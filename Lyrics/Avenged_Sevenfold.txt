before the story begins
is it such a sin
for me to take what's mine
until the end of time?
we were more than friends
before the story ends
and i will take what's mine
create what god would never design

our love had been so strong for far too long
i was weak with fear that something would go wrong
before the possibilities came true
i took all possibility from you
almost laughed myself to tears (ahahaha)
conjuring her deepest fears (come here you fucking bitch)
must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
i can't believe it
ripped her heart out right before her eyes
eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
she was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
now she's just so perfect, i've never been quite so fucking deep in her
it goes on and on, and on
i can keep you looking young and preserved forever
with a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'cause i really always knew that my little crime would be cold
that's why i got a heater for your thighs
and i know, i know it's not your time but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
baby don't cry
you had my heart, at least for the most part
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime
we fell apart, let's make a new start
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
but baby don't cry

now possibilities i'd never considered
are occurring the likes of which i'd never heard
now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
to repossess a body with which i misbehave
smiling right from ear to ear
almost laughed herself to tears
must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
i can't believe it
ripped his heart out right before his eyes
eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (eat the shit out of it)
now that it's done, i realize the error of my ways
i must venture back to apologize
from somewhere far beyond the grave
i gotta make up for what i've done
'cause i was all up in a piece of heaven
while you burned in hell, no peace forever

'cause i really always knew that my little crime would be cold
that's why i got a heater for your thighs
and i know, i know it's not your time but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
you had my heart, at least for the most part
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime
we fell apart, let's make a new start
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
but baby don't cry

i will suffer for so long
(what will you do? not long enough)
to make it up to you
(i pray to god that you do)
i'll do whatever you want me to do
(well then i'll grant you one chance)
and if it's not enough
(if it's not enough, it's not enough)
if it's not enough
(not enough)
try again
(try again)
and again
(and again)
over and over again

we're coming back, coming back
we'll live forever, live forever
let's have a wedding, have a wedding
let's start the killing, start the killing

do you take this man to death
for the rest of your unnatural life?
(yes, i do)
do you take this woman to death
for the rest of your unnatural life?
(i do)
i now pronounce you

'cause i really always knew that my little crime would be cold
that's why i got a heater for your thighs
and i know, i know it's not your time but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
you had my heart, at least for the most part
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime
we fell apart, let's make a new start
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
but baby don't cry

never feared for anything
never shamed but never free
a life that healed the broken heart with all that it could
lived a life so endlessly
saw beyond what others see
i tried to heal your broken heart with all that i could

will you stay?
will you stay away forever?

how do i live without the ones i love?
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
i have so much to say but you're so far away

plans of what our futures hold
foolish lies of growin' old
it seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold
a final song, a last request
a perfect chapter laid to rest
now and then i try to find a place in my mind

where you can stay
you can stay awake forever

how do i live without the ones i love?
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
i have so much to say but you're so far away

sleep tight, i'm not afraid
the ones that we love are here with me
lay away a place for me
'cause as soon as i'm done, i'll be on my way
to live eternally

how do i live without the ones i love?
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
and the light you left remains but it’s so hard to stay
when i have so much to say and you’re so far away

i love you, you were ready
the pain is strong and urges rise
but i'll see you when he lets me
your pain is gone, your hands untied
so far away
and i need you to know
so far away
and i need you to, need you to know

so i arrived, naked and cold
a welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
no need for counsel, i appreciate the time, i'm not alone
(why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)
there were days these child eyes
would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
i found my heart for the first time and i awakened in me
i left myself to navigate and oh i felt control
(it seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

who is the crowd that peers through the cage
as we perform here upon the stage?

as the boy became a man
in came a calm sophistication i can hardly understand
so lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
jesus christ was born to die
leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
we're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby
i see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(so tell me, what's your cross to bear?)

who is the crowd that peers through the cage
as we perform here upon the stage?
tell me a lie in a beautiful way
i believe in answers, just not today

hope my wheels don't abandon me now
seein' that i'm out here alone
i'm runnin' out of fight
and the wind speaks a comforting voice
guiding me to her arms
mother, i'm alright
it took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
before a blow to the head
by the gavel of time to wake up
won't you wake up?
when did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
just wake up
can't you wake up?
(you do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?)

who is the crowd that peers through the cage
as we perform here upon the stage?
tell me a lie in a beautiful way
i believe in answers, just not today

nightmare!
now your nightmare comes to life

dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
to be his guest forever (peace of mind is less than never)
hate to twist your mind, but god ain't on your side
an old acquaintance severed (burn the world your last endeavor)
flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
so stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
you're now a slave until the end of time here
nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

you should have known the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
while your nightmare comes to life

can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
still dancing with your demons (victim of your own creation)
beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
where hate don't need a reason (loathing self-assassination)
you've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
and now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
so sedated as they medicate your brain
and while you slowly go insane they tell you:
"given with the best intentions, help you with your complications"

you should have known the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
no one to call, everybody to fear
your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
ooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha, ha, ha, ha


fight (fight!), not to fail (fail!), not to fall (fall!)
or you'll end up like the others
die (die!), die again (die!), drenched in sin (sin!)
with no respect for another, oh!
down (down!), feel the fire (fire!), feel the hate (hate!)
your pain is what we desire
lost (lost!), hit the wall (wall!), watch you crawl (crawl!)
such a replaceable liar
and i know you hear their voices (calling from above)
and i know they may seem real (these signals of love)
but our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)
they took for granted your soul, and it's ours now to steal
as your nightmare comes to life

you should have known the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
no one to call, everybody to fear
your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

he who makes a beast out of himself
gets rid of the pain of being a man

caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
i tried, to drive all through the night
the heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
no oasis, here to see
the sand is singing deathless words to me

can't you help me as i'm startin' to burn? (all alone)
too many doses, and i'm starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
no one can save me, and you know i don't want the attention

as i, adjust to my new sights
the rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
my hand is on the trigger, i'm ready to ignite
tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
mental fiction, follow me
show me what it's like to be set free

can't you help me as i'm startin' to burn? (all alone)
too many doses, and i'm starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
no one can save me, and you know i don't want the attention

so sorry you're not here, i've
been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
now take a trip with me, but
don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
these eyes won't see the same, after i flip today

sometimes i don't know why, we'd rather live than die
we look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
we may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
don't want your absolution, 'cause i can't make it right

i'll make a beast out of myself
gets rid of all the pain of being a man

can't you help me as i'm startin' to burn? (all alone)
too many doses and i'm starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
no one can save me and you know i don't want the attention

so sorry you're not here, i've
been sane too long my vision's so unclear
now take a trip with me, but
don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

i've known it from the start, all
these good ideas will tear your brain apart
scared but you can follow me, i'm
too weird to live but much too rare to die

a lonely road, crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love, purpose hard to find
while i recall all the words you spoke to me
can't help but wish that i was there
at where i'd love to be, oh yeah

dear god, the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish i'd stayed
'cause i'm lonely and i'm tired
i'm missing you again, oh no
once again

there's nothing here for me, on this barren road
there's no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
can't help but think of the times i've had with you
pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

dear god, the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish i'd stayed
'cause i'm lonely and i'm tired
i'm missing you again, oh no
once again

some search, never finding a way
before long, they waste away
i found you, something told me to stay
i gave in, to selfish ways
and how i miss someone to hold
when hope begins to fade

a lonely road, crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love, purpose hard to find

dear god, the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish i'd stayed
'cause i'm lonely and i'm tired
i'm missing you again, oh no
once again

watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
children roam the streets now orphans of war
bodies hanging in the streets to adore
royal flames will carve the path in chaos
bringing daylight to the night (night)
death is riding into town with armor
they come to take all your rights

hail to the king, hail to the one
kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
hail to the king (hail, hail, hail)
the king

blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne
born again but it’s too late to atone
no mercy from the edge of the blade
dare escape and learn the price to be paid
let the water flow with shades of red now
arrows black out all the light (light)
death is riding into town with armor
they come to grant you your rights

hail to the king, hail to the one
kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
hail to the king (hail, hail, hail)
the king


there's a taste of fear (hail, hail, hail)
when the henchmen call (hail, hail, hail)
iron fist to tame them (hail, hail, hail)
iron fist to claim it all

hail to the king, hail to the one
kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
hail to the king, hail to the one
kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
hail to the king (hail, hail, hail)
the king

our truth is painted across the sky
in our reflection we learn to fly
no hand to hold us
no one to save us from tomorrow

sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
far beyond the dreams of everyone
no light to follow
a shot in the dark
does anybody know?
sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
far beyond the dreams of everyone
high from the heavens
i can't see the pain
does anybody care?

think for a moment of all the lives
stripped of their essence before their time
we stand to conquer
but is there nothing left tomorrow?

sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
far beyond the dreams of everyone
no light to follow
a shot in the dark
does anybody know?
sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
far beyond the dreams of everyone
high from the heavens
i can't see the pain
does anybody care?

"we have one collective hope: the earth; and yet, uncounted people remain hopeless
famine and calamity abound
sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war
people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of god
do we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?
each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane
every fictionalized dictator, biased or partisan, and wayward son
are part of the curtains of society’s racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts
and you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers
when i track the orbits of asteroids, comets and planets
each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity
i see beyond the plight of humans
i see a universe ever-expanding, with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time
however big our world is, our hearts, our minds, our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger
there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches
more stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since earth formed
more stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
the day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species
in that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment
until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective: a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above, nor below; but within"

like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
so unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
i see a distant light, but girl, this can't be right
such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be?
arrived too early

and when i think of all the places i just don't belong
i've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

i don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
escape from this afterlife
'cause this time i'm right to move on and on
far away from here

a place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
this peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
no pain or sign of time (i'm much too young to fall)
so out of place, don't wanna stay, i feel wrong and that's my sign
i've made up my mind

give me your hand but realize i just wanna say goodbye
please understand i have to leave and carry on my own life

i don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
escape from this afterlife
'cause this time i'm right to move on and on
far away from here
got nothing against you and surely i'll miss you
this place full of peace and light
and i'd hope you might take me back inside
when the time is right

loved ones back home all crying
'cause they’re already missing me
i pray by the grace of god
that there’s somebody listening
give me a chance to be that person i wanna be
(i am unbroken, i’m choking on this ecstasy)
oh, lord, i’ll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(unbreak me, unchain me, i need another chance to live!)


i don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
'cause this time i'm right to move on and on
far away from here
got nothing against you and surely i'll miss you
this place full of peace and light, and i'd hope you might
take me back inside when the time is right

let's take a moment and break the ice
so my intentions are known
see i have pity in watching you suffer
i know the feeling of being damned alone
i've got a storybook of my own

don't you see i am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(and you know it's right)
i am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
know me by name, shepherd of fire

well i can promise you paradise
no need to serve on your knees
and when you're lost in the darkest of hours
take a moment and tell me who you see
won't tell you who not to be

now you know i am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(and you know it's right)
i am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
know me by name, shepherd of fire

disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
make way, the shepherd of fire

through the ages of time
i've been known for my hate
but i'm a dealer of simple choices
for me its never too late

i am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(and you know it's right)
i am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
i am your wrath, i am your guilt, i am your lust!
(and you know it's right)
i am your law, i am your scar, i am your trust
know me by name, shepherd of fire

(shh! quiet, you might piss somebody off!)
like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
while you feed off others insecurities
you stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head, your best friend)
heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass, your fake reflection)

i've had enough, it's time for something real
i don't respect the words you're speaking
gone too far, a clone

so, how does it feel to know that
someone's kid in the heart of america has blood on their hands
fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle
that insults his family's existence?
well, where i'm from we have a special salute
we aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
who spend their days pointing fingers
(fuck you!)

(shh be quiet, you might piss somebody off)
like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
i'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies

tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(there's no need for us to bury you)
selfish agenda once again
(right this way, you dug your own grave)

i've had enough, it's time for something real
i don't respect the words you're speaking
gone too far, a clone

all the way from the east to the west
we got this high society looking down on their very foundation
constantly reminding us that our actions
are the cause of all their problems
pointing their fingers in every direction
blaming their own nation for who wins elections
they never contributed a fucking thing
to the country they love to criticize

excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
depictions we see, try and get through
admitting mistakes can hurt
i'm not the last but i sure ain't the first

(shh! be quiet, you might piss somebody off)

self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head, your best friend)
heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass, your fake reflection)

i've had enough, it's time for something real
i don't respect the words you're speaking
gone too far, a clone

as the embers rose through the roman sky
tell me were you calm when they took your life?

just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
shine forever true

shared with us the world well before your time
though they took your voice, words forever shine

just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
shine forever true

as they spoke your fate a fearless man replied
"as you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
shine forever true

oh!

hey! can't you see we're tripping on the wire
walking through the candy land of our desires
press the magic button and behold the world you crave
where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?

pledge allegiance, no flag
god nation, god damn
the devil dances with the scorned
and how the fire keeps us warm

hey! it goes beyond big brother in the sky
beyond the threat of martial law no horus eye
no one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
blind follows the blind and now the one-eyed man is king

pledge allegiance, no flag
god nation, god damn
the devil dances with the scorned
and how the fire keeps us warm
tunnel vision, no man
damnation, god damn
can't see the forest for the trees
can't heal the wound before we bleed

no form of payment, no pot of gold will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
and led them to the river for what was their final day
no need for convincing on his pipe he played a song to fool them all
fooled them all

pledge allegiance, no flag
god nation, goddamned
the devil dances with the scorn
and now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
tunnel vision, no man
damnation, god damn
can't see the forest for the trees
can't heal the wound before we bleed

cry alone, i've gone away
no more nights, no more pain
i've gone alone, took all my strength
i've made the change
i won't see you tonight

sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and loved

it's building up inside of me
a place so dark, so cold, i had to set me free
don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
as bottles call my name
i won't see you tonight

sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and most of all i loved
but i can't see myself that way
please don't forget me or cry while i'm away

cry alone, i've gone away
no more nights, no more pain
i've gone alone, took all my strength
but i've made the change
i won't see you tonight
so far away, i'm gone
please don't follow me tonight
and while i'm gone everything will be alright

no more breath inside
essence left my heart tonight
no more breath inside
essence left my heart tonight

skull!

(they all know, they all know)

sorry, did i wake your dream?
some questions run too deep
we only, only wake up when we sleep
led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
lost our way tonight

is it something we said?
is it something we said to them?
is it something we said?

(save me)
i'm trapped in a vile world
(save me)
where the end game's all the same as every other
we're only here to die
(save me)
i'm losing my only dream
(save me)
i can use some guiding light, some place to go
if you hear me, let me know

(they all know, they all know)

ever since the day you left, my fate's been set unknown
how many years to walk this path alone?
so much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
why can't i shut mine?

is it something we did?
is it something we did to them?
is it something we did?

(save me)
i'm trapped in a vile world
(save me)
where the end game's all the same as every other
we're only here to die
(save me)
i'm losing my only dream
(save me)
i can use some guiding light, some place to go
if you hear me, let me know
if you hear me, let me know


help me find my way
said help me find my way

no pulse inside of me
stone cold lips and heresy
all lies and to a degree
losing who i want to be
you'll find out, right now

he may be out of his mind, but someday you will find
that sanity's left us all blind, and dragged us all behind
a moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
they say that all beauty must die, i say it just moves on

if you'd only open your mind, then someday you will find
insanity left us behind, and walked right through the door
i can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
i can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

(save me)
i'm trapped in a vile world
(save me)
where the end game's all the same as every other
we're only here to die
(save me)
i'm losing my only dream
(save me)
i can use some guiding light, some place to go
if you hear me, let me know
if you hear me, let me know

tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die
tonight we all die young

seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
it's empty and cold without you here
too many people to ache over

i see my vision burn, i feel my memories fade with time
but i'm too young to worry
the streets we traveled on will undergo our same lost past

i found you here, now please just stay for a while
i can move on with you around
i hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
i'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done
we both know the day will come, but i don't want to leave you

i see my vision burn,  i feel my memories fade with time
but i'm too young to worry
a melody, a memory, or just one picture

seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
it's empty and cold without you here
too many people to ache over

newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
no longer needed here so where do we go?
will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
but girl, what if there is no eternal life?

i see my vision burn, i feel my memories fade with time
but i'm too young to worry
a melody, a memory, or just one picture

seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
it's empty and cold without you here
too many people to ache over
trials in life, questions of us existing here
don't wanna die alone without you here
please tell me what we have is real


so, what if i never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again?
woah, so i never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
i beg don't leave me

seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
it's empty and cold without you here
too many people to ache over
trials in life, questions of us existing here
don't wanna die alone without you here
please tell me what we have is real

silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
i'm stuck here alone (silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
falling away from you, no chance to get back home
(silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
i'm stuck here alone (silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
falling away from me, no chance to get back home
(silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)

this shining city built of gold
a far cry from innocence
there's more than meets the eye 'round here
look to the waters of the deep
a city of evil
there sat a seven-headed beast
ten horns raised from his head
symbolic woman sits on his throne
but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
the beast and the harlot

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the city dressed in jewels and gold
fine linen, myrrh and pearls
her plagues will come all at once
as her mourners watch her burn
destroyed in an hour
merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
will weep and mourn this loss
with her sins piled to the sky
the beast and the harlot

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the day has come for all us sinners
if you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
flee the burning, greedy city
looking back on her to see there's nothing around
i don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to hell
you've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
you're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

you've been breaking down for far too long
far too many moons since you felt well and strong
you see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
not ever

engineer the wires to your brain
architect a code so you won't feel the pain
with your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever
live forever

i'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
i shed my human side
farther, o' father
i stare at my reflection, have i lost that boy inside?
final paradigm

what's it really mean to be a man?
think about your answer but please understand
while it's natural to fear, i'll make it disappear forever
i forever

i'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
i shed my human side
farther, o' father
i stare at my reflection, have i lost that boy inside?
final paradigm

(singular i am)
i have to question if these thoughts are mine
to live forever but did something in me die?
i'm clawing my skin but i can't feel it inside
i know the agony of pain would hurt so much better

i'm way up, so far up
have i lost myself tonight?
father, o' father
have you lost that boy you used to know?

took me years to make my motives clear
and the days have not been kind
once a steady gaze and charming smile
has been buried in the lines i find
i walk in the noise, quiet employs
and darkness seems to know just where i am

mother wash the devil from my hands
pray the lord i have the strength to stand
mother, tell me was it all a lie?
show me where the angels die

there are words that never found my lips
there are words i'd soon forget
thought the trick was never to look back
but it seems i've lost my grip, i slip
the faster we run now, the closer the gun now
and somehow all the bullets bear my name

mother wash the devil from my hands
pray the lord i have the strength to stand
mother, tell me was it all a lie?
show me where the angels die

took the road but should have chased the stars
now i've lost my own way home
had a photo of the time we shared
but i burned it long ago, i know
i struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
forgive me, won't you simply speak my name?

mother wash the devil from my hands
pray the lord i have the strength to stand
mother, tell me was it all a lie?
show me where the angels die
die

(the faster we run now, the closer the gun now
and somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
the faster we run now, the closer the gun now
and somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
(took the road but should have chased the stars
now i've lost my own way home
had a photo of the time we shared
but i burned it long ago)
the faster we run now, the closer the gun now
and somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now

"i'll try"
she said as she walked away
tried not to lose you
two vibrant hearts could change
nothing tears the being more than deception
unmasked fear
i'll be here waiting, tested and secure

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sin's deep in my blood
you'll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who won't care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go, no one's guiding me
when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know it's hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

nothing will last in this life
our time is spent constructing
now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
constrict your hands around me
squeeze till i cannot breathe
this air tastes dead inside me
contribute to our plague

break all your promises
tear down this steadfast wall
restraints are useless here
tasting salvation's near
oh!

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sin's deep in my blood
you'll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who won't care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go, no one's guiding me
when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know it's hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
