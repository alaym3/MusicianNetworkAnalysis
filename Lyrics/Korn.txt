something takes a part of me
something lost and never seen
every time i start to believe
something's raped and taken from me, from me
life's gotta always be messin' with me (you wanna see the light)
can't they chill and let me be free? (so do i)
can't i take away all this pain? (you wanna see the light)
i try to every night, all in vain, in vain

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me

feelin' like a freak on a leash (you wanna see the light)
feeling like i have no release (so do i)
how many times have i felt diseased? (you wanna see the light)
nothing in my life is free, is free

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me

hey, i'm feeling tired
my time has gone today
you flirt with suicide
sometimes that's okay
do what others say
i'm here standing hollow
falling away from me
falling away from me

day is here fading
that's when i'm insane
i flirt with suicide
sometimes kill the pain
i can't always say
"it's gonna be better tomorrow"
falling away from me
falling away from me

beating me down!
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground!
screaming some sound!
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground!

falling away from me
it's spinning round and round
falling away from me
it's lost and can't be found
falling away from me
it's spinning round and round
falling away from me
throw it down

beating me down!
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground!
screaming some sound!
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground!

twisting me!

are you ready?

this place inside my mind
a place i like to hide
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?
a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind
another place i find
to escape the pain inside
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?
a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind

deeper, and deeper, and deeper
as i journey to live a life that seems to be
a lost reality
that can never find a way to reach my inner...
self-esteem is low
how deep can i go
in the ground that i lay
if i don't find a way to
see through the gray that clouds my mind
this time i look to see what's between the lines
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind

i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind (i can see i'm going)
i can see, i can see i'm going blind (going blind)
i can see, i can see i'm going blind
i can see, i can see i'm going blind!

i'm blind!
i'm blind!
i'm blind!
i'm blind!

i wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain

i wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
you're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in…

i can't hear this (scat singing)
i can't fuck it (scat singing)
i can't take this (scat singing)
i hate (scat singing)

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in…
digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain

hate, something, sometime, someway
something kick off the front floor
mine, something inside i'll never ever follow
so give me something that is for real, i'll never ever follow
get your boogie on
get your boogie on
hate, something, someway, each day
dealing with no forgiveness
why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
so give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow

god paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
god told me, i've already got the life, oh i say
god paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
god told me, i've already got the life, oh i say

each day i can feel it swallow
inside something they took from me
i don't feel your deathly ways
each day i feel so hollow
inside i was beating me
you will never see so come dance with me
dance with me
dance with me
dance with me
dance with me
dance with me
dance with me
me!

god paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
god told me, i've already got the life, oh i say
god paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
god told me, i've already got the life, oh i say

got the life!
got the life!

got the life!
got the life!
got the life!
got the life!
got the life!
got the life!
.

keep holding on
when my brain's ticking like a bomb
guess the black thoughts
have come again to get me
sweet bitter words
unlike nothing i have heard
sing along, mockingbird
you don't affect me
that's right!
deliverance of my heart!
please strike!
be deliberate!

wait, i'm coming undone!
irate, i'm coming undone!
too late, i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong, so delicate!
wait, i'm starting to suffocate!
and soon i anticipate!
i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong, so delicate!

choke, choke again
i thought my demons were my friends
pity me in the end
they're out to get me
since i was young
i tasted sorrow on my tongue
and the sweet sugar gun
does not protect me
that's right!
trigger between my eyes!
please strike!
make it quick now!

wait, i'm coming undone!
irate, i'm coming undone!
too late, i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong, so delicate!
wait, i'm starting to suffocate!
and soon i anticipate!
i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong, so delicate!

i'm trying to hold it together
head is lighter than a feather
looks like i'm not getting better
not getting better

wait, i'm coming undone!
irate, i'm coming undone!
too late, i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong so, delicate!
wait, i'm starting to suffocate!
and soon i anticipate!
i'm coming undone!
what looks so strong, so delicate!

life

things keep ending up this way
another notch is carved away
in the thoughts of mass decay
funny how things end up this way

beaten down
dominated by its sound
growing deep within my head
softly dying, its soul is shed
eating me all up inside
this cancer finds everything i hide
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

life
that's not right out insane

satisfaction is delayed
its motivation is displayed
flaunting its misogyny
funny how i thought it'd go away

beaten down
dominated by its sound
growing deep within my head
softly dying, its soul is shed
eating me all up inside
this cancer finds everything i hide
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

life
that's not right out insane

i'm constantly beat up inside
and i'm the one to blame
no one can relate to me
that's not right out insane
that's not right out insane
that's not right out insane
that's not right out insane
that's not right out insane
that's not right out insane

this time, i'm taking it away
i've got a problem
with me getting in the way
not by design
so i take my face
and bash it into a mirror
i won't have to see the pain
pain, pain!

this state is elevating
as the hurt turns into hating
anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

the hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
this shit's gone way too far
all this time, i've been waiting
oh, i cannot grieve anymore
for what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
i'm not, i'm not a whore
you've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
oh, i cannot give any more

my mind's done with this, okay?
i've got a question
can i throw it all away?
take back what's mine
so i take my time
guiding the blade down the line
each cut closer to the vein
vein, vein

this state is elevating
as the hurt turns into hating
anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

the hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
this shit's gone way too far
all this time, i've been waiting
oh, i cannot grieve anymore
for what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
i'm not, i'm not a whore
you've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
oh, i cannot give any more

i'm here to stay (ha-aah)
bring it down! (aah)
i'm here to stay (aah)
bring it down! (aah)
i'm here to stay (aah)
bring it down! (aah)
i'm here to stay (aah)

bring it down!
bring it down!
bring it down!
bring it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it down!
gonna break it!

life is degrading and silently making me
spun out inside my own head
spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
down the road to my own death

i can't take this, i might break it
watch it all fall down

so come give me the truth you hide
take the pain inside

humiliating, i fall to its craving
it feeds on the doubt in my heart
sinking and fading, our feelings i'm saving
to fix what i tore all apart

i can't take this, i might break it
watch it all fall down

so come give me the truth you hide
take the pain inside

i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me
i'm lost

so come give me the truth you hide
take the pain inside

i'm lost, ah, you'll never find me
i'm lost, you'll never find me, ah
(i watched you die, now watch me die)
i'm lost, you'll never find me, ah
i'm lost
come for me

i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine
i'm not doing fine

nursery rhymes are said
verses in my head
into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
hidden violence revealed
darkness that seems real
look at the pages that cause all this evil

one, two, buckle my shoe
three, four, shut the door
five, six, pick up sticks
seven, eight, lay them straight
london bridge's falling down
falling down
falling down
london bridge is falling down my fair lady

there you are alone
with no hope of ever having
something to be proud of
something earned without begging
yes, i know you're a person
a person close to me
who do you think you are, and what more do you want from me?

ball tongue!
ball tongue!
ball tongue!
ball tongue!

why are you at home
buried in your self-pity?
why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
yes, i know you're the person
the person that took time with me
does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?

i dream of a past so i can break through
the walls i have built inside
the thoughts i can grasp, transparency through
they constantly fight and collide

i'd love to see a different world
a place where you can't find me

feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
your magic spell doesn't work anymore
kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (my friend!)
this ain't the end (end!)

why can't i relax and let it be true?
this world that i tried to hide
it's kind of a mess, too reckless for you
this place makes me feel alive

i'd love to see a different world
a place where you can't find me

feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
your magic spell doesn't work anymore
kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (my friend!)
this ain't the end (end!)

the call for the purposes, the changing behavior
ends at us all, we keep constraints on the strangers
it gets on top of you and forces your perspective
then you know it, you feel it
it's as dark as you can get you want it
harder, harder, harder, give it to you
harder, harder, you might just want it
harder, harder, harder, give it to you
harder, harder, i don't think you'll ever get it

feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
your magic spell doesn't work anymore
kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (my friend!)
this ain't the end (end!)
