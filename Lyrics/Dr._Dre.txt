y'all know me, still the same og
but i been low-key
hated on by most these niggas
with no cheese, no deals and no g's
no wheels and no keys
no boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
mad at me ‘cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
to add to the wall full of plaques
hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
did y'all think i'ma let my dough freeze?
ho, please!
you better bow down on both knees
who you think taught you to smoke trees?
who you think brought you the oldies?
eazy-e's, ice cube's, and d.o.c.'s
the snoop d-o-double-g's
and the group that said, "motherfuck the police!"
gave you a tape full of dope beats
to bump when you stroll through in your hood
and when your album sales weren't doin' too good
who's the doctor they told you to go see?
y'all better listen up closely
all you niggas that said that i turned pop or the firm flopped
y'all are the reason that dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
so fuck y'all, all of y'all!
if y'all don't like me, blow me!
y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
but nothin' comes out when they move their lips
just a bunch of gibberish
and motherfuckers act like they forgot about dre

so what do you say to somebody you hate (what?)
or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (yup)
just study a tape of n.w.a
one day i was walkin' by
with a walkman on, when i caught a guy
gave me an awkward eye ('chu lookin' at?)
and strangled him up in the parking lot with his karl kani
i don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
i'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
when i'm drunk as fuck
right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
fuck you too, bitch! call the cops!
i'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
and when the cops came through
me and dre stood next to a burnt-down house
with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
and still weren't found out (right here!)
so from here on out, it's the chronic ii
startin' today and tomorrow's anew
and i'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a charleston chew
chicka-chicka-chicka slim shady
hotter than a set of twin babies
in a mercedes benz with the windows up
when the temp goes up to the mid-80s
callin' men ladies
sorry doc, but i been crazy
there's no way that you can save me
it's okay, go with him, hailie (dada?)

nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say

if it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
comin' up to me with your hands out
lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
when my last cd was out, you weren't bumpin' me
but now that i got this little company
everybody wanna come to me
like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘cause i'm from the streets of c-compton! (compton!)
i told 'em all
all 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like i ain't got none
what, you think i sold 'em all
‘cause i stay well off?
now all i get is hate mail all day sayin' dre fell off
what, ‘cause i been in the lab
with a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
i ain't havin' that
this is the millennium of aftermath
it ain't gon' be nothin' after that
so give me one more platinum plaque
and fuck rap, you can have it back
so where's all the mad rappers at?
it's like a jungle in this habitat
but all you savage cats know that i was strapped with gats
while you were cuddlin' a cabbage patch

nowadays, everybody wanna talk
like they got somethin' to say

just a bunch of gibberish

wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
i bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
it's not a fluke, it's been tried, i'm the truth
since "turn out the lights" from the world class wreckin cru
i'm still at it, after mathematics
in the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

smoke weed every day

i'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
i'm runnin' out of time
i need a doctor, call me a doctor
i need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

i told the world, one day i would pay it back
say it on tape, and lay it, record it
so that one day i could play it back
but i don't even know if i believe it when i'm sayin' that
doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
hope, i just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
when i play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
but they don't know what dope is
and i don't know if i was awake or asleep when i wrote this
all i know is, you came to me when i was at my lowest
you picked me up, breathed new life in me, i owe my life to you
but for the life of me, i don't see why you don't see like i do
but it just dawned on me you lost a son
demons fightin' you, it's dark
let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
i don't think you realize what you mean to me
not the slightest clue
'cause me and you were like a crew, i was like your sidekick
you gon' either wanna fight when i get off this fuckin' mic
or you gon' hug me, but i'm outta options
there's nothin' else i can do 'cause—

i'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
i'm runnin' out of time
i need a doctor, call me a doctor
i need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

it hurts when i see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
you say they're just pieces, so i'm puzzled
'cause the shit i hear is crazy
but you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
like i'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
i can endure no more, i demand you remember who you are
it was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
you risked your career for me, i know it as well as you
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
dre, i'm cryin' in this booth
you saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
but i can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
but i ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
get up, dre, i'm dyin', i need you
come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

i'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
i'm runnin' out of time
i need a doctor, call me a doctor
i need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
bring me back to life
bring me back to life
i need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

it literally feels like a lifetime ago
but i still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
you walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
went through friends, some of them i put on, but they just left
they said they was ridin' to the death
but where the fuck are they now, now that i need them?
i don't see none of them, all i see is slim
fuck all you fair-weather friends, all i need is him
fuckin' backstabbers
when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of aftermath, faggots
you gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
you can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
and the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
makin' wack math, backwards producers; i'm back, bastards
one more cd and then i'm packin' up my bags
and as i'm leavin', i'll guarantee they'll scream:
"dre, don't leave us like that, man", 'cause—

i'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
i'm runnin' outta time
i need a doctor, call me a doctor
i need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

what's the difference between me and you?
what's the difference between me and you?

back when cube was rollin' with lorenzo in a benzo
i was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
got the pens and pencils, got down to business
but sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
but you was a real nigga, i could sense it in you
i still remember the window of the car that you went through
that's fucked up, but i'll never forget the shit we been through
and i'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'cause you my nigga, doc, and eazy, i'm still wit' you
fuck the beef, nigga, i miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
you see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is, and who i'm still cool with
then, i got these fake-ass niggas i first blew with
claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (do not resist the beat)
spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
until then, i ain't even speakin' your name
just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
it ain't that i'm too big to listen to the rumors
it's just that i'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
that's the difference

what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

yo, i stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
never knew about the next level 'til dre did it (yeah)
i stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
i smash the critics like a overhand right from riddick (yeah)
come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
i be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
so what the fuck am i supposed to do?
i pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (come on!)
a heartless bastard, high and plastered
my style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
pass it around if you can't handle it
hang hollywood niggas by they soul train laminates
what's the difference between me and you? (what?)
about five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
until my death, i'm bangladesh
i suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
yo, that's the difference!

what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

a'ight, hold up, hold up!
stop the beat a minute! i got somethin' to say, dre
i wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (what the fuck?)
i don't know if i ever told you this
but i love you, dog, i got your motherfuckin' back (right), just know this shit
slim, i don't know if you noticed it
but i've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
i mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: "whose throat is it?"
well, if you ever kill that kim bitch, i'll show you where the ocean is
well, that's cool, and i appreciate the offer
but if i do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
i'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
and cruise around with her for seven hours through california
and have her wavin' at people (hi!)
then drop her off on the corner at the police station
and drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*beep-beep!*)
raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
fuck blood, i wanna see some lungs coughed up
get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
in they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
that's for tryna talk like the chronic was lost product
that's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
and you better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up
so what's the difference between us? we can start at the penis
or we can scream, "i just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it

what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

what's the difference between me and— (*gunshot*)

doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(yeah, about that…)

don't let me find out the bitch in you
don't let me find out the snitch in you

fame and fortune is not your forte
fuck the world now, i'm done with foreplay
doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
doctor's orders

listen, this is my evaluation
this shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
kids sippin' actavis and they ain't even activated
married to the internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
ain't nobody graduatin'
don't nobody love this shit the way i love it
that's why i gotta hate it
everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
damn, i'm gettin' aggravated
fuck, i'm gettin' agitated
teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
the police got our name in all they databases
girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
these niggas in tight shit, i'm in the fuckin' matrix
it's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
i got all these patients, man
how come they ain't patient with me?
they just think i want the money
why? when i can't take it with me
y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
they gon' find out who you are
just admit it 'fore you get admitted

say, what you livin' about? (fuck you gon' tell me?)
do you remember where you started out though?
you're lookin' lost now (you want a pass? oh, damn!)
fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
but when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
i'd rather be hated on for who i am
than to be loved for who i'm not, that's word to doc

fame and fortune is not your forte
fuck the world now, i'm done with foreplay
doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself

in the beginning a few of the people who had a problem i was this good scoffed, i just shook off
prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw tiger woods golf
never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
but based on how i ascended
see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
but no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til i took off
mistook me because i looked soft
but i stood tall, i just followed the doctor's orders
so i rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
decided opposing you is what i'm ‘posed to do, all's
i did was say what i'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
and had you on pins and needles when i spoke to you all
you felt my pain, it's almost like i poked voodoo dolls
and i hope my spirit haunts the studios when i'm gone
my picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
and fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of lou rawls
karma's headed for armageddon
the drama setter, i'm going in, already got an arm and head in
whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
i give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
whoever i hurt or whatever bridges i burned in this bitch

and whatever consequences come with every verse
it's worth it, so doc, turn the beat on
whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
and here's to all the years i spent toein' a line to overtime
as sure as a mole is blind
in my mind i'm still underground as a groundhog
and i'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
no signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
i just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind

been a doctor's assault rifle
with the sniper scope for this whole time
day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, i spray (uh)
pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun

then i hops in my coupe to make a quick run
bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
lick on these nuts and suck the dick
gets the fuck out after you're done
then i hops in my coupe to make a quick run

i used to know a bitch named eric wright
we used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
and we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' compton streets
peep, the shit got deep and it was on
number one song after number one song
long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
i didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
but she was hangin' with a white bitch, doing the shit she do
suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
and the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
now she's suing 'cause shit that she be doing ain't shit
bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
so now she taking me to court
it's real conversation for your ass
so recognize and pass to daz

now as i'm rollin' with my nigga dre and eastwood
fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
we flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(but we don't love them hoes) bitch, and it's like that
this is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
you run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
while you're chillin' with your homies and shit
and how my niggas kick the anthem like this (biatch)

bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
lick on these nuts and suck the dick
gets the fuck out after you're done
then i hops in my coupe to make a quick run

to the store to get me a 4-0
snoop doggy dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
so i head down the streets to long beach
just so i could meet a freak
to lick me from my head to my feet
and i'm here, now i'm ready to be done up
nothin' but homies around, so i puts my gun up
bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
but i'm from tha pound and we don't love them hoes
how could you trust a ho? (why?) 'cause a ho's a trick
i don't love them tricks (why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
and my dick's constantly in her mouth
turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

i once had a bitch named annie mae
used to be all in them guts like every day
the pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
i was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
the homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
but i'm the maniac in black, mr. snoop eastwood
so i figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
guess what? got gaffled by one-time
i'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
uh, i gets released on a hot sunny day
my nigga d.o.c. and my homie dr. dre
scoop in a coupe, "snoop, we got news
your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues"
i ain't been out a second
and already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
move up the blocks as we groove up the block
see my girl's house, "dre, pass the glock"
kick in the door, i look on the floor
it's my little cousin daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(bitches ain't shit) i un-cock my shit
i'm heartbroke but i'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
lick on these nuts and suck the dick
gets the fuck out after you're done
then i hops in my coupe to make a quick run
bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
lick on these nuts and suck the dick
gets the fuck out after you're done
then i hops in my coupe to make a quick run
bitches ain't shit

ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
i don't give a fuck about a bitch (bitches ain't shit)
but i'll let her know that she can't fade this
'cause i'm doin' my own thing (bitches ain't shit)
down with the swang (sing to these hoes)
i'm hangin' with death row like it ain't no thang
i say you know you can't deal (bitches ain't shit, death row)
'cause i'm a bitch that's real
motherfuckers need to step back
hell yeah, they need to chill (tell these motherfuckers)
because i don't give a fuck (bitches ain't shit), and i don't give a fuck
and i don't give a fuck, i don't give a fuck (tell these motherfuckers)
and now i gotta do some—
i gotta do some shit that's clean (bitches ain't shit)
but when i'm on the dick, hell yeah, i get real mean, hah
like a washer machine, i can wash the clothes
all the hoes knows that i'm on the flo', ho (bitches ain't shit)
but they can't hang with my type of swang
i ain't tryna say i suck every ding-a-lang
but just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
and then they're sprung and with their nuts hung

bitches ain't shit

where you from nigga?
(help me!)

"what is going on in compton? i don't understand it."
"well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from dr. dre."

i heard you talking about respect, i gave you niggas the utmost
all you niggas the utmost
would you look over picasso's shoulder
and tell him about his brush strokes?
them opinions, i don't trust those
i apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
every hood love me, but it started on one coast
could've stopped in '86 but i knew that you would want more
i'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go

(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
but i ain't been gone that long
(all they wanna know is: where you from? where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton!)

psst! this is about where i'm from
i think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
yeah, down in the pacific (the pacific), representin'
where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water

listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
go fuck around and drown in the specifics
always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes

(don't get it fucked up!) naw, nigga!

(you might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
i'm the one that got they ear
ah, for many years, i been making parents live in fear
i just wanna make it clear: my influence run deep like the ocean

(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
but i ain't been gone that long
(all they wanna know is: where you from? where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton!)

feel's like you're drowning, don't you?
about a hundred miles down in that ocean
it's over, shoulda never jumped in
if you can't swim (if you can't swim, if you can't swim)
oh my god, where's a lifeguard when you need one?

motherfucker know i started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
mixin' that with similac, my momma knew i had a problem
wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, i was juuging for a dollar
putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla
no policing me, i got the beast in me, i gotta holla
keep the decency and make them tnt my product
i'm a c-o-m-p-t-o-innovator, energizer
inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
ah, shit! i don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
all i care about is wearing out your area
and airing out your upper body
when i catch ya walking out your parents house
(don't get it fucked up!) homie got fucked up
tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
or who's who, living in the l.a. county zoo
pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
once upon a time, i shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)
i tried to kill him but i guess i needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)
that's when i realized banging wasn't for everybody
switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
they liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
they worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
the beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
a great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium

(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
been away from home all night long
(all they wanna know is: where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton)

this is about where i'm from
i think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
yeah, down in the pacific
where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water

help me
(feels like you're drowning)
i'm drowning
help me, help me, help me
somebody help me
(shoulda never jumped in
if you, if you can't swim)

it's easy to say you need me
when you got everything you want
but it's hard for me to believe it
you'll find out when i'm gone

i went from hanging out down at the swap meet
to driving some of the hottest cars l.a. has ever seen
people been tellin' me i've grown into some kind of monster
but they don't know me though, i've been this way since seventeen
tryna get finances poppin', man, i thought that was the object
'til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
my only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
you could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
it's your choice, i took this industry by storm, young and black
killing them softly
don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
so anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
we ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!

it's easy to say you need me

things just ain't the same for gangstas
times is changin', young niggas is agin'
becoming og's in the game and changin'
to make way for these new names and faces
but the strangest things can happen from rappin'
when niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
zipped up in bags—when it happens, that's it
i've seen 'em come, i've watched 'em go
watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money: i lost 'em both
went and visited niggas in the hospital
it's all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show (the watcher)

'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)
people i used to know
just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know (the watcher)
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low (i'm watching)

i moved out of the hood for good—you blame me?
niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
but niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
i'm out of sight now, i'm out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
you'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
i ain't a thug—how much 2pac in you you got?
i ain't no bitch, neither
it's either my life or your life and i ain't leavin', i like breathin'
'cause nigga, we can go round for round
clip for clip—shit, four-pound for pound
nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
i got a lot more to lose than you
remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (the watcher)

'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)
people i used to know
just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know (the watcher)
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low (i'm watching)

things just ain't the same for gangstas
cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
they wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'cause every time you let the animal out cages
it's dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now, we got a new era of gangstas
hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
can't help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
and this the motherfuckin' thanks i get?
it's funny how time flies
i'm just having fun, just watchin' it fly by (the watcher)

'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)
people i used to know
just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know (the watcher)
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low (i'm watching)

the watcher
i'm watching

mama tried counseling, five plans for kendrick (but fuck it)
my family ties had sabotaged rosecrans existence (abducted)
my aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (disgusting)
our stadium's packed, raiders in black
curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
i lie on the side of a one-way street (blow-blow-blow-blow!)
nowhere to go, death all i can see (blow-blow-blow-blow!)
i say "fuck is up?" i fuck 'em up
your supper's up, and something's up

this one is for my brother, tyree, r.i.p
a message to god

since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
we made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
lord, i thought we was made for each other
you shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
now what i'm supposed to do? i'm only half the man that i was
i'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
you knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
he can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
the one who puts the g in it, who you think put me in it?
i'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
we fought like brothers, something we never should do
we coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
he had talent too - i had plans on watching him blow
don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

i thought i learned from eazy, now i'm going through it with you
we lost a thug, a son, and a father
i spoke to your son, the other day, and told him uncle dre got him
the lord must be accidentally pulling your file
cause i'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
you either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
i done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
to straight breaking down and showing all emotions
i'm anxious to believing real g's don't cry
if that's the truth, then i'm realizing i ain't no gangsta
it's just not me, but you know i'mma always ride wit you
i miss you, sometimes i wish i just died with you
