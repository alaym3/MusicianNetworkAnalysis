tomorrow morning if you wake up
and the sun does not appear
i... i will be here
if in the dark we lose sight of love
hold my hand and have no fear
cause i... i will be here
i will be here
when you feel like being quiet
when you need to speak your mind
i will listen
and i will be here
when the laughter turns to crying
through the winning, losing and trying
we'll be together
cause i will be here
tomorrow morning if you wake up
and the future is unclear
i... i will be here
as sure as seasons are made for change
our lifetimes are made for years
so i... i will be here
i will be here
so you can cry on my shoulder
when the mirror tells us we're older
i will hold you
and i will be here
to watch you grow in beauty
and tell you all the things you are to me
i will be here, hmmm
i will be true to the promise i have made
to you and to the one who gave you to me
just as sure as seasons are made for change
our lifetimes are made for years
so i... i will be here
we'll be together
cause i will be here
i will be here 

how do you explain
how do you describe
a love that goes from east to west
and runs and deep as it is wide?
you know all our hopes
lord, you know all our fears
and words cannot express the love we feel
but we long for you to hear
so listen to our hearts (oh, lord, please listen)
hear our spirits sing (and hear us sing)
a song of praise that flows (a simple song of praise)
from those you have redeemed (from those you have redeemed)
we will use the words we know
to tell you what an awesome god you are
but words are not enough
to tell you of our love
so listen to our hearts
if words could fall like rain
from these lips of mine
and if i had a thousand years
i would still run out of time
so if you listen to my heart
every beat would say
'thank you for the life, thank you for the truth, thank you for the way.'
so listen to our hearts (oh, lord, please listen)
hear our spirits sing (and hear us sing)
a song of praise that flows (a simple song of praise)
from those you have redeemed (from those you have redeemed)
we will use the words we know
to tell you what an awesome god you are
but words are not enough
to tell you of our love
so listen to our hearts 

i guess we have always known
that a day like this one would come
when our children would leave us
and begin to build a home of their own
lord, all you have taught us
we have gladly passed on to them
but one thing we don't know
is how to place them back in your arms again
chorus:
lord, help us let go of two
that they might become one
just like the father, spirit, and son
two hearts invisibly bound in love
by a vow that will not be undone
now in your tender care
lord, be all that we cannot be
and help us to trust you
when we don't see you quickly meeting their needs
for you have provided
since the day you gave our children to us
but now, in your arms dear jesus
the time has come for giving them up
repeat chorus
the urge is strong
to try holding on
to the image of two
the way that we knew them
but now in your eyes
the two will be as one
repeat chorus 2 times
tag:
by a vow that will not be undone
by a vow that will not be undone 

i see the smoke on the horizon
i feel my heart pounding in my chest
i hear the war raging all around me
and somehow i feel like i was born for this
i can taste the fear, but i choose courage
as i raise my shield and lift my sword
and i fall on my knees and i fight like a warrior
i am a warrior on my knees
i call on the name of the one who is conqueror
i'm more than a conqueror when i believe
the enemy trembles every time
'cause he knows the battle is no longer mine
when i fall on my knees and i fight like a warrior, like a warrior, oh, oh, oh
daughters and sons, we can hear your calling
broken and weak, we can hear your cry
and even though our enemy roars like a lion
the lion of judah is on our side
and he will go before us and behind us
fighting on the left and on the right
so i fall on my knees and i fight like a warrior
i am a warrior on my knees
i call on the name of the one who is conqueror
i'm more than a conqueror when i believe
the enemy trembles every time
'cause he knows the battle is no longer mine
when i fall on my knees and i fight like a warrior, like a warrior, like a warrior
our weapons are trust, our weapons are hope
in the king of kings and the lord of lords
he says, "i am with you so don't be afraid
'cause i've already won this war."
so fall on your knees and fight with me
we are the warriors when we are on our knees
the enemy trembles...
we will fall on our knees and fight like a warrior
we are the warriors on our knees
we call on the name of the one who is conqueror
we're more than conquerors when we believe
the enemy trembles every time
'cause he knows the battle isn't yours or mine
when we fall on our knees and fight like a warrior, like a warrior
we are warriors on our knees
we are the warriors, we are warriors, we are warriors on our knees
jesus!
calling on the name of jesus!
power in the name of jesus!
calling on the name of jesus!
power in the name of jesus!
calling on the name of jesus!
power in the name of jesus!
calling on the name of jesus!
power in the name of jesus! 

the long awaited rains
have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground
and carved their way to where
the wild and rushing river can be found
and like the rains
i have been carried here to where the river flows, yeah
my heart is racing and my knees are weak as i walk to the edge
i know there is no turning back once my feet have left the ledge
and in the rush i hear a voice
that's telling me it's time to take the leap of faith
so here i go

i'm diving in
i'm going deep
in over my head i want to be
caught in the rush
lost in the flow
in over my head i want to go
the river's deep
the river's wide
the river's water is alive
so sink or swim i'm diving in

there is a supernatural power
in this mighty river's flow
it can bring the dead to life
and it can fill an empty soul
and give a heart the only thing
worth living and worth dying for, yeah
but we will never know the awesome power of the grace of god
until we let ourselves get swept away into this holy flood
so if you'll take my hand
we'll close our eyes and count to three
and take the leap of faith, come on let's go
i'm diving in
i'm going deep
in over my head i want to be
caught in the rush
lost in the flow
in over my head i want to go
the river's deep
the river's wide
the river's water is alive
so sink or swim i'm diving in
i'm diving in
i'm going deep
in over my head i want to be
caught in the rush
lost in the flow
in over my head i want to go
the river's deep
the river's wide
the river's water is alive
so sink or swim i'm diving in

i'm diving in
i'm going deep
in over my head i want to be
caught in the rush
lost in the flow
in over my head i want to go
the river's deep
the river's wide
the river's water is alive
so sink or swim i'm diving in
so sink or swim i'm diving in
so sink or swim i'm diving in
i'm diving in
i'm diving in
i'm diving in 

i can do all things
through christ who gives me strength
but sometimes i wonder what he can do through me
no great success to show
no glory on my own
yet in my weakness he is there to let me know
his strength is perfect when our strength is gone
he'll carry us when we can't carry on
raised in his power, the weak become strong
his strength is perfect, his strength is perfect
we can only know
the power that he holds
when we truly see how deep our weakness goes
his strength in us begins
where ours comes to an end
he hears our humble cry and proves again
his strength is perfect when our strength is gone
he'll carry us when we can't carry on
raised in his power, the weak become strong
his strength is perfect, his strength is perfect 

my life began like any other man
held beneath a mother’s loving gaze
somewhere between now and then
i lost the man i could have been
took everything that wasn’t mine to take
but love believes that it is not too late
only one of us deserves this cross
a suffering that should belong to me
deep within this man i hang beside
is the place where shame and grace collide
and it’s beautiful agony
that he believes it’s not too late for me

this is how love wins, every single time
climbing high upon a tree where someone else should die
this is how love heals, the deepest part of you
letting himself bleed into the middle of your wounds
this is what love says, standing at the door
you don’t have to be who you’ve been before
silenced by his voice, death can’t speak again
this is how love wins

did you see this moment from the start
that we would drink this of cup of suffering?
i wonder, did we ever meet?
childhood games in dusty streets
for all my many sorrows and regrets
nothing could compare to just this one
that in the presence of my king
i cannot fall upon my knees
i cannot carry you up to your throne
you instead, will carry me back home
this is how love wins, every single time
climbing high upon a tree where someone else should die
this is how love heals, the deepest part of you
letting himself bleed into the middle of your wounds
this is what love says, standing at the door
you don’t have to be who you’ve been before
silenced by his voice, death can’t speak again
this is how love wins

what can wash away my sin?
nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood
what can make me whole again?
nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood
because this is what love say, standing at the door
you don’t have to be who you’ve been before
and silenced by his voice, death can’t speak again
this is how love wins

this is how love wins, every single time
climbing high upon a tree where someone else should die
this is how love heals, the deepest part of you
letting himself bleed into the middle of your wounds
this is what love says, standing at the door
you don’t have to be who you’ve been before
silenced by his voice, death can’t speak again
this is how love wins 

life is like a mountain railway
with an engineer that's brave
we must make this run successful
from the cradle to the grave
watch the curves, the fills, and tunnels
never falter, never fail
keep your hand upon the throttle
and your eyes upon the rail
blessed savior, thou will guide us
till we reach that blissful shore
where the angels wait to join us
in that great forevermore
you will roll up grades of trial; you will cross the bridge of strife;
see that christ is your conductor on this lightning train of life;
always mindful of obstruction, do your duty, never fail;
keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the rail
blessed savior, thou will guide us
till we reach that blissful shore
where the angels wait to join us
in that great forevermore
as you roll across the trestle, spanning jordan’s swelling tide
you behold the union depot into which your train will glide;
there you’ll meet the superintendent, god the father, god the son
with the hearty, joyous, plaudit, “weary pilgrim, welcome home!”
blessed savior, thou will guide us
till we reach that blissful shore
where the angels wait to join us
in that great forevermore
where the angels wait to join us
in that great forevermore 

i know you've heard the stories
but they all sound too good to be true
you've heard about a place called home
but there doesn't seem to be one for you
so one more night you cry yourself to sleep
and drift off to a distant dream
where love takes you in and everything changes
a miracle starts with the beat of a heart
when love takes you home and says you belong here
the loneliness ends and a new life begins
when love takes you in
and somewhere while you're sleeping
someone else is dreaming too
counting down the days until
they hold you close and say i love you
and like the rain that falls into the sea
in a moment what has been is lost in what will be
when love takes you in everything changes
a miracle starts with the beat of a heart
and this love will never let you go
there is nothing that could ever cause this love to lose its hold
when love takes you in everything changes
a miracle starts with the beat of a heart
when love takes you home and says you belong here
the loneliness ends and a new life begins
when love takes you in it takes you in for good
when love takes you in 

we planted the seed while the tears of our grief soaked the ground
the sky lost its sun, and the world lost its green to lifeless brown
now the chilling wind has turned the earth hard as stone
and silently seed rise beneath ice and snow
and my heart's heavy now
but i'm not letting go of this hope i have that tells me
spring is coming, spring is coming
and all we've been hoping and longing for soon will appear
spring is coming, spring is coming
it won't be long now, it's just about here
hear the birds start to sing
feel the life in the breeze
watch the ice melt away
the kids are coming out to play
feel the sun on your skin
growing strong and warm again
watch the ground: there's something moving
something is breaking through
new life is breaking through
spring is coming, spring is coming
and all we've been hoping and longing for soon will appear
spring is coming, spring is coming
and it won't be long now, it's just about here
spring is coming, spring is coming
(out of these ashes, beauty will rise)
and all we've been hoping and longing for soon will appear
(sorrow will be turned to joy)
spring is coming, spring is coming
(all we hoped for soon will appear)
it won't be long now, it's just about here
(out of the dark clouds, beauty will shine)
(all above in heaven, rejoice)
(spring is coming soon)
(spring is coming soon) 

she spins and she sways
to whatever song plays
without a care in the world
and i'm sitting here wearing
the weight of the world on my shoulders
it's been a long day
and there's still work to do
she's pulling at me
saying "dad, i need you
there's a ball at the castle
and i've been invited
and i need to practice my dancing
oh, please, daddy, please?"

so i will dance with cinderella
while she is here in my arms
'cause i know something the prince never knew
oh, i will dance with cinderella
i don't want to miss even one song
'cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
and she'll be gone...
she says he's a nice guy and i'd be impressed
she wants to know if i approve of the dress
she says, "dad, the prom is just one week away
and i need to practice my dancing
oh, please, daddy, please?"

so i will dance with cinderella
while she is here in my arms
'cause i know something the prince never knew
oh, i will dance with cinderella
i don't want to miss even one song
'cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
and she'll be gone

she will be gone

well, she came home today with a ring on her hand
just glowing and telling us all they had planned
she says, "dad, the wedding's still six months away
but i need to practice my dancing
oh, please, daddy, please?"
so i will dance with cinderella
while she is here in my arms
'cause i know something the prince never knew
oh, i will dance with cinderella
i don't want to miss even one song
'cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
and she'll be gone 

this is not at all
how we thought it was supposed to be
we had so many plans for you
we has so many dreams
but now you've gone away
and left us with the memories of your smile
and nothing we can say
and nothing we can do
can take away the pain
the pain of losing you
and we can cry with hope
we can say good-bye with hope
'cause we know our good-bye is not the end
and we can grieve with hope
'cause we believe with hope
there's a place where we'll see your face again
we'll see your face again
and never have i known
anything so hard to understand
and never have i questioned more
the wisdom of god's plan
but through the cloud of tears
i see the father smile and say 'well done.'
and i imagine you
where you wanted most to be
seeing all your dreams come true
'cause now your home
and now your free
and we can cry with hope
we can say good-bye with hope
'cause we know our good-bye is not the end
and we can grieve with hope
'cause we believe with hope
there's a place where we'll see your face again
we'll see your face again
we have this hope as an anchor
'cause we believe that everything
god promised us is true
and we can cry with hope
we can say good-bye with hope
'cause we know our good-bye is not the end
and we can grieve with hope
'cause we believe with hope
there's a place where we'll see your face again
we'll see your face again
we wait with hope
and we ache with hope
we hold on with hope
we let go with hope 

be still and know that he is god
be still and know that he is holy
be still oh, restless soul of mine
bow before the prince of peace
let the noise and clamor cease
be still and know that he is god
be still and know that he is faithful
consider all that he has done
stand in awe and be amazed
and know that he will never change
be still
be still and know that he is god
be still and know that he is god
be still and know that he is god
be still, be speechless
be still and know that he is god
be still and know he is our father
come rest your head upon his chest
listen to the rhythm of
his unfailing heart of love
beating for his little ones
calling each of us to come
be still, be still 

here we stand, here we are
with all our wounds and battle scars
from all the storms and all the wars we’ve weathered together
we had no way of knowing when
we started way back there and then
how the road would twist and turn and bend
we just knew we belonged together
and if it wasn’t for god’s mercy and his grace
there’s no way we would be standing in this place
but because he has been faithful
every step along the way
here we are together
we’ve climbed up mountains higher than
were ever in our hopes and plans
we’ve held onto each other’s hands
watched miracles unfold together
and we’ve crawled on our hands and knees
through valleys cold and dark and deep
sometimes not even sure if we could make it out alive together
and if it wasn’t for god’s mercy and his grace
there’s no way we would be standing in this place
but because he has been faithful
every step along the way
here we are together, together
and if it wasn’t for god’s mercy and his grace
there’s no way we would be standing in this place
but because he has been faithful
every step along the way
here we are together, together 

one voice in the dark
a song that lights up the stars
one breath that gives life
one sovereign in power
who speaks with thunder and fire
one lord, one king
there is no other that can compare to you

you are
the one alone in greatness
the one who never changes
jesus, you are
the one who rose in power
the one who reigns forever
jesus, the one true god

one man on a cross
one light of the world
one name, one word
one way to be saved
one lamb that was slain
one love above all
there is no other that can compare to you
you are
the one alone in greatness
the one who never changes
jesus, you are
the one who rose in power
the one who reigns forever
jesus, you're the one true god
you're the one true god

we have seen the glory of
the one and only son of god
yes, we have seen the glory of
the one and only son of god
and we have seen the glory of
the one and only son of god
yes, we have seen the glory of
the one and only son of god

you are
the one alone in greatness
the one who never changes
jesus, you are
the one alone in greatness
the one who never changes
jesus, you are
the one who rose in power
the one who reigns forever
jesus, the one true god
you're the one true god
you are the one true god 

today i watched in silence as people passed me by
and i strained to see if there was something hidden in their eyes;
but they all looked back at me as if to say
life just goes on
the old familiar story told in different ways
make the most of your own journey from the cradle to the grave;
dream your dreams tomorrow because today
life must go on
but there's more to this life than living and dying
more than just trying to make it through the day;
more to this life, more than these eyes alone can see
and there's more than this life alone can be
tonight he lies in silence staring into space
and looks for ways to make tomorrow better than today
but in the morning light it looks the same;
life just goes on
he takes care of his family, he takes care of his work
and every sunday morning he takes his place at the church;
and somehow he still feels a need to search
but life just goes on
but there's more to this life than living and dying
more than just trying to make it through the day;
more to this life, more than these eyes alone can see
and there's more than this life alone can be
so where do we start to find every part
of what makes this life complete;
if we turn our eyes to jesus we'll find
life's true beginning is there at the cross where he died
he died to bring us ...
but there's more to this life than living and dying
more than just trying to make it through the day;
more to this life, more than these eyes alone can see
and there's more than this life alone can be 

well, i've been looking back over my shoulder
retracing every step trying to unforget
and i see the mountaintops i've journeyed over
and i see the valleys deep where i crawled on my hands and knees
pages and memories filled with joy and stained with tears
they call my name and if i listen, i can hear them saying

remember the way he led you up to the top of the highest mountain
remember the way he carried you through the deepest dark
remember his promises for every step on the road ahead
look where you've been and where you're going
and remember to remember
remember, remember

and now i'm looking out at the road that's waiting
but my eyes can only see so far out ahead of me
as sure as the sun will shine there'll be more mountains i will climb
and more deep dark shadowlands where desperate faith is all i have
until i'm home, i'm resting all my hope and trust
in the only one whose name is: god with us

remember the way he led us up to the top of the highest mountain
remember the way he carried us through the deepest dark
remember his promises for every step on the road ahead
look where we've been and where we're going
and remember to remember
remember the day is coming when he's going to wipe the tears away
he'll look in our eyes and say:
remember the way i led you off the mountain
remember the way i carried you, ohh

remember the way i led you up to the top of the highest mountain
remember the way i carried you through the deepest dark
remember my promises for every step on the road ahead
look where you've been and where you're going
look where we've been and where we're going
and remember to remember

oh remember to remember
oh remember to remember
oh remember to remember 

to all the travelers
pilgrims longing for a home
from one who walks with you
on this journey called life's road
it is a long and winding road
from one who's seen the view
and dreamt of staying on the mountains high
and one who's cried like you
wanting so much to lay down and die
i offer this, we must remember this
we are not home yet
we are not home yet
keep on looking ahead
let you heart not forget
we are not home yet
not home yet
so close your eyes with me
and hear the father saying, welcome home
let us find the strength
in all his promises to carry on
he said, i go prepare a place for you
so let us not forget
we are not home yet
we are not home yet
keep on looking ahead
let you heart not forget
we are not home yet
we are not home yet
keep on looking ahead
let you heart not forget
we are not home yet
i know there'll be a moment
i know there'll be a place
where we will see our savior
and fall in his embrace
so let us not grow weary
or too content to stay
'cause we are not home yet
we are not home yet
not home yet
so let us journey on
we are not home yet
we are not home yet
keep on looking ahead
let you heart not forget
we are not home yet
not home yet 

well, i don't know if you remember me or not
i'm one of the kids they brought in from the home
i was the red-haired boy in an old green flannel shirt
you may not have seen me, i was standing off alone
i didn't come and talk to you, 'cause that's never worked before
and you'll prob'ly never see this letter anyway
but just in case there's something you can do to help me out
i'll ask you one more time
all i really want for christmas
is someone to tuck me in
a shoulder to cry on if i lose
shoulders to ride on if i win
there's so much i could ask for
but there's just one thing i need
all i really want for christmas is a family
well, i guess i should go ahead and tell you now
if it's really true about that list you have
somehow i always seem to end up in a fight
but i'm really trying hard not to be bad
but maybe if i had a brother or a dad to wrestle with
well, maybe they could teach me how to get along
and from everything i've heard
sounds like the greatest gift on earth would be a mom
all i really want for christmas
is someone to tuck me in
a shoulder to cry on if i lose
shoulders to ride on if i win
there's so much i could ask for
but there's just one thing i need
all i really want for christmas
is someone who'll be there
to sing me "happy birthday"
for the next 100 years
and it's ok if they're not perfect
well, even if they're a little broken, that's alright
'cause so am i
well, i guess i should go
it's almost time for bed
and maybe next time i write you
i'll be at home
'cause all i really want for christmas
is someone to tuck me in
tell me i'll never be alone
someone whose love will never end
of all that i could ask for
well, there's just one thing i need
all i really want for christmas
all i really want for christmas is a family
just a family
that's all i really need 

this is not how it should be
this is not how it could be
this is how it is
and our god is in control
this is not how it will be
when we finally will see
we'll see with our own eyes
he was always in control
and we'll sing holy, holy, holy is our god
and we will finally really understand what it means
so we'll sing holy, holy, holy is our god
while we're waiting for that day
this is not where we planned to be
when we started this journey
but this is where we are
and our god is in control
though this first taste is bitter
there will be sweetness forever
when we finally taste and see
that our god is in control
and we'll sing holy, holy, holy is our god
and we will finally really understand what it means
so we'll sing holy, holy, holy is our god
while we're waiting for that day
we're waiting for that day
we'll keep on waiting for that day
and we will rise
our god is in control
(holy, holy, holy) 
our god is in control
(holy, holy, holy)
our god is in control
(holy, holy, holy)
