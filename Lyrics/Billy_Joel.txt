it's nine o'clock on a saturday
the regular crowd shuffles in
there's an old man sittin' next to me
makin' love to his tonic and gin
he says, "son, can you play me a memory?
i'm not really sure how it goes
but it's sad, and it's sweet, and i knew it complete
when i wore a younger man's clothes"

la, la-la, di-dee-da
la-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

now john at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be
he says, "bill, i believe this is killing me"
as the smile ran away from his face
"well i'm sure that i could be a movie star
if i could get out of this place"

oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
la-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

now paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talkin' with davy, who's still in the navy
and probably will be for life
and the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinkin' alone


sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
to forget about life for a while
and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, "man, what are you doin' here?"

oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
la-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

slow down, you crazy child
you're so ambitious for a juvenile
but then if you're so smart
tell me why are you still so afraid, hmm?
where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
you'd better cool it off before you burn it out
you've got so much to do
and only so many hours in a day, ayy

but you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're gonna
kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
when will you realize
vienna waits for you?

slow down, you're doin' fine
you can't be everything you wanna be
before your time
although it's so romantic
on the borderline tonight, tonight
too bad but it's the life you lead
you're so ahead of yourself
that you forgot what you need
though you can see when you're wrong
you know you can't always see when you're right
you're right

you've got your passion
you've got your pride
but don't you know
that only fools are satisfied?
dream on
but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
when will you realize
vienna waits for you?


slow down, you crazy child
and take the phone off the hook
and disappear for a while
it's all right, you can afford
to lose a day or two, ooh
when will you realize
vienna waits for you?

and you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you could just get old
you're gonna
kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
why don't you realize
vienna waits for you?

when will you realize
vienna waits for you?

uptown girl
she's been living in her uptown world
i bet she's never had a backstreet guy
i bet her momma never told her why
i'm gonna try for an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am

and when she knows what she wants from her time
and when she wakes up and makes up her mind

she'll see i'm not so tough
just because i'm in love with an

uptown girl
you know i've seen her in her uptown world
she's getting tired of her high class toys
and all the presents from her uptown boys
she's got a choice

uptown girl
you know i can't afford to buy her pearls
but maybe someday when my ship comes in
she'll understand what kind of guy i've been
and then i'll win

and when she's walking, she's looking so fine
and when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

she'll say i'm not so tough
just because i'm in love with an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am

uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
you know i'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
you know i'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
you know i'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
you know i'm in love with an uptown girl

dum dum dum

whoa, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time

if you said goodbye to me tonight
there would still be music left to write
what else could i do?
i'm so inspired by you
that hasn't happened for the longest time

once i thought my innocence was gone
now i know that happiness goes on
that's where you found me
when you put your arms around me
i haven't been there for the longest time

whoa, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest

i'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
and the greatest miracle of all
is how i need you
and how you needed me too
that hasn't happened for the longest time

maybe this won't last very long
but you feel so right and i could be wrong
maybe i've been hoping too hard
but i've gone this far and it's more than i hoped for

who knows how much further we'll go on?
maybe i'll be sorry when you're gone
i'll take my chances
i forgot how nice romance is
i haven't been there for the longest time

i had second thoughts at the start
i said to myself, "hold on to your heart"
now i know the woman that you are
you're wonderful so far, and it's more than i hoped for

i don't care what consequence it brings
i have been a fool for lesser things
i want you so bad
i think you ought to know that
i intend to hold you for the longest time

whoa, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time
whoa, oh, oh (for the longest)
for the longest time...

she can kill with a smile
she can wound with her eyes
and she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
and she only reveals
what she wants you to see
she hides like a child
but she's always a woman to me

she can lead you to love
she can take you or leave you
she can ask for the truth
but she'll never believe you
and she'll take what you give her
as long as it's free
yeah, she steals like a thief
but she's always a woman to me

oh, she takes care of herself
she can wait if she wants
she's ahead of her time
oh, and she never gives out
and she never gives in
she just changes her mind

and she'll promise you more
than the garden of eden
then she'll carelessly cut you
and laugh while you're bleedin'
but she'll bring out the best
and the worst you can be
blame it all on yourself
cause she's always a woman to me

mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm mm

oh, she takes care of herself
she can wait if she wants
she's ahead of her time
oh, and she never gives out
and she never gives in
she just changes her mind

she is frequently kind
and she's suddenly cruel
she can do as she pleases
she's nobody's fool
but she can't be convicted
she's earned her degree
and the most she will do
is throw shadows at you
but she's always a woman to me

mmm mm, mmm mm
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

hoo ooh
ohh ohh
mmm mmm

come out virginia, don't let me wait
you catholic girls start much too late
aw, but sooner or later
it comes down to fate
i might as well be the one

well, they showed you a statue
told you to pray
they built you a temple
and locked you away
aw, but they never told you
the price that you pay
for things that you might have done

well, only the good die young
that's what i said
only the good die young
only the good die young

we might be laughing a bit too loud
aw, but that never hurt no one

the stained-glass curtain

you got a nice white dress
and a party on your confirmation

but virginia
they didn't give you quite enough information
you didn't count on me
when you were counting on your rosary

they say there's a heaven
for those who will wait
some say it's better, but i say it ain't
i'd rather laugh with the sinners
than cry with the saints
the sinners are much more fun

you know that only the good die young
oh oh ohh baby
i tell ya only the good die young
only the good die young

2:26 - 2:39

a bottle of white, a bottle of red
perhaps a bottle of rosé instead
we'll get a table near the street
in our old familiar place
you and i, face to face, mmm
a bottle of red, a bottle of white
it all depends upon your appetite
i'll meet you any time you want
in our italian restaurant


things are okay with me these days
got a good job, got a good office
got a new wife, got a new life
and the family is fine
oh, lost touch long ago
you lost weight, i did not know
you could ever look so nice
after so much time

you remember those days
hanging out at the village green?
engineer boots, leather jackets
and tight blue jeans
oh, you drop a dime in the box
play the song about new orleans
cold beer, hot lights
my sweet romantic teenage nights


brenda and eddie were the popular steadies
and the king and the queen of the prom
riding around with the car top down
and the radio on
nobody looked any finer
or was more of a hit at the parkway diner
we never knew we could want
more than that out of life
surely brenda and eddie
would always know how to survive

brenda and eddie were still going steady
in the summer of '75
when they decided their marriage
should be at the end of july
everyone said they were crazy
"brenda you know that you're much too lazy
and eddie could never afford
to live that kind of life."
oh but there we were waving
brenda and eddie goodbye

well, they got an apartment
with deep pile carpets
and a couple of paintings from sears
a big waterbed that they
bought with the bread
they had saved for a couple of years
they started to fight
when the money got tight
and they just didn't count on the tears

yeah, rock and roll!

well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
but it's always the same in the end
they got a divorce as a matter of course
and they parted the closest of friends
then the king and the queen
went back to the green
but you can never go back there again

brenda and eddie had had it already
by the summer of '75
from the high to the low
to the end of the show
for the rest of their lives
they couldn't go back to the greasers
the best they could do
was pick up their pieces
we always knew they would
both find a way to get by
and that's all i heard about brenda and eddie
can't tell you more 'cause i told you already
and here we are waving
brenda and eddie goodbye


bottle of red, bottle of white
whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
i'll meet you anytime you want
in our italian restaurant

some folks like to get away
take a holiday from the neighborhood
hop a flight to miami beach or to hollywood
but i'm taking a greyhound
on the hudson river line
i'm in a new york state of mind
(mmh-mmh)

i've seen all the movie stars
in their fancy cars and their limousines
been high in the rockies
under the evergreens
i know what i'm needing
and i don't want to waste more time
i'm in a new york state of mind
(mmh-mmh)

it was so easy living day by day
out of touch with the rhythm and blues
but now i need a little give and take
the new york times, the daily news

it comes down to reality
and it's fine with me 'cause i've let it slide
i don't care if it's chinatown or on riverside
i don't have any reasons i left them all behind
i'm in a new york state of mind
(mmh-mmh, oh yeah)


it was so easy living day by day
out of touch with the rhythm and blues
but now i need a little give and take
the new york times, the daily news
(who-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh)

it comes down to reality
and it's fine with me 'cause i've let it slide
i don't care if it's chinatown or on riverside
i don't have any reasons i left them all behind
i'm in a new york state of mind
(mmh-mmh)

i'm just taking a greyhound
on the hudson river line
'cause i'm in a, i'm in a new york
state of mind, yeah

got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
said he couldn't go on the american way
closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
now he gives them a stand-up routine in l.a

i don't need you to worry for me 'cause i'm alright
i don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
i don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

i never said you had to offer me a second chance
(i never said you had to...)
i never said i was a victim of circumstance
(i never said...)

i still belong (still belong)
don't get me wrong (get me wrong)
and you can speak your mind
but not on my time

they will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself

i don't need you to worry for me 'cause i'm alright
i don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
i don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

i never said you had to offer me a second chance
(i never said you had to...)
i never said i was a victim of circumstance
(of circumstance...)

i still belong (still belong)
don't get me wrong (get me wrong)
and you can speak your mind
but not on my time

i don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

keep it to yourself, it's my life
keep it to yourself, it's my life
keep it to yourself, it's my life
keep it to yourself, it's my life...

if you search for tenderness
it isn't hard to find
you can have the love you need to live
but if you look for truthfulness
you might just as well be blind
it always seems to be so hard to give

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you

i can always find someone
to say they sympathize
if i wear my heart out on my sleeve
but i don't want some pretty face
to tell me pretty lies
all i want is someone to believe

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you

i can find a lover
i can find a friend
i can have security
until the bitter end
anyone can comfort me
with promises again
i know, i know

when i'm deep inside of me
don't be too concerned
i won't ask for nothin' while i'm gone
but when i want sincerity
tell me where else can i turn
'cause you're the one that i depend upon

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you

well, we all have a face
that we hide away forever
and we take them out and show ourselves
when everyone has gone
some are satin, some are steel
some are silk and some are leather
they're the faces of a stranger
but we'd love to try them on

well, we all fall in love
but we disregard the danger
though we share so many secrets
there are some we never tell
why were you so surprised
that you never saw the stranger?
did you ever let your lover
see the stranger in yourself?

don't be afraid to try again
everyone goes south every now and then
you've done it
why can't someone else?
you should know by now
you've been there yourself

once i used to believe
i was such a great romancer
then i came home to a woman
that i could not recognize
when i pressed her for a reason
she refused to even answer
it was then i felt the stranger
kick me right between the eyes

well, we all fall in love
but we disregard the danger
though we share so many secrets
there are some we never tell
why were you so surprised
that you never saw the stranger?
did you ever let your lover
see the stranger in yourself?

don't be afraid to try again
everyone goes south every now and then
you've done it
why can't someone else?
you should know by now
you've been there yourself

you may never understand
how the stranger is inspired
but he isn't always evil
and he is not always wrong
though you drown in good intentions
you will never quench the fire
you'll give in to your desire
when the stranger comes along
ooo ooo
ooh ooh

well, we're living here in allentown
and they're closing all the factories down
out in bethlehem, they're killing time
filling out forms, standing in line

well, our fathers fought the second world war
spent their weekends on the jersey shore
met our mothers at the uso
asked them to dance, danced with them slow

and we're living here in allentown
but the restlessness was handed down
and it's getting very hard to stay

well, we're waiting here in allentown
for the pennsylvania we never found
for the promises our teachers gave
if we worked hard, if we behaved

so the graduations hang on the wall
but they never really helped us at all
no they never taught us what was real
iron and coke, chromium steel

and we're waiting here in allentown
but they've taken all the coal from the ground
and the union people crawled away

every child had a pretty good shot
to get at least as far as their old man got
but something happened
on the way to that place
they threw an american flag in our face

well i'm living here in allentown
and it's hard to keep a good man down
but i won't be getting up today

and it's getting very hard to stay
and we're living here in allentown

we met as soul mates on parris island
we left as inmates from an asylum
and we were sharp, as sharp as knives
and we were so gung ho to lay down our lives

we came in spastic like tameless horses
we left in plastic as numbered corpses
and we learned fast to travel light
our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight

we had no home front, we had no soft soap
they sent us playboy, they gave us bob hope
we dug in deep and shot on sight
and prayed to jesus christ with all of our might

we had no cameras to shoot the landscape
we passed the hash pipe and played our doors tapes
and it was dark, so dark at night
and we held on to each other like brother to brother
we promised our mothers we'd write

and we would all go down together
we said we'd all go down together
yes, we would all go down together

remember charlie, remember baker
they left their childhood on every acre
and who was wrong? and who was right?
it didn't matter in the thick of the fight

we held the day in the palm of our hands
they ruled the night, and the night
seemed to last as long as six weeks
on parris island
we held the coastline, they held the highlands
and they were sharp, as sharp as knives
they heard the hum of our motors, they counted the rotors
and waited for us to arrive

and we would all go down together
we said we'd all go down together
yes, we would all go down together

what's the matter with
the clothes i'm wearing?
can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
maybe i should buy some
old tab collars?
welcome back to the age of jive
where have you been
hidin' out lately, honey?
you can't dress trashy
till you spend a lot of money

everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

what's the matter with the car i'm driving?
can't you tell that it's out of style?
should i get a set
of whitewall tires?
are you gonna cruise
the miracle mile?
nowadays you can't be too sentimental
your best bet's a true
baby blue continental

hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
it's still rock and roll to me

oh, it doesn't matter
what they say in the papers
cause it's always been the same old scene
there's a new band in town
but you can't get the sound
from a story in a magazine
aimed at your average teen

how about a pair of pink sidewinders
and a bright orange pair of pants?
you could really be a beau brummel baby
if you just give it half a chance
don't waste your money
on a new set of speakers
you get more mileage
from a cheap pair of sneakers

next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
it's still rock and roll to me


what's the matter with the crowd i'm seeing?
don't you know that they're out of touch?
should i try to be a straight 'a' student?
if you are then you think too much
don't you know about
the new fashion honey?
all you need are looks
and a whole lotta money

it's the next phase, new wave
dance craze, anyways
it's still rock and roll to me

everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

in every heart there is a room
a sanctuary safe and strong
to heal the wounds from lovers past
until a new one comes along

i spoke to you in cautious tones
you answered me with no pretense
and still i feel i said too much
my silence is my self defense

and every time i've held a rose
it seems i only felt the thorns
and so it goes, and so it goes
and so will you soon i suppose

but if my silence made you leave
then that would be my worst mistake
so i will share this room with you
and you can have this heart to break

and this is why my eyes are closed
it's just as well for all i've seen
and so it goes, and so it goes
and you're the only one who knows

so i would choose to be with you
that's if the choice were mine to make
but you can make decisions too
and you can have this heart to break

and so it goes, and so it goes
and you're the only one who knows

well, you went uptown
ridin' in your limousine
with your fine park avenue clothes
you had the dom perignon
in your hand
and the spoon up your nose
ooh, and when you
wake up in the mornin'
with your head on fire
and your eyes too bloody to see
go on and cry in your coffee
but don't come bitchin' to me

because you had to be
a big shot, didn't cha
you had to open up your mouth
you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
all your friends were so knocked out
you had to have the last word, last night
you know what everything's about
you had to have a white hot spotlight
you had to be a big shot last night, whoa
yeah

and they were all impressed
with your halston dress
and the people that you knew at elaine's
and the story of your latest success
you kept 'em so entertained
but now you just don't
remember all the things you said
and you're not sure that you want to know
i'll give you one hint, honey
you sure did put on a show

yes, yes, you had to be
a big shot, didn't cha
you had to prove it to the crowd
you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
all your friends were so knocked out
you had to have the last word, last night
you're so much fun to be around
you had to have the front page, bold type
you had to be a big shot last night

well, it's no big sin
to stick your two cents in
if you know when to leave it alone
but you went over the line
you couldn't see it was time to go home
no, no, no, no, no, no

you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
you had to open up your mouth
you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
all your friends were so knocked out
you had to have the last word, last night
you're so much fun to be around
you had to have a white hot spotlight
you had to be a big shot last night

big shot
big shot
oh, big shot
big shot

saturday night, and you're still hanging around
you're tired of living in your one horse town
you'd like to find a little hole in the ground
for a while
mmhmm

so you go to the village in your
tie-dye jeans
and you stare at the junkies
and the closet queens
it's like some pornographic magazine
and you smile
mmhmm

captain jack will get you high tonight
and take you to your special island
captain jack will get you by tonight
just a little push, and you'll be smiling
oh, yeah yeah

your sister's gone out, she's on a date
and you just sit at home and masturbate
your phone is gonna ring soon
but you just can't wait
for that call
mmhmm

so you stand on the corner in your
new english clothes
and you look so polished
from your hair down to your toes
oh, but still your finger's
gonna pick your nose
after all
mmhmm, yeah

but captain jack will get you high tonight
and take you to your special island
captain jack will get you by tonight
just a little push, and you'll be smiling

you got your tape deck
and your brand new chevrolet
ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
what for?
mmhmm

so you got everything
ah, but nothing's cool
they just found your father
in the swimming pool
and you guess you won't be goin' back to school
anymore

but captain jack can get you high tonight
and take you to your special island
oh, captain jack will get you by tonight
just a little push, and you'll be smiling
la la la
oh, yeah yeah

so you play your albums
and you smoke your pot
and you meet your girlfriend in the parkin' lot
ohh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
what went wrong?
mmhmm

and if you can't understand
why your world is so dead
why you've got to keep in style
and feed your head
well, you're 21, and still your mother makes your bed
and that's too long
oh, oh, oh
ohh ohh whoa yeah yeah

but captain jack will get you high tonight
and take you to your special island
well, now captain jack
will get you by tonight
just a little push, and you'll be smiling

oh, captain jack
will get you high tonight
and take you to your special island
well, now captain jack
could make you die tonight
just a little push, and you’ll be smiling

yeah, captain jack will get you high tonight
and take you to your special island

will make you die tonight

well, now captain jack
could make you die tonight
just a little push, and you'll be smiling
