every time i see your face
it reminds me of the places we used to go
but all i've got is a photograph
and i realise you're not coming back any more

the day you went away
but i can't make it
'til you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay

while my heart is broke, my tears i cried for you

to live without you
but that's not something
that i'm looking forward to

times were right, overnight
we were headline news
crazy days and reckless nights
limosuines and bright spotlights
we were brothers through it all

never without you (without you, without you)
within you, without you (within you, without you)

hanging out in castles or hanging in the yard

from paul to john
to playin' in german bars
from mono to stereo
hittin' number one
and havin' all the fun
and lightin' up the radio

nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
what's my name? (ringo!)

spinning 'round and 'round
we broke the speed of sound
tearin' up the freeway
with the tumblin' of the dice
and gettin' bad advice
we had to call a mayday

they said we've had the last
we're a thing of the past
but i can still rock 'n' roll
you can't deny
we're doin' somethin' right
it's not my first rodeo

nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
what's my name? (ringo!)

i can't get enough
of peace and love
this is what i've come to understand
i'll pull myself together
through all kinds of weather
i'll give you everything i can

well, i've seen it all
from the mountains of nepal
to reno, nevada
i've taken all the falls
i was climbin' up the walls
and now it doesn't matter

nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
what's my name? (ringo!)

now i'm playing on the run
and there is only one
what's my name? (ringo!)
i can feel the love
from the stars above
what's my name? (ringo!)
followin' the sun
where the river runs
what's my name? (ringo!)
now i've raised my hands
all across the lands
what's my name? (ringo!)
nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
nothin' stays the same
but i'm still in the game
hey, what's my name? (ringo!)
what's my name? (ringo!)

(one, two)

headed for the studio to finish this track
a lot going on and a lot to do
we gotta get it done 'cause we ain't coming back
we still got a lot of playing to do
playing guitars are no troubles for you
we play really tight, we play really loud
we're gonna kick ass in front of the crowd
we're gonna play some rock and roll, that's true
now we're heading down the highway to play it for you
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're traveling fast thru' the sky tonight
in 24 hours gonna make it right
a passenger's time seems to go to slow
we're telling stories and having a laugh
singing my songs all around
nothing's gonna matter when we roll up to play the show
as i open my eyes and wish you good day
i count the hours until we get to play
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're gonna play some rock and roll, that's true
now we're heading down the highway to play it for you
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're on the road again
we're on the road, on the road
on the road again

i searched here, there and everywhere
until i saw you standing there
i am the greatest fan of you
and love is all i've got to do
it's all too much my little child
if you will be my honey pie
eight days a week you will be mine
and getting better all the time
i'm begging you don't pass me by
and if you do please tell me why
i know you told me yesterday
you've got to hide your love away
but if your honey is bad to me
it told me "love and let it be"

six o'clock in the morning, you've just gone to sleep
i wipe a tear from my eye
it can't be the kind of company i keep
that keeps me asking, you keep me asking
you keep me wondering why
i don't treat you like i'd like to treat you
every planet in the sky is in your eyes

but i don't treat you like i
no, i don't treat you like i
no, i don't treat you like i should

it could be the comfort going to my head
that makes me want to dream of you
but while you're sleeping softly in your bed
i want to tell you, i'd like to tell you
i'd love to tell you too

i (i) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you)
like i'd like to treat you
every diamond in the sky is in your eyes

but i don't treat you like i
no, i don't treat you like i
no, i don't treat you like i should

i know you would say, you love my way
it's good enough for you
but i know for sure, i could do more, (more) more. (more)
i want to tell you, i'd like to tell you
i'd love to tell you too

i (i) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you)
like i'd like to treat you
every diamond in the sky is in your eyes

i phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
he said, "come on over."
i said, "do i have to?"
my knees started shakin', my wrist started achin'
when my doctor said to me:

oh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

the head nurse, she blew in, just like a tornado
when they started dancing, i jumped off the table
i felt myself healing and as i was leavin'
this is what they said to me:

oh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
oh my my, if you try, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

now if you should slow down and you're feelin' low down
don't call up your doctor, just grab you a partner
it's what you've been missin', i've got your prescription
that boogie-woogie remedy

oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie, you can slide
oh my my, oh my my, we can boogie 'till we die
oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

oh my my, oh my my, watch me boogie, watch me slide
oh my my, (ow!) oh my my, born to boogie, born to slide
(can you boogie?)
oh my my, oh my my, oo-wee, boogie, oo-wee, aye

oh my my, oh my my, love that boogie, love that slide
(can you boogie?)
oh my my, oh my my, oh my boogie, oh my slide

when we first met
on the rooftop of that hotel
everyone around us could see, we got on well
so we took the elevator straight up to forty second floor
when we kissed in your doorway, it's like we never kissed before
i was in love again, and i knew that you were too
we spent every night together, nothing was kaboom
and early in the morning the sunlight in your hair
i knew we stick together, you were the answer to my prays
how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
how could i (how could i) be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
all the time we spent together so close and true
living for each other together thru the blue (thru the blue)
two stars like lovers beneath the tennessee moon
we near as we could be
johnny cash and june
how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long
how could i (how could i) be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
for so long (for so long)
for so long
then i heard a rumor, from an old friend of mine
he been seeing someone else, i never saw the signs
i hope he make she happy, and that he is happy too
and just like all the others, i'll get over you
but how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
how could i be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (so long)
how could i (how could i) be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (so long)
how could i… be so wrong? for so long
