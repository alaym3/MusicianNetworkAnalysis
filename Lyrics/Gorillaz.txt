city's breaking down on a camel's back
they just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
so while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
and you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
you got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
a melancholy town where we never smile
and all i wanna hear is the message beep
my dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause i don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)

windmill, windmill for the land
turn forever, hand in hand
take it all in on your stride
it is ticking, falling down
love forever, love is free
let's turn forever, you and me
windmill, windmill for the land

laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats

with yo' sound, you in the blink
gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
with yo' sound, you kill the inc
so don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
until you're cheddar headed
and watch the way i navigate, hahahahaha

hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

(hoo, yeah, haha)
finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on (that's right)
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner (fuck 'em) so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

when the pulsing looks to die for
take it in your heart now, lover
when the case is out
and tired and sodden
take it in your heart
take it in your heart

back to when it was cool
'cause there's no substitute
who even knows the truth?
the truth, the truth

take it in your heart now, love her
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
take it in your heart
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
where it all goes down

outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
i took it to the right man
took it all back
when the courts were closing
it was bobby gracing
i know that
i put it to the right man
he put it back

talk to the crowds
stacks of lights
come streaming back
make it for the best times
growing pains, good times
good times, good times
good times, good times
good times, good times

take it in your heart now, love her
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
take it in your heart
take it in your heart
where it all goes down

andromeda
andromeda, andromeda
take it in your heart now, love her
andromeda, andromeda
andromeda, andromeda
take it in your heart
take it in your heart
where it all goes down

i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
drive on engines till they weep
with future pixels in factories far away
so call the mainland from the beach
your heart is now washed up in bleach
the waves are rising for this time of year
and nobody knows what to do with the heat
under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
while rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

(uh)
(mmmmm)

i can't see you now my heart is frozen
all the bowses and the growses
have been abstinated in my soul
i prayed on the immovable
yet clinging to the atoms of rock
seasons see adjustment signs of change
i can't see now, she said, "taxi"
now that light is all i can take
this dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(here we go again)
that's electric
(uh)
that's electric

helicopters fly over the beach
same time every day, same routine
a clear target in the summer when skies are blue
it's part of the noise when winter comes
it reverberates in my lungs
nature's corrupted in factories far away

(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)

it's coming up, it's coming up

you've got to press it on you
you've just been thinking

slow it down some, no split, clown bum
your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
where you found them at?
got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
would have floated, bloated, voted
sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
that blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
crank it on blast, roll past front street
blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
these kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well, you know november has come

(oh, what they say)
something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well, you know november has come

bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
my guess is yes, you can, like "can i kick it?" wicked
liquor shot if you happy and you know it
as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
grope a pen and i'm in cope hymen
doper rhymin' more worther than the hope diamond
acquired off the black market
a wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
the rapid-fire spark lit
(zzzt!) a rapper bug zapper
and it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
the beats got family members askin' him for closure
aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, "clean it"
then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
she wore a filled-in thong of billabong
that said, "nah, fo'real-a, the villain on a gorilla jawn?"

i change your whole location to a pine box, six under
impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
orders given to me is strike and i'm thunder
with lightning-fast reflexes
on constant alert from the constant hurt
that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
it seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
you can't conceal the hate that consumes you
i'm the reason why you fill up your isuzu
chill with your old lady at the tilt
i got a ninety-day extension and i'm filled with guilt
from things that i seen
your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
at night i hear the shots ring, so i'm a light sleeper
the cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert with my street sweeper
"the war is over", so said the speaker
with the flight suit on
maybe to him, i'm just a pawn
so he can advance
remember when i used to dance?
man, all i wanna do is dance

i need a gun to keep myself among

momentary bliss

we could do so much better than this
mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita

lovely rita, meter maid
lovely rita, meter maid

your potential, you lack credentials
and you are special, so fucking special (rita)
oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
and you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
you part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (ah)
and you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (woo)
best you shut your trap and keep it hush (hush)
on another note, compliments make me blush
there's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
you pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (ah, ah, ah)
"what was scripted, the day before it happened?"
we all give applause when people open doors
but on the way out it did your back in
see, everything in life ain't silver and gold
but mining for metal gave you platinum

it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
it just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
makes me sick

poster boy (ayy)
poster girl (rita)
in truth, the bills (the bills)
must be paid (yeah, yeah, alright)
poster boy (yeah, alright)
poster girl (ah, that's time)

in truth, the bills, they must be paid (uh-huh)
and what is left is sodden cake, typical
oh, you need to change your face
you're getting sold, it's such a waste
y'know, we could do so much better than this
swimming in pools of momentary bliss
where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it
meanwhile, you keep on adding
how big you gonna grow?

it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
it just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners

we could do so much better than this
perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita

i'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
with a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
i'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
the shadow in the corner, just playing along
i'm only laying in my bed, i'm rolling aside
but if i get a car, i'm hoping to ride
because i know if i ever say "i'm leaving" to you
you've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
you're soft

you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)

i’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
i’m at lay chimirida, not a heart and soul
i got a saturday night, and nothing is dead
and if i ever had to do it, well, you know i wouldn’t care
i just kicked down, i love when i’m seen
yeah, and if i wanna talk back, the message is free
then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
and if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
you get a heart, break

you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)

every time we try, we get nowhere
wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? yeah
trying so hard to act like we don't care
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right

new word, onomatopoeia (boom)
quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
fuck around and get jumped like leap year
glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
get the fuck on, gone
okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
my girl look pretty up there riding dick
my plaid past, my solid future
asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
i'm an outkast but you're into me
summer got mad cause the winter blew me
that juicy fruit, that splooshy sploosh
generation x on bloopty bloop
get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
like a chimney, i commend me
how come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"ah, he don't rap enough"
but y'all rap a lot and i'm like "wrap it up, hoe"
you ain't scarface, you ain't willie d
you ain't bushwick, you ain't killin' me
better play with your motherfuckin' momma
bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
keep sleeping on me, i'ma rock my pajamas
in the daytime, i swear, i promise
dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
how come blacks don't play baseball?
y'all white, know y'all can taste all this
fly shit, i stay finna take off

a lava language in a vocal volcanic

if it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
if it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
and if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush

trying so hard to act like we don't care (i don't care)
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right

flip the page, our days are revelatious
space is strange, doctor, i've got no patience
oh, it's all a part of the process (okay, okay)
nothing's new, it's true, cool, i admit
shit, i guess you're right

kids with guns
kids with guns
taking over
but they won't be long
they're mesmerized
skeletons

drinking out (push it real)
pacifier (push it real, push it)
vitamin souls (push it, push it real)
the street desire (push it real, push it)
doesn't make sense to (push it, push it real)
but it won't be long (push it real, push it)

drinking out

doesn't make sense to
but it won't be long

'cause kids with guns

summer don't know me no more
he got mad, tiresome
summer don't know me
he'd just let me low in myself
'cause i do know love
from you then
just dying

i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine

don't stop the bud when it comes
it's the dawn, you'll see
money won't get there
ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
if you do that
i'll be sworn
to find you

i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine


i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine

maybe in time
you'll want to be mine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine
maybe in time
you'll want to be mine

mama mavis, oh, mama, they tried my patience
{obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{orlando,} we mourn, i'm praying for my neighbors
they say the devil's at work and {trump} is calling favors
you say i'm dangerous, i speak for the nameless
i fly with the vultures, i be with them bangers
if change don't come, then the change won't come
if the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(woo!)

am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
look into your eyes
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark, let me out)
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change come to pass
change come to pass
you'd best be ready for it

something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all

let me out
let me out
let me out
let me out

look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
tell me that i won't die at the hands of the police
promise me i won't outlive my nephew and my niece
promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that i teach
tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
but until then, i keep my piece in arm's reach

am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark) another night
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change coming
you'd best be ready for it

something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all

all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark) another night
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change, oh, change is coming
you'd best be ready

be ready, ready for it
be ready, be ready
(let me out)

oscillate yourself tonight
when you're in your bed
assimilate the dopamine
passing through your head

when you get back on a saturday night
and the room is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?

see yourself in cupid's lake
chipped in your head
do you indicate to satellites
passing by the edge?

when you get back on a saturday night
and your head is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?

do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you turn into your effigy?

do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?

(do you dance?)
(do you dance?)
(do you dance?)
(do you dance?)

oh, joys are us, the sun has come again to hold you
sailing out the doldrums of the week
the polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
it's all around you, out here

and if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
fall through space out of mind with me

where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
blows all the shadows far away
the falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

little memories, marching on
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon, like a wave, empires will fall
and closing in on you, they're going on
little memories
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon like a wave, empires will fall
closing in on you, they're going on
