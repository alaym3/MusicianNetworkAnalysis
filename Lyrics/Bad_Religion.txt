i don't need to be a global citizen
'cause i'm blessed by nationality
i'm a member of a growing populace
we enforce our popularity
there are things that seem to pull us under, and
there are things that drag us down
but there's a power and a vital presence
that's lurking all around

we've got the american jesus
see him on the interstate
we've got the american jesus
he helped build the president's estate

i feel sorry for the earth's population
'cause so few live in the u.s.a
at least the foreigners can copy our morality
they can visit, but they cannot stay
only precious few can garner the prosperity
it makes us walk with renewed confidence
we've got a place to go when we die
and the architect resides right here

we've got the american jesus (ah)
bolstering national faith (ah-ah-ah)
we've got the american jesus (ah-ah-ah)
overwhelming millions every day (ah-ah)

he's the farmers' barren fields (in god!)
the force the army wields (we trust!)
expressions on the faces of the starving millions
(because he's one of us)
the power of the man (break down!)
the fuel that drives the klan (cave in!)
he's the motive and the conscience of the murderer
(we can redeem your sin)
he's the preacher on t.v. (strong heart!)
the false sincerity (clear mind!)
the form letter that's written by the big computers
(and infinitely kind)
the nuclear bombs (you lose!)
the kids with no moms (we win!)
and i'm fearful that he's inside me
(he is our champion) yeah!

we've got the american jesus
(we've got the american jesus)
see him on the interstate
(we've got the american jesus)
we've got the american jesus
(we've got the american jesus)
exercising his authority
we've got the american jesus
(we've got the american jesus)
bolstering national faith
(we've got the american jesus)
we've got the american jesus
(we've got the american jesus)
overwhelming millions every day
(ah-ah-ah) yeah!

there's a place where everyone can be happy
it's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world
it's made of candy canes and planes and bright red choo choo trains
and the meanest little boys, the most innocent little girls
and, you know, i wish that i could go there
it's a road that i have not found
and i wish you the best of luck, dear
so drop a card or letter to my side of town

'cause there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
but baby, i'm amazed at the hate that you can send

and you painted my entire world
but i don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
and i won't forget it

there's a place where everyone can be right
even though you remain determined to be opposed
admittance requires no qualifications
it's where everyone has been and where everybody goes
so please try not to be impatient
for we all hate standing in line
and when the farm is good and bought, you'll be there without a thought
and eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time

as there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
but baby, i'm amazed at the hate that you can send

and you painted my entire world
but i don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
and i won't forget it

jackboots crackin' on a polished floor
red hats gathered in the liquor store
pure hearts race on a crystal night
everybody grab a torch to light

everybody
needs somebody
join the party
the kids are alt-right today

now grab your partner and do-si-do
populism is a sold-out show
humanity is a nowhere scene
when everybody has an ar-15

everybody
needs somebody
join the party
the kids are alt-right today

we love god, we love our women
we love tradition, we love kin
we've got shiny new tools
for ancient impulses that we can't even understand
so if you feel alone and downtrodden
there's an elixir for your ills
join the alt-right, post-light, endarkenment order
and the rest of those bastards can go to hell
alternative facts, alternative lies
alternative names, alternative tribes

everybody
let's get bloody
join the party
the kids are alt-right today

i can't believe it
the way you look sometimes
like a trampled flag on a city street, oh yeah
and i don't want it
the things you're offering me
symbolized bar code, quick id, oh yeah

'cause i'm a 21st century digital boy
i don't know how to live, but i've got a lot of toys
my daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
my mommy's on valium, so ineffectual
ain't life a mystery, yeah?

i can't explain it
the things you're saying to me
it's going ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, oh yeah

'cause i'm a 21st century digital boy
i don't know how to read, but i've got a lot of toys
my daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
my mommy's on valium, so ineffectual
ain't life a mystery, yeah?

tried to tell you about no control
but now i really don't know
and then you told me how bad you had to suffer
is that really all you have to offer?


see, i'm a 21st century digital boy
i don't know how to read but i've got a lot of toys
my daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
my mommy's on valium, so ineffectual

cat's foot, iron claw
(21st century digital boy)
neurosurgeon, scream for more
(21st century digital boy)
innocence raped with napalm fire
(21st century digital boy)
everything i want, i really need

21st century schizoid boy
21st century video boy
21st century digital boy
21st century sofa boy...

now here i go, hope i don't break down
i won't take anything, i don't need anything
don't want to exist, i can't persist
please stop before i do it again

just talk about nothing
let's talk about nothing
let's talk about no one
please talk about no one, someone, anyone!

you and me have a disease
you affect me, you infect me
i'm afflicted, you're addicted
you and me, you and me

i'm on the edge, get against the wall
i'm so distracted, i love to strike you
here's my confession, you learned your lesson
stop me before i do it again

just talk about nothing
let's talk about nothing
let's talk about no one
please talk about no one, someone, anyone

you and me have a disease
you affect me, you infect me
i'm afflicted, you're addicted
you and me, you and me

you're clear as a heavy lead curtain
want to drill you like an ocean
we can work it out, i've been running out
now i'm running out, don't be mad about it baby
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

you and me have a disease
i want to tie you, crucify you
(you affect me, you infect me)
kneel before you, revile your body
(i'm afflicted, you're addicted)
you and me were made in heaven
(you and me have a disease)
i want to take you, i want to break you
(you affect me, you infect me)
supplicate you with thorny roses
(i'm afflicted, you're addicted)
you and me are incurable
(you and me have a disease)
i want to bathe you in holy water
(you affect me, you infect me)
i want to kill you upon the altar
(i'm afflicted, you're addicted)
you and me, you and me

father, can you hear me?
how have i let you down?
i curse the day that i was born
and all the sorrow in this world

let me take you to the herding ground
where all good men are trampled down
just to settle a bet that could not be won
between a prideful father and his son
will you guide me, now, for i can't see
a reason for the suffering and this long misery
what if every living soul could be upright and strong?
well then i do imagine

there will be sorrow
yeah, there will be sorrow
and there will be sorrow no more

when all soldiers lay their weapons down
or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves
it's easy to imagine

there will be sorrow
yeah, there will be sorrow
and there will be sorrow no more


there will be sorrow
yeah, there will be sorrow
and there will be sorrow no more
yeah, there will be sorrow
yeah, there will be sorrow
and there will be sorrow no more

hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand
your actions speak so loud, i can't hear a word you're saying
hey sister bleeding heart with all of your compassion
your labors soothe the hurt, but can't assuage temptation

hey man of science with your perfect rules of measure
can you improve this place with the data that you gather?
hey mother mercy, can your loins bear fruit forever?
is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure?

and i want to conquer the world
give all the idiots a brand new religion
put an end to poverty, uncleanliness, and toil
promote equality in all of my decisions

with a quick wink of the eye
and a "god you must be joking!"


hey mr. diplomat with your worldly aspirations
did you see your children cry when you left them at the station?
hey moral soldier, you've got righteous proclamations
and precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations

and i want to conquer the world
give all the idiots a brand new religion
put an end to poverty, uncleanliness, and toil
promote equality in all of my decisions
i want to conquer the world
expose the culprits and feed them to the children
do away with air pollution and then i'll save the whales
we'll have peace on earth and global communion

i want to conquer the world!
i want to conquer the world!
i want to conquer the world!
i want to conquer the world!

everybody needs a slogan in their pocket or two
it never hurts to have a strategy you can go to
sometimes i have no sense at all
as most flawed men are won't to do
just say fuck you
pavlovian rude
a menace too
pay homage to
your bad attitude
you can even get cerebral if you want to
make a radical assessment that sticks like glue
sometimes it takes no thought at all
the easiest thing to do
is say fuck you
pavlovian rude
a menace too
pay homage to
your bad attitude
the reaction it brings, just one of those things
your friends might not want you around
if the impulse is right you might get in a fight
even though you can't hold your ground
but all rest assured, sometimes just a word
is the most satisfying sound
sometimes it makes no sense at all
the easiest thing to do
is say fuck you
pavlovian rude
a menace to
pay homage to
your bad attitude
just say fuck you

culture was the seed of proliferation but it's gotten melded
into an inharmonic whole, to an inharmonic whole
consciousness has plagued us and we cannot shake it
though we think we're in control, though we think we're in control

questions that besiege us in life are testament
of our helplessness

there's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
when we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah

time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes but they can't
explain why it should slip away, explain why it should slip away
history and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
rooted in the present day, rooted in the present day

questions that besiege us in life are testament
of our helplessness

there's no vestige of beginning, no prospect of an end
when we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah
if you came to conquer, you'll be king for a day
but you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away

and believe these words you hear when you think your path is clear...
we have no control. we have no control
we have no control, we do not understand
you have no control, you are not in command
you have no control. we have no control
no control. no control. you have no control

a febrile shocking violent smack
and the children are hoping for a heart-attack
tonight the windows are watching, the streets all conspire
and the lamppost can't stop crying
if i could fly high above the world
would i see a bunch of living dots spell the word "stupidity?"
or would i see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides
and olly olly oxen frees who pick a side and hide?

(ah-ah-ah) the world is scratching at my door
(ah-ah-ah) my morning paper's got the scores
(ah, ah, ah) the human interest stories
and the obituary, oh yeah

cockroach naps, rattling traps
how many devils can you fit upon a match head?
caringosity killed the kerouac cat
sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

in my alley 'round the corner, there's a wino with feathered shoulders
and a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back
there's a little kid and his family eating crackers like thanksgiving
and a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living

(ah-ah-ah) the world is scratching at my door
(ah-ah-ah) my morning paper has the scores
(ah, ah, ah) the human interest stories
and the obituary, oh yeah

cradle for a cat, wolfe looks back
how many angels can you fit upon a match?
i wanna know why hemingway cracked
sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

life is the crummiest book
i ever read, there isn't a hook
just a lot of cheap shots, pictures to shock
and characters an amateur would never dream up
sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

when the world has gone mad
and there's nowhere to roam
the lights are all on
but nobody’s home
there comes a time
when you look up to the sky
and ask, "why do my favorite songs
always make me cry?"

and am i losing

my sanity? my sanity?
i've nothing to lose, so please let me be
i've got a firm grip and strong roots like a tree
burrowed deep in reality
i won’t let you go, what else can there be?
you're all i have

when you swore to be true (ooh, ooh)
our bed was belief
but alternative facts
snuck in like a thief
there comes a time
to release the cord of self
and with confidence, declare your state of
perfect mental health

never doubting

my sanity, my sanity
i've nothing to lose, so please let me be
my life is a song, a short melody
harmonizing with reality
i've got it real bad, there's no remedy
you're all i have, my dear sanity

sometimes there's no sane reason
for optimism


oh, my sanity, my sanity
i've nothing to lose, so please let me be
my life is a song, a short melody
harmonizing with reality
i’ve got it real bad, there’s no remedy
my world picture is exemplary
i won't let you go, what else can there be?
you’re all i have, my dear sanity

just to think that not so long ago
was a man who risked his life
who challenged all the lies offered as sacred truth
just to cast a brighter light

the notion that we
can live as one in perfect harmony
requires a common sensibility
to teach an intellectual capacity that i believe
is in the air, but everywhere
is the ultimate act of treason
how so few could be aware
that their nation's heart is bleeding

but oh, when the violence has begun
we decree the pen more mighty than the gun
while the fools believe as one
in this unrepentant age of unreason

just to think that not so long ago
was a man who received the seal
he peddled blatant lies and brought back tyranny
to divide his people with zeal

but we can live as one in perfect harmony
it requires a common sensibility
to teach an intellectual capacity that i believe
is in the air, but everywhere
is the ultimate act of treason
how so few could be aware
that their nation's heart is bleeding

but oh, as a child who plays for fun
with his eye up to the barrel of a gun
watchin' fools believe as one
in this unrepentant age of unreason
now that darkness has begun
we decree the pen more mighty than the gun
watch the fools believe as one
in this unrepentant age of unreason

did you ever see the concrete
stares of everyday?
the lunatic, the hypocrite
are all lost in the fray

can't you see their lives are just like yours?
an unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
the gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
the masses of humanity have always had to suffer

the businessman whose master plan
controls the world each day
is blind to indications of
his species' slow decay

can't you see his life is just like yours?
an unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
the gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
the masses of humanity have always had to suffer

people blow their minds, they choose to resign
this deformed society is part of the design
it'll never go away, it's in the cards that way
the masses of humanity have always, always had to suffer

a door leading to
the gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
the masses of humanity still clinging to their dignity
the masses of humanity will always have to suffer
always have to suffer

early man walked away
as modern man took control
their minds weren't all the same
to conquer was his goal
so he built his great empire
and he slaughtered his own kind
then he died a confused man
killed himself with his own mind (go!)

somewhere high in the desert, near a curtain of blue
saint ann's skirts are billowing
but down here in the city of limelights
the fans of santa ana are withering
and you can't deny that living is easy
if you never look behind the scenery
it's showtime for dry climes
and bedlam is dreaming of rain

when the hills of los angeles are burning
palm trees are candles in the murder wind
so many lives are on the breeze
even the stars are ill at ease
and los angeles is burning

this is not a test
of the emergency broadcast system
where malibu fires and radio towers
conspire to dance again
and i cannot believe the media mecca
they're only trying to peddle reality
catch it on prime time, story at 9
the whole world is going insane

when the hills of los angeles are burning
palm trees are candles in the murder wind
so many lives are on the breeze
even the stars are ill at ease
and los angeles is burning

a placard reads, "the end of days"
jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze
more a question than a curse
how could hell be any worse?
the flames are starting
the camera's running
so take warning


when the hills of los angeles are burning
palm trees are candles in the murder wind
so many lives are on the breeze
even the stars are ill at ease
and los angeles is burning

do what you want!

hey do what you want, but don't do it around me
idleness and dissipation breed apathy
i sit on my ass all goddamn day
a misanthropic anthropoid with nothing to

say what you must, do all you can
break all the fucking rules and
go to hell with superman and
die like a champion, yeah hey!

hey i don't know if the billions will survive
but i'll believe in god when 1 and 1 are 5
my moniker is man and i'm rotten to the core
i'll tear down the building just to pass through the door

so do what you must, do all you can
break all the fucking rules and
go to hell with superman and
die like a champion, yeah hey!

have you been to the desert? have you walked with the dead?
there's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
and the figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
but we do what we want and we think what we please
have you lived the experience? have you witnessed the plague?
people making babies sometimes just to escape
in this land of competition, the compassion is gone
yet, we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
keep pushing on

this is just a punk rock song
written for the people who can see something's wrong
like ants in a colony, we do our share
but there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
and this is just a punk rock song

have you visited the quagmire? have you swam in the shit?
the party convention and the real politik
the face is always different, the rhetoric the same
but we swallow it all and we see nothing change
nothing has changed

this is just a punk rock song
written for the people who can see something's wrong
like workers in a factory, we do our share
but there's so many other fuckin' robots out there
and this is just a punk rock song


ten million dollars on a losing campaign
twenty million starving and writhing in pain
big, strong people, unwilling to give
small in vision and perspective

one in five kids below the poverty line
one population runnin' out of time
runnin' out of time

this is just a punk rock song
written for the people who can see something's wrong
like ants in a colony, we do our share
but there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
and this is just a punk rock song
figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
but we do what we want and we think what we please
one in five kids below the poverty line
one population runnin' out of time
this is just a punk rock song
this is just a punk rock song
this is just a punk rock song

as i walk along this road paved with human kindness
i can never forget the price you've paid
i'm an actor on a role, an artificial virus
i'm your daddy, i'm your disgrace
i say kid just move along
we don't want it, don't need it
your politics just breed despair
i salute an empty flag of ancient tribalism
and trust me nobody cares

for i am your candidate
i am bloody lips and makeup (ooh-ooh)
i'm your caliphate, opioids and mutilation
a celebrity and my name is competition (ooh-ooh)
i've come to bear your pain (bear your pain)
and i can make it go away, i'll make it go away
i'll make it go away-ay-ay-ay-ay (yeah)


believers, dupes, and clowns
i want you all to gather 'round
to glorify ignorance and fear
i dispense misinformation
to a post-truth generation
my darlings, don't shed a tear

i am bloody lips and makeup (ooh-ooh)
i'm your caliphate, opioids and revelation
an hermaphrodite
in restrooms and service stations (ooh-ooh)
i truly feel your pain (feel your pain)
and i can make it go away, i'll make it go away
i'll make it go away

like a rock, like a planet
like a fucking atom bomb
i'll remain unperturbed by the joy and the madness
that i encounter everywhere i turn

i've seen it all along in books and magazines
like a twitch before dying, like a pornographic sea
there's a flower behind the window, there's an ugly laughing man
like a hummingbird in silence, like the blood on my door
it's the generator

ah! ah! ah! ah!

oh yeah, oh yeah
like the blood on my door
wash me clean and i will run
until i reach the shore

i've known it all along like the bone under my skin
like actors in a photograph, like paper in the wind
there's a hammer by the window, there's a knife on the floor
like turbines in darkness, like the blood on my door
it's the generator

ah! ah! ah! ah!

oh yeah, oh yeah
like the blood on my door
wash me clean and i will run
until i reach the shore

the full moon is rising over dark water
and the fools below are picking up sticks
and the man in the gallows lies permanently waiting
for the doctors to come back and tend to him

the flat earth society is meeting here today
singing happy little lies
and the bright ship humana is sailing far away
with grave determination and no destination

lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
lie, lie, lie
lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
lie, lie, lie

nothing feels better than a spray of clean water
and the whistling wind on a calm summer night
but you'd better believe that down in their quarters
the men are holding on for their dear lives

the flat earth society is somewhere far away
with their candlesticks and compasses
and the bright ship humana is well on its way
with grave determination and no destination


the flat earth society is meeting here today
singing happy little lies
