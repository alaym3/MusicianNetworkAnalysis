angel came down from heaven yesterday
she stayed with me
just long enough to rescue me
and she told me a story yesterday
about the sweet love between
the moon and the deep blue sea
and then she spread her wings high over me
she said she is going to come back tomorrow

and i said, "fly on, my sweet angel
fly on through the sky
fly on my sweet angel
tomorrow i'm going to be by your side"

sure enough this morning came unto me
silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
and my angel she said unto me
"today is the day for you to rise
take my hand, you are going to be my man
you are going to rise"
and then she took me high over yonder

and i said, "fly on, my sweet angel
fly on through the sky
fly on my sweet angel
forever i will be by your side"

singing about atlantis love songs
the valleys of neptune is rising, rising, rising

mercury liquid, emerald's shining
now showing me where i came from, baby
honey sun, turquoise bed he lays in
on the burning edge horizon
i'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
see the wind make love to all the ocean
tidal waves spread, and the message got home
and the message got home

singing about the valley of sunsets...
purple and gold... the armies of the lord
before ancient egypt, there were moon trips...
the valleys of neptune is arising -

look out east coast, but you're going to have a neighbor
a rebirth land, home of the praying handsâ€‹
we know there were kinds, so much older
and they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man
i see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
releasing all hell that will shake the earth from end to end

and this isn't bad news, good news, or any news
it's just the truth, better save your souls while you can
singing about the new valleys
of the sunrise... rainbow clean
the world is gonna be...
singing about getting ready for the new tide...
the valleys of neptune is arising

for fifty years they've been married
and they can't wait for their fifty-first to roll around

thirty years they've been married
and now they're old and happy and they settle down

and then you come along and talk about
so you, you say you wanna be married

ten years they've been married
a thousand kids run around hungry
'cause their mother's a louse
daddy's down at the whiskey house
that ain't all
for three years they've been married
they don't get along so good
they're tired of each other, you know how that goes
she got another lover, same old thing
so now you're seventeen
running around, hanging out, and having your fun
life for you has just begun, baby

and then you come saying
so you, you say you want to be married

ain't that some shame?
you must be losing your, weak little mind
i ain't ready yet, baby, i ain't ready

i ain't ready
i ain't ready now
let me live a little while longer

so if you're finished talking
let me get back in my groove

purple haze all in my brain
lately things don't seem the same
actin' funny, but i don't know why
'scuse me while i kiss the sky
purple haze all around
don't know if i'm comin' up or down
am i happy or in misery?
whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
help me
help me
oh, no, no
hammerin'
talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul
i'm talkin' about hard stuff
if everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
so far out my mind
something's happening, something's happening
ooo, ahhh
ooo, ahhh
ooo, ahhh
ooo, ahhh, yeah!
purple haze all in my eyes, uhh
don't know if it's day or night

is it tomorrow or just the end of time?
ooh
help me
ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah

"hey, look out for my glass up there, man
that's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright
make it a double, or eh
somebody has to sing
some body will sing?
somebody will sing, right?
i don't know"
you all pass me that bottle
and i'll sing you all a real song
yeah
let me get my key, ahem
well, i'm looking through harlem
my stomach squeal just a little more
a stagecoach full of feathers and footprints
pulls up to soap box door
now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
tied to the driver's fence
breathes in my face
bourbon and coke possessed words
"haven't i seen you somewhere in hell
or was it just an accident?"
(you know how i felt then, and so)
before i could ask "was it the east or west side?"
my feet they howled in pain
the wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
but not as deep in my mind as the rain
and as they pulled away, i could see her words
stagger and fall on my muddy tent
well i picked them up, brushed them off
to see what they say
and you wouldn't believe
"come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
and bring along the bottle and a president"

and eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
especially when your only friend
talks, sees, looks and feels like you
and you do just the same as him
(gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(got more to say)

well i'm riding through la (huh)
on a bicycle built for a fool
and i seen one of my old buddies
and he say, "you don't look the way you usually do"
i say, "well, some people look like a coin-box"
he says, "looks like you have got no coins to spare"
and i laid back and i thought to myself, and i said this
i just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
and combed this breath right out of my hair

and eh sometimes it's not so easy
especially when your only friend
talks, sees, looks and feels like you
and you do just the same as him

i just got out of a scandinavian jail
and i'm on my way straight home to you
but i feel so dizzy, i take a quick look in the mirror
to make sure my friend's here with me too
and you know good well i don't drink coffee
so you fill my cup full of sand
and the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
cherry lipstick around the broken edge
and my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
and your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
and i thought you were my friend too
man, my shadow comes in line before you

i'm finding out that it's not so easy, baby
especially when your only friend
talks, sees, looks and feels like you
and you do the same just like him

(lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah)
yeah!
(pass me that bottle over there)
yeah, yeah, okay
