'twas a dark day in dallas, november '63
a day that will live on in infamy
president kennedy was a-ridin' high
good day to be livin' and a good day to die
being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
he said, "wait a minute, boys, you know who i am?"
"of course we do, we know who you are"
then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
shot down like a dog in broad daylight
was a matter of timing and the timing was right
you got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
we're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
we'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
we've already got someone here to take your place
the day they blew out the brains of the king
thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
it happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
right there in front of everyone's eyes

pick up the pieces and lower the flags
i'm goin' to woodstock, it's the aquarian age
then i'll go over to altamont and sit near the stage
put your head out the window, let the good times roll
there's a party going on behind the grassy knoll
stack up the bricks, pour the cement
don't say dallas don't love you, mr. president
put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
try to make it to the triple underpass
blackface singer, whiteface clown
better not show your faces after the sun goes down
up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
living in a nightmare on elm street
when you're down on deep ellum, put your money in your shoe
don't ask what your country can do for you
cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
dealey plaza, make a left-hand turn
i'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
the place where faith, hope, and charity died
shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
see if you can shoot the invisible man
goodbye, charlie, goodbye, uncle sam
frankly, miss scarlett, i don't give a damn
what is the truth, and where did it go?
ask oswald and ruby, they oughta know
"shut your mouth," said a wise old owl
business is business, and it's a murder most foul

tommy, can you hear me? i'm the acid queen
i'm riding in a long, black lincoln limousine
ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
headed straight on in to the afterlife
i'm leaning to the left, i got my head in her lap
oh lord, i've been led into some kind of a trap
where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
we're right down the street, from the street where you live
they mutilated his body and they took out his brain
what more could they do? they piled on the pain
but his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
for the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
i hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
wake up, little susie, let's go for a drive
cross the trinity river, let's keep hope alive
turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
parkland hospital, only six more miles
you got me dizzy, miss lizzy, you filled me with lead
that magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
i'm just a patsy like patsy cline
never shot anyone from in front or behind
i've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
i'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
zapruder's film, i've seen that before
seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
it's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
ugliest thing that you ever have seen
they killed him once and they killed him twice
killed him like a human sacrifice
the day that they killed him, someone said to me, "son
the age of the antichrist has just only begun"
air force one comin' in through the gate
johnson sworn in at 2:38
let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
it is what it is, and it's murder most foul

i said the soul of a nation been torn away
and it's beginning to go into a slow decay
and that it's thirty-six hours past judgment day

how many roads must a man walk down
before you call him a man?
how many seas must the white dove sail
before she sleeps in the sand?
yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
before they're forever banned?

the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
the answer is blowin' in the wind

yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
'fore it is washed to the sea?
yes, and how many years can some people exist
before they're allowed to be free?
yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
and pretend that he just doesn't see?

the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
the answer is blowin' in the wind

yes, and how many times must a man look up
before he can see the sky?
yes, and how many ears must one man have
before he can hear people cry?
yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
that too many people have died?

the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
the answer is blowin' in the wind

come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
and admit that the waters around you have grown
and accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
if your time to you is worth saving
then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
for the times, they are a-changin'
come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
and keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
and don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
and there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
for the loser now will be later to win
for the times, they are a-changin'
come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
for he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
the battle outside ragin'
will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
for the times, they are a-changin'
come mothers and fathers throughout the land
and don't criticize what you can't understand
your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
your old road is rapidly aging
please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
for the times, they are a-changin'
the line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
the slow one now will later be fast
as the present now will later be past
the order is rapidly fading
and the first one now will later be last
for the times, they are a-changin'

"there must be some way out of here"
said the joker to the thief
"there's too much confusion
i can't get no relief
businessmen, they drink my wine
plowmen dig my earth
none of them along the line
know what any of it is worth"

"no reason to get excited"
the thief, he kindly spoke
"there are many here among us
who feel that life is but a joke
but you and i, we've been through that
and this is not our fate
so let us not talk falsely now
the hour is getting late"

all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too
outside, in the distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
the wind began to howl

once upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
people call, say "beware doll, you're bound to fall"
you thought they were all a-kiddin' you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hangin' out
now you don't talk so loud
now you don't seem so proud
about having to be scrounging your next meal

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be without a home?
like a complete unknown?
like a rolling stone?

aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely
but ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
and now you’re gonna have to get used to it
you say you never compromise
with the mystery tramp, but now you realize
he's not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and say, “do you want to make a deal?"

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
never understood that it ain't no good
you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
you used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
ain't it hard when you discover that
he really wasn't where it's at
after he took from you everything he could steal?

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to hang on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
exchangin' all precious gifts
but you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
when ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
you're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

how does it feel?
aw, how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

i know you haven’t made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i’ve known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

i’d go hungry, i’d go black and blue
i’d go crawling down the avenue
there’s nothing that i wouldn’t do
to make you feel my love

the storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet

i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn’t do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love

pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out, “my god, they killed them all!”

here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

three bodies lyin' there
does patty see
and another man named bello
moving around mysteriously
“i didn’t do it,” he says
and he throws up his hands
“i was only robbin' the register
i hope you understand

i saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“one of us had better call up the cops”
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene
with their red lights flashin'
in the hot new jersey night

meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that’s just the way things go
if you’re black
you might as well not show up on the street
unless you want to draw the heat

alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around
he said, “i saw two men running out
they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said, “wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men

four in the morning and they haul rubin in
they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
says, “why did you bring him in here for?
he ain't the guy!”

here’s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin’s in south america, fighting for his name
while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game
and the cops are putting the screws to him
lookin' for somebody to blame

“remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“you think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
running that night?”
“don’t forget that you are white”

arthur dexter bradley said, “i’m really not sure”
the cops said, “a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job
and we’re talking to your friend bello
now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
be a nice fellow

you’ll be doing society a favor
that son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder
on him
he ain’t no gentleman jim”

rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
"it’s my work", he’d say, "and i do it for pay
and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way"

up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man
into a mouse

all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus
he never had a chance
the judge made rubin’s witnesses
drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum

and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one
who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed

rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder “one,”
guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
to live in a land
where justice is a game

now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis
and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha
in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell

yes that’s the story of the hurricane
but it won’t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he’s done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
if'n you don't know by now
and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
it'll never do somehow
when your rooster crows at the break of dawn
look out your window and i'll be gone
you're the reason i'm a-traveling on
but don't think twice, it's all right

and it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe
the light i never knowed
and it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
i'm on the dark side of the road
but i wish there was something you would do or say
to try and make me change my mind and stay
but we never did too much talking anyway
but don't think twice, it's all right

so it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
like you never done before
and it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
i can't hear you anymore
i'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
i once loved a woman, a child, i'm told
i give her my heart but she wanted my soul
but don't think twice, it's all right

so long, honey babe
where i'm bound, i can't tell
goodbye's too good a word, babe
so i'll just say, "fare thee well"
i ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
you could've done better, but i don't mind
you just kinda wasted my precious time
but don't think twice, it's all right

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

though i know that evening's empire has returned into sand
vanished from my hand
left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
my weariness amazes me, i am branded on my feet
i have no one to meet
and my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
my senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
i'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade
into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
i promise to go under it

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
it's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
and but for the sky there are no fences facing
and if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
to your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
i wouldn't pay it any mind
it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

and take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
the haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
let me forget about today until tomorrow

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
and where have you been, my darling young one?
i’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
i’ve walked and i’ve crawled on six crooked highways
i’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
i’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
i’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

and it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
and what did you see, my darling young one?
i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
i saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
i saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
i saw a white ladder all covered with water
i saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

and what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
and what did you hear, my darling young one?
i heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
i heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
i heard one person starve, i heard many people laughing
i heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
i heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
and who did you meet, my darling young one?
i met a young child beside a dead pony
i met a white man who walked a black dog
i met a young woman, her body was burning
i met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
i met one man who was wounded in love
i met another man who was wounded in hatred

and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

and what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
and what will you do now, my darling young one?
i’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
i’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
where the people are many and their hands are all empty
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
and the executioner’s face is always well hidden
where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
where black is the color, where none is the number
and i’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
and reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
then i’ll stand on the ocean until i start sinking
but i’ll know my song well before i start singing

and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
i'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
the man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
look out kid, it's somethin' you did
god knows when, but you're doin' it again
you better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
the man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
phone's tapped anyway
maggie says the many say
they must bust in early may
orders from the d.a
look out kid, don't matter what you did
walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
look out kid, you're gonna get hit
by losers, cheaters, six-time users
hanging 'round the theaters
girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters

oh, get born, keep warm
short pants, romance
learn to dance, get dressed
get blessed, try to be a success
please her, please him, buy gifts
don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
look out kid, they keep it all hid
better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles

they're selling postcards of the hanging
they're painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
they've got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other is in his pants

and the riot squad, they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row

cinderella, she seems so easy
"it takes one to know one," she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo, he's moaning
"you belong to me, i believe"
and someone says, "you're in the wrong place, my friend
you'd better leave"

and the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row

now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortune-telling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain

and the good samaritan, he's dressing
he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row

ophelia, she's 'neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty-second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession's her religion
her sin is her lifelessness

and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah's great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row

einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
now he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet

you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row

dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they're trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she's in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
"have mercy on his soul"

they all play on the pennywhistle
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row

across the street they've nailed the curtains
they're getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
in a perfect image of a priest
they are spoon feeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they'll kill him with self-confidence
after poisoning him with words

and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"get outta here if you don't know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row"

at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene

is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row

praise be to nero's neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
everybody's shouting
"which side are you on?"
and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captain's tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers

between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row


yes, i received your letter yesterday
about the time the doorknob broke
when you asked me how i was doing
was that some kinda joke?
all these people that you mention
yes, i know them, they're quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name

right now, i can't read too good
don't send me no more letters, no
not unless you mail them
from desolation row

early one morning the sun was shining
i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said our lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and i was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue

she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam, i guess
but i used a little too much force
we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away
i heard her say over my shoulder
"we'll meet again someday
on the avenue"
tangled up in blue

i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i lucky was to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix
but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind
and i just grew
tangled up in blue

she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was just about to do the same
she was standing there, in back of my chair
said to me "tell me, don't i know your name?"
i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoe
tangled up in blue

she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"i thought you'd never say hello" she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul
from me to you
tangled up in blue

i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafes at night
and revolution in the air
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when it finally, the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keeping on
like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue

so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doing with their lives
but me, i'm still on the road
a-heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point
of view
tangled up in blue

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

mama, take this badge off of me
i can’t use it anymore
it’s getting dark, too dark to see
i feel i’m knockin' upon heaven’s door

knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

mama, put my guns in the ground
i can’t shoot them anymore
that long black cloud is coming down
i feel i’m knockin' on heaven’s door

knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

come, you masters of war
you that build the big guns
you that build the death planes
you that build all the bombs
you that hide behind walls
you that hide behind desks
i just want you to know
i can see through your masks

you that never done nothing
but build to destroy
you play with my world
like it's your little toy
you put a gun in my hand
and you hide from my eyes
and you turn and run farther
when the fast bullets fly

like judas of old
you lie and deceive
a world war can be won
you want me to believe
but i see through your eyes
and i see through your brain
like i see through the water
that runs down my drain

you fasten all the triggers
for the others to fire
then you set back and watch
while the death count gets higher
you hide in your mansion
while the young people's blood
flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud

you've thrown the worst fear
that can ever be hurled
fear to bring children
into the world
for threatening my baby
unborn and unnamed
you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins

how much do i know
to talk out of turn?
you might say that i'm young
you might say i'm unlearned
but there's one thing i know
though i'm younger than you
that even jesus would never
forgive what you do

let me ask you one question
is your money that good?
will it buy you forgiveness?
do you think that it could?
i think you will find
when your death takes its toll
all the money you made
will never buy back your soul

and i hope that you die
and your death will come soon
i will follow your casket
by the pale afternoon
and i'll watch while you're lowered
down to your deathbed
and i'll stand over your grave
'til i'm sure that you're dead

if you’re travelin' in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine

if you go when the snowflakes storm
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see if she has a coat so warm
to keep her from the howling winds

please see if her hair hangs long
if it rolls and flows all down her breast
please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
for that’s the way i remember her best

i’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
many times i’ve often prayed
in the darkness of my night
in the brightness of my day

so if you’re travelin' the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine

darkness at the break of noon
shadows even the silver spoon
the handmade blade, the child's balloon
eclipses both the sun and moon
to understand you know too soon
there is no sense in trying

pointed threats they bluff with scorn
suicide remarks are torn
from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
plays wasted words, proves to warn
that he not busy being born
is busy dying

temptation's page flies out the door
you follow, find yourself at war
watch waterfalls of pity roar
you feel to moan, but unlike before
you discover that you'd just be one more
person crying

so don't fear if you hear
a foreign sound to your ear
it's alright, ma, i'm only sighing

as some warn victory, some downfall
private reasons, great or small
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
to make all that should be killed to crawl
while others say don't hate nothing at all
except hatred

disillusioned words like bullets bark
as human gods aim for their mark
make everything from toy guns that spark
to flesh-colored christs that glow in the dark
it's easy to see without lookin' too far
that not much is really sacred

while preachers preach of evil fates
teachers teach that knowledge waits
can lead to hundred-dollar plates
goodness hides behind its gates
but even the president of the united states
sometimes must have to stand naked

and though the rules of the road have been lodged
it's only people's games that you got to dodge
and it's alright, ma, i can make it

advertising signs that con
you into thinking you're the one
that can do what's never been done
that can win what's never been won
meantime, life outside goes on
all around you

you lose yourself, you reappear
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear
alone you stand with nobody near
when a trembling distant voice, unclear
startles your sleeping ears to hear
that somebody thinks they really found you

a question in your nerves is lit
yet you know there is no answer fit
to satisfy, ensure you not to quit
to keep it in your mind and not forget
that it is not he, or she, or them, or it
that you belong to

but though the masters make the rules
for the wise men and the fools
i got nothing, ma, to live up to

for them that must obey authority
that they do not respect in any degree
who despise their jobs, their destiny
speak jealously of them that are free
do what they do just to be
nothing more than something they invest in

while some on principles baptized
to strict party platform ties
social clubs in drag disguise
outsiders they can freely criticize
tell nothing except who to idolize
and say "god bless him"

while one who sings with his tongue on fire
gargles in the rat race choir
bent out of shape from society's pliers
cares not to come up any higher
but rather get you down in the hole
that he's in

but i mean no harm, nor put fault
on anyone that lives in a vault
but it's alright, ma, if i can't please him

old lady judges watch people in pairs
limited in sex, they dare
to push fake morals, insult and stare
while money doesn't talk, it swears
obscenity, who really cares
propaganda, all is phony

while them that defend what they cannot see
with a killer's pride, security
it blows the minds most bitterly
for them that think death's honesty
won't fall upon 'em naturally
life sometimes must get lonely

my eyes collide head-on with stuffed
graveyards, false goals, i scuff
at pettiness which plays so rough
walk upside down inside handcuffs
kick my legs to crash it off
say, okay, i've had enough
what else can you show me?

and if my thought-dreams could be seen
they'd probably put my head in a guillotine
but it's alright, ma, it's life, and life only

you must leave now
take what you need, you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun

look out, the saints are coming through
and it's all over now, baby blue

the highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
take what you have gathered from coincidence
the empty handed painter from your streets
is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

the sky, too, is folding under you
and it's all over now, baby blue

all your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
your empty-handed armies are all going home
your lover who just walked out the door
has taken all his blankets from the floor

the carpet, too, is moving under you
and it's all over now, baby blue

leave your stepping stones behind
there's something that calls for you
forget the dead you've left
they will not follow you
the vagabond who's rapping at your door
is standing in the clothes that you once wore

strike another match, go start anew
and it's all over now, baby blue

ain't it just like the night to play
tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
we sit here stranded
though we're all doing our best to deny it
and louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
lights flicker from the opposite loft
in this room the heat pipes just cough
the country music station plays soft
but there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
just louise and her lover so entwined
and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind

in the empty lot where the ladies play
blindman's bluff with the key chain
and the all-night girls
they whisper of escapades out on the "d" train
we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
louise, she's all right, she's just near
she's delicate and seems like the mirror
but she just makes it all too concise and too clear
that johanna's not here
the ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
where these visions of johanna have now taken my place

now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
he brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
and when bringing her name up
he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
he's sure got a lotta gall
to be so useless and all
muttering small talk at the wall while i'm in the hall
oh, how can i explain?
it's so hard to get on
and these visions of johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
voices echo, "this is what salvation must be like after a while"
but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
you can tell by the way she smiles
see the primitive wallflower freeze
when the jelly-faced women all sneeze
hear the one with the mustache say, "jeez, i can't find my knees"
oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
but these visions of johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

the peddler now speaks
to the countess who's pretending to care for him
sayin', "name me someone that's not a parasite
and i'll go out and say a prayer for him"
but like louise always says
"you can't look at much, can you, man?"
as she, herself, prepares for him
and madonna, she still has not showed
we see this empty cage now corrode
where her cape of the stage once had flowed
the fiddler, he now steps to the road
he writes everything's been returned which was owed
on the back of the fish truck that loads
while my conscience explodes
the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
and these visions of johanna are now all that remain

you walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you, you say, "who is that man?"
you try so hard
but you don't understand
just what you will say
when you get home

because something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you raise up your head
and you ask, "is this where it is?"
and somebody points to you and says
"it's his"
and you say, "what's mine?"
and somebody else says, "well, what is?"
and you say, "oh my god, am i here all alone?"

but something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says, "how does it feel to
be such a freak?"
and you say, "impossible"
as he hands you a bone

and something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to all give a check
to tax-deductible charity organization
aw, you've been with the professors
and they've all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
you've been through all of
f. scott fitzgerald's books
you are very well read
it's well known

but something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says, "here is your throat back
thanks for the loan"

and something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

now you see this one-eyed midget
shouting the word "now"
and you say, "for what reason?"
and he says, "how?"
and you say, "what does this mean?"
and he screams back "you're a cow
give me some milk or else go home"

and you know something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there oughtta be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones

'cause something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
