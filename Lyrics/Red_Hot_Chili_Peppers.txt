psychic spies from china try to steal your mind's elation
and little girls from sweden dream of silver-screen quotation

it's understood that hollywood sells californication

marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
a teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
and buy me a star on the boulevard, it's californication
space may be the final frontier but it's made in a hollywood basement
and cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off station to station?

a scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
a candidate for my soul mate bled
mmm, push the trigger and i pull the thread

take it on the otherside
take it on, take it on

how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don't, i don't believe it's bad
a-slittin' my throat, is all i ever


turn me on, take me for a hard ride
burn me out, leave me on the otherside
i yell and tell it that it's not my friend
i tear it down, i tear it down, and then it's born again

how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don't, i don't believe it's bad
a-slittin' my throat, is all i ever had

(how long?)

when i lay it on, come get to play it on
all my life to sacrifice
hey, oh

my shadow side, so amplified, keeps coming back dissatisfied
elementary sun, but it's so—
my love affair, with everywhere, was innocent
why do you care?
someone start the car, time to go
you're the best i know

my sunny side has up and died
i'm betting that, when we collide, the universe will shift into a low
the travesties that we have seen are treating me like benzedrine
automatic laughter from a pro

my, what a good day for a walk outside
i'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
god knows that i really tried
my, what a good day for a— take out bride
i'd like to say we did it for the better of–

i saw you there so unaware, those hummingbirds all in your hair
elementary sun, but it's so—
the disrepair of norma jean could not compare to your routine
balarama beauty goin' toe to toe
my, what a good day for a— let it slide
i'd like to say we did it for the better of–

i thought about it and i brought it out
i'm motivated by the lack of doubt
i'm consecrated, but i'm not devout
the mother, the father, the daughter

right on the verge, just one more dose
i'm traveling from coast to coast
my theory isn't perfect, but it's close
(uuh-uh-uh)
i'm almost there, why should i care?
my heart is hurting when i share
someone open up, let it show

my, what a good day for a walk outside
i'd like to think we did it for the better of–
yeah!
i thought about it and i brought it out
i'm motivated by the lack of doubt
i'm consecrated, but i'm not devout

i called the teacher cause i wanted to confess it now
can i make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
she spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
i don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
i don't think it's irreversible, anymore
somebody hooted and they hollered can i buy a vowel
don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
and when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
can i put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
i don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
i don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

tell me now, i know that it just won't stop
you will find your flow when you go robot

i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots don't care where i've been
you've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin

sometimes i feel like i'm a sentimental trooper
she cried so hard, you know she looked like alice cooper
i don't think that it's so personal, anymore, anymore
i don't think it's irreversible, anymore
tell me now, i know that it just won't stop
you will find your flow when you go robot

i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots don't care where i've been
you've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin

i'm kissing high and low our bodies like two dominoes
can i come and get you when i hit you in your party clothes
let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
and now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
i don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
i don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

tell me now, i know that it just won't stop
you will find your flow when you go robot

i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots don't care where i've been
you've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin 

say goodbye to oz and everything you own
california dreamin' is a pettibon
la's screaming you're my home
vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
i could smell the prozac in your pretty hair
got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
i don't know but it's been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home
stick n move you're living in a quick world
got a heavy life for such a tiny girl
born into it that's for sure

rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
sick love is my modern cliche

people talk and tell you what you want to hear
do you really need another souvenir
superheroes tend to disappear
fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last
i don't know but it's been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home
rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
sick love is my modern cliche

openly defective is the lover you elected and
a portrait she was bound to portray 

i'm an ocean in your bedroom

not alone, i'll be there tell me when you want to go

i'll be there but tell me when you want to go
come again and tell me when you want to go
more will be revealed, my friend 

i like pleasure spiked with pain
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane
songbird sweet and sour jane
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane

pleasure spiked with pain
that motherfucker's always spiked with pain

looking in my own eyes, hey lord
i can't find the love i want
someone better slap me
before i start to rust
before i start to decompose
looking in my rear-view mirror
looking in my rear-view mirror
i can make it disappear
i can make it disappear, have no fear

i like pleasure spiked with pain
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane
songbird sweet and sour jane
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane
pleasure spiked with pain
that motherfucker's always spiked with pain

sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
i'm turning into dust again
my melancholy baby
the star of mazzy must
push her voice inside of me
i'm overcoming gravity
i'm overcoming gravity
it's easy when you're sad to be
it's easy when you're sad, sad like me

i like pleasure spiked with pain
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane
songbird sweet and sour jane
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane

pleasure spiked with pain
just one note could make me float
could make me float away
one note from the song she wrote
could fuck me where i lay
just one note could make me choke
one note, that's not a lie
just one note could cut my throat
one note could make me die

i like pleasure spiked with pain
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane
songbird sweet and sour jane
and music is my aeroplane
it's my aeroplane

pleasure spiked with pain

my aeroplane, my aeroplane...
it's my aeroplane... 

listen to the beatles and the sound of laughing ed mcmahon
we got high
educated by a world so full of self and lost in space
too much pride
cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut
soviet spy
every now and then when i remember to befriend
the little things in life

hey, you're fine i wanna listen to the radio driving down
calexico highway and now i know the signs for sure
hold my hand, i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now

later on, i'll read to you the things that i've been needing
to say goodbye
walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had
tell no lies
carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off
'fore you die
take a little breath before you catch an early death there is
so much sky
hey, you're fine, i wanna listen to the radio driving down calexico
highway and now i know the signs for sure
hold my hand, i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now

skinny brains and little stains upon your
face teenage remains tell me more
lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

hey, you're fine, i wanna listen to the radio driving down calexico
highway and now i know the signs, for sure, for sure
hold my hand, i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now
