if you like to gamble, i tell you i'm your man
you win some, lose some, it's all the same to me
the pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say
i don't share your greed, the only card i need is

the ace of spades
the ace of spades

playing for the high one, dancing with the devil
going with the flow, it's all a game to me
seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you
double up or quit, double stake or split

the ace of spades
the ace of spades

you know i'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools
but that's the way i like it baby, i don't wanna live forever
and don't forget the joker!

pushing up the ante, i know you got to see me
read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
i see it in your eyes, take one look and die
the only thing you see, you know it's gonna be

the ace of spades
the ace of spades 

i, i will be king
and you, shall be my queen
though nothing, will never drive them away
but we can beat them, forever and ever
cause we can be heroes, just for one day

and you, you are insane
and i, i am the same
cause we're lovers, and that is the truth
yes we're lovers, and we are the proof

though nothing, will keep us together
we could stop time, forever and ever
we can be heroes
what d'you say?

i, i can remember (i remember)
standing, by the wall (by the wall)
and the guns, were all ready to fire (ready to fire)
and we kissed, as though we never can fall (never can fall)

and the shame, was on another city
oh we can beat them, forever and ever
then we could be heroes, just for one day
we can be heroes, we can be heroes
we can be heroes, just for one day
we can be heroes 

only way to feel the noise
is when it's good and loud
so good i can't believe it
screaming with the crowd

don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
overkill, overkill
overkill

on your feet you feel the beat
it goes straight to your spine
shake your head, you must be dead
if it don't make you fly

don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
overkill, overkill
overkill

know your body's made to move
ya feel it in your guts
rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name
if it don't make you strut

don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you, hey
don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
overkill, overkill
overkill 

it's time to play the game
time to play the game
hahahahahaha

it's all about the game, and how you play it
all about control, and if you can take it
all about the debt, and if you can pay it
it's all about pain, and who's gonna make it
i am the game. you don't wanna play me
i am control, no way you can change me
i am heavy debt, no way you can pay me
i am the pain, and i know you can't take me

look over your shoulder, ready to run
like a good little bitch from a smoking gun
i am the game, and i make the rules
so move on out or you can die like a fool
try to figure out what my move’s gonna be
come on over sucker, why don’t you ask me?
don't you forget, there's a price you can pay
'cause i am the game, and i want to play

it's time to play the game
hahahahahahahahaha
time to play the game
it's all about the game, and how you play it
it's all about control, and if you can take it
it's all about your debt, and if you can pay it
it's all about the pain, and who's gonna make it
i am the game. you don't wanna play me
i am control, there's no way you can change me
i am your debt, they know you can't pay me
i am your pain, and i know you can't take me

you're gonna die in flames
hahahahahahaha
time to play the game

if the stars fall down on me
and the sun refused to shine
then may the shackles be undone
may all the old words cease to rhyme
if the sky turned into stone
it will matter not at all
for there is no heaven in the sky
hell does not wait for our downfall

let the voice of reason chime
let the pious vanish for all time
god's face is hidden, all unseen
you can't ask him what it all means

he was never on your side
god was never on your side
let right or wrong alone decide
god was never on your side

see ten thousand ministries
see the holy, righteous dogs
they claim to heal, but all they do is steal
abuse your faith, cheat, and rob
if god is wise, why is he still
when these false prophets call him friend?
why is he silent? is he blind?
are we abandoned in the end?
let the sword of reason shine
let us be free of prayer and shrine
god's face is hidden, turned away
he never has a word to say

he was never on your side
god was never on your side
let right or wrong alone decide
god was never on your side
no, no, no


he was never on your side
god was never on your side
never, never, never, never
never on your side
never on your side
god was never on your side
never on your side 

sunrise, wrong side of another day
sky high and six thousand miles away
don't know how long i've been awake
wound up in an amazing state
can't get enough
and you know it's the righteous stuff
goes up like prices at christmas
motörhead, remember me now
motörhead, alright
brain dead, total amnesia
get some mental anesthesia
don't move, i'll shut the door and kill the lights
i guess i'll see you all on the ice
all good clean fun
have another stick of gum
man, you look better already
motörhead, remember me now
motörhead, alright
fourth day, five day marathon
we're moving like a parallelogram
don't move, i'll shut the door and kill the lights
i guess i'll see you all on the ice
i should be tired
and all i am is wired
ain't felt this good for an hour
motörhead, remember me now
motörhead, alright
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
motörhead, remember me now
motörhead, it's only you now
motörhead, only you, babe
motörhead, yeah, yeah, yeah 

i am the one, orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand
my image is of agony, my servants rape the land
obsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vain
two thousand years of misery, of torture in my name
hypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the law
my name is called religion: sadistic, sacred whore

i twist the truth, i rule the world, my crown is called deceit
i am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet
i rob you and i slaughter you, your downfall is my gain
and still you play the sycophant and revel in your pain
and all my promises are lies, all my love is hate
i am the politician and i decide your fate


i march before a martyred world, an army for the fight
i speak of great heroic days, of victory and might
i hold a banner drenched in blood, i urge you to be brave
i lead you to your destiny, i lead you to your grave
your bones will build my palaces, your eyes will stud my crown
for i am mars, the god of war, and i will cut you down 

16 years old when i went to the war
to fight for a land fit for heroes
god on my side, and a gun in my hand
chasing my days down to zero
and i marched and i fought and i bled
and i died & i never did get any older
but i knew at the time, that a year in the line
was a long enough life for a soldier

we all volunteered
and we wrote down our names
and we added two years to our ages
eager for life and ahead of the game
ready for history's pages
and we brawled and we fought
and we whored 'til we stood
ten thousand shoulder to shoulder
a thirst for the hun
we were food for the gun
and that's what you are when you're soldiers

i heard my friend cry
and he sank to his knees, coughing blood
as he screamed for his mother
and i fell by his side
and that's how he died
clinging like kids to each other
and i lay in the mud
and the guts and the blood
and i wept as his body grew colder
and i called for my mother
and she never came
though it wasn't my fault
and i wasn't to blame
the day not half over
and ten thousand slain, and now
there's nobody remembers our names
and that's how it is for a soldier 

they say music is the food of love
let's see if you're hungry enough
take a bite, take another
just like a good boy would
get a sweet thing on the side
home cooking, homicide
side order, could be your daughter
finger licking good

come on baby, eat the rich
put the bite on the son of a bitch
don't mess up, don't you give me no switch
come on baby, and eat the rich
come on baby, and eat the rich

sitting down in a restaurant
tell the waiter just what you want
is that the meat you wanted to eat?
how would you ever know?
hash browns and bacon strips
i love the way that you lick your lips
no fooling, i can see you drooling
feel the hunger grow
come on baby, eat the rich
put the bite on the son of a bitch
don't mess up, don't you give me no switch
come on baby, and eat the rich
come on baby, and eat the rich
come on honey, here's your supper
come on baby, bite that sucker


i'll eat you, baby, you eat me
eat two, baby get one free
shetland pony, extra pepperoni
just pick up the phone
eat greek or eat chinese
eat salad or scarf up grease
you're on the shelf, you eat yourself
come on and bite my bone

come on baby, eat the rich
bite down on the son of a bitch
don't mess around, don't you give me no switch
come on baby, and eat the rich
come on baby, and eat the rich
sitting here in a hired tuxedo
you wanna see my bacon torpedo
eat it baby, eat the rich
eat it baby, eat the rich
eat it baby, eat the rich
eat it baby, eat the rich 

love me forever or not at all
end of our tether, backs to the wall
give me your hand, don't you ever ask why
promise me nothing, live 'till we die

everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no-one to blame
every way out brings you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart

we are the system, we are the law
we are corruption, worm in the core
one of another, laugh 'till you cry
faith unto death or a knife in your eye

everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no-one to blame
every way out takes you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart
oh, my lost love, come on back to me

love me or leave me, tell me no lies
ask me no questions, send me no spies
you know love's a thief, steal your heart in the night
slip through your fingers, best hold on tight

everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no-one to blame
every way out brings you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart
oh, my lost love, come on back to me 

when i was young
i was the nicest guy i knew
i thought i was the chosen one
but time went by
and i found out a thing or two
my shine wore off as time wore on

i thought that i was living
out the perfect life
but in the lonely hours
when the truth begins to bite
i thought about the times
when i turned my back and stalled
i ain't no nice guy after all

when i was young
i was the nicest guy in town
i thought i had it down for sure
but time went by
and i was lost in what i found
the reasons blurred, the way unsure

i thought that i was living
life the only way
but i saw that life was
more than day to day
i turned around
i read the writing on the wall
i ain't no nice guy after all
i ain't no nice guy after all
in all the years you spent
between your birth and death
you find there's lots of times
when you should have saved your breath
it comes as quite a shock
when that trip leads to the fall
i ain't no nice guy after all
i ain't no nice guy after all


when i was young
i was the nicest guy i knew
i thought i was the chosen one
but time went by and
i found out a thing or two
my shine wore off as time wore on

i thought that i was living
out the perfect life
but in the lonely hours
when the moon's the only light
i thought about the times
i turned my back and stalled
i ain't no nice guy after all
i ain't no nice guy after all 

show on!

if you squeeze my lizard
i'll put my snake on you
i'm a romantic adventure
and i'm a reptile too

but it don't make no difference
cause i ain't gonna be easy, easy
the only time i'm easy's when i'm
killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
someone

i'm a lone wolf ligger
but i ain't no pretty boy
i'm a backbone shiver
and i'm a bundle of joy

but it don't make no difference
cause i ain't gonna be easy, easy
the only time i'm easy's when i'm
killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
someone
killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
someone's gonna killed by death, someone
someone


killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
ahahahahahahaha
killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
ahhhhhh!

killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
(killed by a bunch of death)
killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
(shut out your mouth, shut out your mouth!)

killed by death
killed by death
killed by death
i'm dead, i'm dead, i'm dead
i'm dead, i'm dead, i'm dead
killed by death
killed by death
ahhhhhhh!

around the world for rock 'n' roll
sometimes, it feels so tough
but i still ain't had enough
i keep saying that it's getting too much
but i know i'm a liar
feeling alright in the noise and the light
but that's what lights my fire

hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
hellraiser, and i'll make it come true
hellraiser, i'll put a spell on you

walking out on another stage
another town, another place
sometimes, i don't feel right
nerves wound up too damn tight

don't you tell me
that it's bad for my health
'cause kicking back don't make it
out of control, i play the ultimate role
don't know how to fake it

on your knees dog, hahahaha
all hail

bow down to the, bow down to the king
bow down to the, bow down to

the king grinned red, as he walked from the place
where the traitor lost both his name and his face
through the halls and the corridors, stinging in blood
he tasted his grin and it tasted good
the king took his head, left him broken and dead

bow down to the, bow down to the king
bow down to the, bow down to the king
bow down to the, bow down to

the king left none living, unable to tell
the king took their heads and he sent them to hell
their screams echoed loud in the place of their death
ripped open they died with their final breath
they hailed the king, the king of kings
bow down to the, bow down to the king
bow down to the, bow down to the king
bow down to the, bow down to the king

into the dirt his will be done

firestorm coming closer
napalm to the bone

dark night nothing to see
invisible hand in front of me
scared to death there's someone near
scared to move but you can't stay here

you know me, evil eye
you know me, prepare to die
you know me, the snakebite kiss
devil's grip, the iron fist

flying horse don't make a sound
flying hooves don't touch the ground
walk in circle lose you track
can't go on but you can't go back

you know me, evil eye
you know me, prepare to die
you know me, you can't resist
devil's grip, the iron fist

moon eclipse and you know why
ghost rider in the sky
beast of evil devil's hound
tooth and claw they pull you down
you know me, evil eye
you know me, prepare to die
you know me, the great white kiss
devil's grip, the iron fist
