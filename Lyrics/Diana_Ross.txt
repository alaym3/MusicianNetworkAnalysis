there's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line

upside down

if you need me, call me
no matter where you are
no matter how far
just call my name
i'll be there in a hurry
on that you can depend and never worry
you see, my love is alive
it's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
so if you feel the need for company
please, my darling, let it be me

i may not be able to express
the depth of the love i feel for you
but a writer put it very nicely
when he was away from the one he loved
he sat down and wrote these words

no wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)
nor winter's cold
can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
if you're my goal
no wind, no rain
can stop
if you want to go

i know, i know you must follow the sun
wherever it leads
but remember
if you should fall short of your desires
remember life holds for you one guarantee
you'll always have me
and if you should miss my love
one of these old days
if you should ever miss the arms
that used to hold you so close, or the lips
that used to touch yours so tenderly
just remember what i told you
the day i set you free

ain't no mountain high enough, aah
ain't no valley low enough
ain't no river wide enough
to keep me from you
ain't no mountain high enough
ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
ain't no river wide enough
to keep me from you

ain't no mountain high enough
nothing can keep me
to keep me from you

ain't no mountain high enough
ain't no valley low enough (one more time)
ain't no river wide enough (say it again)
to keep me from you

ain't no mountain high enough
nothing can keep me
to keep me from you
nothing in this world

fancy me
thought i had my degree
in life and how love
ought to be a run
i had a one step plan to prove it
guide in my pocket for fools
folly and fun
love had to show me one thing

i was so right (so right)
so right
thought i could turn emotion
on and off
i was so sure
so sure (i was so sure)
but love taught me
who was, who was, who was the boss

i'd defy
anyone who claimed that i
didn't control
whatever moved in my soul
i could tempt
touch delight
just because you fell for me
why should i feel uptight
love had to show me one thing

i was so right (so right)
so right
thought i could turn emotion
on and off
i was so sure
so sure (i was so sure)
but love taught me
who was, who was, who was the boss

love taught me
taught me
taught me
taught me

i was so right (so right)
so right
thought i could turn emotion
on and off
i was so sure
so sure (i was so sure)
but love taught me
who was, who was, who was the boss
(taught me who was, who was the boss)

since you've been away
i've been down and lonely
since you've been away
i've been thinking of you
trying to understand the reason you left me
what were you going through?
oooh, oooh.  oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns
oooh, oooh.  oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns
oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
as i look around, i see things that remind me
just to see you smile made my heart filled with joy
i still recall all those dreams we shared together
where did you run to, boy?
oooh, oooh.  oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns.  (tell me why the road turns.)
oooh, oooh.  oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns
sometimes i wondered, i didn't understand
just where were you trying to go
only you knew the plan
and i tried to be there, but you wouldn't let me in
but now you've gone away, boy
i feel so brokenhearted.  (oh.)
i knew the day we started that we were meant to be
if only you'd let me
i've cried so many tears.  (oh.)
gotta face now all my fears.  (oh, oh.)
we let time slip away
i need you, boy, here again
there was so much you gave me to my heart, to my soul
there was so much of your dreams that were never told
you had so much hope for a brighter day
why were you my flower plucked away?
(oooh, oooh.  i'm missing you.)
tell me why the road turns.  (tell me why the road turns.)
oooh, oooh
oooh, oooh.  i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns.  (tell me why the road turns.)
tell me, tell me why.  (oooh, oooh.  i'm missing you.)
tell me why the road turns.  (tell me why the road turns.)
oh.  don't understand it.  (oooh, oooh, i'm missing you.)
oh, oh.  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  (tell me why the road turns.)
oooh, oooh.  i'm missing you
tell me why the road turns.  (tell me why the road turns.)

don't lose your way
with each passing day
you've come so far
don't throw it away
live believing
dreams are for weaving
wonders are waiting to start
live your story
faith, hope and glory
hold to the truth in your heart
if we hold on together
i know our dreams will never die
dreams see us through to forever
where clouds roll by
for you and i
souls in the wind
must learn how to bend
seek out a star
hold on to the end
valley, mountain
there is a fountain
washes our tears all away
words are swaying
someone is praying
please let us come home to stay
if we hold on together
i know our dreams will never die
dreams see us through to forever
where clouds roll by
for you and i
when we are out there in the dark
we'll dream about the sun
in the dark we'll feel the light
warm our hearts, everyone
if we hold on together
i know our dreams will never die
dreams see us through to forever
as high as souls can fly
the clouds roll by
for you and i

you took a mystery and made me want it
you got a pedestal and put me on it
you made me love you out of feeling nothing
something that you do
and i was there and not dancing with anyone
you took a little, then you took me over
you set your mark on stealing my heart away
crying, trying, anything for you
i'm in the middle of a chain reaction
you give me all the after midnight action
i wanna get you where i can let you make all that love to me
i'm on a journey for the inspiration
to anywhere and there ain't no salvation
i need you to get me nearer to you
so you can set me free
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
you make me tremble when your hand moves lower
you taste a little then you swallow slower
nature has a way of yielding treasure
pleasure made for you, oh
you gotta plan, your future is on the run
shine a light for the whole world over
you never find your love if you hide away
crying, dying, all you gotta do is
get in the middle of a chain reaction
you get a medal when you're lost in action
i wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
instant radiation
you let me hold you for the first explosion
we get a picture of our love in motion
my arms will cover, my lips will smother you
with no more left to say
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
you let me hold you for the first explosion
my arms will cover you all you gotta do
get in the middle of a chain reaction (chain reaction)
you get a medal when you're lost in action (lost in action)
don't pass me by
i wanna get your love all ready
for the sweet sensation, instant radiation
you let me hold you for the first explosion
we get a picture of our love in motion
my arms will cover, my lips will smother you
sooner or later all you gotta do is
get in the middle of a chain reaction
you get a medal when you're lost in action
i wanna get your love all ready
for the sweet sensation, instant radiation
you let me hold you for the first explosion

do you know where you're going to?
do you like the things that life is showing you?
where are you going to?
do you know?
do you get what you're hoping for?
when you look behind you, there's no open doors
what are you hoping for?
do you know?

once we were standing still in time
chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
you knew i loved you, but my spirit was free
laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

do you know where you're going to?
do you like the things that life is showing you?
where are you going to?
do you know?

now, looking back at all we've passed
we let so many dreams just slip through our hands
why must we wait so long before we see
how sad the answers to those questions can be?

do you know where you're going to?
do you like the things that life is showing you?
where are you going to?
do you know?
do you get what you're hoping for?
when you look behind you, there's no open doors
what are you hoping for?
do you know?

i wanna call the stars
down from the sky
i wanna live a day
that never dies
i wanna change the world
only for you
all the impossible

under the rain

and feel the pain

to stop my tears

i'll make you safe
no matter where you are
and bring you
everything you ask for

in a world without you
i would always hunger
all i need is your love to make me stronger
and baby
everytime you touch me
i become a hero
i'll make you safe
no matter where you are
and bring you
everything you ask for
nothing is above me
i'm shining like a candle in the dark
when you tell me that you love me
you love me
when you tell me that you love me

it's my house and i live here
(i wanna tell you)
it's my house and i live here
there's a welcome mat at the door

where my dreams await someone to share

'cause it was buillt for love

i put my name in the ceilin' above
'cause it was built for love
it was built for love
it's my house and i live here
(i wanna tell you)
it's my house and i live here

if there's a cure for this
i don't want it
i don't want it
if there's a remedy
i'll run from it
from it
think about it all the time
never let it out of my mind
'cause i love you
i've got the sweetest hangover
i don't wanna get over
the sweetest hangover
yeah, i don't wanna get over
i don't wanna get

touch me in the morning
then just walk away
we don't have tomorrow
but we had yesterday
hey, wasn't it me who said
that nothin' good's gonna last forever
and wasn't it me who said
let's just be glad for the time together
must've been hard to tell me
that you've given all you had to give
i can understand your feelin' that way
ev'rybody's got their life to live
well, i can say goodbye
in the cold morning light
but i can't watch love die
in the warmth of the night
if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight
when you're gone, till you go
i need to lie here and
think about the last time

you'll touch me in the morning
then just close the door
leave me as you found me
empty like before
hey, wasn't it yesterday
we used to laugh at the wind behind us
didn't we run away and hope
that time wouldn't try to find us
didn't we take each other
to a place where
no one's ever been
yeah, i really need you
near me tonight
'cause you'll never take me there again

let me watch you go
with the sun in my eyes
we've seen how love can grow
now we'll see how it dies
if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight
when you're gone
till you go
i need to hold you until the tie
your hands reach out and

touch me in the morning
(then just walk away)
we're blue and gold
and we could feel one another living
we walked with a dream to hold
and we could take what the world was giving
(we don't have tomorrow)
there's no tomorrow here
there's only love and the time to chase it
(but we had yesterday)
yesterday's gone my love
there's only now and it's time to face it

i remember when
i was five and you were ten, boy
you knew that i was shy
so you teased and made me cry
but i loved you
then one day you came
you told me you were leaving
you gave your folks the blame
and made me cry again
when you said

little girl
please don't wait for me
wait patiently for love
someday will surely come
ooh, little girl
please don't wait for me
wait patiently for love
someday will surely come
and i'm still waiting

i'm waiting
ooh, still waiting
i'm just a fool
ooh, i'm a fool
to keep waiting
for you
i'm waiting
ooh, still waiting
fot love
for you

then someone finally came
he told me that he loved me
i put him off with lies
he could see i had no eyes
so he left me once again alone
like a child without her playmate
i had to face the truth
i was still in love with you
but you said

little girl
please don't wait for me
wait patiently for love
someday will surely come
little girl
please don't wait for me
wait patiently for love
someday will surely come
and i'm still waiting

love has never shown his face
since the day
you walked out that door
you filled my life with empty space
come back
can't you see it's you i'm waiting for

don't you know i'm waiting
i'm waiting for love
for you
i miss you
i'm waiting
come on back, boy
come on back
come on back
come on back, boy
i need you
i want you
that's what my friends says
oh buh huh

when you look behind you, there's no open doors

what are you hopin' for? do you know?

everybody look around
'cause there's a reason to rejoice you see
everybody come out
and let's commence to singing joyfully

everybody look up
and feel the hope that we've been waiting on

everybody's glad
because our silent fear and dread is gone

freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
just look about, you owe it to yourself to check it out

can't you feel a brand new day?
can't you feel a brand new day?

everybody be glad
because the sun is shining just for us

everybody wake up
into the morning, into happiness

hello world
it's like a different way of livin' now

and thank you world

we always knew that we'd be free somehow

in harmony, and show the world that we've got liberty
it's such a change, for us to live so independently
freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
just look about, you owe it to yourself to check it out

can't you feel a brand new day?

am i really hard to please?
perhaps i have such special needs
i wondered what was wrong with me
my friends all fall so easily

but today i fell in love with someone i hardly know
did i make myself imagine that he could love me so?
'cause the feeling was so unexpected
i could hardly keep myself collected

i thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
never did believe in lovin' on sight
i thought it took time to learn about lovin'
all i know is now it's gotta be right

in the midst of conversation he looked into my eyes
and all through the conversation much to my own surprise
half the words he said to me were missin'
'cause my mind was so intend on kissin'



but today i fell in love with someone i hardly know
did i make myself imagine that he could love me so?
and the feelin' was so deep inside me
i could feel it when he brushed beside me


i'm in love, so in love today i fell in love
