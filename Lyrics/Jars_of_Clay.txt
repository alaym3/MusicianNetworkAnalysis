rain, rain on my face
it hasn't stopped raining for days
my world is a flood
slowly i become one with the mud

but if i can't swim after forty days
and my mind is crushed by the thrashing waves
lift me up so high that i cannot fall
lift me up
lift me up - when i'm falling
lift me up - i'm weak and i'm dying
lift me up - i need you to hold me
lift me up - keep me from drowning again

downpour on my soul
splashing in the ocean, i'm losing control
dark sky all around
i can't feel my feet touching the ground


calm the storms that drench my eyes
dry the streams still flowing
cast down all the waves of sin
and guilt that overthrow me

lift me up - when i'm falling
lift me up - i'm weak and i'm dying
lift me up - i need you to hold me
lift me up - keep me from drowning again 

we are one in the spirit, we are one in the lord
we are one in the spirit, we are one in the lord
and we pray that our unity may one day be restored
and they'll know we are christians by our love, by our love
yeah, they'll know we are christians by our love

we will work with each other, we will work side by side
we will work with each other, we will work side by side
and we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's pride
and they'll know we are christians by our love, by our love
yeah, they'll know we are christians by our love

our love
by our love
our love, by our love
our love, by our love
by love, by our love
by our, by our love
by love, by our love
love, our love
love 

i am the only one to blame for this
somehow it all ends up the same
soaring on the wings of selfish pride
i flew too high and like icarus i collide
with a world i try so hard to leave behind
to rid myself of all but love, to give and die
to turn away and not become
another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves
more deeply than the oceans
more abundant than the tears
of a world embracing every heartache
can i be the one to sacrifice
or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow
to love you - take my world apart
to need you - i am on my knees
to love you - take my world apart
to need you - broken on my knees
all said and done i stand alone
amongst remains of a life i should not own
it takes all i am to believe
in the mercy that covers me
did you really have to die for me
all i am for all you are
what i need and what i believe are worlds apart
and i pray
to love you - take my world apart
to need you - i am on my knees
to love you - take my world apart
to need you - broken on my knees
on my knees
i look beyond the empty cross
forgetting what my life has cost
wipe away the crimson stains
dull the nails that still remain
more and more i need you now
i owe you more each passing hour
battles between grace and pride
i gave up not so long ago
so steal my heart and take the pain
and wash the feet and cleanse my pride
take the selfish, take the weak
and all the things i cannot hide
take the beauty, take my tears
sin-soaked heart, make it yours
take my world all apart
take it now, take it now
and serve the ones that i despise
speak the words i can't deny
watch the world i used to love
fall to dust and blow away
i look beyond the empty cross
forgetting what my life has cost
wipe away the crimson stains
dull the nails that still remain
so steal my heart and take the pain
take the selfish, take the weak
and all the things i cannot hide
take the beauty, take my tears
take my world apart, take my world apart
i pray, and i pray, and i pray
take my world apart
worlds apart 

i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die, hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away

some bright morning, when this life is o'er
i'll fly away
to a land on god's celestial shore
i'll fly away

when the shadows of this life have grown
i'll fly away
like a bird from these prison walls
i'll fly, i'll fly away

and i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die, hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away

o, how glad and happy when we meet
i'll fly away
no more cold iron shackles on my feet
i'll fly away
and i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away!

just a few more weary days and then
i'll fly away
to a land where joys will never end
i'll fly away

i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die, hallelujah bye and bye
i'll, i'll fly away
i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die, hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly, i'll fly away
i'll fly away, o glory
i'll fly away
when i die, hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away
yeah, i'll fly away
i'll fly away 

in open fields of wild flowers
she breathes the air and flies away
she thanks her jesus for the daises and the roses
in no simple language
someday she'll understand the meaning of it all
he's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
as close as a heartbeat or a song on her lips
someday she'll trust him and learn how to see him
someday he'll call her and she will come running
and fall in his arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
sitting silent wearing sunday best
the sermon echoes through the walls
a great salvation through it calls to the people
who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls
he's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
as close a heartbeat or a song on our lips
someday we'll trust him and learn how to see him
someday he'll call us and we will come running
and fall in his arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
he's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
as close a heartbeat or a song on our lips
someday we'll trust him and learn how to see him
someday he'll call us and we will come running
and fall in his arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
you
you
we want to pray
it seems too easy to call you 'savior'
not close enough to call you 'god'
so as i sit and think of words i can mention
to show my devotion
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you
i want to fall in love with you (my heart beats)
i want to fall in love with you (for you)
i want to fall in love with you (my heart beats)
i want to fall in love with you (for you) 

we wandered off like children, in the woods
we let the searchers come and never find us
we tried to make a life among the trees
while your dreams collected planes and cars and cities
you slipped away from me while i was sleeping
to climb the tallest oak and see the lights
your dissatisfaction gave you questions
do you remember what the city sounded like?
do you remember what the city sounded like?
so, stay up with me don't fall asleep
we only have this moment once in our lives
the next time we'll meet under city lights
but we're here tonight so, lets make it all it was meant to be
so, i held you but the cold was from inside
i knew i couldn't keep you if i tried
but i watched as the distance spread as the shadows grew
and the longings came like wolves to devour you
so, stay up with me don't fall asleep
'cause we only have this moment once in our lives
the next time we'll meet under city lights
so, lets make it all it was meant to be 

on jordan's stormy banks i stand
and cast a wishful eye
to canaan's fair and happy land
where my possessions lie

all o'er those wide extended plains
shines one eternal day
there god, the son forever reigns
and scatters night away

i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land

no chilling wind nor poisonous breath
can reach that healthful shore
where sickness, sorrow, pain, and death
are felt and feared no more

i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
when shall i see that happy place
and be forever blessed
when shall i see my father's face
and in his bosom rest

i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land
i am bound, i am bound, i am bound for the promised land 

collapsing was much softer
still falling always hurt
only after sensing your love
for always ever burned

you justified my folly
my affluent disguise
removed revealing nothing
nothing unforgiven lies
unforgiven lies

no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do
no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way, the way that you do

to touch the rose unfearful
is to meet the thorn
and pierce the heart's emotion
and feel the emptiness no more
emptiness no more
no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do
no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do

took some time to realize i've fallen

no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do
no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way, the way that you do

no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do
yeah, no one loves me like you
no one loves me the way you do

no one loves me the way you love
no one loves me like, loves me like, loves me like you do
no one loves me like you
(repeat/fade) 

oh my god, look around this place
your fingers reach around the bone
you set the break and set the tone
flights of grace, and future falls
in present pain
all fools say, "oh my god"

oh my god, why are we so afraid?
we make it worse when we don't bleed
there is no cure for our disease
turn a phrase and rise again
or fake your death and only tell your closest friends
oh my god

oh my god, can i complain?
you take away my firm belief
and graft my soul upon your grief
weddings, boats and alibis
all drift away and a mother cries

liars and fools, sons and failures
thieves will always say
lost and found, ailing wanderers
healers always say
whores and angels, men with problems
leavers always say
broken hearted, separated
orphans always say
war creators, racial haters
preachers always say
distant fathers, fallen warriors
givers always say
pilgrim saints, lonely widows
users always say
fearful mothers, watchful doubters
saviors always say
sometimes i cannot forgive
and these days mercy cuts so deep
if the world was how it should be
maybe i could get some sleep
while i lay, i dream we're better
scales were gone and faces lighter
when we wake, we hate our brother
we still move to hurt each other
sometimes i can close my eyes
and all the fear that keeps me silent
falls below my heavy breathing
what makes me so badly bent?
we all have a chance to murder
we all feel the need for wonder
we still want to be reminded
that the pain is worth the thunder
sometimes when i lose my grip
i wonder what to make of heaven
all the times i thought to reach up
all the times i had to give up
babies underneath their beds
hospitals that cannot treat
all the wounds that money causes
all the comforts of cathedrals
all the cries of thirsty children
this is our inheritance
all the rage of watching mothers
this is our greatest offense
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god 

when i go, don't cry for me
in my father's arms i'll be
the wounds this world left on my soul
will all be healed and i'll be whole
sun and moon will be replaced
with the light of jesus' face
and i will not be ashamed
for my savior knows my name

it don't matter where you bury me
i'll be home and i'll be free
it don't matter where i lay
all my tears be washed away

gold and silver blind the eye
temporary riches lie
come and eat from heaven's store
come and drink and thirst no more

it don't matter where you bury me
i'll be home and i'll be free
it don't matter where i lay
all my tears be washed away
so weep not for me my friends
when my time below does end
for my life belongs to him
who will raise the dead again

it don't matter where you bury me
i'll be home and i'll be free
it don't matter, don't matter where i lay
all my tears be washed away

it don't matter
it don't matter
it don't matter
it don't matter 

love came down at christmas
love all lovely, love divine
love was born at christmas
stars and angels gave the sign
love came down at christmas
love all lovely, love divine
love was born at christmas
stars and angels gave the sign
love will be our token
love be yours and love be mine
love from god to all of us
love for plea and gift, a sign
love shall be our token
love be yours, love be mine
love from god to all of us
love for plea and gift, a sign
love came down at christmas
love for the ten commandments
love for the nine that crucified
love for the eight that stood at the gate
love for the seven who opened up to heaven
love for the six that never got fixed
love for the five that stayed alive
love for the four that stood at the door
love for the hebrew children
love from the little bitty baby
love came down at christmas 

just in case, i will leave my things packed
so i can run away
i cannot trust these voices
i don't have a line of prospects that can give some kind of peace
there is nothing left to cling to that can bring me sweet release

i have no fear of drowning
it's the breathing that's taking all this work

do you know what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"?
what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"

empty spaces with shadows hit by street lights
warning signs and weight of tired conversations
in the absence of a shoulder, in the abscess of a thief
on the brink of this destruction, on the eve of bittersweet

now all the demons look like prophets and i'm living out
every word they speak, (every word they speak)
every word they speak, (every word they speak)
do you know what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"?
what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"
what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"

do you know what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"?
what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"
what i mean when i say, "i don't want to be alone"
alone, alone, i don't want to be alone

i have no fear of drowning
it's the breathing that's taking all this work 

o come and mourn with me awhile
o come near to the savior’s side
o come together, let us mourn
jesus our lord is crucified

seven times he spoke
seven words of love
and all three hours his silence cried
for mercy on the souls of men
jesus our lord is crucified

(o love of god) o love of god, o sin of man (sin of man)
in this dread act your strength is tried
and victory remains with love
jesus our lord is crucified

o break, o break hard heart of mine
my weak self love and guilty pride
his pilate and his judas were
jesus our lord is crucified

(o love of god) o love of god, o sin of man (sin of man)
in this dread act your strength is tried
and victory remains with love
jesus our lord is crucified
o come and mourn with me awhile

a broken heart a fount of tears
ask and they will not be denied
a broken heart love’s cradle is
jesus our lord is crucified
jesus our lord is crucified
jesus our lord is crucified
our lord is crucified
(sin of man)

and victory remains with love
jesus our lord is crucified
(o love of god) o love of god, o sin of man (sin of man)
in this dread act your strength is tried
and victory remains with love
jesus our lord is crucified

o come and mourn with me awhile
crucified
our lord is crucified 

fare thee well
trade in all our words for tea and sympathy
wonder why we tried, for things could never be
play our heart's lament
like an unrehearsed symphony

not intend
to leave this castle full of empty rooms
our love the captive in the tower never rescued
and all the victory songs
seemed to be playing out of tune

'cause it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
and it's not the way
that it has to be

you begin
all your words fall to the floor and break like china cups
and the waitress grabs a broom and tries to sweep them up
i reach for my tea
slowly drink in
and it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
and it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy

(don't trade)
yeah
(don't trade)
(don't trade)
(don't trade)

fare thee well
the words, the bag of leaves that fill my head
i could taste the bitterness
and call the waitress instead
'cause she holds the answer
smiles and asks one teaspoon or two

'cause it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
and it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy
it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
'cause it's not the way
that it has to be
don't trade our love for tea and sympathy
yeah
no
don't trade us for tea and sympathy
(don't trade us for tea and sympathy)
don't trade us for tea and sympathy
we can work it out
don't trade us for tea and sympathy
(don't trade us for tea and sympathy)
don't trade us for tea and sympathy
we can work it out
yeah
oh
we can work it out, oh 

arms nailed down, are you telling me something?
eyes turned out, are you looking for someone?

this is the one thing, the one thing that i know
blood-stained brow, are you dying for nothing?
flesh and blood, is it so elemental?

blood-stained brow, he wasn't broken for nothing
arms nailed down, he didn't die for nothing
 

there are no streets to walk on
no maps you can rely on
faith and guts to guide you
wander 'til you find you
only raw desire
no match to give you fire
you'll have to trust your heart

they don't believe in oceans
you, you were a sailor
who burned your ship and walked on
far away you walked on
you keep turning inland
where no man is an island
it's where you're supposed to be

woah, woah
you keep heading inland
no man is an island
come on home to me

afraid of your convictions
they said the land will change you
steady your confession
your course make no corrections
when you are a stranger
hold your tongue and wager
love will set you free
until it sets you free
 x2
woah, woah
you keep heading inland
no man is an island
come on home to me

just follow your desire
leave it all, you're leaving all
just burn it in the fire

everything you once knew
and everyone that knew you
remove the shoes you came on
feel the earth you're made from
pack up all your questions
just keep heading inland
and come on home to me
yeah, come on home to me

woah, woah
you keep heading inland
no man is an island
come on home to me
woah (i will always be here by your side)
woah (i will always stand next to you)
you keep walking inland
(when the darkness hits the light)
where no man is an island
(in the space where you stand against the tide)
come on home to me
(i will always stand next to you)
just come on home to me
(woah...)
(i will always stand next to you)
come on home to me
(woah...)
(i will always be here by your side)
come on home to me 

convinced of my deception
i've always been a fool
i fear this love reaction
just like you said i would
a rose could never lie
about the love it brings
and i could never promise
to be any of those things

if i was not so weak
if i was not so cold
if i was not so scared of being broken
growing old
i would be
i would be

blessed are the shallow
depth they'll never find
seems to be some comfort
in rooms i try to hide
exposed beyond the shadows
you take the cup from me
your dirt removes my blindness
your pain becomes my peace
if i was not so weak
if i was not so cold
if i was not so scared of being broken
growing old
i would be
i would be

i would be
i would be
frail 

i built another temple to a stranger
i gave away my heart to the rushing wind
i set my course to run right into danger
sought the company of fools instead of friends

you know i've been unfaithful
with lovers in lines
while you're turning over tables
with the rage of a jealous kind
i chose the gallows to the aisle
thought that love would never find
hanging ropes will never keep you
and your love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind

tryin' to jump away from rock that keeps on spreading
for solace in the shift of the sinking sand
i'd rather feel the pain all too familiar
than be broken by a lover i don't understand
'cause i don't understand

you know i've been unfaithful
with lovers in lines
while you're turning over tables
with the rage of a jealous kind
i chose the gallows to the aisle
thought that love would never find
hanging ropes will never keep you
and your love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind, yeah
love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind
one hundred other lovers, more, one hundred other altars
if i should slow my pace and finally subject me to grace
and love that shames the wise, betrays the heart's deceit and lies
and breaks the back of foolish pride

you know i've been unfaithful
with lovers in lines
while you're turning over tables
with the rage of a jealous kind
i chose the gallows to the aisle
thought that love would never find
hanging ropes will never keep you
and your love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind, yeah
love of a jealous kind
love of a jealous kind 

empty again
sunken down so far
so scared to fall
i might not get up again
so i lay at your feet
all my brokenness
i carry all of my burdens to you

all of these things
held up in vain
no reason or rhyme
just the scars that remain
of all of these things
i'm so much afraid
scared out of my mind
by the demons i've made
sweet jesus, you never ever let me go
oh, sweet jesus, never ever let me go

so happy to love
yet so far to go
you lead me on to where i've never been before
all of these things
i've held up in vain
no reason no rhyme
just the scars that remain
of all of these things
i'm so much afraid
scared out of my mind
by the demons i've made
sweet jesus, you never ever let me go
oh, sweet jesus, never let me go
no, no, no no, no, sweet jesus, you never let me go 

don't try to reach me, i'm already dead
the pain when it grips me, for things that i've done
well, i try to make you proud
but for crying out loud
just give me a chance to hide away
exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?
fearful tears are running down
the pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
don't take my heart away from me
and they think i fell down again
daddy, don't you love me
then why do you hit me
and momma don't you love me
then why do you hurt me
well, i try to make you proud
but for crying out loud
just give me a chance to hide away
exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?
fearful tears are running down
the pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
don't take my heart away from me
and they think i fell down again
fearful tears are running down
the pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
don't take my heart away from me
and they think i fell down
a teardrop falls from up in the heavens
drowning the sorrow of angels on high
for the least of the helpless, the hopeless, the loveless
your jesus, his children, he holds in his arms
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
he loves you, he sees you
he knows you, protects you
he needs you, he holds you
