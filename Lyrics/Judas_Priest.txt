faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
rides the metal monster, breathing smoke and fire
closing in with vengeance soaring high

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller

planets devastated, mankind's on its knees
a saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel
evil's going under deadly wheels

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
oh!

faster than a laser bullet
louder than an atom bomb
chromium plated boiling metal
brighter than a thousand suns


flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave
nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave
with mankind resurrected, forever to survive
returns from armageddon to the skies

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
wings of steel painkiller
deadly wheels painkiller
ah!


he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
pain! pain! killer! killer!
pain! pain! killer! killer!


can't stop the painkiller!
pain!

up here in space, i’m looking down on you
my lasers trace everything you do
you think you’ve private lives, think nothing of the kind
there is no true escape, i’m watching all the time

i’m made of metal
my circuits gleam
i am perpetual
i keep the country clean

i’m elected electric spy
i’m protected electric eye

always in focus, you can’t feel my stare
i zoom into you, but you don’t know i’m there
i take a pride in probing all your secret moves
my tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

i’m made of metal
my circuits gleam
i am perpetual
i keep the country clean

i’m elected electric spy
i’m protected electric eye


electric eye, in the sky
feel my stare, always there
there’s nothing you can do about it
develop and expose
i feed upon your every thought
and so my power grows

i’m made of metal
my circuits gleam
i am perpetual
i keep the country clean

i’m elected electric spy
i’m protected electric eye
i'm elected electric spy
i'm elected, protected, detective, electric eye

he had enough, he couldn't take anymore
he found a place in his mind and slammed the door
no matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
they washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

yeah, i've left the world behind
i am safe here in my mind
i'm free to speak with my own kind
this is my life, this is my life, i'll decide not you

withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space
no sign of life would flicker on his face
until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride
the wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died

yeah, i've left the world behind
i am safe here in my mind
i'm free to speak with my own kind
this is my life, this is my life, i'll decide not you

keep the world with all its sin
it's not fit for living in
yeah! i will start again
it can take forever and ever and ever and ever
but i shall win


how many like him are there still?
but to us, all seem to have lost the will
they lie in thousands, plagued and lost
is nothing worth this bitter cost?

yeah, i've left the world behind
i am safe here in my mind
i'm free to speak with my own kind
this is my life, this is my life, i'll decide not you

keep the world with all its sin
it's not fit for living in


beyond the realms of death

whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
the liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
don't you know you're driving me insane?
you're tryin' to find your way through life
you're tryin' to get some new direction
another woman's got her man
but she won't find no new connection

takes another drink or two
things look better when she's through

take another look around, you're not going anywhere
you've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
you're tryin' to find your way again
you're tryin' to get some new
another woman's got her man
but she won't get a new

takes another drink or two
things look better when she's through

you've been foolin' with some hot guy
i want to know why is it why
get up, get out, you know you really blew it
i've had enough, i've had enough, good god, pluck me


once she was wonderful
once she was fine
once she was beautiful
once she was mine, she was mine
change has come over her body
she doesn't see me anymore
now change has come over her body
she doesn't see me anymore

changes
changes
changes
changes
victim of changes


no, no, no
no

standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
took us by the hands and up we go

we followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
he could control our sense of time
we thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
everyone was in peace of mind

we felt the sensations drift inside our frames
finding complete contentment there
and all the tensions that hurt us in the past
just seemed to vanish in thin air

he said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
that is vibrating constantly
and if we could grip and hold on to the note
we would see our minds were free, oh they're free

we are lost above
floating way up high
if you think you can find a way
you can surely try

living after midnight
rocking to the dawn
loving till the morning
then i'm gone, i'm gone

i took the city 'bout one a.m, loaded, loaded
i'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
i come alive in the neon light
that's when i make my moves right

living after midnight
rocking to the dawn
loving till the morning
then i'm gone, i'm gone

got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
my pulse is racing, i'm hot to take
this motor's revved up, fit to break

living after midnight
rocking to the dawn
loving till the morning
then i'm gone, i'm gone

i'm aiming for you
i'm gonna floor you
my body's coming
all night long

the air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
i'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
i set my sights and then home in
the joint starts flying when i begin

living after midnight
rocking to the dawn
loving till the morning
then i'm gone, i'm gone
living after midnight
rocking to the dawn
loving till the morning

you won't hear me, but you'll feel me
without warning, something's dawning, listen
then within your senses
you'll know you're defenseless
how your heart beats when you run for cover
you can't retreat, i spy like no other
then we'll race together
we can ride forever
wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
changing gear i pull you tighter to me

i'm your turbo lover
tell me there's no other
i'm your turbo lover
better run for cover

we hold each other closer
as we shift to overdrive
and everything goes rushing by
with every nerve alive
we move so fast it seems as though
we've taken to the sky
love machines in harmony
we hear the engines cry

i'm your turbo lover
tell me there's no other
i'm your turbo lover
better run for cover


on and on we're charging
to the place so many seek
in perfect synchronicity
of which so many speak
we feel so close to heaven
in this roaring heavy load
and then in sheer abandonment
we shatter and explode

i'm your turbo lover
tell me there's no other
i'm your turbo lover
better run for cover
i'm your turbo lover
tell me there's no other
i'm your turbo lover
better run for cover

i'll bring you the head of the demon
i'm peeling the skin from his face
the life that you lead is inhuman
its cause and effects a disgrace

you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike (strike, strike)
lightning to strike

twisted dreams that are born from delusion
the collusion of fear and torment
decimating to stem this contusion
with a power-mad freaking intent

you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell

walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike (strike, strike)
lightning to strike

i'll spin the world around reeling
i have to when mankind's at stake
i might be left broken and bleeding
for it's all in the fight that we make


you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell

walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike (strike, strike)
lightning to strike

lightning will strike!

howling winds keep screaming around
and the rain comes pouring down
doors are locked and bolted now
as the thing crawls into town

straight out of hell
one of a kind
stalking his victim
don't look behind you

night crawler
beware the beast in black
night crawler
you know he's coming back
night crawler

sanctuary is being sought
whispered prayers our last resort
homing in its cry distorts
terror struck they know they're caught

straight out of hell
one of a kind
stalking his victim
don't look behind you

night crawler
beware the beast in black
night crawler
you know he's coming back
night crawler


as night is falling
the end is drawing near
they'll hear
their last rites echo on the wind

huddled in the cellar
fear caught in their eyes
daring not to move or breathe
as the creature cries
fingernails start scratching
on the outside wall
clawing at the windows
come to me it calls
atmosphere's electric
as it now descends the stairs
hiding in the darkness
is so futile from its glare
death comes in an instant
as they hoped it would
souls ascend to heaven
while it feasts on flesh and blood

straight out of hell
one of a kind
stalking his victim
don't look behind you

night crawler
beware the beast in black
night crawler
you know he's coming back
night crawler

he's going to get you
he's going to get you
beware of the beast
night crawler
beware of the beast
he's going to get you
night crawler
straight out of hell
beware of the beast
he's going to get you

with weapons drawn we claim the future
invincible through every storm
bring in the foe to be defeated
to pulverize from dusk till dawn

firepower
petrifies
firepower

the die is cast, make no exceptions
we're forged by evil to compel
come rally round this lack of freedom
our union thrives, so go to hell

firepower
taking lives
firepower
neutralize

empty the chamber
lock and reload
this world thrives on danger
it's bound to explode

aim for the target
with laser red lights
releasing the trigger
puts victory in sight

no time to pray or ask forgiveness
those blessed souls are now deceased
there is no sense in this contrition
with open arms we fight for peace

we fight with firepower
petrifies
firepower
between the eyes
firepower
mortifies
firepower
man's demise

i'm laying awake at nights
i can't get you out of my mind
all i can hear is my heartbeat
and the voice in the dark of some kind

where are you now?
the fears are coming back to me once again
oh, i wish you were here
taking good care of me
i want you
i feel as though i'm out in the cold

out in the cold
hear me calling, cold
out in the cold

i know it was you i hurt, i didn't mean to hurt you
so much to forgive and forget
can't take anymore of this hurt (oh no, oh no)
there's so many things i regret

where are you now?
the fears are coming back to me once again
oh, i wish you were here
taking good care of me
i want you
i feel as though i'm out in the cold

angel, put sad wings around me now
protect me from this world of sin
so that we can rise again

oh angel, we can find our way somehow
escaping from the world we're in
to a place where we began

and i know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
angel won't you set me free

angel remember how we'd chase the sun
then reaching for the stars at night
as our lives had just begun

when i close my eyes, i hear your velvet wings and cry
i'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
angel shine your light on me

angel we'll meet once more, i'll pray
when all my sins are washed away
hold me inside your wings and stay
oh, angel take me far away

put sad wings around me now
angel take me far away
put sad wings around me now
so that we can rise again
put sad wings around me now
angel take me far away
put sad wings around me now
so that we can rise again

hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
fill your brain with orders and that's not right
they're playing out a game that draws you closer
till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
always taking, baby, but that's okay
what they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me
told you once, you're never gonna win the race
same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

we are screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is a manacled place
screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is defiled in disgrace

tie a blindfold all around your head
spin you round in the torture before the dread
and then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
then they lead you out into the final slaughter
as the sweat is running down your neck
all you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
got to fight the horror of this mental load

we are screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is a manacled place
screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is defiled in disgrace


so you wait it out and bide your time
rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
everyone who wins in the great escape
leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
i don't talk about it, but that's all right
table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
if it takes forever, then i tell you i can wait
send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

we are screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is a manacled place
screaming, screaming for vengeance
the world is defiled in disgrace

screaming, screaming vengeance
screaming, vengeance, screaming

you know that life isn't set
i lead the pack i ain't no pretender
you give as good as you get
we live and die cause there's no surrender

chasing a dream as i go higher
playing it mean, my heart's on fire
living my life, ain't no pretender
ready to fight with no surrender

you know the way that i feel
if you're with me you better hold on tighter
i'm only keeping it real
that's who i am, i'm just a non-stop fighter

chasing a dream as i go higher
playing it mean, my heart's on fire
living my life, ain't no pretender
ready to fight with no surrender

run out of road
the end of the days
not for the weak
only the brave


chasing a dream as i go higher
playing it mean, my heart's on fire
living my life, ain't no pretender
ready to fight with no surrender

i'm chasing a dream as i go higher
you know i'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
i'm living my life, ain't no pretender
ready to fight with no surrender

fast and furious, we ride the universe
to carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
we accelerate, no time to hesitate
this load will detonate, whoever would contend its right

born to lead at breakneck speed
with high octane we're spitting flames

freewheel burning
freewheel burning

on we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
we don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
we blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere

born to lead at breakneck speed
with high octane we're spitting flames

freewheel burning
freewheel burning

look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede

you mesmerize slowly
till i can't believe my eyes
ecstasy controls me
what you give just serves me right
without warning you're here
like magic you appear
i taste the fear

i'm so afraid
but i still feed the flame

in the night
come to me
you know i want your touch of evil
in the night
please set me free
i can't resist a touch of evil

aroused with desire
you put me in a trance
a vision of fire
i never had a chance
a dark angel of sin
preying deep from within
come take me in

i'm so afraid
but i still feed the flame

in the night
come to me
you know i want your touch of evil
in the night
please set me free
i can't resist a touch of evil


arousing me now
with a sense of desire
possessing my soul
until my body's on fire
a dark angel of sin
preying deep from within
come take me in
you're possessing me

i can't resist a touch of evil

touch of evil
touch of evil
touch of evil
touch

deadly as the viper peering from its coil
the poison there is coming to the boil
ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
on the verge of snapping if it's caught

and all the pressure that's been building up
for all the years it bore the load
the cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
it's ready to explode
jawbreaker

crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
every ounce of fiber on alert

and all the pressure that's been building up
for all the years it bore the load
the cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
it's ready to explode
jawbreaker

and all the pressure that's been building up
for all the years it bore the load
the cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
it's ready to explode
jawbreaker

jawbreaker
jawbreaker
jawbreaker

i made a spike about nine o'clock on a saturday
all eyes hit me as i walked into the bar
and seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
a couple cards played rough stuff, new york, fire island
i cased the joint, straining at the scenes

i moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
i snapped the smile off his face and scowled "give me a bourbon"
the mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
all the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
the scene screwed me up, i saw some contact
then the big boys saw me and knew that

i'd had too much, floating around
statues alive, seconds are hours


sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
i was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
i guess i dream in pictures, not colours
the true free expression i demand is human rights, right
i gave my life, i am immortal

i'm going, no loss
i'm going, no loss
i'm going, no loss
i'm going, no loss

nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming
raw deal
