don't tell me not to live
just sit and putter
life's candy and the sun's
a ball of butter
don't bring around a cloud
to rain on my parade
don't tell me not to fly
i've simply got to
if someone takes a spill
it's me and not you
who told you you're allowed
to rain on my parade?!
i'll march my band out
i'll beat my drum
and if i'm fanned out
your turn at bat, sir
at least i didn't fake it
hat, sir, i guess i didn't make it!
but whether i'm the rose
of sheer perfection
a freckle on the nose
of life's complexion
the cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
i gotta fly once
i gotta try once
only can die once, right, sir?
ooh, life is juicy
juicy, and you see
i gotta have my bite, sir!
get ready for me, love
'cause i'm a "comer"
i simply gotta march
my heart's a drummer
don't bring around a cloud
to rain on my parade!
i'm gonna live and live now
get what i want--i know how
one roll for the whole shebang
one throw, that bell will go clang
eye on the target--and wham--
one shot, one gun shot, and bam!
hey, mister arnstein, here i am!
i'll march my band out
i will beat my drum
and if i'm fanned out
your turn at bat, sir
at least i didn't fake it, hat, sir
i guess i didn't make it
get ready for me, love
'cause i'm a "comer,"
i simply gotta march
my heart's a drummer
nobody, no, nobody
is gonna rain on my parade!

memories
light the corners of my mind
misty water-colored memories
of the way we were

scattered pictures
of the smiles we left behind
smiles we gave to one another
for the way we were

can it be that
it was all so simple then?
or has time re-written every line?
if we had the chance to do it all again
tell me, would we?
could we?

memories
may be beautiful and yet
what's too painful to remember
we simply choose to forget

so it's the laughter
we will remember
whenever we remember
the way we were
the way we were
hmmmmm hmmmmm

some day my prince will come
some day i'll find my love
and how thrilling that moment will be
when the prince of my dreams comes to me
he'll whisper "i love you"
and steal a kiss or two
though he's far away
i'll find my love some day
some day when my dreams come true
some day i'll find my love
someone to call my own
and i'll know him the moment we meet
for my heart will start skipping a beat
some day we'll say i do
things we've been longing to
though he's far away i'll find my love some day
some day when my dreams come true
somewhere waiting for me
there is someone i'm longing to see
someone i simply can't help but adore
someone who'll thrill me forever
someday my prince will come
someday i will find the one
though he's far away
he'll find my love someday
someday when my dreams come true
oh please make my dreams come true

life is a moment in space
when the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
i kissed the morning goodbye
but down inside you know we never know why
the road is narrow and long
when eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
i turn away from the wall
i stumble and fall but i give you it all

i am a woman in love and i'd do anything
to get you into my world and hold you within
it's a right i defend
over and over again
what do i do?

with you eternally mine
in love there is no measure of time
we planned it all at the start
that you and i live in each other's heart
we may be oceans away
you feel my love, i hear what you say
no truth is ever a lie
i stumble and fall but i give you it all

i am a woman in love and i'd do anything
to get you into my world and hold you within
it's a right i defend
over and over again
what do i do?

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
i am a woman in love and i'm talking to you
you know i know how you feel
what a woman can do
it's a right i defend
over and over again

i am a woman in love and i'd do anything
to get you into my world and hold you within
it's a right i defend
over and over again

oh my man i love him so, he'll never know
all my life is just despair but i don't care
when he takes me in his arms
the world is bright, alright
what's the difference if i say "i'll go away"
when i know i'll come back on my knees someday
for whatever my man is, i am his
forever more
it cost me a lot but that's one thing that i've got
it's my man
cold and wet tired you bet
but all that i soon forget, with my man
he's not much for looks
and no hero out of books, he's my man
two or three girls has he
that he likes as well as me but i love him
oh my man i love him so, he'll never know
all my life is just despair but i don't care
when he takes me in his arms
the world is bright, alright
what's the difference if i say "i'll go away"
when i know i'll come back on my knees someday
for whatever my man is, i am his
forever more

i got 36 expressions!

why can't you just tell me the truth?
hard to believe the things you say
why can’t you feel the tears i cry today?
cried today, cried today
how do you win if we all lose?
you change the facts to justify
your lips move but your words get in the way
in the way, in the way

kings and queens, crooks and thieves
you don't see the forest for the trees
hand and heart, on our knees
you can't see what we all see

how do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
all that we built has come undone
how do you sleep when the world is burning?
everyone answers to someone

don’t lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

you can build towers of bronze and gold
you can paint castles in the sky
you can use smoke and mirrors, old clichés
not today, not today

kings and queens, crooks and thieves
you don't see the forest for the trees
hand on heart, down on knees
you can't see what everyone sees

how do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
all that we built has come undone

everyone answers to someone

don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
don’t lie to me, don’t lie to me, you lie to me

can't you see i’m crying?
can't you see we're crying?
where's the new horizon?
where’s the new horizon?

how do you sleep?
how do you sleep?
how do you sleep?
how do you sleep?
(how do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
all that we built has come undone)
enough is enough
how do you sleep?
(how do you sleep when the world is burning?
everyone answers to someone)

don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

midnight not a sound from the pavement
has the moon lost her memory?
she is smiling alone
in the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
and the wind begins to moan
memory, all alone in the moonlight
i can dream of the old days
life was beautiful then
i remember the time i knew what happiness was
let the memory live again
every streetlamp seems to beat
a fatalistic warning
someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
and soon
it will be morning
daylight
i must wait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin
(music interlude)
burnt out ends of smoky days
the stale cold smell of morning
a streetlamp dies; another night is over
another day is dawning...
touch me!
it's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun...
if you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
look, a new day has begun

shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
out on the street anybody you meet
got a heartache of their own (it oughta be illegal)
make it a crime to be lonely or sad (it oughta be illegal)
you got a reason for livin'
you battle on with the love you're livin' on
you gotta be mine
we take it away
it's got to be night and day
just a matter of time

and we got nothing to be guilty of
our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
and we never let it end
we are devotion
and we got nothing to be sorry for
our love is one in a million
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
i don't wanna hear your goodbye

pulses racing, darling
how grand we are
little by little we meet in the middle
there's danger in the dark (it oughta be illegal)
make it a crime to be out in the cold (it oughta be illegal)
you got a reason for livin'
you battle on with the love you're buildin' on
you gotta be mine
we take it away
it's gotta be night and day
just a matter of time

and we got nothing to be guilty of
our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
and we never let it end
we are devotion
and we got nothing to be sorry for
our love is one in a million
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
i don't wanna hear your goodbye

don't wanna hear your goodbye
i don't wanna hear your

and we got nothing
and we got nothing to be guilty of
our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
and we never let it end
we are devotion
and we got nothing to be sorry for
our love is one in a million
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
i don't wanna hear your goodbye
and we got nothing to be guilty of
our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
and we never let it end

it's funny how from simple things
the best things begin
(this time is different) la la la la
(it's all because of you) la la la la
(it's better than it's ever been)
('cause) ((we can talk it through))
my favorite line
was "can i call you sometime?"
it's all you had to say
to ((take my breath away))

((this is it))
((oh, i finally found someone))
((someone to share my life))
((i finally found the one))
((to be with every night))
'cause whatever i do (it's just got to be you)
((my life has just begun, i finally found someone))
ooooh, someone
(i finally found someone)
ooooh

(did i keep you waiting?) i didn't mind
(i apologize) baby, that's fine
(i would wait forever)
((just to know you were mine))
(you know, i love your hair) are you sure it looks right?
(i love what you wear) isn't it too tight?
(you're exceptional)
((i can't wait for the rest of my life))

((this is it))
((ohhhhh, i finally found someone))
((someone to share my life))
((i finally found the one))
((to be with every night))
'cause whatever i do (it's just got to be you, oh yeah)

"honey, you're a funny girl."
that's me
i just keep them in stitches
doubled in half
and though i may be all wrong for a guy
i'm good for a laugh
i guess it's not funny
life is far from sunny
when the laugh is over
and the joke's on you
a girl oughta have a sense of humor
that's one thing you really need for sure
when you're a funny girl
the fella said "a funny girl"
funny
how it ain't so funny
funny girl

love soft as an easy chair
love fresh as the morning air
one love that is shared by two
i have found with you

like a rose under the april snow
i was always certain love would grow
love ageless and evergreen
seldom seen by two

you and i will make each night a first
(every day a new beginning)
every day a beginning
(darling, do you know you make my spirits rise)
spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
they warm and excite us
'cause we have the brightest love

two lights that shine as one
as one
morning glory and midnight sun
time we've learned to sail above
time won't change the meaning of one love
ageless and ever evergreen, evergreen

people, people who need people
are the luckiest people in the world
we're children, needing other children
and yet letting our grown-up pride
hide all the need inside
acting more like children, than children

lovers are very special people
they're the luckiest people in the world

with one person (one person)
one very special person (one very special person)
a feeling deep in your soul
says you were half, now you're whole

no more hunger and thirst
first be a person who needs people
people who need people
are the luckiest people in the world

no more hunger and thirst (hunger and thirst)
first be a person who needs people (people need people)
people who need people (people who need people)
are the luckiest people in the world

people who need people in the world (people who need people who need people)
send them your love
people who need people in the world (people who need people)
send them your love (oh those people, people who need people)
people who need people in the world (send them your love)
people who need people (people who need people)
send them your love

who is also in heaven
may the light
of this flickering candle
illuminate the night the way
your spirit illuminates my soul
papa, can you hear me?
papa, can you see me?
papa, can you find me in the night?
papa, are you near me?
papa, can you hear me?
papa,can you help me not be
frightened?
looking at the skies
i seem to see a million eyes
which ones are yours?
where are you now that yesterday
has waved goodbye
and closed its doors?
the night is so much darker
the wind is so much colder
the world i see is so much bigger
now that i'm alone
papa, please forgive me
try to understand me
papa, don't you know i had no choice?
can you hear me praying
anything i'm saying
even though the night is filled
with voices?
i remember ev'rything you taught me
ev'ry book i've ever read
can all the words in all the books
help me to face what lies ahead?
the trees are so much taller
and i feel so much smaller
the moon is twice as lonely
and the stars are half as bright
papa, how i love you
papa, how i need you
papa, how i miss you
kissing me goodnight

you are woman, i am man
you are smaller, so i can be taller than
you are softer to the touch
it's a feeling i like feeling very much
you are someone
i admire
still our friendship leaves something to be desired
doesn't take more explanation than this
you are woman, i am man
let's kiss
isn't this the height of nonchalance?
furnishing a bed in restaurants
well a bit of dinner hurt- but guess who is gonna be dessert?
do good girls do just what momma says' when mommas not around?
it's a feeling... oy vey' what a feeling!
a bit of patế?
ahh... i drink it all day
should i do the things he'll tell me to?
in this pickle, what would sadie do?
in my soul i feel an inner lack
just suppose he wants his dinner back?
just some dried up toast in a sliver
on the top a' a little chopped liver' oh
hmm' hmm'
how many girls become a sinner, while
waiting for a roast beef dinner? oh
most girls slip in ordinary ways
i got style i do it bordelaise
well at least you think i'm special

what a feast to go on such pearl'
would a convent take a jewish girl?

oh... there's some thrills and chills goin' through me
if i stop him now' will he sue me?
you are woman
you are man
let's'

if i could
i'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes
give you courage in a world of compromise
yes, i would
if i could
i would teach you all the things i've never learned
and i'd help you cross the bridges that i've burned
yes, i would
if i could
i would try to shield your innocence from time
but the part of life i gave you isn't mine
i've watched you grow
so i could let you go
if i could
i would help you make it through the hungry years
but i know that i can never cry your tears
but i would
if i could
if i live
in a time and place where you don't want to be
you don't have to walk along this road with me
my yesterday
won't have to be your way
if i knew
i'd have tried to change the world i brought to you to
and there isn't very much that i can do
but i would
if i could
if i could
i would try to shield your innocence from time
but the part of life i gave you isn't mine
i've watched you grow
so i could let you go
if i could
i would help you make it through the hungry years
but i know that i can never cry your tears
but i would
if i could
yes i would
yes i would
if i could

verse:
tell me where
where is it written
what it is i'm meant to be?
that i can't dare...
it all began the day i found
that from my window
i could only see
a piece of sky
i stepped outside and looked around
i never dreamed it was so wide
or even half as high
the time had come
(papa, can you hear me?)
to try my wings
(papa, are you near me?)
and even thought it seemed at any moment i could fall
i felt the most
(papa, can you see me?)
amazing things
(can you understand me?)
the things you can't imagine
if you've never flown at all
though it's safer to stay on the ground
sometimes where danger lies
there the sweetest of pleasures are found
no matter where i go-
there'll be mem'ries that tug at my sleeve
but there will also be
more to question yet more to believe
(oh tell me where-
where is the someone who will turn to look at me
and want to sahre
my ev'ry sweet-imagined possibility?)
the more i live - the more i learn
the more i learn - the more i realize
the less i know
each step i take-
(papa, i've a voice now!)
each page i turn-
(papa, i've a choice now!)
each mile i travel only means
the more i have to go
what's wrong with wanting more?
if you can fly - then soar!
with all there is - why settle for
just a piece of sky?
papa, i can hear you...
papa, i can see you...
papa, i can feel you...
papa, watch me fly!

there was a time when we were down and out
there was a place when we were starting over
we let the bound break
we let the heartache in
who's sorry now?
there was a world when we were standing still
and for a moment we were separated
and then you found her
you let the stranger in
who's sorry now?
who's sorry now?
what, what kind of fool
tears it apart
leaving me pain and sorrow?
losing you now
wonderin' why
where will i be tomorrow?
forever more that's what we are to be
without each other
we'll be remembering when
there was a time when we were down and out
we cried...
there was a place when we were starting over
we lied...
we let the bound break
we let the heartache in
who's sorry now?
who's sorry now?
what, what kind of fool
tears it apart
leaving me pain and sorrow?
oh, losing you now
how can i win?
where will i be tomorrow?
was there a moment when i cut you down?
played around?
what have i done?
i only apologize
for being, as they say, the last to know
it has to show
when someone is in your eyes
what kind of fool
tears it apart
leaving me pain and sorrow?
losing you now
wondering why
where will i be tomorrow?
what, what kind of fool
tears it apart
leaving me pain and sorrow?
losing you now
how can i win
where will i be tomorrow?
