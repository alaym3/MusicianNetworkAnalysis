"look, i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
"but i'm only going to get this one chance" (six minutes— six minutes—)
"something's wrong, i can feel it" (six minutes, slim shady, you're on!)
"just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen, but i don't know what. 
if that means what i think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
and if he is as bananas as you say, i'm not taking any chances"
"you are just what the doc ordered"

i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half-cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat, packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
and at the exact same time, i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic, i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow? all i do is drop f-bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like ι have got

well, to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew!)
mcs get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
now i lead a new school full of students
me? i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz, 2pac, n.w.a, cube, hey doc, ren
yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
to meet run–d.m.c., induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game, 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
little gay-lookin' boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
you're witnessin' a mass-occur
like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
hey, lookin' boy! what you say, lookin' boy?
i get a "hell yeah" from dre, lookin' boy
i'ma work for everything i have, never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face, lookin' boy!
basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racin' around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planet's krypton—no, asgard, asgard

so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off, then i'm reloadin'
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin' dead, but i'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
but i got your mom deep-throatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
it's me, my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on "i'm back" from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm
morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal!
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya, like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day, "hey fab, i'ma kill you!"
lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad)
uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman?
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music, you make elevator music
"oh, he's too mainstream."
well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"it's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock rap with doc
throw on "lose yourself" and make 'em lose it
"i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use."
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
i'm drunk, so, satan, take the fucking wheel
i'ma sleep in the front seat
bumpin' heavy d and the boyz, still "chunky but funky"
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have, then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then!
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?!
don't mistake him for satan; it's a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard—be a king? think not
why be a king when you can be a god?

you sound like a bitch, bitch
shut the fuck up
when your fans become your haters
you done?
fuckin' beard's weird
alright
you yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (you want smoke)
we doin' this once
you yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
why you yell at the mic? (illa)

rihanna just hit me on a text
last night i left hickeys on her neck
wait, you just dissed me? i'm perplexed
insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
damn, i'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
was watchin' 8 mile on my nordictrack
realized i forgot to call you back
here's that autograph for your daughter, i wrote it on a starter cap
stan, stan, son
listen, man, dad isn't mad
but how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
and have a man-bun?
the giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
i say one call to interscope and you're swayze
your reply got the crowd yelling, "woo!"
so before you die let's see who can out-petty who
with your corny lines ("slim, you're old")—ow, kelly, ooh
but i'm 45 and i'm still outselling you
by 29, i had three albums that had blew
now let's talk about somethin' i don't really do
go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
but you're a fuckin' mole hill
now i'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
gunner? bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
what the fuck's in the bowl, milk? wheaties or cheerios?
'cause i'm takin' a shit in 'em, kelly, i need reading material
…dictionary…
"yo, slim, your last four albums sucked
go back to recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
what do you know? oops
know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? yeah, i had enough money in '02
to burn it in front of you, ho
younger me? no, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
i'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'til i'm hitting old age
still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
feel like i'm babysitting lil tay
got the diddy okay so you spent your whole day
shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
got you at your own wake, i'm the billy goat
you ain't never made a list next to no biggie, no jay
next to taylor swift and that iggy ho, you about to really blow
kelly, they'll be putting your name
next to ja, next to benzino—die, motherfucker!
like the last motherfucker sayin' hailie in vain
alien brain, you satanist (yeah)
my biggest flops are your greatest hits
the game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
so before i slay this bitch i, mwah, give jade a kiss
gotta wake up labor day to this (the fuck?)
bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
in a state of bliss 'cause i said his goddamn name
now i gotta cock back, aim
yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this! (pop)
it's your moment
this is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
had to give you a career to destroy it
lethal injection
go to sleep six feet deep, i'll give you a b for the effort
but if i was three-foot-eleven
you'd look up to me, and for the record
you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
lick a ballsack to get on my channel
give your life to be as solidified
this mothafuckin' shit is like rambo when he's out of bullets
so what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
how the fuck can him and i battle?
he'll have to fuck kim in my flannel
i'll give him my sandals
'cause he knows, long as i'm shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
exhausting, letting off on my offspring
lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
you dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
you're fuckin' salty
'cause young gerald's balls-deep inside of halsey
your red sweater, your black leather
you dress better, i rap better
that a death threat or a love letter?
little white toothpick
thinks it's over a pic, i just don't like you, prick
thanks for dissing me
now i had an excuse on the mic to write "not alike"
but really i don't care who's in the right
but you're losin' the fight you picked
who else want it? kells—attempt fails! budden—l's!
fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as cottonelle
killshot, i will not fail, i'm with the doc still
but this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
but, kells, the day you put out a hit's the day diddy admits
that he put the hit out that got pac killed, ah!
i'm sick of you bein' wack
and still usin' that mothafuckin' auto-tune
so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
i'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
need to get the cock up out it
before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
i'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
that you're marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
don't mean you are, and you're not about it
so just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

you fuckin'—oh
and i'm just playin', diddy
you know i love you

ugh, you're a monster

i can swallow a bottle of alcohol and i'll feel like godzilla
better hit the deck like the card dealer
my whole squad's in here, walking around the party
a cross between a zombie apocalypse and b-bobby "the
brain" heenan which is probably the
same reason i wrestle with mania
shady's in this bitch, i'm posse'd up
consider it to cross me a costly mistake
if they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
adhd, hydroxycut
pass the courvoisier (hey, hey)
in aa with an ak, melee, finna set it like a playdate
better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
this beat is cray-cray, ray j, h-a-h-a-h-a
laughing all the way to the bank, i spray flames
they cannot tame or placate the

monster
you get in my way, i'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
i'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
when the moon shines like ice road truckers
i look like a villain outta those blockbusters
godzilla, fire spitter, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet
fire, godzilla, fire, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet

i'm just a product of slick rick and onyx, told 'em lick the balls
had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
it's impossible to list 'em all
and in the midst of all this
i'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
tryna see, will i still be like this tomorrow?
risperdal, voices whisper
my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
this is just the song to go ballistic on
you just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
i'm just a loch ness, the mythological
quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
when you twist the top of the bottle, i'm a

monster
you get in my way, i'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
i'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
when the moon shines like ice road truckers
i look like a villain outta those blockbusters
godzilla, fire spitter, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet
fire, godzilla, fire, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet

if you never gave a damn (ayy), raise your hand
'cause i'm about to set trip, vacation plans
i'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
the motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
how can i have all these fans and perspire?
like a liar's pants, i'm on fire
and i got no plans to retire and i'm still the man you admire
these chicks are spazzin' out, i only get more handsome and flyer
i got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
and what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'cause i caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
like kid ink, bitch, i got them racks with so much ease that they call me diddy
'cause i make bands and i call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake, yeah)
bitch, i'm a player, i'm too motherfuckin' stingy for cher
won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
but i tell a bitch i'll marry her if she'll bury her
face in my genital area, the original richard ramirez
cristhian rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
so they wanna give me the chair
like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it hari kari
'cause e'ry tom and dick and harry carry a merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
it's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
we wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
evil half of the bad meets
evil, that means take a back seat
take it back to fat beats with a maxi single
look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
is my 'gangsta bitch' like apache with a catchy jingle
i stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten cheeto
fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
other words, i minute maid 'em
i don't wanna hurt 'em, but i did, i'm in a fit of rage
i'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
i'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
i'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
but don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like i'm mentally ill
i'm attila, kill or be killed, i'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
you're bringin' the killer within me outta me
you don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
and be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
when i'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
a hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
i'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, i'm unfadable
you wanna battle, i'm available, i'm blowin' up like an inflatable
i'm undebatable, i'm unavoidable, i'm unevadable
i'm on the toilet bowl, i got a trailer full of money and i'm paid in full
i'm not afraid to pull a—

man, stop
look what i'm plannin', haha

look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it, or just let it slip? yo

his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's choking, how? everybody's joking now
the clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
there goes rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
he knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better…

his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking, make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
these hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
he's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads
god only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, i suppose it's old, partner
but the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better…

no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine-to-
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail, i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trailer's got
to go; i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better…

you can do anything you set your mind to, man

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy

i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew, see, but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do's be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
whoo! hit the lottery, ooh-wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
goin' coo-coo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause i'm—

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

now, i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
could be over tomorrow, so i keep conjurin'
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! i think it went wanderin' off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killin' me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
nobody's home, i'm sleepwalkin'
i'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the—

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

call me crazy, but i have this vision, one day that
i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then, drums get killed and
i'm comin' straight at mc's, blood gets spilled and
i'll take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
it's payback, russell wilson fallin' way back
in the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
straw into gold, chump, i will spin—rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket
face facts: i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that!
it's nothin', i'm still friends with the—

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(get along with) get along with the voices inside of my head
(you're tryin' to) you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(and you think) and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's nothin'

(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

woah, joyner, joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

yeah, i done did a lot of things in my day, i admit it
i don't take back what i say, if i said it then i meant it
all my life i want a grammy, but i'll prolly never get it
i ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (yah i said it)
fuck the system, i'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
i'm about to risk it all, i ain't got too much to lose
y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
pass the plate! where my drink? this my day, lucky you
fuck you too, woo!

y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
turn my back on you, all of you finished
back to these bullets, it's back to the job
pull my mac out and all of you runnin'
back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
these packs and i'm actually pumpin'
can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
you mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
i'm actually buzzin' this time
straight out the kitchen, i told 'em the oven is mine
i do not fuck with you guys (woo!)
if i don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
i ain't no gangster but i got some bangers
some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
my 12 days of christmas was nothin' but lies (i)
run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
they say i talk like a chulo (chulo)
i live on mars, i'm not bruno (woo)
bitch i'm a dog, call me cujo (rah)
you play your cards, i reverse on you all
and i might just draw 4 like a uno (bup)
cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (joyner)
they've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
lookin' for somethin' i prolly can never find now
shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
in truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
i've been alone and i never needed nobody
just only me and my shotty, i'll tell these niggas to lie down
keep all the money, i never wanted the lifestyle
i just pray to god that my son'll be alright now
i said ain't no love for the other side
or anyone who ever want smoke (joyner)
when i die i'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (yeah)
you in the wrong cab down the wrong path
nigga, wrong way, wrong road (woo, woo)
snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
i just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (vroom!)

i done said a lotta things in my day, i admit it
this is payback in a way, i regret it that i did it
i done won a couple grammys, but i sold my soul to get 'em
wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
fuck's the difference?
i'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
man, i used to risk it all, now i got too much to lose
i've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
i just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
fuck you think? (woo!)

i got a couple of mansions
still i don't have any manners
you got a couple of ghostwriters
but to these kids it don't actually matter
they're askin' me, "what the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
i said, "i don't have any answers"
'cause i took an l when i dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but i'm back on these rappers
and actually comin' from humble beginnings
i'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
i wish i could say, "what a wonderful feeling!"
"we're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
but nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
to even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
the inability to pen humility
ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
fuck it, i'm goin' for the jugular
shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
about the ones that were here before you that made rap
let's recap, way back, mc's that wreak havoc on tape decks
adat's, where the g raps and kanes at?
we need 3 stacks asap and bring masta ace back
'cause half of these rappers have brain damage
all the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
i don't hate trap, and i don't wanna seem mad
but in fact, where the old me at? the same cat
that would take that feedback and aim back, i need that
but i think it's inevitable
they know what button to press or what lever to pull
to get me to snap though (lil' bitch)
and if i pay it attention i'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
but you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
on the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
i'm asleep at the wheel again
as i peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
of another beat i'ma kill again
'cause even if i gotta end up eatin' a pill again
even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
it better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
and i might as well 'cause i'ma end up bein' a villain again
levels to this shit, i got an elevator
you could never say to me i'm not a fuckin' record breaker
i sound like a broken record every time i break a record
nobody could ever take away the legacy i made, i never cater
motherfucker, now i got a right to be this way
i got spite inside my dna
but i roll 'til the wheels fall off, i'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
it's the moment y'all been waitin' for
like california wishin' rain to pour
in that drought, y'all been prayin' for
my downfall from the 8 mile to the southpaw
still the same marshall, that outlaw
that they say as a writer might've fell off
i'm back on that bull like the cowboy

so y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

*plane crash*
yeah (illa, illa, illa)
yo, i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
yeah

let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate, i'm ’bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet, i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr!)
full magazine could take staples out
savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but bitch, i'm off the chain like kala brown
motherfucker, shut the fuck up when i’m talkin’, lil' bitch
i’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? oh, critiquin'
my talent? oh, bitch, i don't know who the fuck y’all are
to give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
you mention me, millions of views, attention in news
i mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
billions of views, your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued, business as us'
shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though? prob'ly no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi, yo, adiós
i can see why people like lil yachty, but not me though
not even dissin', it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe "stan" just isn't your cup of tea (get it?)
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit, preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill, probably i will
old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror, i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead, i must be possessed
like an evil spell, i'm e-v-i-l ("evil" spelled)
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ, man, how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (fuck my side chick!)
you won't ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the m-i-c
i polarize shit, so the thames might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch, i got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
turn down for what?
i ain't loud enough, nah, turn the valium up (illa, illa, illa)
'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesn't matter what caliber
i spit at, i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
you'll turn around and just be like, "man, how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
and now he wants to take it out on us" (ooouuu)
but last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooouuu)
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me (nfing)
so finger-bang, chicken wang, mgk, igg' azae'
lil pump, lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
i'm fed up with bein' humble
and rumor is i'm hungry, i'm sure you heard rumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you, if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean, then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a line and never caught it
'cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless, all i'll ever be is honest (illa, illa, illa)
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs, my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side, never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep, not even a wink, i don't blink
i don't doze off, i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze
"aw, man! that bet cypher was weak, it was garbage
the thing ain't even orange—oh my god, that's a reach!"
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"dawg, that's a date" — "looks like an olive to me"
"look, there's an apple!" — "no, it's not, it's a peach!"
so finger-bang, pootie tang
burger king, gucci gang, dookie, dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
invite 'em in like a one a day
i'm not done (preach!)

'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'cause the way i see people turning's
makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined?
'cause i'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back, i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted
but i think it's workin'
these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
and he's too scurred to answer me with words
'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least he's heard it
'cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him
or ask if i'm linked to terrorists
i said, "only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
but my beef is more media journalists
(hold up, hold up, hold up)
i said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes, i mean eating a penis
'cause they've been pannin' my album to death
so i've been givin' the media fingers
don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they've been puttin' me through the ringer
so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleaners

my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear slim, i wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her?
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too, i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too, that shit was phat
anyways, i hope you get this, man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan

my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you, for four hours, and you just said no
that's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad, though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver?
you said if i'd write you, you would write back
see, i'm just like you in a way: i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i drift away and put 'em on
‘cause i don't really got shit else
so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see, everything you say is real, and i respect you ‘cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you, slim, no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours, stan—p.s. we should be together too

my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear mr. i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months, and still no word—i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two letters, i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you, i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now, i'm doin' 90 on the freeway
hey, slim, i drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil collins, "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
but didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
now it's too late, i'm on a thousand downers now—i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you, slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
you ruined it now, i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see, slim—shut up, bitch! i'm tryin' to talk
hey, slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat, i just tied her up—see? i ain't like you
‘cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well, gotta go, i'm almost at the bridge now
oh, shit, i forgot—how am i supposed to send this shit out?!

my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear stan, i meant to write you sooner, but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
look, i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother; i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show, i must've missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
i say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
you got some issues, stan, i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together?
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter, i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little, i'm glad i inspire you, but stan
why are you so mad? try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it, his name was—it was you

damn…

i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care
hi suzanne, but i shoulda said "bye suzanne"
after the first night, but tonight i am

i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

a one-night stand turned a two-night stand
it was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
he found out, now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!

i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

my name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
river (ooh), river run
call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
river (ooh), we'll let the river run

always the bridesmaid, never "the bride, hey!"
fuck can i say? if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one (i'm sorry)
i don't want to admit to something (i fucked up)
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

i got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
when the world gives you a raw deal
sets you off 'til you scream, "piss off! screw you!"
when it talks to you like you don't belong
or tells you you're in the wrong field
when something's in your mitochondrial
'cause it latched on to you, like—

knock knock, let the devil in
manevolent as i've ever been, head is spinnin'
this medicine's screamin', "l-l-l-let us in!"
l-l-l-like a salad bowl, edgar allan poe
bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
liquid tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
wicked, i get all high when i think i've smelled the scent
of elephant manure—hell, i meant kahlúa
screw it, to hell with it, i went through hell with accelerants
and blew up my-my-myself again
volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
mayo and went from hellmann's and being rail thin
filet-o-fish, scribble jam, rap olympics '97 freaknik
how can i be down? me and bizarre in florida
proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
dr. dre said, "hell yeah!"
and i got his stamp like a postcard, word to mel-man
and i know they're gonna hate
but i don't care, i barely can wait
to hit 'em with the snare and the bass
square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
because they're gonna taste my—

venom, (i got that) adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(w-w-when they get bit with the—)

(w-w-when they get bit with the—)

i said knock knock, let the devil in
shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
it-it's evident i'm not done
v-venomous, the thoughts spun
like a web and you just caught in 'em
held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
beat strangler attack
so this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
like, what's her name's at the wheel? danica patrick
threw the car into reverse at the indy, a nut crashin'
into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
my mustang and the jeep wrangler grill
with the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and gandhi (gandhi)
translation, i will probably kill us both
when i end up backin' into ya
you ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
when you're bit with the—

alien, e-e-elliott phone home
ain't no telling when this chokehold
on this game will end, i'm loco
became a symbiote, so
my fangs are in your throat, ho
you're snake-bitten with my—venom
with the ballpoint pen i'm
gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like yung joc
'cause the doc put me on like sunblock
why the fuck not, you only get one shot
ate shit 'til i can't taste it
chased it with straight liquor
then paint thinner, then drank 'til i faint
and awake with a headache
and i take anything in rectangular shape
then i wait to face the demons i'm bonded to
'cause they're chasin' me but i'm part of you
so escapin' me is impossible
i latch onto you like a—parasite
and i probably ruined your parents' life
and your childhood too
'cause if i'm the music that y'all grew up on
i'm responsible for you retarded fools
i'm the super villain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
you marvel that? eddie brock is you
and i'm the suit, so call me—

venom, (i got that) adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(w-w-when they get bit with the—)

two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'round the outside, 'round the outside
two trailer park girls go 'round the outside

guess who's back, back again
shady's back, tell a friend
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back

i've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more, they want shady, i'm chopped liver
well, if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not co-operating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
you waited this long, now stop debating
'cause i'm back, i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job, ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that! cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, debbie!

now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "bitch!"
a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
a rebel, so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
and it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
well, i'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then i'm gonna
enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention, back for the winter
i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing, "attention please"
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent? you sent for me?

now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

a tisk-it a task-it, i'll go tit for tat with
anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby? you can get stomped by obie
you thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno
now let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me, i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey!)
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me

now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me

hum dei dei la la, la la la la la

let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
i'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
that's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
just like i did with addiction, i'm 'bout to kick it

but quick to get it impaled when i tell 'em, "stick it!"
so sick, i'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to kendrick

that's how much we have in common (yah!)
that's how much we have in common (woah!)
up on this mic when we're on it (yah)
that's how much we have in common (yuh!)
that's how much we have in common (woo!)
that's how much we have in common
we are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (yah!)

i don't do jordans and audemars
i do explosions and molotovs
y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
i blow the smoke from the car exhaust
flyin' to a party i am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
i ain't gotta dance long as my ferrari spider move like c breezy
i don't gotta hire goons
i'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
the sky is blue, the tires new
the maserati white and cool like g-eazy
why these dudes tryna figure out
how to do a freestyle as fly as me? (why?)
i'm confused tryna figure out how to do kapri styles and mya g
everybody doin' chick joints
probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'member everybody used to bite nickel
now everybody doin' bitcoin
we don't got nothin' in common (no!)
we don't got nothin' in common (no!)
y'all into stuff like doubled-up styrofoam cups
on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
i'm into stuff like doublin' commas
find me a brother who's solid
to count the shit up and then bust the shit down
when the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
we cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
to dropped in the park in a pile of shit
knowledge is power, but powerless
if you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
y'all music sound like dr. seuss inspired it
hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
we can spit it for your advance
i'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants
you niggas—

brain dead, eye drops
pain meds, cyclops
daybed, ipod
"may-back," maybach
trainwrecks, sidewalks
payless, high-tops
k-fed, ihop
playtex, icebox

that's how much we have in common (yah!)
that's how much we have in common (woah!)
up on this mic when we're on it (yah)
that's how much we have in common (yuh!)
that's how much we have in common (woo!)
that's how much we have in common
we are not alike, there's nada like us—

you say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy!)
the people you run with are thuggin' (gang!)
but you just a wannabe gunner (gang!)
like you was gonna do somethin'
actin' like you catchin' bodies (ayy!)
and you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
you ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
rap god spit lyrical bullets (pew!)
and gats cock, your partners better tool up
this has not to do with muscular
but have guns for sure, you better put a
strap on, other words if you're gonna
roll up with your (gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'cause this bar is over your head
so you better⁠—{gun cock}⁠—have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt!)
oh, you run the streets, huh?
now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
this little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
he wants to keep up his tough demeanour
so he does a feature, decides to team up with n9na
but next time you don't gotta use tech n9ne
if you wanna come at me with a sub, machine gun
and i'm talkin' to you
but you already know who the fuck you are, kelly
i don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
but keep commenting on my daughter hailie
i keep on telling motherfuckers
but just in case you forgot really and need ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
i respond rarely, but this time shady 'bout to sound off
like a fuckin' cocked semi-glock demi-god
let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
you're not ready, fool, break yourself like rock steady crew
obviously, i'm not getting through
we can get it poppin' like redenbach, letting off like remy ma
heavy artille—ry, godzilla harsh with a hard shell
with a motherfucking heart bigger than bizarre's belly
only time you'll ever say i lost
you'll be talkin' 'bout fetty wap, better call diddy
just to try to get me off
and you better hope i don't call trick trick
bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
punk, you don't disrespect ogs, r.i.p. prodigy
sold dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
that i'll be the most hated, though made it
so that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
but now those days are over
i harvey weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
my code name is groper, i role play with lotion
i fuck the whole world then i throw away the trojan
old lederhosen with home-made explosives
i blow 80 holes in you
don't make me go in, i oj the flows
and i'm insult to injury, rolaids to goldman
i'm throat spray and motrin, i throated nicole
as they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
i double-edge sword it 'cause one place i poke and
i stick and i turn in a rotating motion
invisible with the pen, i'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
i'm fuckin' these syllables, i let 'em lick on my genitals
i'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
a little bit unpredictable, i spit the formidable
that you bitches fuckin' with, the original
i consider me and nickel identical—but not us
the only thing we have in common's i'm a dick and you suck
otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
none come close to skunk, bug, soldier
tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
young thug poster, unplugged toaster

that's how much we have in common (yah!)
that's how much we have in common (woah!)
up on this mic when we're on it (yah)
that's how much we have in common (yeah!)
that's how much we have in common (woo!)
that's how much we have in common
we are not alike, there's nada like us—
(man, fuck this shit, let's go)

may i have your attention, please?
may i have your attention, please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat, will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here...

y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
it's the return of the "oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?"
and dr. dre said… nothing, you idiots!
dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
feminist women love eminem
"chicka, chicka, chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
flippin' the you-know-who," "yeah, but he's so cute though"
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
"my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel, don't they?
we ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?

will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (nope)
well, i do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can sit me here next to britney spears?
shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
"yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee"
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd (agh!)
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me, so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?

i'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it, i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder: "how can kids eat up these albums like valiums?"
it's funny, 'cause at the rate, i'm going, when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking, but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king, spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "i don't give a fuck!"
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?

ha ha, i guess there's a slim shady in all of us
fuck it, let's all stand up!

(photoshoot!)
you know, everybody's been tellin' me
what they think about me for the last few months
it's too loud
maybe it's time i tell 'em what i think about them
can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
it's too loud
three’s not a crowd all up in it
slow fire

don't fall on my face
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my–

gotta concentrate, against the clock i race
got no time to waste, i'm already late, i got a marathoner's pace
went from addict to a workaholic, word to dr. dre
in that first marijuana tape—guess i got a chronic case (yeah)
and i ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
i know this time paul and dre
they won't tell me what not to say (nope!)
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
you'd swear to god i forgot i'm the guy that made "not afraid"
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late, it's just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin' radar, i'm so far away
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute, they're mockin' jay
next minute, they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just don't know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate, i call it walk-on-water-gate
i've had as much as i can tolerate
i'm sick and tired of waitin', i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
you wanted shady? you got him!

don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
don't fall on my fate (look)

somebody tell budden before i snap, he better fasten it
or have his body bag get zipped
the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (pump it up!)
and don't make me have to give it back to akademiks
say this shit is trash again, i'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
even when i'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
lacking with it, "he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
ho, you better go back and listen
you know me better, thinkin' i'll slow or let up
call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
hopin' that you rappers fall in that
dre said, "hold your head up!"—kathy griffin
stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
this is how i shot ahead (pew)—gabby gifford
my attack is vicious, jack the ripper, back in business
tyler create nothin', i see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
it's not just 'cause you lack attention
it's because you worship d12's balls, you're sack-religious
if you're gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters
the fans waited for this moment like that feature
when i stole the show (ha), sorry if i took forever (ha-ha)

don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh (i won't)
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

just remember, i was here before you
and i'll be here after you make your run-in for you
detractors, i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine (yeah)
increase the dose, from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host (ha-ha)
then give album of the year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word to everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
and i got no faith in your writers, i don't believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most, i was that wing and a prayer (huh)
a beacon of hope, put a b-i-r-d in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
that's who i'm doin' it for, the rest i don't really even care
but you would think i'm carryin' an oxford dictionary in my pocket
how i'm buryin' these artists
on a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
and what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause i'm just barely gettin' started (woo)
and far as lord jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
or i'll show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home (yeah)
i belong here, clown! don't tell me 'bout the culture!
i inspired the hopsins, the logics, the coles, the
seans, the k-dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
brought the world 50 cent, you did squat, piss and moan
but i'm not gonna fall… bitch! (yeah)

it's too loud
can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
it's too loud
three’s not a crowd all up in it
slow fire

'cause sometimes you just feel tired
yo, left, yo, left
feel weak and when you feel weak
yo, left, right, left
you feel like you wanna just give up
yo, left, yo left
but you gotta search within you
yo, left, right, left
try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
yo, left, yo left
and get that motivation to not give up
yo, left, right, left
and not be a quitter, no matter how bad
yo, left, yo left
you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
yo, left, right, left

'til i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
‘cause when i am not, then i'ma stop pennin' 'em
and i am not hip-hop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts, when i'ma stop sendin' 'em?
women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
amoxicillin's just not real enough
the criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're comin' with me, feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like i showed ya the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin' up?
fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
you bizzles forgot, slizzle does not give a fuck

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
until the roof, until the roof
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
the roof comes off, the roof comes off
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
until my legs, until my legs
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
give out from underneath me

music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
when you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
this is your moment, and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes: reggie, jay-z, 2pac and biggie
andré from outkast, jada, kurupt, nas, and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream, like bobby and whitney — nate, hit me!

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
until the roof, until the roof
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
the roof comes off, the roof comes off
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
until my legs, until my legs
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
give out from underneath me

soon as a verse starts, i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinking? how not to go against me, smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll prob'ly never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth, that would be the death of me first
‘cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack, like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full-blown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest, so

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
until the roof, until the roof
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
the roof comes off, the roof comes off
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
until my legs, until my legs
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
give out from underneath me

until the roof, until the roof
the roof comes off, the roof comes off
until my legs, until my legs
give out from underneath me
i, i will not fall, i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me

just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe, but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her, the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me, and i love it — "wait!
where you going?" — "i'm leaving you!" — "no, you ain't!
come back!" — we're runnin' right back, here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad, it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped, "who's that dude?", i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength

just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
you swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls you both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane

just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

now, i know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk?
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time? there won't be no next time!
i apologize, even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games, i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

now, everybody from the 313
put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
everybody from the 313
put your motherfuckin' hands up! look, look
now, while he stands tough
notice that this man did not have his hands up
this free world's got you gassed up
now, who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
one, two, three, and to the four
one pac, two pac, three pac, four
four pac, three pac, two pac, one
you're pac, he's pac, no pac, none
this guy ain't no motherfuckin' mc
i know everything he's 'bout to say against me
i am white, i am a fucking bum
i do live in a trailer with my mom
my boy future is an uncle tom
i do got a dumb friend named cheddar bob
who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
i did get jumped by all six of you chumps
and wink did fuck my girl
i'm still standin' here screaming, "fuck the free world!"
don't ever try to judge me, dude
you don't know what the fuck i've been through
but i know something about you
you went to cranbrook, that's a private school
what's the matter, dawg? you embarrassed?
this guy's a gangster? his real name's clarence
and clarence lives at home with both parents
and clarence' parents have a real good marriage
this guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
he's scared to death, he's scared to look
at his fucking yearbook; fuck cranbrook!
fuck a beat, i'll go a cappella
fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
fuck everybody! fuck y'all if you doubt me!
i'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
and fuck this battle, i don't wanna win, i'm outtie
here, tell these people something they don't know about me

yo...

(fack) okay, (fack) how do i say this? (fack)
last year (fack) didn't work out so well for me (fack)
(fack last year!) (fack) (last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (fack) well (fack)

hah, yeah, i'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
you beat me, islamic nazi, that means there is no such thing
i've been goin' for your jugular since craig g "duck alert"
wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
i'll ride through your cul-de-sac
window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
y-you collaborative effort rap, i-i have never said his raps
o-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
and ruined your welcome mat
so spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (wrote it) (yeah)
while i teabag the microphone 'cause i go nuts on it (on it) (yeah)
like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
headed right at opponents and i'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
i'm 'bout to—

smash into everyone, crash into everything
back and i've just begun, "fack" 2017
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna
smash into everyone, crash like an f-15
damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna

i turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when i wasn't (wasn't)
from the moment i heard rappers cussin', i was in (was in)
which is why i identify with the guy
who i was invented by, dre's frankenstein
energized like a nine volt
ice cold like snake eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
but if the only reason i blowed is 'cause i'm white though
why don't every other white rapper sell what i sold? (ooh)
kamikaze pilot, i wrote my suicide note
here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'fore i jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'cause i'm takin' y'all with me when i go cyclone
i don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here i go
eyes closed, blindfolded, i'm 'bout to—

smash into everyone, crash into everything
back and i've just begun, "fack" 2017
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna
smash into everyone, crash like an f-15
damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna

smash
kamikaze, kamikaze
kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
take a look at what i've done

i heard your freestyle on shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
there is no way we ever air that shit again, i guarantee that
wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (get it)
the shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending tara reid bare
in my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of cher
each nut is the chair width of an acorn stairlift, beware of me
lyrically i'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
richard ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
somethin' evil is lurkin', i'm no conspiracy theorist
but somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
get the measurin' stick (what?), 12 inches of wood (haha)
wait, but i've been goin' for your jugular since craig g "duck alert"
and i've come to pay respects
'cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
you get laid to rest and i hope your butt is hurt
put me on a track, i go cray-on it like a color book
you got some views, but you're still below me
mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
and i don't say the hook unless i wrote the hook
and now i'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
and you know i've always spoke the truth
you're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
and it ain't somethin' i need a phone to do
when i say i can't wait 'til i get ahold of you
and i don't know what i'm s'posed to do
line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes (fuck)

why are expectations so high? is it the bar i set?
my arms, i stretch, but i can’t reach
a far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
soon as i grab, squeeze
i lose my grip like the flying trapeze
into the dark i plummet, now the sky's blackening
i know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
knowin' that no matter what bars i come with
you're gonna harp, gripe, and
that's a hard vicodin to swallow, so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking, because—

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
(it's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
i walk on water (shit)
but only when it freezes

it's the curse of the standard, that the first of the mathers disc set
always in search of the verse that i haven’t spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
i’ve garnered? the rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
and it always feels like i'm hittin’ the mark
'til i go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
like, "this shit is garbage!"
god's given me all this, still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
if only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
i'm not god-sent, nas, rakim, 'pac, b.i.g., james todd smith
and i'm not prince, so…

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
(it's true, i'm a rubik's—, it's true—)
but only when it freezes
(it's true—)

'cause i'm only human, just like you
making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down, oh

it's true, i'm a rubik's—a beautiful mess
at times juvenile, yes, i goof and i jest
a flawed human, i guess
but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
the "speedom" verse, now big sean
he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
there was a time i had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on
and now i'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
but the only one who's looking down on
me that matters now's deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long?
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and it's time to wash out the blonde
sales decline, the curtain's drawn
they're closin' the set, i'm still pokin' my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt, remind
now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta sight, outta mind, i might go outta mine
'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
but when i do fall from these heights though, i'll be fine
i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes

'cause i'm only human, just like you
i've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down, oh
if i walked on water, i would drown

'cause i'm just a man
but as long as i got a mic, i'm godlike
so me and you are not alike
bitch, i wrote "stan"
