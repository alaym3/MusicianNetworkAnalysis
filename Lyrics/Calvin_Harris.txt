hey, hey
i could sweat like this all night
oh, heatstroke, oh
i think you opened my eyes

you took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
and with a word, all my love came rushing out
and every whisper, it's the worst
emptied out by a single word
there is a hollow in me now

so i'll put my faith in something unknown
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but i'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
i'm living on such sweet nothing
and it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
when you're giving me such sweet nothing
sweet nothing, sweet nothing
you're giving me such sweet nothing

it isn't easy for me to let it go
'cause i've swallowed every single word
and every whisper, every sigh
eats away at this heart of mine
and there is a hollow in me now

so i'll put my faith in something unknown
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but i'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
i'm living on such sweet nothing
and it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
when you're giving me such sweet nothing
sweet nothing, sweet nothing
you're giving me such sweet nothing

and it's not enough to tell me that you care
when we both know the words are empty air
you give me nothing
nothing

sweet nothing
sweet nothing

i need your love, i need your time
when everything's wrong, you make it right
i feel so high, i come alive
i need to be free with you tonight
i need your love
i need your love

i take a deep breath every time i pass your door
i know you're there, but i can't see you anymore
and that's the reason you're in the dark
i've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

and i feel so helpless here
watch, my eyes are filled with fear
tell me, do you feel the same?
hold me in your arms again

i need your love, i need your time
when everything's wrong, you make it right
i feel so high, i come alive
i need to be free with you tonight

what i mean to you, do i belong?
i try to fight this, but i know i'm not that strong

and i feel so helpless here

tell me, do you feel the same?
hold me in your arms again

i need your love, i need your time
when everything's wrong, you make it right
i feel so high, i come alive

and now my eyes are open
and now my heart is closing
and all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
i've been trying to make it change
and now my eyes are open

i need your love, i need your time
when everything's wrong, you make it right
i feel so high, i come alive
i need to be free

i don't like to talk, but i love to sing
and i don't smoke, but i love to drink
i'm paranoid, i don't miss a thing
but i'm still nice, at least that's what i think
fall in love, like i'm a fiend
but then i pull out, and say
"i need freedom, i need freedom" (woah-woah)

i guess i'll take it, heartbreaker
a title, i can't shake it, can't fake it

oh, i remember when this road was my own
i pray to god, i just don't know anymore
i pray to god, i just don't know anymore
and more, i lost the feeling but i try to hold on
i thought the end of a love is what made you strong
i pray to god, i just don't know anymore

when there's no getting through
i won't hold back
i will throw down everything in life, i know now
i've been lyin' on the floor
sleeping on the ground
i will give up everything in life, i know how

'cause i can't stop wondering
if i was too late to perceive the signs
if i could go back with hands up
i'd look up to the sky

and give in
i'd give in
i'd give in
i'd give in to you, give in to you

oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
i made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
the lights in my eyes, they disappeared
visions of my mind are enough to keep me from fear
i won't let it hold me down, the other way around
i don't want the words to, i can't make a sound

'cause i can't stop wondering
if i was too late to perceive the signs
if i could go back with hands up
i'd look up to the sky

and give in
i'd give in
i'd give in
i'd give in to you, give in to you

can't hold back, reachin' out
(hot, hot) i was livin' in the heat in the moment
between us, i told you that
(hot, hot) i was livin' in the heat in the moment
i'd give in
(hot, hot) i was livin' in the heat in the moment
i'd give in
(hot, hot) i was livin' in the heat in the moment
i'd give in
(hot, hot) i was livin' in the heat in the moment
i'd give in to you, give in to you

and give in
i'd give in
i'd give in
i'd give in to you, give in to you
and give in
i'd give in
i'd give in
i'd give in to you, give in to you

'cause i could be the man for ya
