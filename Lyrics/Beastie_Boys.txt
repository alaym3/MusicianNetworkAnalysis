well, now, don't you tell me to smile
you stick around, i'll make it worth your while
got numbers beyond what you can dial
maybe it's because i'm so versatile
style, profile

i said it always brings me back when i hear, "ooh child"
from the hudson river out to the nile
i run the marathons 'til the very last mile

well, if you battle me, i will revile
people always saying my style is wild
you've got gall, you've got guile (guile)
to step to me, i’m a rapophile

if you wanna battle, you're in denial
coming from uranus to check my style
go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
cast you off into exile

jazz and awol, that's our team
step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
when it comes to beats, well, i'm a fiend
i like my sugar with coffee and cream

well, i gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam
too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
well, on the tough guy style, i'm not too keen
trying to change the world, i will plot and scheme

mario c likes to keep it clean (clean)
goin' to shine like a sunbeam
keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream
thank moe dee for sticking to themes

now when it comes to envy, y'all is green
jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)

we're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
kick off your shoes and relax your socks
the rhymes will spread just like a pox
'cause the music is live, like an electric shock

i am known to do the wop (wop)
also known for the flintstone flop
tammy d getting biz on the crop (crop)
beatsie boys known to let the beat
"mmm, d-r-r-rop!"
do it

now when i wrote graffiti, my name was slop
if my rap's soup, my beats is stock
step from the table when i start to chop
i'm the lumberjack, dj adrock

if you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
i'll stir fry you in my wok
your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
like a pinch on the neck of mr. spock

do it

i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'ma set it straight, this watergate
i can't stand rockin' when i'm in here
'cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this fuckin' thorn in my side
oh my god, it's a mirage
i'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

so, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
you'll shut me down with a push of your button
but, yo, i'm out and i'm gone
i'll tell you now, i keep it on and on

'cause what you see, you might not get
and we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
i'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

whhhhhyyyyyy
(our backs are now against the wall)

listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'm-a set it straight, this watergate
but i can't stand rockin' when i'm in this place
because i feel disgrace because you're all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i'm buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be – it's a mirage
you're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage

now here's a little story i've got to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well
it started way back in history
with ad-rock, mca, (and me) mike d
been had a little horsey named paul revere
just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
riding across the land, kicking up sand
sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause i'm in demand
one lonely beastie i be
all by myself without nobody
the sun is beating down on my baseball hat
the air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
looking for a girl, i ran into a guy
his name was mca, i said howdy, he said hi

he told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
the brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
his voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
he said, "can i get some?" – i said, "you can't get none!"
had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
quick on the draw, i thought i'd be dead
he put the gun to my head, and this is what he said
now my name is mca, i've got a license to kill (yeah)
i think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah)
now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
i run this land, you understand? i've made myself clear?
we stepped into the wind, he had a gun, i had a grin
you think this story's over, but it's ready to begin

now i got the gun, you got the brew
you got two choices of what you can do
it's not a tough decision as you can see
i can blow you away or you can ride with me
i said, i'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
the sheriff's after me for what i did to his daughter
i did it like this, i did it like that
i did it with a wiffleball bat
so i'm on the run, the cop got my gun
and right about now it's time to have some fun
the king ad-rock, that is my name
and i know the fly spot where they got the champagne
we rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
the beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
this dude was staring like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar
mca said, "yippie yo, you know this kid?"
i said i didn't, but i know he did
the kid said, ("get ready 'cause this ain't funny
my name's mike d and i'm about to get money")
pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
he yelled ("stick 'em up!") and let two fly
hands went up and people hit the floor
he wasted two kids that ran for the door
("i'm mike d and i get respect
your cash and your jewelry is what i expect")
mca was with it and he's my ace
so i grabbed the piano player and i punched him in the face
piano player's out, the music stopped
his boy had beef and he got dropped
mike d grabbed the money (mca snatched the gold)
i grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold

to mario c—you can't front on that

well just plug me in just like i was eddie harris
you're eating crazy cheese like you would think i'm from paris
you know i get fly, you think i get high
you know that i'm gone and i'm-a tell you all why

so tell me who are you dissing; maybe i'm missing
the reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
in my head, i just want to take 'em down
imagination set loose and i'm gonna shake 'em down

let it flow like a mud-slide
when i get on, i like to ride and glide
i've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
i get props at my mention 'cause i vex, y'all

so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
i get so funny with my money that you flaunt
i said, "where'd you get your information from, huh?
you think that you can front when revelation comes?"

(yeah, you can't front on that)

well they call me mike d, the ever-loving man
i'm like spoonie gee (whoo ooh), i'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
you scream and you holler about my chevy impala
but the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

but like a dream i'm flowing without no stopping
sweeter than a cherry pie with reddi whip topping
going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
well i'll be calling out to people like a casting call

ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
with your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
believe me, what you see is what you get
and you see me, i'm coming off as you can bet

well i think i'm losing my mind, this time
this time i'm losing my mind; that's right
i said i think i'm losing my mind, this time
this time, i'm losing my mind

yeah, you can't front on that

but little do you know about something that i talk about
i'm tired of driving, it's due time that i walkabout
but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise
i've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize

well i'm dr. spock, i'm here to rock, y'all
i want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
i said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
so i reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
see, i'm the long leaner victor the cleaner
i'm the illest motherfucker from here to gardena

well i'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
you've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
but if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
i've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech

yeah, you can't front on that

so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

brooklyn

foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
my job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time

beastie boys always on vacation
itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
i do what i do best because i'm illing and able

while you're at the job working nine-to-five
the beastie boys at the garden cold kicking it live

another plane, another train
another bottle in the brain
another girl, another fight
another drive all night

our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
he's got his own room at the back of the bus
tour around the world, you rock around the clock
plane to hotel, girls on the jock
we're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
four on the floor, ad-rock's out the door
mca's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore
we got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
with dice in the front and brooklyn's in the back
white boys got more rhymes

you wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
you ask your mom "please?", but she still says "no!"
you missed two classes and no homework
but your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

you gotta fight!
for your right!
to party!

your pop caught you smoking, and he said: "no way!"
that hypocrite smokes two packs a day
man, living at home is such a drag
now your mom threw away your best porno mag (busted!)

you gotta fight for your right to party
you gotta fight


don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
i'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
your mom busted in and said, “what's that noise?"
aw, mom, you're just jealous it's the beastie boys

you gotta fight for your right to party
you gotta fight for your right to party

parrrrrrty
parrrrrrty
yeah!

and on the cool check-in
center-stage on the mic
and we puttin' it on wax;
it's the new style

four and three and two and one (what up?)
and when i'm on the mic—the suckers run (word!)
down with ad-rock and mike d, and you ain't
and i got more juice than picasso got paint
got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
i'm not surprised you're on my dick (mike d!)
b-e-a-s-t-i-e
what up, mike d?
aw—yeah—that's me
i got franks and pork and beans
always bust the new routines
i get it, i got it—i know it's good
the rhymes i write—you wish you would
i'm never in training, my voice is not straining
people always biting, and i'm sick of complaining
so i went into the locker room, during classes
went into your locker and i smashed your glasses
you're from secaucus—i'm from manhattan
you're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

("there it is")
kick it!

father to many—married to none
and in case you're unaware; i carry a gun (word)
stepped into the party—the place was over-packed
saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
man, i had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
you better keep your mouth shut 'cause i'm fully strapped
i got money in the bank—i can still get high
that's why your girlfriend thinks that i'm so fly
i've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed
their father had envy so i shot him in the head
if i played guitar, i'd be jimmy page
the girlies i like are underage (shh! check it)
girls with boyfriends are the kinds i like
i'll steal your honey like i stole your bike
my father—he's jealous 'cause i'm making that green (what up?)
i've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places i've been

("there it is")
kick it!

you wanna know why? because i'm—
october 31st, that is my date of birth
i got to the party, you know what i did? the smurf!
taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
and when i get my fill, i'm chilly most
we ragtag girlies back at the hotel
and then we all switch places when i ring the bell
i chill at white castle 'cause it's the best
but i'm fly at fatburger when—when he's—i'm way out west (check it)
check; k-i-n-g a-d—whammy!
all the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
went to the prom—wore the fly, blue rental
got six girlies in my lincoln continental
i met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
i told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt (check it)
spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and i watched columbo

let me clear my throat
kick it over here, baby pop
and let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
mmm—drop

coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
just me, my posse, and—mca
a lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
my posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
some voices got treble—some voices got bass
we got the kind of voices that are in your face!
like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
i'm the king of the ave.—and i'm the king of the block
well, i'm mca—and i'm the king ad-rock
well, i'm mike d—i got all the fly juice
on the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce

i'm on like dr. john, yeah, mr. zu zu
i'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
and everything i do is funky like lee dorsey
well it's the taking of the pelham 1, 2, 3
if you want a doo doo rhyme, then come see me
i've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
i keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
strictly handheld is the style i go
never rock the mic with the pantyhose
i strap on my ear goggles and i'm ready to go
‘cause at the boards is the man, they call the mario
you pull up at the function and you know i kojak
to all the party people that are on my bozac
i've got more action than my man, john woo

timing like a clock when i rock the hip-hop
top notch is my stock on the soapbox
i've got more rhymes than i've got gray hairs
and that's a lot because i've got my share (oohh, weee)
i've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
i gotta straighten my thoughts
i'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
i'll have to step back, i gotta contemplate
well, i'm like lee perry, i'm very on
rock the microphone, and then i'm gone
i'm like vaughn bode, i'm a cheech wizard
never quittin', so won't you listen

ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time

'cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
mca, come and rock the sure shot

i want to say a little something that's long overdue
the disrespect to women has got to be through
to all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
i want to offer my love and respect to the end
well, you say i'm twenty-something and i should be slacking
but i'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
so i'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my tv
i'm still listening to wax, i'm not using the cd
well, i'm that kid in the corner
all fucked up and i wanna so i'm gonna (yeah)
take a piece of the pie, why not, i'm not quittin'
think i'm-a change up my style just to fit in
i keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
i use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
to send my rhymes out to all the nations
like ma bell, i got the ill communication

'cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
keep on and rockin' the sure shot

b-boys, b-girls...
tick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock

girls – all i really want is girls
and in the morning it's girls
'cause in the evening it's girls
i like the way that they walk
and it's chill to hear them talk
and i can always make 'em smile
from white castle to the nile
back in the day
there was this girl around the way
she liked my home-piece mca
he said he would not give her play
i asked him, "please?" – he said, "you may."
her pants were tight and that's ok
if she would dance, i would dj
we took a walk down to the bay
i hope she'll say
"hey, me and you should hit the hay!"
i asked her out, she said "no way!"
i should've probably guessed her gay
so i broke north with no delay
i heard she moved real far away
that was two years ago this may
i seen her just the other day
jockin' mike d. to my dismay
girls – to do the dishes
girls – to clean up my room
girls – to do the laundry
girls – and in the bathroom
girls – that's all i really want is girls
two at a time – i want girls
with new wave hairdos – i want girls
i ought to whip out my – girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

all you klingons in the fucking house
grab your backstreet friend and get loud
blowin' doors off hinges
i'll grab you with the pinchers
and no, i didn't retire
i'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

like mutual of omaha
got the ill boat you've never seen before
glidin' in the glades
and like lorne greene, you know i get paid
like caprese and with the basil
not goofy like darren or hazel
i'm a motherfuckin' nick at night
with classics rerunning that you know all right

now remain calm, no alarm
'cause my farm ain't fat
so what's up with that?
i've got friends and family that i respect
when i think i'm too good, they put me in check
so believe when i say i'm no better than you
except when i rap, so i guess it ain't true
like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
guaranteed to make your body rock

method of controlling my mind

i looked out the window, seen his bald head
ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
launched that shot, and he was caught out there
saw the convertible driving by
i loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
he went for his to find he didn't have one
put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
the egg, a symbol of life
i go inside your house and bust out your wife
i pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
the trigger, i pulled - his face, the yolk
reached in his pocket, took all his cash
left my man standing with the egg mustache
suckers, they come a dime a dozen
"when i say dozen, you know what i'm talkin' about, boy"

yeah, that's right, i'm the egg man
driving around, king of the town (yeah)
always got my windows rolled down
ready to throw
you know, i'm the egg man
once upon a time (egg man…)

humpty dumpty was a big fat egg
he was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
hit the rastaman, he said, (bloodclot!)
which came first, the chicken or the egg?
i egged the chicken, and then i ate his leg
riding the trains, in between cars
when i pull out the station, you're gonna get yours
drive-by eggings, plaguing la
"yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!"
sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (ray)
comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
people laugh, it's no joke
my name's "yauch" and i'm throwing the yolk
now they got me in a cell, but i don't care
it was then that i got caught catching people out there

up on the roof, in my car, up all night
i'm going through science like dolemite
the mack (who?)
i'm the egg man… taxi driver?
i'm the egg man
egg man, egg man

we all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
we began to attack, the eggs did crack on haze's back
sam i am, down with the program
green eggs and ham, yosemite sam
come halloween, you know i come strapped
i throw it at a sucker… "k-pap"
you made the mistake and judge a man by his race
you go through life with egg on your face
woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
the family, punk rocks, the businessman
i'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand
it's not like the crack that you put in a pipe
but crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe

egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man
egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man
egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man, egg man...

i'm not james at 15 or chachi in charge
i'm adam, and i'm adamant about livin' large
with the white sassoons and the looks that kill
makin' love in the back of my coupe de ville
i met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
i liked the little cutie, but i kicked her in the booty
cause i don't kinda go for that messin' around

the phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
she said come on over, it was me that she missed
i threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know i got dissed
your old lady left you, and you went insane
you blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train
well, take my advice at any price
a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
suckin' down pints 'til i didn't know
woke up in the morning with the won ton ho
'cause i announce, i like girls that bounce

rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin' (yeah)
ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me, homes
(being very proud to be an emcee)
and then the man upstairs, well, i hope that he cares
if i had a penny for my thoughts, i'd be a millionaire
amps and crossovers under my rear hood
because the bass is bumping from the back of my fleetwood
they tell us what to do? hell no!
