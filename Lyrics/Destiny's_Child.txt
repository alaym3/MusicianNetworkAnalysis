thou shalt pay bills

you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"

boy, i know you want me, i can see it in your eyes
but you keep on frontin'
won't you say what's on your mind?
'cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
but when i ask you "what's the deal?"
you hold it all inside
if you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real;
tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
'cause, boy, i know you want me just as much as i want you
so come and get my love - it's all here for you

you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"

if you keep actin' this way, you're gonna lose my love
i ain't got no time to play, you better hurry up
'cause every time i come around and cruise around your way
i see you on the corner, but you don't know what to say
when i walk up to you, baby, you seem so shy
what's the problem, baby? never had a girl like i?
i can see right through you, and you know you wanna be mine
so get your act together, 'cause you're running out of time!

you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no," (oh!)
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no" (no...)
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
(don't you know, you tell me, "no, baby, no, baby, no, baby")
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes..." ("yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby...")
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no," ("no, baby, no, baby, no, baby!")
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby...")
(just say yes)

you won't regret, i must confess
i'm really feelin' you
anything you've ever wanted before is right here for you, for you
don't worry what they say
just bring your love my way
'cause your friends can't do what i can for you
i don't wanna hear you say

(no...)
baby, tell me (yes..)
tell me yes, don't tell me no, no (no...)
(yes...)
you be sayin', "no...", (don't tell me "no," no...)
when it's really, "yes..." (tell me what i wanna hear, yeah, yeah)
you be sayin', "no..." (y-e-s, not n-o)
when it's really, "yes..." (oh, ooh, oh)

you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no"
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
(you make me say "no, baby, no, baby, no, baby")
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")
you be sayin', "no, no, no, no, no" ("no, baby, no, baby, no, baby!")
when it's really, "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")

i thought that this was something, yes
promising that one day it would turn into something, yes
thought the feelings were mutual
and i didn't have to guess
started being skeptical
always unavailable
like you didn't know
but now i'm feeling something, else
that's telling me this may not be the real something, else
but you was showing me
now i'm ready and you running
damn you got me open now
feeling like i'm choking now
where am i to go?

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her
you could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i feel in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

see i know we're not official, no
but us being official ain't ever been an issue, no
it came down to us, boy
remember we were different?
we said that we'd talk if we ever had problems about anything
i was cool with no commitment, wait
let me take that back
it was you so i was with it, see
i guess i didn't get when you showed you didn't miss it
now it seems that your interest ain't here
we ain't the same

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her
you could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i feel in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
me seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

all you had to say was this ain't what you want
i won't be so hurt and i could just move on
you had me believing everything was my fault
but i can see it now
it's a situation that i must let go
cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
i guess me seeing you with her tells it all

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i know in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
me seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
