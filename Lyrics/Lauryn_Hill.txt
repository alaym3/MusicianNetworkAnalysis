yo, remember back on the bully
when cats used to harmonize like (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
yo, yo, my men and my women
don't forget about the deen
sirat al-mustaqeem
yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
if ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
and lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(put them up, put them up)
(put them up, put them up)
(put them up, put them up)

it's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
the one you let hit it and never called you again
'member when he told you he was 'bout the benjamins?
you act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
to begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
like you wasn't down and you called him again?
plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
if you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
talking out your neck, sayin' you're a christian
a muslim, sleeping with the jinn
now that was the sin that did jezebel in
who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
you know i only say it 'cause i'm truly genuine
don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
baby girl, respect is just a minimum
niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
now, lauryn is only human
don't think i haven't been through the same predicament
let it sit inside your head like a million women in philly, penn
it's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
look at where you be in, hair weaves like europeans
fake nails done by koreans
come again
(a win win, come again
a win win, come again)
guys, you know you'd better watch out
some girls, some girls are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing

the second verse is dedicated to the men
more concerned with his rims and his timbs than his women
him and his men come in the club like hooligans
don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
the pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
need to take care of they three or four kids
and they face a court case when the child support late
money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
the sneaky, silent men
the punk, domestic violence men
quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
uh-uh, come again (yeah)
hey, yo-yo, come again
my french men, come again
my sister, come again
watch out, watch out
look out, look out
watch out, watch out
look out, look out
watch out, watch out
look out, look out
watch out, watch out
look out, look out

girls, you know you'd better watch out
some guys, some guys are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing
guys, you know you'd better watch out
'cause girls, some girls are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing
girls, you know you’d better watch out
some guys, some guys are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing

class!
hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(no! no, no, i don’t think so)
i say it for me, uh, i’m an adult i say, wait
“you’re too young to be in love, this is silly
you’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
you wear fancy adidas”
i mean, it might be something i don’t know
(it's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
well, you tell me. what’s the difference?
(okay. you can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(you’re crazy! you fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(you might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(she poetic)
she killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right? 

yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo
yo, uh, yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo

it could all be so simple (ba-ba-ba-baby, baby, baby)
but you'd rather make it hard (huh, uh)
loving you is like a battle (it's like a battle)
and we both end up with scars

tell me who i have to be (who i have to be)
to get some reciprocity
see, no one loves you more than me (more than me)
and no one ever will (no one ever will, yeah)

is this just a silly game (silly game)
that forces you to act this way? (to act this way)
forces you to scream my name
then pretend that you can't stay (yeah)

tell me, who i have to be (i know what we gotta do)
to get some reciprocity
see, no one loves you more than me
and no one ever will
no matter how i think we grow
you always seem to let me know
it ain't working (it ain't working, no), it ain't working
and when i try to walk away
you'd hurt yourself to make me stay
this is crazy, this is crazy (oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)

i keep letting you back in (you back in)
how can i explain myself? (i don't understand why)
as painful as this thing has been
i just can't be with no one else

see i know what we've got to do (yeah)
you let go (you let go), and i'll let go too (and i'll let go)
cause no one's hurt me more than you (no one's hurt me more than you)
and no one ever will

no matter how i think we grow
you always seem to let me know
it ain't working (it ain't working), it ain't working (it ain't working)
and when i try to walk away
you'd hurt yourself to make me stay
this is crazy, (this is crazy) oh, this is crazy (this is crazy)
(care) care for me, care for me
i know you care for me
(there) there for me, there for me
said you'd be there for me
(cry) cry for me, cry for me

(da, da, da, d-da, d-da) 

one day, you're gonna understand
zion

unsure of what the balance held
i touched my belly overwhelmed
by what i had been chosen to perform
but then an angel came one day
told me to kneel down and pray
for unto me a man-child would be born
woe this crazy circumstance
i knew his life deserved a chance
but everybody told me to be smart
"look at your career," they said
"lauryn, baby use your head"
but instead i chose to use my heart

now the joy of my world
is in zion! (zion, zion!)
now the joy of my world
is in zion! (zion, uhh, zion!)

how beautiful if nothing more
than to wait at zion's door
i've never been in love like this before
now let me pray to keep you from
the perils that will surely come
see life for you, my prince has just begun
and i thank you for choosing me
to come through unto life to be
a beautiful reflection of his grace
see i know that a gift so great
is only one god could create
and i'm reminded every time i see your face
that the joy (joy)
of my world (world)
is in zion (is in zion)
is in zion (is in zion)
now the joy (joy)
of my world (world)

okay, how many people here have ever been in love? i know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. how many of y'all ever been in love?

(mumbling)

i know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? oh! let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. about your personal definition, don't tell me what webster thinks. huh?

willingness to do everything for that person

okay, everything like what? explain. let him talk, c'mon. if i asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. but we wanna talk about love. you can do it. (to another pupil) what do you think? you said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

the way they act

uh-huh

the way they carry themselves, stuff like that
okay

the way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. it's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. it's like, that way, you know?

yeah

it's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

that's deep

that's what i'm talking about

i thought that was a beautiful point. anyone else want to deal with that?

it's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. they can't love you. 'cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

love is not phony!

(laughter) 

it's funny how money change a situation
miscommunication lead to complication
my emancipation don't fit your equation
i was on the humble, you on every station
some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
but remember not a game new under the sun
everything you did has already been done
i know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
my ting done made your kingdom wan' run
now understand, l-boogie, non-violent
but if a thing test me, run for mi gun
can't take a threat to mi new born son
l been this way since creation
a groupie call, you fall from temptation
now you wanna bawl over separation
tarnish my image in the conversation
who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
you might win some but you just lost one

you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
gained the whole world for the price of your soul
tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
wisdom is better than silver and gold
i was hopeless, now i'm on hope road
every man wanna act like he's exempt
need to get down on his knees and repent
can't slick talk on the day of judgment
your movement's similar to a serpent
tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
consequence is no coincidence
hypocrites always wanna play innocent
always want to take it to the full out extent
always want to make it seem like good intent
never want to face it when it time for punishment
i know you don't wanna hear my opinion
there come many paths and you must choose one
and if you don't change then the rain soon come
see you might win some, but you just lost one

you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some, but you really lost one
you just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
when it's all done, did you really gain from (gain from)
what you done done? it's so silly, how come?
(you done, how come?)
you just lost one

now don't you understand, man, universal law?
what you throw out comes back to you, star
never underestimate those who you scar
'cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
you can't hold god's people back that long
the chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
trying to pretend like your word is your bond
but until you do right, all you do will go wrong
now some might mistake this for just a simple song
and some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
and, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
now, some might listen and some might shun
and some may think that they've reached perfection
if you look closely you'll see what you've become
'cause you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one

you might win some, but you really lost one
you just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
when it's all done, did you really gain from
what you done done? it's so silly, how come?
you might win some, but you really lost one
you just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
when it's all done, did you really gain from
what you done done? it's so silly, how come?
you just lost one
you just lost one, you just lost one
you just lost one, you just lost one
(how come, you lost one? it's so dumb)
you just lost one, you just lost one
you just lost one

your love make me feel ten feet tall (yeah)
without it, i'd go through withdrawal

just repossessed my four by four
'cause nothing even matters no more
(no more, no more, no more)
nothing even matters
nothing even matters no more
nothing even matters
no, no more
to me, to me, to me, to me
to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me

everything is everything
what is meant to be will be
after winter must come spring (must come spring)
change, it comes eventually
everything is everything
what is meant to be will be
after winter must come spring (must come)
change, it comes eventually

i wrote these words (i wrote these words) for everyone who struggles in their youth
who won't accept deception in, instead of what is truth (gotta know the truth, y'all)
it seems we lose the game
before we even start to play
who made these rules? (who made these rules?)
we're so confused (we're so confused)
easily led astray
let me tell ya that...

everything is everything
everything is everything
everything is everything (everything)
after winter must come spring
everything is everything
our philosophy possibly speak tongues
beat drum, abyssinian, street baptist (word)
rap this in fine linen, from the beginning (word)
my practice extending across the atlas, i begat this
flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
you can't match this rapper slash actress
more powerful than two cleopatras
bomb graffiti on the tomb of nefertiti (ooh, uh)
mcs ain't ready to take it to the serengeti
my rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister betty (el shabazz!)
l-boogie spars with stars and constellations (what?)
then came down for a little conversation (huh)
adjacent to the king, fear no human being
roll with cherubims to nassau coliseum (what?)
now hear this mixture, where hip hop meets scripture (uh)
develop a negative into a positive picture

now everything is everything (everything, y'all, everything, y'all)
what is meant to be will be (what is meant to be will be, yeah)
after winter must come spring (after winter, must come spring)
change, it comes eventually (change, it comes eventually)

sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream (sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream)
but things come slow or not at all (they come slow, know what i mean?)
and the ones on top won't make it stop (ones on top, they won't make it stop)
so convinced that they might fall
let's love ourselves and we can't fail
to make a better situation (better situation, uh-uh)
tomorrow, our seeds will grow (tomorrow, our seeds will grow)
all we need is dedication
let me tell ya that
everything is everything
everything is everything

after winter must come spring
everything is everything (everything is everything)

everything is everything
what is meant to be will be
after winter (after winter) must come spring (must come)
change, it comes eventually 

my world, it moves so fast today
the past, it seems so far away
and life squeezes so tight that i can't breathe
and every time i've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
so caught up, i wasn't able to achieve

but deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
and i made up my mind to define my own destiny

i look at my environment
and wonder where the fire went
what happened to everything we used to be
i hear so many cry for help
searching outside of themselves
now i know that his strength is within me

and deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
and i made up my mind to define my own destiny (and deep in my heart)
and deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
and i made up my mind to define my own destiny 

i gotta find peace of mind
i know another cord...
i gotta find peace of mind
see, this what that voice in your head says
when you try to get peace of mind
i gotta find peace of mind, i gotta find peace of mind

he says it's impossible, but i know it's possible
he says it's impossible, but i know it's possible

he says there's no me without him
please help me forget about him
he takes all my energy, trapped in my memory
constantly holding me, constantly holdin' me
i need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused, mm-mm-mm-mm
i need to tell you i'm
i'm undone because, mm-mm-mm-mm

he says it's impossible, but i know it's possible
he says it's impossible without him, but i know it's possible

to finally be in love, and know the real meaning of
a lasting relationship, not based on ownership
i trust every part of you, 'cause all that i...
all that you say you do
you love me despite myself, sometimes i fight myself
i just can't believe that you, would have anything to do
with someone so insecure, someone so immature
oh, you inspire me, to be the higher me
you make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
just tell me what to say, i can't find the words to say
please don't be mad with me, i have no identity
all that i've known is gone, all i was building on
i wanna walk with you, how do i talk to you

touch my mouth with your hands
touch my mouth with your hands

he says it's impossible, but i know it's possible
he says it's improbable, but i know it's tangible

what a joy it is to be alive
to get another chance, yeah
everyday's another chance
to get it right this time
everyday's another chance
oh what a merciful, merciful, merciful god
oh what a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful god
 

it's the mystery of iniquity...
said it's the misery of inequity...
said it's the history of inequity...
when it all...
all falls down...
telling you all...
it all falls down

children...
eat your bread
little children...
eat your bread
cause it all...
all falls down...
telling you all...
it all falls down

yo! y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
perjures the jurors, witness despised
crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
it's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas
high profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
enter the dragon, black-robe crooked-balance
souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
court reporter catch the circus on the paper
file it in the system not acknowledged by the maker
swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
publicly perpetrating that "in god we trust"
cross-examined by a master manipulator
the faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
for status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
see the bailiff representing security
holding the word of god soliciting perjury
the prosecution, political prostitution
the more money you pay, the further away solution
legal actors, babylon's benefactors
masquerading as the agency for the clients
hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant
orally armed to do bodily harm
polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
and the defense isn't making any sense
faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
that a defendant is depending on the system
totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
framed by intentions
inventions whereby they lynch men
enter the false witness slandering the accused
planting the seed openly showing he's being used
to discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
expert witness (the paid authority)
made a priority to deceive the majority
of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years
hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers
do we expect the system made for the elect
to possibly judge correct? properly serve and protect?
materially corrupt, spiritually amuck
oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt
blind leading the blind, guilty never defined
filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind
legal extortion, blown out of proportion
in vein deceit, the truth is obsolete
only two positions: victimizer or victim
both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
trying to own a piece of the "american corona"
the revolving door, insanity every floor
skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?
empty traditions, reaching social positions
teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
when the son of perdition is commander in chief
the standard is thief; brethren, can we candidly speak?
woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'
leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources
counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
confusion consumes them
every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
internally they absent of light
trapped in the night and bonded to the cain of the night
under the curse, evil men waxing more worse
faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth
it's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root
the empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal
oh it's real, surrender for jehovah is real
how long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that you keep
the idols you heap, causing the destruction you reap
judgment has come, find it and return to the one
abandon the flesh, self-interest: broadway to death
pride and the greed, hide and subdividing the seed
the knowledge of good and evil is what caused us to lie
caused us to die, let your emotions be crucified
renounce all your thoughts
repent and let your mind be re-taught
you'll find what you sought
was based on the deception you bought
a perception of naught where the majority remains caught
loving a lie, not realizing in adam, all die
loving a lie, not realizing in adam, all die
loving a lie, not realizing in adam, all die
loving a lie, not realizing in adam, all die
it's the mystery of iniquity...
said it's the history of inequity...
said it's the misery of inequity...
when it all...
all falls down...
telling you all...
it all falls down 

now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't

as i look at what i've done
the type of life that i've lived
how many things i pray the father will forgive
one situation involved a young man
he was the ocean and i was the sand
he stole my heart like a thief in the night
dulled my senses and blurried my sight
and i used to love him

i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't

i chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
sacrificed too much and waited in vain
gave up my power ceased being queen
addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
see, torn and confused, wasted and used
reached the crossroad which path would i choose
stuck and frustrated, i waited, debated
for something to happen that just wasn't fated
thought what i wanted was something i needed
when momma said no then i just should have heeded
misled i bled 'till the poison was gone
and out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't

father you saved me and you showed me that life
was much more than being some foolish man's wife
showed me that love was respect and devotion
greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
see, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
content because that part of my life is finished
i see him sometimes and the look in his eye
is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
but my heart is gold, see, i took back my soul
and totally let my creator control
the life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
i used to love him but now i don't
see, i used to love him 

forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
although them again we will never, never, never trust
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
them nuh know what them do
dig out your eye, while i'm sticking like glue
fling, skin, grin, while them plotting for you, true!

forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do (me a tell you, dem nuh know)
forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do (fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

beware the false motives of others
be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
and you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
to you
they say all the right things to gain their position
then use your kindness as their ammunition
to shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
oh

forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do
forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do
why every indian wanna be the chief?
feed a man till he full and he still want beef
give me grief, try to tief off my piece
why for you to increase, i must decrease?
if i treat you kindly, does it mean that i'm weak?
you hear me speak and think i won't take it to the streets
i know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
but i try to keep it civilized, like menelik
and other african czars, observing stars with war scars
get yours in this capitalistic system
so many caught or got bought you can't list them
how you gon' idolize the missing? to survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
even when they coming, gunning i stand position
l's known the mission since conception
let's free the people from deception
if you looking for the answers, then you gotta ask the questions
and when i let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
sick of men trying to pull strings like geppetto
why black people always be the ones to settle?
march through these streets like soweto, uhh

like cain and abel, caesar and brutus
jesus and judas, backstabbers do this
forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do
forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do

it took me a little while to discover
wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
a friend once said, and i found to be true
that everyday people, they lie to god too
so what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do (forgive them, forgive them)
forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do (forgive them, forgive them)

gwan like dem love you, while dem rip you to shreds
trample pon yuh heart, and leff you fi dead
dem a yuh friend, who you depend pon, from way back when
(  to grace)
but if you, gi' dem yuh back, then you must meet yuh end
dem nuh know what dem do do
(who's gonna be the one?)
dem nuh know what dem do do
(gotta be the one to say)
dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know
dem nuh know what dem do do
(oh, yeah, oh)
(forgive them, father, forgive them, father...) 

uh-uh
uh
and yo
uhh, uhh (like fungus among us)
yo, yo (haha), uh

yo, i treat this like my thesis
well-written topic, broken down into pieces
i introduce then produce, words so profuse
it's abuse how i juice up this beat, like i'm deuce
two people both equal like i'm gemini, rather simeon
if i jimmy on this lock i could pop it, you can't stop it
drop it, your whole crew microscopic
like particles while i make international articles, and on the cover
don't discuss the baby mother (nah)
business, i been in this third lp you can't tell me
i witness first-handed, i'm candid, you can't stand it
respect demanded, and get flown around the planet
rock hard like granite or steel
people feel lauryn hill from new-ark to israel
and this is real, so i keep makin' the street's ballads
while you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
i'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
i wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
you gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
i'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
and then amend it, every law that ever prevented
our survival since our arrival documented in the bible
like moses and aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
and all the transparent gonna be seen through
let god redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
and i remain calm reading the 73rd psalm
'cause with all that’s going on i got the world in my palm

you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour

now i be breaking bread sipping manischewitz wine
pay no mind party like it's 1999
but when it comes down to ground beef like palestine
say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
now i'ma get the mozzarella like a rockafeller
still be in the church of lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
whether posed in mirabella in couture
or collecting residuals from off the score
i'm making sure i'm with the 144
i've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
word to boonie, i make salat like a sunni
get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
had opportunity went from hoodshock to hood-chic
but it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
and even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'cause i baptize my lips every time i take a sip
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour
you can get the money, you can get the power
but keep your eyes on the final hour 

when it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)

why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)

i loved real, real hard once
but the love wasn't returned
found out the man i'd die for
he wasn't even concerned
i tried, and i tried, and i tried
to keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
i cried, and i cried, and i cried
but i couldn't make it right

but i, i loved the young man
and if you ever been in love
then you'd understand

that what you want might make you cry
what you need might pass you by
if you don't catch it
if you don't catch it, if you don't catch it
and what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
if you just let it (if you just let it)
if you just let it (if you just let it)
see, i thought this feeling, it was all that i had
but how could this be love
and make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
gave up my power, i existed for you
but whoever knew, the voo-doo you'd do

but i, i loved the young man
and if you ever been in love
then you'd understand

that what you want might make you cry
what you need might pass you by
if you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
and what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
if you just let it (if you just let it)
if you just let it (if you just let it)
see what you want might make you cry
what you need might pass you by
if you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
and what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
if you just let it (if you just let it)
if you just let it (if you just let it)

you ain't said nothin'
why you ain't say somethin' to me?
(boy 1)
i feel like love right now is like confusion
it's like people think they love somebody
when they don't really love somebody
like i thought i was in love with this girl but i really wasn't
it's like now, i don't feel about her
(laughter)
ok. alright
you think that tv and music have somethin' to do with
why people are always confused about love?
(girl 1)
(yes!)
why?
(cause today we listen to a lot of tv a lot of music
and it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you)
we need to put you on a bullhorn
let you ride around newark 

yo hip-hop, started out in the heart
uh-huh, yo

c'mon baby light my fire (come on)
everything you drop is so tired (everything)
music is supposed to inspire (music is supposed to inspire)
how come we ain't gettin' no higher? (how come, how come)

now tell me your philosophy
on exactly what an artist should be
should they be someone with prosperity
and no concept of reality?
now, who you know without any flaws?
that lives above the spiritual laws?
and does anything they feel just because (just because, just because)
there's always someone there who'll applaud?

c'mon baby light my fire (come on)
everything you drop is so tired (everything you drop is so tired)
music is supposed to inspire (what are we here for, what are we here for)
how come we ain't gettin' no higher? (gettin' no higher)
i know you think that you've got it all
and by making other people feel small
makes you think you're unable to fall
but when you do, who you gonna call?
see what you give is just what you get (what you give is just what you get)
i know it hasn't hit you yet (i know it hasn't hit you yet)
now i don't mean to get you upset (get upset, get upset)
but every cause has an effect, uh-huh!

c'mon baby light my fire
everything you drop is so tired (yeah)
music is supposed to inspire (music is supposed to inspire)
how come we ain't gettin' no higher? (we ain't no higher, we ain't no higher)

i cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks
why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? uhh
all i wanted was to sell like five hundred
and be a ghetto superstar since my first album, blunted
i used to work at foot locker, they fired me: i fronted
or i quitted, now i spit it, however do you want it?
now you get it!
writing rhymes, in the range, with the frames lightly tinted
then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (lauryn hill!)
and if your lines sound like mine i'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
i'm serious, i'm takin' over areas in aquarius
runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
just as christ was a superstar, you stupid, star!
they'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
they'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
if you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it
c'mon baby light my fire
everything you drop is so tired (everything you drop, everything you drop)
music is supposed to inspire (oh yeah)
how come we ain't gettin no higher? (we ain't getting no higher, getting no higher)
c'mon baby light my fire (c'mon baby light my fire)
everything you drop is so tired (everything you drop is so tired)
music is supposed to inspire
how come we ain't gettin no higher? (how come we ain't gettin no higher?)
c'mon baby light my fire (come on baby)
everything you drop is so tired (everything you drop is so tired)
music is supposed to inspire
how come we ain't gettin no higher? (we ain't no higher) 

the unexpected
multi-dimensional
unexpected sound of the refugee all-stars
the sweetest thing i've ever known
was like the kiss on the collarbone
the soft caress of happiness
the way you walk, your style of dress
i wish i didn't get so weak
oooh, baby, just to hear you speak
makes me argue just to see
how much you're in love with me

see like the queen upon her throne
it was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing i've known
it was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing i've known
i get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
so i tell you leave, when i mean stay
warm as the sun dipped in black
fingertips on the small of my back
more valuable than all i own
like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone

it was the...ah
i tried to explain
ah...but baby, it's in vain
speaking on my mother's phone
the touching makes me think i'm grown, (you ain't grown)
sweet prince of the ghetto
your kisses taste like armaretto
intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
how sad, how sad that all things come to an end
but then again, i'm, i'm not alone
 

i get out, i'll get out of all your boxes
i get out, you can't hold me in these chains
i'll get out, father free me from this bondage
knowin' my condition is the reason i must change

your stinking resolution is no type of solution
preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
i won't support your lie no more
i won't even try no more
if i have to die, oh lord, that's how i choose to live
i won't be compromised no more
i can't be victimized no more
i just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now i understand
you just wanna use me
you say "love" then abuse me
you never thought you'd lose me
but how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
you thought i'd stay here hurtin'
your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘cause now i'm choosin' life, yo
i'll take the sacrifice, yo
if everything must go, then go: that's how i choose to live

heh… hehehehehe…
ok, we gettin' there
at least i had a chunk
aight, okay, it's how i choose to live
hehehe, awww
no more compromises
i see past your disguises
blinding me through mind control
stealing my eternal soul
appealing through material
to keep me as your slave

but i get out, oh, i get out of all your boxes
i'll get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
i get out, oh, i want out of social bondage
knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason i must change

see, what you see is what you get
oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
oh, i don't care if you're upset
i could care less if you're upset
see, it don't change the truth
and your hurt feeling's no excuse
to keep me in this box, psychological locks
repressin' true expression
cementin' this repression
promotin' mass deception
so that no one can be healed
i don't respect your system
i won't protect your system
when you talk i don't listen
oh, let my father's will be done
and just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
knowin' my condition is the reason i must change

i've just accepted what you said
keeping me among the dead
the only way to know is to walk to learn and grow
but faith is not your speed
oh, you’d have everyone believe
that you're the sole authority
just follow the majority
afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
oh, and escape this mind control
you spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
are you sure it's god you serving?
obligated to a system
getting less then you're deserving
who made up these schools, i say
who made up these rules, i say
animal conditioning, oh, just to keep us as a slave
oh, just get out of this social purgatory
just get out, all these traditions are a lie
just get out, superstition killin' freedom
knowin' my condition is the reason i must die, ahh

just get out, just get out, just get out
let's get out, let's get out
knowin' my condition
is the reason i must die, just get out 

i was just a little girl
skinny legs, a press and curl
my mother always thought i'd be a star
but way before the record deals
streets that nurtured lauryn hill
made sure that i'd never go too far

every ghetto, every city

story starts in hootaville
grew up next to ivy hill
when kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
"kill the guy" in carter park
rode a mongoose 'til it's dark
watching kids show off the stolen ones

every ghetto, every city

july 4th races outside parker
fireworks at martin stadium
the untouchable p.s.p
where all them crazy niggas be
and car thieves got away through irvington
hillside brings beef with the cops
self destruction record drops
and everybody's name was muslim (children playing, women producing)
sensations and eighty-eight
attracted kids from out of state

time to get free, or give yourselves up now
it's freedom, said it's freedom time

yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
for the dominion
who will dominate the opinion
skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
conformin' our vision
to the world church's decision
trapped in a section
submitted to committee election
moral infection
epidemic lies and deception
insurrection
of the highest possible order
destortin' our tape recorders
from hearin' like under water
beyond the borders
find the sin in disorder
bound by the strategy
a systematic depravity
heavy as gravity
head first in the cavity
without a bottom
a fate, worse than sodom
what's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
truth comes, we can't hear it
when you've been, programmed to fear it
i had a vision i was fallin' in indescision
apallin', callin' religious
some program on television
how can, dominant wisdom
be recognized in the system
of anti-christ, the majority rules
intelligent fools
phds in illusion
masters of mass confusion
bachelors in past delusion
now who you choosin'?
the head, or the tail
the bloodshed of the male
or confidence in the tale
conferences is yale
discussin' doctrines of baal
causin' people to fail
keepin' the third in jail
his word has nailed
everything to the tree
severing all of me
from all that i used to be
formless and void
totally paranoid
enjoy darkness as lord
keepin' me from the sword
block for mercy
bitter than cerasee
hungry and thirsty
for good meat we would eat
and still, dined at the table of deceit
how incomplete
from confrontation to retreat
we belong, in true enemies defeat
destitute in a necessity
causin' desperation to get the best of me
punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
realizin' the inescapable death of me
no options in the valley of decision
the only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
inwardly, only water can purge the heart
from words to fiery darts
thrown by the workers of the arts
iniquity, shapen in
there's no escapin' when
your whole philosophy is paper thin
in vanity
the wide road is insanity
could it be all of humanity
picture that
scripture that
the origin of a man's heart is black
how can we show up for
an invisible war
preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
achin' in sores
babylon, the great mystery
mother of human history
system of social sorcery
our present condition
needs serious recognition
where there's no repentance there can be no admission
and that sentence, more serious than vietnam
the atom bomb and saddam and minister farrakhan
what's goin' on, what's a priority to you
by what authority do to you
the majority hasn't a clue
we majored in curses
search the chapters, check the verses
recapture the land
remove the mark from off of our hands
so we can stand
in agreement with his command
everything else is damned
let them with ears understand
everything else is damned, let them with ears understand
it's freedom, said it's freedom time now
it's freedom, said it's freedom time now
it's freedom, i'mma be who i am
it's freedom time, said it's freedom time
everybody knows that they've lied
everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
everybody knows that they guilty, yes
resting on their conscience eating their insides
get free, be who you're supposed to be
freedom, said it's freedom time now
freedom, said it's freedom time
freedom, freedom time now
