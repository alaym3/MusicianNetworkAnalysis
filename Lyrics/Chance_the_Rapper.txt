move to the neighborhood; i bet they don't stay for good, watch
somebody'll steal daddy's rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
captain save-a-hood, hood savior, baby boy
still getting id'd for swishers (mama still wash my clothes)
still with the save money militia (i'ma still watch my bros)
trapped in the middle of the map
with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
that, with a literary knack
and a little shitty mac, and like literally jack

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips

why you think they don't talk about it? they deserted us here
where the fuck is matt lauer at?

probably scared of all the refugees
look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
they'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
i mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
down here, it's easier to find a gun
than it is to find a fucking parking spot
no love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'cause they've never been in our position
getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i remember when
this age of pathetics
don't forget the happy thoughts
all you need is happy thoughts
the past tense, past bed time
way back then when everything we read was real
and everything we said rhymed
wide eyed kids being kids
why did you stop?
what did you do to your hair?
where did you go to end up right back here?
when did you start to forget how to fly?
it's so natural
tastes like juicy fruit
works like a magic trick
please give me half of that
we don't, we don't, we don't
don't you color out

they want four-minute songs
you need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn

hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh

the empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek
the masochism that you preach
practice backflips, tragic actress
on a movie with no screen
when the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

my druggy, when i'm ugly, hug me
when i'm bummy, scummy, i'm your hubby
let's get lost, let's get lost
igh

kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
the richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
spineless bitches in backless dresses
wore my feelings on my sleeveless
my weed seedless, my trees leafless
i miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
and back when mike jackson was still jesus
before i believed in not believing in
yeah, i inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
my big homie died young, just turned older than him
i seen it happen, i seen it happen, i see it always
he still be screaming, i see his demons in empty hallways
i trip to make the fall shorter
fall quarter was just a tall order
and i'm hungry, i'm just not that thirsty
as of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
and all my words just mean controversy
took the team up off my back, like "that's not your jersey?"
stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping i don't get picked
all this medicine in me hoping i don't get sick
making all of this money hoping i don't get rich
'cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
sometimes the truth don't rhyme
sometime the lies get millions of views
funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
from your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
i think love is beautiful too
building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
for future hoopers dead from rugers
shooting through the empty alley
could've threw him an alley-oop
helping him do good in school
damn that acid burn when it clean ya
i still miss being a senior
and performing at all those open mic events
eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
and i still get jealous of vic
and vic's still jealous of me
but if you touch my brother
all that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
and the rest of your team
smoking cigarettes to look cooler
i only stop by to look through ya
and i'm only getting greedier
and i'm still mr. youmedia
and i still can't find talent
and i'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
mom still thinks i should go back to school
and justin still think i'm good enough
and mama jan still don't take her meds
and i still be asking god to show his face
and i still be asking god to show his face

i am a new man, i am sanctified
oh, i am holy, i have been baptized
i have been born again, i am the white light
rain, rain don't go away
igh!

angels (na-na, na-na, ah)

i got my city doing front flips
when every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
i guess that's why they call it where i stay
clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play

'til they fuck around, sign me to ovo
ooh, i just might share my next one with keef

got us scared to let our grandmamas outside
you gon' make me take the campers way downtown
you gon' make me turn my bm to my housewife
i just had a growth spurt
it done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
you can keep the nose ring, i don't have to soul search
i'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
grandma say i'm kosher, mama say i'm culture
gci, 107.5, angel goin' live

you couldn't stand me, i couldn't stand you
you said i'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
your big brother footwork, your play sister juke
the rink was the place, but in that space and time i was too young for you
as you were for me, too worried 'bout frooties and chews
'til i found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
and realized what booties could do

we gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'

maybe you and i were meant to be, maybe (juke), i'm crazy (juke)

we never rolled at the rink, we would just go to the rink
you ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the rink
you had a nigga, i couldn't stand him
but when they play "take you down," chris brown, i am his stand-in
i mean, it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
then i put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
to see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

we've got so much history, baby (that's right, that's right), maybe (that's right, that's right)
maybe you and i were meant to be, maybe i'm crazy
crazy 'bout you

i used to tell hoes i was dark light or off-white
but i'd fight if a nigga said that i talk white
and both my parents was black
but they saw it fit that i talk right
with my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
but gravity had me up in a submission hold
like i'm dancing with the devil with two left feet and i'm pigeon-toed
in two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
and two missing toes
but it's love like cupid kissing a mistletoe

nice to see you, father new year
middle finger uncle samuel
shooting death with weighted dice
and hitting stains on birthday candles
i know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'cause they help me beat my demon's ass

like cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
the type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
with babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2pac had taught
obviously, they are on a come up
with better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
all odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than lucky
you're ending happy, that's only a tugging
like satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
ugh, how father time a deadbeat? maybe i'm adopted
that'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh

everybody's somebody's everything, nigga
nobody's nothing, nigga
everybody's somebody's everything, nigga
nobody's nothing at all

everybody's somebody's everything
that's right
nobody's nothing
i know you're right
