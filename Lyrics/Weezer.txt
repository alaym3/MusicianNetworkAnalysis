i can't control my brain

we'll run away together
we'll spend some time forever
we'll never feel bad anymore

i'm the epitome of public enemy

come down on the street and dance with me

i'm a lot like you, so please
hello, i'm here, i'm waiting
i think i'd be good for you
and you'd be good for me

i asked you to go to the green day concert
you said you never heard of them (how cool is that?)
how cool is that? so i went to your room
and read your diary
"watching grunge leg drop new jack through a press table"
and then my heart stopped, "listening to cio-cio san
fall in love all over again" (ow)

i'm a lot like you, so please
hello, i'm here, i'm waiting (oh, what could it be now?)
i think i'd be good for you
and you'd be good for me

how stupid is it? i can't talk about it
i gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
how stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute?
just come up to me and say hello to my heart
how stupid is it? for all i know you want me too
and maybe you just don't know what to do
or maybe you're scared to say
"i'm falling for you"

i wish i could get my head out of the sand
'cause i think we'd make a good team
and you would keep my fingernails clean
but that's just a stupid dream that i won't realize
'cause i can't even look in your eyes
without shaking and i ain't faking
i'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

i'm a lot like you, so please
hello, i'm here, i'm waiting (waiting, oh)
i think i'd be good for you
and you'd be good for me (oh-hoo)

(i'm a lot like you) i'm a lot like you
(i'm a lot like you) i'm waiting, oh
i think i'd be good for you
and you'd be good for me, woo

when i'm stable long enough
i start to look around for love
see a sweet in floral print
my mind begins the arrangements
but when i start to feel that pull
turns out i just pulled myself
she would never go with me
were i the last girl on earth

i'm dumb, she's a lesbian
i thought i had found the one
we were good as married in my mind
but married in my mind's no good
oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
let me know the truth, let me know the truth

might have smoked a few in my time
but never thought it was a crime
knew the day would surely come
when i'd chill and settle down
when i think i've found a good old-fashioned girl
then she put me in my place
everyone's a little queer
oh, can't she be a little straight?

i'm dumb, she's a lesbian
i thought i had found the one
we were good as married in my mind
but married in my mind's no good
oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
let me know the truth, let me know the truth

i'm dumb, she's a lesbian
i thought i had found the one, oh
we were good as married in my mind
but married in my mind's no good, oh
pink triangle on her sleeve
let me know the truth, let me know the truth
i'm dumb, she's a lesbian
i thought i had found the one, oh
we were good as married in my mind
but married in my mind's no good
oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
let me know the truth, let me know the truth
let me know the truth
let me know the truth

i can't help my feelings, i'll go out of my mind
these players come to get me cause they'd like my behind
i can't love my business if i can't get a trick
down on santa monica where tricks are for kids

oh, come on and kick me
oh, come on and kick me
(woah) come on and kick me
(woah) you've got your problems

(oh) you've got your big g's
i've got my hash pipe

i can't help my boogies, they get out of control
i know that you don't care but i want you to know
the knee-stocking flavor is a favorite treat
of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

oh, come on and kick me
oh, come on and kick me
(whoa) come on and kick me

where i come from isn't all that great
my automobile is a piece of crap
my fashion sense is a little whack
and my friends are just as screwed as me
i didn't go to boarding schools
preppy girls never looked at me
why should they? i ain't nobody
got nothing in my pocket

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
livin' in beverly hills

look at all those movie stars
they're all so beautiful and clean
when the housemaids scrub the floors
they get the spaces in between
i wanna live a life like that
i wanna be just like a king
take my picture by the pool
cause i'm the next big thing

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
livin' in beverly hills


the truth is
i don't stand a chance
it's something that you're born into
and i just don't belong

no i don't, i'm just a no class, beat down fool
and i will always be that way
i might as well enjoy my life
and watch the stars play

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(gimme gimme, gimme gimme)

my name is jonas, i'm carryin' the wheel
thanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel
come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea
just like grandma made when we couldn't find sleep
things were better then, once but never again
we've all left the den, let me tell you about it

the choo-choo train left right on time
a ticket cost only your mind
the driver said, "hey man, we go all the way"
of course we were willing to pay

my name is wepeel, got a box full of your toys
they're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise, making noise
tell me what to do now the tank is dry
now this wheel is flat and you know what else?
guess what i received in the mail today
words of deep concern from my little brother

the building's not goin' as he planned
the foreman has injured his hand
the dozer will not clear a path
the driver swears he learned his math

the workers are going home, the workers are going home
the workers are going home, the workers are going home, yeah

the workers are going home, the workers are going home
the workers are going home, yeah, yeah, yeah

my name is jonas

the girl in the pastry shop with the net in her
hair is making a cannoli for you to
take on your hiking trip in the woods with your
bros that you've known since second grade and you
may encounter dragons or ruffians and be
called upon to employ your testosterone
in a battle for supremacy and access to
females glued to the tv
and even if you are victorious you may receive
many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
and you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
and tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
and when you come home she will be there
waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
and a big fat cannoli to shove
in your mouth, and that's why you

thank god for girls
holla jesu christe, from tennessee to la
thank god for girls
on your reckoning day, you better bow down and pray

she's so big, she's so strong
she's so energetic in her sweaty overalls
thank god for girls (thank god for girls)
thank god for girls (thank god for girls), thank god for girls

i'm so glad i got a girl to think of
even though she isn't mine
i think about her all the day and all the night
it's enough to know that she's alive
she says i give her sweaty palms, she almost had a heart attack
the truth is that i'm just as scared i don't know how to act
i wish that i could get to know her better, but meeting up
in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
i carved her name into all the trees
sang a song down on one knee
looking at the underwear page of the sears catalog
like when i was 14
i'm levitating like a magnet turned
the wrong way around
i'm like an indian fakir tryna meditate on a
bed of nails with my pants pulled down

thank god for girls
holla jesu christe, from tennessee to la
thank god for girls
on your reckoning day, you better bow down and pray

she's so big, she's so strong
she's so energetic in her sweaty overalls
thank god for girls (thank god for girls)
thank god for girls (thank god for girls), thank god for girls

god took a rib from adam
ground it up in a centrifuge machine
mixed it with cardamom and cloves
microwaved it on the popcorn setting
while adam was like, "ooh ooh! that really hurts!"
going off into the tundra
so pissed at god
and he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
messing with the bees who were trying
to pollinate the echinacea, until god said
"i'ma smite you with loneliness
and break your heart in two!"
and adam wept and wailed
tearing out his hair
falling on his knees, looked to
the sky and said, "thank god..."

they say i need some rogaine to put in my hair
working out at the gym to fit my underwear
oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
you'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool

i'ma do the things that i wanna do
i ain't got a thing to prove to you
i'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
excuse my manners if i make a scene

i ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
i'm fine and dandy with the me inside
one look in the mirror and i'm tickled pink
i don't give a hoot about what you think

everyone likes to dance to a happy song, hey, hey
with a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along, hey, hey
timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts, hey!

you are eighteen year-old girl who live in small city of japan
you heard me on the radio about one year ago and you wanted to know
all about me and my hobbies
my favorite food and my birthday

why are you so far away from me?
i need help and you're way across the sea
i could never touch you, i think it would be wrong
i've got your letter, you've got my song

they don't make stationery like this where i'm from
so fragile, so refined
so i sniff (so i sniff)
and i lick (and i lick)
your envelope and fall to little pieces every time (your envelope and fall to)
i wonder what clothes you wear to school
i wonder how you decorate your room
i wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea

why are you so far away from me?
i need help and you're way across the sea
i could never touch you, i think it would be wrong
i've got your letter, you've got my song

at ten, i shaved my head and tried to be a monk
i thought the older women would like me if i did
you see, ma, i'm a good little boy (good little boy)
it's all your fault, mama, it's all your fault (it's all your fault)

goddamn, this business is really lame
i gotta live on an island to find the juice

when i look in the mirror
i can't believe what i see
tell me, who's that funky dude
staring back at me?
broken, beaten down, can't even get around
without an old man cane, i fall and hit the ground
shivering in the cold, i'm bitter and alone (woo)

excuse the bitching
i shouldn't complain
i should have no feeling
'cause feeling is pain
as everything i need is denied me
and everything i want is taken away from me
but who do i got to blame? nobody but me

and i don't wanna be an old man anymore
it's been a year or two since i was out on the floor
shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
it's time i got back to the good life

it's time i got back, it's time i got back
and i don't even know how i got off the track
i wanna go back, yeah

screw this crap, i've had it (i've had it)
i ain't no mr. cool

you can't resist her, she's in your bones
she is your marrow, and your ride home
you can't avoid her, she's in the air (in the air)
in between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide

only in dreams, we see what it means
reach out our hands, hold onto hers
but when we wake, it's all been erased
and so it seems, only in dreams

you walk up to her, ask her to dance
she says, "hey, baby, i just might take the chance"
you say, "it's a good thing that you float in the air (in the air)
that way, there's no way i will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces"

only in dreams, we see what it means
reach out our hands, hold onto hers
but when we wake, it's all been erased
and so it seems, only in dreams

only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams
only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams

i'm tired, so tired

yesterday, i went outside
with my mama's mason jar
caught a lovely butterfly
when i woke up today
looked in on my fairy pet
she had withered all away
no more sighing in her breast

i'm sorry for what i did
i did what my body told me to
i didn't mean to do you harm
every time i pin down what i think i want, it slips away
the ghost slips away

smell you on my hand for days
i can't wash away your scent
if i'm a dog, then you're a bitch
i guess you're as real as me
maybe i can live with that
maybe i need fantasy
life of chasing butterfly

i'm sorry for what i did
i did what my body told me to
i didn't mean to do you harm
every time i pin down what i think i want, it slips away
the ghost slips away

i told you i would return
when the robin makes his nest
but i ain't never coming back

i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i'm sorry

 (spoken)

crush up the blue and inhale through your nose
scrape every quark from the wood in the floor

she said, "do you wanna get high? don’t eat no dinner tonight
i took a road trip to mexico and scored a hundred count
do you wanna get high? it’s like we’re falling in love
we can listen to bacharach and stop at any point"

now our bones start to ache as we cramp on the pot
and we fall to the floor with our face in a knot

she said, "do you wanna get high? don’t eat no dinner tonight
i took a road trip to mexico and scored a hundred count
do you wanna get high? it’s like we’re falling in love
we can listen to bacharach and stop at any point"

keep on doing what you do ‘cuz i’ll never get tired of you
don’t need booze, ‘cuz i’ll never get tired of you
stop the tape, kill the lights, close the drapes
and keep doing what you do, ‘cuz i’ll never get tired of you


she said, "do you wanna get high? don’t eat no dinner tonight
i took a road trip to mexico and scored a hundred count
do you wanna get high? it’s like we’re falling in love
we can listen to bacharach and stop at any point"

sleeping with mother theresa, drifting in a lone fantasia
brahmin you recite the veda, beautiful as euthanasia...

"어느 회사 제품이죠?"

holy cow, i think i've got one here
now just what am i supposed to do?
i've got a number of irrational fears
that i'd like to share with you
first, there's rules about old goats like me
hanging 'round with chicks like you
but i do like you and another one
you say "like" too much

but i'm shaking at your touch, i like you way too much
my baby, i'm afraid i'm falling for you
i'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
or maybe i would rather settle down with you, oh

holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
just as i was busting loose
i gotta go turn in my rock star card
and get fat and old with you
'cause i'm a burning candle, you're a gentle moth
teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
and i do like you, you're the lucky one
no, i'm the lucky one

i'm shaking at your touch, i like you way too much
my baby, i'm afraid i'm falling for you
i'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
or maybe i would rather settle down with you


holy sweet goddamn
you left your cello in the basement
i admired the glowing stars
and tried to play a tune
i can't believe how bad i suck, it's true
what could you possibly see in little ol' three chord me?
but i do like you and you like me too
i'm ready, let's do it, baby

i'm shaking at your touch, i like you way too much
my baby, i'm afraid i'm falling for you
i'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
or maybe i would rather settle down

(down)
with you (you)
down (down)
with you (you)
oh
