for awhile, to love was all we could do
we were young and we knew
in our eyes, we're alive
deep inside we knew our love was true
for awhile, we paid no mind to the past
we knew love would last
every night, something right
would invite us to begin the day

something happened along the way
what used to be happy was sad
something happened along the way
and yesterday was all we had

and, oh, after the love has gone
how could you lead me on
and not let me stay around?
oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
what used to be right is wrong
can love that's lost be found?

for awhile, to love each other with all
we would ever need
love was strong for so long
never knew that what was wrong
oh, baby, wasn't right
we tried to find what we had
'til sadness was all we shared
we were scared
this affair would lead our love in two

something happened along the way
yesterday was all we had
something happened along the way
what used to be happy is sad
something happened along the way
oh, and yesterday was all we had

and, oh, after the love has gone
how could you lead me on
and not let me stay around?
oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
what used to be right is wrong
can love that's lost be found?
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

we write a song

(oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
and no matter how you try to hide, it states your case
now a frown will bring your spirits down to the ground
and never let you see the good things all around
every time we seem to let our feelings flow
our luck run out and the wind won't blow

but that can't make me sad, just can't make me
woah, 'cause i've been there before, don't wanna go no more
won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
while you run your race, keep a smilin' face
help you set your pace
(oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
we wonder how your attitude is going down
is it waking and shaking and safe and sound?
every time we seem to let our feelings flow
our luck runs out and the wind won't blow

but that can't make me sad, just can't make me
woah, 'cause i've been there before, don't wanna go no more
won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
while you run your race, keep a smilin' face
life is on your case

yes it is, yeah
this world can't shake me (this world can't shake me)
bad times can't make me sad
woah, 'cause i've been there before, don't wanna go no more
won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
(oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

you can't shake me the way i feel today
come tomorrow, i'll feel the same old way
ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
yeah, yeah, yeah
wake me, my heart is feeling glad
i'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
use the sunshine in your heart (oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

you can't shake me the way i feel today
come tomorrow, i'll feel the same old way
i start to wonder what's goin' down, gotta feel it, feel it
wake me, my heart is feeling glad
i'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
i start to wonder what's going down
in your life, is it safe and sound?
i start to wonder, is your life alright?
are you dealing with it every day it cause you strife?
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)
