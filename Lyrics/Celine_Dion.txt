every night in my dreams
i see you, i feel you
that is how i know you go on
far across the distance
and spaces between us
you have come to show you go on

near, far, wherever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more, you open the door
and you're here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

love can touch us one time
and last for a lifetime
and never let go 'til we're gone
love was when i loved you
one true time i'd hold to
in my life, we'll always go on

near, far, wherever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more, you open the door
and you're here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

you're here, there's nothing i fear
and i know that my heart will go on
we'll stay forever this way
you are safe in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

how does a moment last forever?
how can a story never die?
it is love we must hold onto
never easy, but we try
sometimes our happiness is captured
somehow, our time and place stand still
love lives on inside our hearts and always will

minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
but when all else has been forgotten
still our song lives on

maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
maybe some memories not so sweet
but we have to know some bad times
or our lives are incomplete
then when the shadows overtake us
just when we feel all hope is gone
we’ll hear our song and know once more
our love lives on

how does a moment last forever?
how does our happiness endure?
through the darkest of our troubles
love is beauty, love is pure
love pays no mind to desolation
it flows like a river through the soul
protects, proceeds, and perseveres
and makes us whole

minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
but when all else has been forgotten
still our song lives on

how does a moment last forever
when our song lives on

what's left to say?
these prayers ain't working anymore
every word shot down in flames
what's left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
i'm losing my voice calling on you

'cause i've been shaking
i've been bending backwards till i'm broke
watching all these dreams go up in smoke

let beauty come out of ashes
let beauty come out of ashes
and when i pray to god all i ask is
can beauty come out of ashes?

can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?
'cause i need you here, woah

'cause i've been shaking
i've been bending backwards till i'm broke
watching all these dreams go up in smoke

let beauty come out of ashes
let beauty come out of ashes
and when i pray to god all i ask is
can beauty come out of ashes?

can beauty come out of ashes?

for all those times you stood by me
for all the truth that you made me see
for all the joy you brought to my life
for all the wrong that you made right
for every dream you made come true
for all the love i found in you
i would be forever thankful, baby
you're the one who held me up
never let me fall
you're the one who saw me through, through it all

you were my strength when i was weak
you were my voice when i couldn't speak
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'cause you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me

you gave me wings and made me fly
you touched my hand, i could touch the sky
i lost my faith, you gave it back to me
you said no star was out of reach
you stood by me and i stood tall
i had your love, i had it all
i'm grateful for each day you gave me
maybe i don't know that much
but i know this much is true
i was blessed because i was loved by you

you were my strength when i was weak (you were my strength)
you were my voice when i couldn't speak
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'cause you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me

you were always there for me
the tender wind that carried me
a light in the dark, shining your love into my life
you've been my inspiration
through the lies, you were the truth
my world is a better place because of you

you were my strength when i was weak (you were my strength)
you were my voice when i couldn't speak (when i couldn't speak)
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'cause you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me
you were my strength when i was weak
you were my voice when i couldn't speak (my voice)
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'cause you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me
oh

i'm everything i am
because you loved me

j'ai compris tous les mots
j'ai bien compris, merci
raisonnable et nouveau
c'est ainsi par ici
que les choses ont changé
que les fleurs ont fané
que le temps d'avant
c'était le temps d'avant
que si tout zappe et lasse
les amours aussi passent

il faut que tu saches

j'irai chercher ton cœur
si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses
d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton âme
dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts
pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore

fallait pas commencer
m'attirer me toucher
fallait pas tant donner
moi je sais pas jouer
on me dit qu'aujourd'hui
on me dit que les autres font ainsi
je ne suis pas les autres
avant que l'on s'attache
avant que l'on se gache

je veux que tu saches

j'irai chercher ton cœur
si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses
d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton ame
dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts
pour que tu m'aimes encore

je trouverai des langages
pour chanter tes louanges
je ferai nos bagages
pour d'infinies vendanges
les formules magiques
des marabouts d'afrique
j'les dirai sans remords
pour que tu m'aimes encore

je m'inventerai reine
pour que tu me retiennes
je me ferai nouvelle
pour que le feu reprenne
je deviendrai ces autres
qui te donnent du plaisir
vos jeux seront les nôtres
si tel est ton désir
plus brillante plus belle
pour une autre étincelle
je me changerai en or
pour que tu m'aimes encore

pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore
tu m'aimes, tu m'aimes
tu m'aimes encore


i understood all the words, i well understood, thanks
reasonable and new, that's the way here
things have changed, that flowers get fade
that the time before, was the time before
if all zap and tire, loves also go by

you must know

i'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
even if in your dances others dance your hours
i'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
i'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

shouldn't begin tease me touch me
shouldn't give so much i don't know how to play
they say that today, they say others do so
i'm not the others
before we attach to the other, before we spoil each other
je veux que tu saches
i want you to know

i'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
even if in your dances others dance your hours
i'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
i'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

i'll find languages to sing your praises
i'll make my luggage’s for infinite vintages
magic spells from african priests
i'll say them without remorse for you to still love me

i'll name myself queen for you to hold me
i'll make myself new to let the fire restart
i'll become these others who give you pleasure
your games will be ours if that's your wish
more brilliant more beautiful for another spark
i'll change myself into gold for you to still love me

the whispers in the morning
of lovers sleeping tight
are rolling by like thunder now
as i look in your eyes
i hold on to your whole body
and feel each move you make
your voice is warm and tender
a love that i could not forsake

'cause i'm your lady
and you are my man
whenever you reach for me
i'll do all that i can

lost is how i'm feeling
lying in your arms
when the world outside's too much to take
that all ends when i'm with you
even though there may be times
it seems i'm far away
never wonder where i am
'cause i am always by your side

'cause i'm your lady
and you are my man
whenever you reach for me
i'll do all that i can

we're heading for something
somewhere i've never been
sometimes i am frightened, but i'm ready to learn
of the power of love

the sound of your heart beating
made it clear suddenly
the feeling that i can't go on
is light years away

'cause i'm your lady
and you are my man
whenever you reach for me
i'm gonna do all that i can

we're heading for something
somewhere i've never been
sometimes i am frightened, but i'm ready to learn
of the power of love

the power of love
the power of love
sometimes i am frightened, but i'm ready to learn
of the power of love
the power of love

there were nights when the wind was so cold
that my body froze in bed
if i just listened to it
right outside the window
there were days when the sun was so cruel
that all the tears turned to dust
and i just knew my eyes were
drying up forever
i finished crying in the instant that you left
and i can't remember where or when or how
and i banished every memory you and i had ever made

but when you touch me like this
and you hold me like that
i just have to admit
that it's all coming back to me
when i touch you like this
and i hold you like that
it's so hard to believe but
it's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

there were moments of gold
and there were flashes of light
there were things i'd never do again
but then they'd always seemed right
there were nights of endless pleasure
it was more than any laws allow
baby, baby

if i kiss you like this
and if you whisper like that
it was lost long ago
but it's all coming back to me
if you want me like this
and if you need me like that
it was dead long ago
but it's all coming back to me
it's so hard to resist
and it's all coming back to me
i can barely recall
but it's all coming back to me now
but it's all coming back

there were those empty threats and hollow lies
and whenever you tried to hurt me
i just hurt you even worse
and so much deeper
there were hours that just went on for days
when alone at last we'd count up all the chances
that were lost to us forever
but you were history with the slamming of the door
and i made myself so strong again somehow
and i never wasted any of my time on you since then

but if i touch you like this
and if you kiss me like that
it was so long ago
but it's all coming back to me
if you touch me like this
and if i kiss you like that
it was gone with the wind
but it's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

there were moments of gold
and there were flashes of light
there were things we'd never do again
but then they'd always seemed right
there were nights of endless pleasure
it was more than all your laws allow
baby, baby, baby

when you touch me like this
and when you hold me like that
it was gone with the wind
but it's all coming back to me
when you see me like this
and when i see you like that
then we see what we want to see
all coming back to me
the flesh and the fantasies
all coming back to me
i can barely recall
but it's all coming back to me now

if you forgive me all this
if i forgive you all that
we forgive and forget
and it's all coming back to me
when you see me like this
and when i see you like that
we see just what we want to see
all coming back to me
the flesh and the fantasies
all coming back to me
i can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

(it's all coming back to me now)
and when you kiss me like this
(it's all coming back to me now)
and when i touch you like that
(it's all coming back to me now)
if you do it like this
(it's all coming back to me now)
and if we

when i was young
i never needed anyone
and making love was just for fun
those days are gone
livin' alone
i think of all the friends i've known
when i dial the telephone
nobody's home

all by myself
don't wanna be
all by myself
anymore

hard to be sure
sometimes i feel so insecure
and loves so distant and obscure
remains the cure

all by myself
don't wanna be
all by myself
anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live
all by myself
anymore

when i was young
i never needed anyone
making love was just for fun
those days are gone

all by myself
don't wanna be
all by myself
anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live
oh
don't wanna live
by myself, by myself
anymore
by myself
anymore
oh
all by myself
don't wanna live
i never, never, never
needed anyone

oh, i didn't mean to fall in deep, but i've no regrets
you tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
i gave you my heart, you took the key
but now i paid my debt, it's time i left

and i don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
and i've just enough left to help me pack my bags
yes, i have found something i thought i lost
i found me, i found faith, i found trust

you can't take this from me
can't you see i won’t take this lying down?
and i can hear you when you speak your poison
bitter words can't hurt me now
i won't take it lying down


all it takes is one bold move to change everything
all it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
but i'm having some kind of breakthrough
i'm ready to live

i don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
and i've just enough left to help me pack my bags
yes, i have found something i thought i lost
i found me, i found faith, i found trust

you can't take this from me
can't you see i won’t take this lying down?
and i can hear you when you speak your poison
bitter words can't hurt me now
i won't take it lying down

i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down

you can't take this from me
can't you see i won’t take this lying down?
and i can hear you when you speak your poison
bitter words can't hurt me now
i won't take it lying down

i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down
i won't take it lying down

you're the bravest of hearts, you're the strongest of souls
you're my light in the dark, you're the place i call home
you can say it's all right, but i know that you're breaking up inside
i see it in your eyes
even you face the night afraid and alone
that's why i'll be there

when the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
ev'ry beat of my heart, ev'ry day without end
ev'ry second i live, that's the promise i make
baby, that's what i'll give, if that's what it takes
if that's what it takes

you can sleep in my arms, you don't have to explain
when your heart's crying out, baby, whisper my name
'cause i've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above
you've given me your love
when your smile like the sun that shines through the pain
that's why i'll be there

when the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
ev'ry beat of my heart, ev'ry day without end
i will stand like a rock, i will bend till i break
till there's no more to give, if that's what it takes
i will risk everything, i will fight, i will bleed
i will lay down my life, if that's what you need
ev'ry second i live, that's the promise i make
baby, that's what i'll give, if that's what it takes

through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire
when the fear rises up, when the wave's ever higher
i will lay down my heart, my body, my soul
i will hold on all night and never let go
ev'ry second i live, that's the promise i make
baby, that's what i'll give, if that's what it takes

if that's what it takes
every day
if that's what it takes
every day

i try to give all of myself to you
but before i can get there

yeah, i got my own imperfections

but, before i can love you
i need to learn to love myself

it's an uphill climb, and i'm feeling sorry
but i know it will come to you, yeah

in this thing called love

when you want it the most, there's no easy way out
when you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
don't give up on your faith
love comes to those who believe it
and that's the way it is

when you question me for a simple answer
i don't know what to say, no
but it's plain to see, if you stick together
you're gonna find a way, yeah

so don't surrender, 'cause you can win
in this thing called love

when you want it the most, there's no easy way out
when you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
don't give up on your faith (don't give up on your faith)
love comes to those who believe it

and loneliness starts to call (loneliness starts)

love comes to those who believe it
and that's the way it is

i would be lying if i said i'm fine
i think of you at least a hundred times
'cause in the echo of my voice i hear your words
just like you're there
i still come home from a long day
so much to talk about, so much to say
i love to think that we're still making plans
in conversations that'll never end
in conversations that'll never end

courage, don't you dare fail me now
i need you to keep away the doubts
i'm staring in the face of something new
you're all i got to hold on to
so, courage, don't you dare fail me now

not one to hide from the truth, i know
it's outta my hands but i won't let you go
there's no replacing the way you touched me
i still feel the rush
sometimes it drowns me 'til i can't breathe
thinking it's only in our memories
but then i talk to you like i did then
in conversations that will never end

courage, don't you dare fail me now
i need you to keep away the doubts
i'm staring in the face of something new
you're all i got to hold on to
so, courage, don't you dare fail me now

'cause it's not easy when you're not with me
this world of madness goes faster now
and it's a train wreck, but i won't crash yet
long as your echo never fades out

courage, don't you dare fail me now
'cause it's not easy when you're not with me
this world of madness goes faster now
and it's a train wreck, but i won't crash yet
long as your echo never fades out
courage, don't you dare fail me now

i am recovering
the faith of a child
by a part of my heart
i was reckless and wild

i am recovering
the hope that i lost
the part of my soul
that paid the cost

little by little, day by day
one step at a time
shake off the devil, oh
take back my peace of mind

i am recovering
anxiety addict
a broken perfectionist
somewhat erratic

i am recovering
a constant regretter
hold it against her
at least till forever

little by little, day by day
one step at a time
shake off the devil, oh
take back my peace of mind

hold me
as i fall apart, baby
hold me
here in the dark
'cause the old me
run just as far as i could from my heart
well, i'm going back to the start

little by little, day by day
one step at a time
shake off the devil, oh
take back my peace of mind
tell him i love him, yeah
take back my peace of mind

a new day has come
a new day has come

i was waiting for so long
for a miracle to come
everyone told me to be strong
hold on and don't shed a tear
through the darkness and good times
i knew i'd make it through
and the world thought i had it all
but i was waiting for you

hush, now
i see a light in the sky
oh, it's almost blinding me
i can't believe i've been touched by an angel with love

let the rain come down and wash away my tears
let it fill my soul and drown my fears (drown my fears)
let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

a new day has come
a new day has come
come

where it was dark, now there’s light
where there was pain, now there's joy
where there was weakness, i found my strength
all in the eyes of a boy

hush, now
i see a light in the sky
oh, it's almost blinding me
i can't believe i've been touched by an angel with love

let the rain come down and wash away my tears
let it fill my soul and drown my fears (drown my fears)
let it shatter the walls for a new sun

a new day has come
a new day has come
(mmm, ooh-ooh)

let the rain come down and wash away my tears
let it fill my soul and drown my fears (drown my fears)
let it shatter the walls for a new sun
a new day has come
a new day has come

ohh, a light
hush, now
i see a light in your eyes
all in the eyes of a boy
(a new day)
i can't believe i've been touched by an angel, with love
(a new day)
i can't believe i've been touched by an angel with love
(a new day)
i can't believe i've been touched by an angel with love
(a new day)

hush, now
(a new day)
rain come down
(a new day)

don't think i can't feel that there's something wrong
you've been the sweetest part of my life for so long
i look in your eyes, there's a distant light
and you and i know there'll be a storm tonight

this is getting serious
are you thinking 'bout you or us?

don't say what you're about to say
look back before you leave my life
be sure before you close that door
before you roll those dice
baby, think twice

baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
for the fire and the faith that was you and me
babe, i know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
'cause when you're half-way up, you're always half-way down

but, baby, this is serious
are you thinking 'bout you or us?
are you thinking 'bout you or us?

don't say what you're about to say
look back before you leave my life
be sure before you close that door
before you roll those dice
baby, think twice

baby, this is serious (this is serious)
are you thinking 'bout you or us, baby?

don't say what you're about to say
(no, no, no, no)
look back before you leave my life
(don't leave my life)
be sure before you close that door
before you roll those dice
baby, think twice
don't do what you're about to do
my everything depends on you
(i depend on you)
whatever it takes, i'll sacrifice
before you roll those dice

don't say what you're about to say
be sure before you leave my life
(don't leave my life)
be sure before you close that door
before you roll those dice
baby, think twice

je voudrais oublier le temps
pour un soupir, pour un instant
une parenthèse après la course
et partir où mon cœur me pousse
je voudrais retrouver mes traces
où est ma vie, où est ma place
et garder l'or de mon passé
au chaud dans mon jardin secret

je voudrais passer l'océan
croiser le vol d'un goéland
penser à tout ce que j'ai vu
ou bien aller vers l'inconnu
je voudrais décrocher la lune
je voudrais même sauver la terre
mais avant tout
je voudrais parler à mon père
parler à mon père
je voudrais choisir un bateau
pas le plus grand ni le plus beau
je le remplirais des images
et des parfums de mes voyages
je voudrais freiner pour m'asseoir
trouver au creux de ma mémoire
des voix de ceux qui m'ont appris
qu'il n'y a pas de rêve interdit
je voudrais trouver les couleurs
des tableaux que j'ai dans le cœur
de ce décor aux lignes pures
où je vous vois et me rassure
je voudrais décrocher la lune
je voudrais même sauver la terre
mais avant tout
je voudrais parler à mon père
parler à mon père

je voudrais oublier le temps
pour un soupir, pour un instant
une parenthèse après la course
et partir où mon cœur me pousse
je voudrais retrouver mes traces
où est ma vie, où est ma place
et garder l'or de mon passé
au chaud dans mon jardin secret

je voudrais partir avec toi
je voudrais rêver avec toi
toujours chercher l'inaccessible
toujours espérer l'impossible
je voudrais décrocher la lune
et pourquoi pas sauver la terre
mais avant tout
je voudrais parler à mon père
parler à mon père
je voudrais parler à mon père
parler à mon père

i want to forget that time exists
for just one shining moment
take a rest after the race
and go where my heart tells me
i want to reconnect with my roots
find my path, my place in life
and keep my treasured memories
hidden in the warmth of my secret garden
i want to swim the ocean wide, spread like an eagle and take flight
think of everything i've seen and even head into the unknown
i want to capture the moon, maybe even save the world
but above all i want to talk to my father
talk to my father...
i want to pick out a boat
not the nicest, not the biggest
i would fill it with all the sights
and smells of my journeys
i want to stop and take a seat
and find within my memory
the voices of those who taught me
to never give up on my dreams
i want to find within my heart, the colours that represent my art
from this decor filled with pure lines, where i see you, which calms my soul
i want to capture the moon, maybe even save the world
but above all, i want to talk to my father
i want to talk to my father...
i want to forget that time exists
for just one shining moment
take a rest after the race
a go where my heart tells me
i want to reconnect with my roots
find my path, my place in life
and keep my treasured memories
hidden away in the warmth of my secret garden
i want to run away with you
i want to dream with you
always seeking the unattainable
always hoping for the impossible
i want to capture the moon
and why not save the world
but above all, i want to talk to my father
i want to talk to my father
talk to my father

i must be crazy now
maybe i dream too much
but when i think of you
i long to feel your touch

to whisper in your ear
words that are old as time
words only you would hear
if only you were mine
i wish i could go back to the very first day i saw you
should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'cause by now i know that you'd feel the way that i do
and i'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

i love you, please say
you love me too, these three words
they could change our lives forever
and i promise you that we will always be together
till the end of time

so today, i finally find the courage deep inside
just to walk right up to your door
but my body can't move when i finally get to it
just like a thousand times before
then without a word he handed me this letter
read i hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

i love you, please say
you love me too, these three words
they could change our lives forever
and i promise you that we will always be together
till the end of time

well maybe i, i need a little love yeah
and maybe i, i need a little care
and maybe i, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
oh you need somebody just to hold you
if you do, just reach out and i'll be there

i love you, please say
you love me too, these three words
they could change our lives forever
and i promise you that we will always be together
till the end of time

these three words
they could change our lives forever
and i promise you that we will always be together
oh, i love you
please say you love me too
please please
say you love me too
till the end of time
my baby
together, together, forever
till the end of time
i love you
i will be your light
shining bright
shining through your eyes
my baby

there's so much life i've left to live
and this fire is burning still
when i watch you look at me
i think i could find the will
to stand for every dream
and forsake this solid ground
and give up this fear within
of what would happen if they ever knew
i'm in love with you

'cause i'd surrender everything
to feel the chance to live again
i reach to you
i know you can feel it too
we'd make it through
a thousand dreams i still believe
i'd make you give them all to me
i'd hold you in my arms and never let go
i surrender

i know i can't survive
another night away from you
you're the reason i go on
and now i need to live the truth
right now, there's no better time
from this fear i will break free
and i'll live again with love
and no they can't take that away from me
and they will see...

i'd surrender everything
to feel the chance to live again
i reach to you
i know you can feel it too
we'd make it through
a thousand dreams i still believe
i'd make you give them all to me
i'd hold you in my arms and never let go
i surrender

every night's getting longer
and this fire is getting stronger, baby
i'll swallow my pride and i'll be alive
can't you hear my call
i surrender all

i'd surrender everything
to feel the chance to live again
i reach to you
i know you can feel it too
we'll make it through
a thousand dreams i still believe
i'll make you give them all to me
i'll hold you in my arms and never let go
i surrender

right here, right now
i give my life to live again
i'll break free, take me
my everything, i surrender all to you
right now
i give my life to live again
i'll break free, take me
my everything, i surrender all to you

take me back into the arms i love
need me like you did before
touch me once again
and remember when
there was no one that you wanted more
don't go, you know you'll break my heart
she won't love you like i will
i'm the one who'll stay
when she walks away
and you know i'll be standing here still

i'll be waiting for you
here inside my heart
i'm the one who wants to love you more
you will see i can give you
everything you need
let me be the one to love you more

see me as if you never knew
hold me so you can't let go
just believe in me
i will make you see
all the things that your heart needs to know

i'll be waiting for you
here inside my heart
i'm the one who wants to love you more
you will see i can give you
everything you need
let me be the one to love you more

some way all the love that we had can be saved
whatever it takes we'll find a way

believe me
i will make you see
all the things that your heart needs to know
i'll be waiting for you
here inside my heart
i'm the one who wants to love you more
can't you see i can give you
everything you need
let me be the one to love you more
