i keep dwellin' on the past, babe
know what i need, yeah

i need some real good lovin'
'cause i'm troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin'
'cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

it's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
if that was true i wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
every relationship failed to take a toll on you
especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
is it easier to erase my memories
at a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
some on the fence, some befriended me
but when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
i'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
believe in your heart, i never intended to make you hurt
now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"

i need some real good lovin'
'cause i'm troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin'
'cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
i got a empty hole in my chest
how do i fill it? somebody give a prescription
i guess i gotta learn to live with regrets
pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
but what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
after you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
need solutions, less problems
cause if love will drive you crazy i belong in the insane asylum
hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
it's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
but i'll admit to feelin' better when i'm hearing this song, it goes

i need some real good lovin'
'cause i'm troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin'
'cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

so i, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
playing empty songs when i'm blowing my high
feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
on an empty bed
dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
playing empty songs when i'm blowing my high
feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
while i lose my mind
so you know what i need
i need some real good lovin'
'cause i'm troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin'
'cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me 

yeah, and it go a little somethin'
li-li-like this

runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

now little lisa's only nine years old
she's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
why she's all alone and they never met her family
momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
bringin home men at different hours of the night
startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
tryin to have his way and little lisa says ouch
she tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (like this)
runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

little nicole is only ten years old
she's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
it's only one girl really knows what she's about
her name is little stacy and they become friends
promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
until one day lil' stacy gets shot
a drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
now nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
little erica is eleven years old
she's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
so she pops x to get rid of all the pain
plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
so there's no protection, he's usin no glove
never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
the days go by and her belly gets big
the father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
erica is stuck up in a world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
she says she 'bout to run away and never come back, ah!

runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

if you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
so fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

luda
they say what don't kill me can make me stronger
so two drinks a night should help me live longer
i blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
i'm on a journey, yeah i'm on a roll
sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
and tonight is the night i got a feeling that i'm about to act a fool
so if you go fix some drinks me and usher about to break some rules

that's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
i was born for the fast life
i go for broke, a lesson i can't afford
but for what it's worth i'm ready to pay
for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life
oh, oh, oh

na, na ,na, hey, oh
na, na, na, hey, oh
na, na, na, hey, oh
na na, na, hey
for the rest of my life
if i got one life to live, i'ma party 'til i'm dead
what the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
tryna keep my balance, i'm twisted so just in case i fall
written on my tombstone should say "women, weed, and alcohol"

that's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
i was born for the fast life
i go for broke, a lesson i can't afford
but for what it's worth i'm ready to pay
for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life

lift your lighters, a toast to life
i'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time

if you are dancin' on the dancefloor
and you look to your left and your right
and there is not a woman in sight

hi, my name's ludacris, and i'm high as giraffe pussy
and i'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me
i curse so much just to get on they nerves
i got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
my filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
so i shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
i take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
and make government officials breathe harder than darth vader
it's the chicken and the beer that makes luda keep rappin'
but no pork on my fork, i don't even speak pig latin
i go fishin' on my lake, with yo bitch as the bait
plus i eat many mcs, but i don't gain no weight
the numba one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
i'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
but my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked
i'll clock ya i'll spring forward, you fall back
every album that i drop has got more than ten bangers
that's cause i'm a shot caller, y'all fools is crank yankers
ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
to get chicks from portland, oregon to portland, maine
now i roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas
for a hefty fee, i'm on your record like bob costas
i own so many jerseys, i'm a throwback mess
i hit the cleaners and tell 'em i want a full-court press (ow)
so momma toast your glass while i'm countin' my cash
'cause every single is a smash, i'm hot as a camel's ass
the competition never just wanna admit that they lost
and that they last about as long as my part in the wash
from yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu
one of mini-me's shoes got more sole than you
so by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
i'm in the strip club smokin' with president clinton
so stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
they made the mold of the penis enlarger off me (me)
i'll be in another room when i hit from the back
not to mention my refrigerator's taller than shaq (yeah)
so yippie kay yay, yippie yie yie yo (yo)
if you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro ('dro)
i've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
but a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons (woo)
so wash all your sins away and stop playin' (yeah)
if god's line is busy you might have to two-way him (mhm)
then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
and when i'm drunk, tell them kids, "drugs are bad, mmm'kay?"?
or watch me swing my chain at the roscoe's off pico
got seven cars, get all my rims at chrome depot
and people think i'm bad, they say "ooh, he's so evil!"
'cause i go on blind dates with actual blind people (ow)
but my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
i heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
like the nba, you gotta play hard or go home
all that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'cause ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
i put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
and your breath will turn to foot locker water repellant
i'm the man, i got money far as the eyes can see
and i'm in a group, i split dough with me, me, and me
so much money in my jewelry that i'm damn near sorry
so i'ma trade my earrings in and get a ferrari (woo)
i buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with donald trump
y'all meet with honda, no payments for twelve months (uh-huh)
take a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad
y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag (fool)
