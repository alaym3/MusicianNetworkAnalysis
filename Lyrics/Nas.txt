yeah, yeah
ayo, black—it's time, word (word, it's time, man)
it's time, man (aight, man, begin)
yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
rappers; i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
i be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see, with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e&j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee-lo champs
laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
g-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off-guard, the mac-10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers "back up!" — the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him back-flip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, "yo, my shit is stuck!"
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
(so, what you sayin'?) it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
in black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
and if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
but yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in a new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' moëts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith & wesson, i'll have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped, plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzled as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

"nasty nas—" 

fuck jay z!
(what's up, niggas?
ayo, i know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
you? what?!)
fuck jay z!
(you been on my dick, nigga
you love my style, nigga)
fuck jay z!
(i) fuck with your soul like ether
(will) teach you – the king – you know you
(not) god's son across the belly
(lose) i prove you lost already

brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
it's like an aids test, what's the results? not positive
who's the best: pac, nas and b.i.g.? ain't no best
east, west, north, south, flossed out, greetings
i embrace y'all with napalm
blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
how could nas be garbage? semi-autos at your cartilage
burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
i got this locked since '91, i am the truest
name a rapper that i ain't influenced
gave y'all chapters, but now i keep my eyes on the judas
with hawaiian sophie fame, kept my name in his music
check it
(i) fuck with your soul like ether
(will) teach you – the king – you know you
(not) god's son across the belly
(lose) i prove you lost already

ayo, pass me the weed!
put my ashes out on these niggas, man
ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
and kiss the motherfuckin' ring!
(i) fuck with your soul like ether
(will) teach you – the king – you know you
(not) god's son across the belly
(lose) i prove you lost already

i've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
luck ran out, they hoped that i'd be gone, stiff and rotten
y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
with your hands out for my money, man, how much can i take?
when these streets keep callin', heard it when i was sleep
that this gay-z and cock-a-fella records wanted beef
started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
to explode it on a camel and his soldiers
i can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
when krs already made an album called blueprint (dick!)
first biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
that you better than b.i.g
dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?
i… will… not… lose
god's son across the belly
i prove you lost already
the king is back, where my crown at?
ill will, rest in peace!
let's do it, niggas!

(i) fuck with your soul like ether
(will) teach you – the king – you know you
(not) god's son across the belly
(lose) i prove you lost already
y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
what's sad is i love you, ‘cause you're my brother
you traded your soul for riches
my child, i've watched you grow up to be famous
and now i smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
you seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
were you abused as a child?
scared to smile? they called you ugly?
well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
in '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
callin' my crib and i ain't even give you my numbers
all i did was give you a style for you to run with
smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the god
wearin' jaz' chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
no jail bars, jigga, no pies, no case
just hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little chase
you a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a stan
i still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
you tae-bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
ask me if i'm tryna kick knowledge?
nah, i'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
that ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
is he dame diddy, dame daddy or dame dummy?
oh, i get it, you biggie and he's puffy
rocafella died of aids, that was the end of his chapter
and that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
put it together: i rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
and now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
in a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
what you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
negro, please! (ha!) you no-mustache-havin'
with whiskers like a rat, compared to beans, you wack
and your man stabbed un and made you take the blame
you ass, went from jaz to hangin' with kane
to irv, to b.i.g. – and eminem murdered you on your own shit
you a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
queens niggas run you niggas, ask russell simmons! ha!
r-o-c get gunned up and clapped quick
j.j. evans get gunned up and clapped quick
your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
shawn carter to jay-z – damn, you on jaz dick!
so little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
how much of biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
wanted to be on every last one of my classics
you pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask kiss! 

ayo, what's up, what's up?
let's keep it real, son, count this money
you know what i'm sayin'? yeah, yeah
ayo, put the grants over there in the safe
you know what i'm sayin'?
‘cause we spendin' these jacksons
the washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
i'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
you know what i'm sayin'?
yo, then what, man, what?!
visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
and my mentality is money-orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in san quentin
others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
keepin' this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin' thievin'
we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
so, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘cause life's a bitch and then you die
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
i woke up early on my born day; i'm 20, it's a blessin'
the essence of adolescence leaves my body, now i'm fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated ‘cause i made it
one quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
load up the mic and bust one, cuss while i pus from
my skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
don't go against the grain, simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
now it's all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
i switched my motto; instead of sayin', "fuck tomorrow!"
that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
once i stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die

i sip the dom p, watchin' gandhi 'til i'm charged, then
writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
to hold the mic i’m throbbin', mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
the fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation, react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason, with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a sikh's cab or montero jeep
i can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
i'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
i'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
i'm out for dead presidents to represent me
whose world is this?

to my man ill will, god bless your life (it's yours)
to my peoples throughout queens, god bless your life
i trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe hitler's
yet i'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
the versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple, you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
while all the old folks pray to jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
of holy water, odds against nas is slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
born in correction, all the wrong shit i did, he'll lead in right direction
how you livin'? large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
you flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
(it's yours)
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

break it down
it's yours, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours

i'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
for murder raps, i kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain, i flip, fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana, stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin' big willie style
check the chip-toothed smile, plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
bust the problems of the world today
(it's yours)
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
the world is yours, the world is yours

fake thug, no love, you get the slug, cb4 gusto
your luck low, i didn't know 'til i was drunk though
you freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
prostitute turned bitch, i got the gauge out
96 ways i made out, montana way
the good f-e-l-l-a, verbal ak spray
dipped attache, jump out the range, empty out the ashtray
a glass of 'zé make a man cassius clay
red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
they let me let y'all niggas know one thing
there's one life, one love, so there can only be one king
the highlights of livin', vegas-style, roll dice in linen
antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 g bets i'm winnin' 'em, threats i'm sendin' 'em
lex with tv sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
party with villains, a case of demi-sec
to chase the henny, wet any clique with the semi tec
who want it? diamonds i flaunt it
chickenheads flock i lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
crack the legs way out of formation
it's horizontal how i have 'em fuckin' me in the benz wagon
can it be vanity from last dragon?
grab your gun, it's on though
shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
with the broke mac that won't spray right
don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

i peeped you frontin'
i was in the jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
across the street you was wildin'
talkin' about how you ran the island in '89
layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
i cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
on my corner when it's pay-me time
dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
somethin' told me "plug him!"
so dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
spun around and shot one
heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
then they came askin' me my name
what the fuck? i got stitched up, it went through
left the hospital that same night, what
got my gat back, time to backtrack
i had the drop so how the fuck i get clapped?
black was in the jeep watchin'
all he seen speed by was a brown datsun
and yo, nobody in my hood got one
that clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
the bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
so when i rhyme it's sincerely yours
be lightin' ls, sippin' coors on all floors in project halls
contemplatin' war niggas i was cool with before
we used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
but, uh—a thug changes and love changes
and best friends become strangers (word up)
y'a–y'all know my steelo
ther–ther–ther–ther–ther–there ain't an army that could strike back
y'a–y'all know my steelo
ther–ther–ther–ther–there ain't an army that could strike back
y'a–y'all know my steelo
ther–ther–ther–there ain't an army that could strike back
y'a–y'all know my steelo
there ain't an army that could strike back

thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
gettin' it on in the world, you know?
to them niggas that's locked down
doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
to my thorough niggas, new york and worldwide
yo, to the queensbridge militia
9-6 shit, the firm clique
illmatic, nigga, it was written though
it's been a long time comin'
y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(they throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
bring the shit, man! live, man!
(fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit 

it ain't hard to tell, i excel, then prevail
the mic is contacted, i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shining, sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
hit the earth like a comet—invasion!
nas is like the afrocentric asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘cause in my physical i can express through song
delete stress like motrin, then extend strong
i drink moët with medusa, give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

the buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
not stories by aesop
place your loot up, parties i shoot up
nas, i analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the l
school a fool well, you feel it like braille
it ain't hard to tell, i kick a skill, like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills, i'm ill plus matic
i freak beats, slam it, like iron sheik
jam like a tec with correct techniques
so analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
i leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell
this rhythmatic explosion
is what your frame of mind has chosen
i'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
end like leviathan, it's deep? well, let me try again
wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
i dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
street's disciple, i rock beats that's mega trifle
and groove even smoother than moves by villanova
you're still a soldier, i'm like sly stone in cobra
packin' like a rasta in the weed spot
vocals will squeeze glocks
mcs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell 

what up, kid? i know shit is rough doin' your bid
when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
i heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
he didn't listen, he be riffin' while i'm tellin' him stuff
i was like, "yeah," shorty don't care, she a snake too
fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
but yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
jerome's niece, on her way home from jones beach
it's bugged—plus little rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
and night time is more trife than ever
what up with cormega? did you see him? are y'all together?
if so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
say what's up to herb, ice and bullet
i left a half a hundred in your commissary
you was my nigga when push came to shove
(one what?) one love!

one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
out in new york the same shit is goin' on
the crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
hold, check out the story yesterday when i was walkin'
that nigga you shot last year tried to appear
like he hurtin' somethin'
word to mother, i heard him frontin'
and he be pumpin' on your block
your man gave him your glock
and now they run together — what up, son? whatever
since i'm on the streets i'ma put it to a cease
but i heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
wildin' on the island, but now in elmira
better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
but maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
on the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
but chill, see you on the next v-i
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
your brother's buckwildin' in 4-main, he wrote me
he might beat his case, 'til he come home i'll play it lowkey
so stay civilized, time flies
though incarcerated your mind dies
i hate it when your moms cries
it kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
i even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack
mind's in another world, thinkin'
"how can we exist through the facts?"
written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
so i be ghost from my projects
i take my pen and pad for the weekend
hittin' l's while i'm sleepin'
a two-day stay, you may say i need the time alone
to relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
you see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in bellevue
or hdm, hit with numbers from eight to 10
a future in a maximum state pen is grim
so i comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop
rollin' two phillies together, in the bridge we call 'em "oo-wops"
he said: "nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
so i wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce."
he inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
i sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
we was chillin' on these benches
where he pumped his loose cracks
i took the l when he passed it, this little bastard
keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
i had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘cause when the pistol blows
the one that's murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
at the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
then i rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
and told my little man i'ma ghost, i broze
left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
words of wisdom from nas: try to rise up above
keep an eye out for jake, shorty wop, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love
one love, one love, one love, one love

to all my niggas locked up
from queensbridge and all over
to my man , one love
to my man herb, one love
to my man , one love
can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, big , one love
to , yeah, one love 

life, i wonder
will it take me under?
i don't know
imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
imagine going to court with no trial
lifestyle, cruising blue bahama waters, no welfare supporters
more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
days are shorter, nights are colder
feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
the world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
if coke was cooked without the garbage
we'd all have the top dollars
imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
lacing your clique up with diamond roles
your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
just some thoughts for the mind
i take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read "the world is mine"
if i ruled the world (imagine that)
i'd free all my sons, i love 'em, love 'em, baby
black diamonds and pearls
(could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
if i ruled the world
(still living for today, in these last days and times)

the way to be: paradise life, relaxin'
black, latino and anglo-saxon
armani exchange, the range
cash, lost tribe of shabazz, free at last
brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
the villa house is for the crew, how we do
trees for breakfast, dime sexes and benz stretches
so many years of depression make me vision
the better living, type of place to raise kids in
open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
but i'm as wise as the old owl, plus the gold child
seeing things like i was controlling, clique rolling
tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
trips to paris, i'd civilize every savage
give me one shot, i turn trife life to lavish
political prisoners set free, stress free
no work release, purple m3's and jet skis
feel the wind breeze in west indies
i'd let coretta scott-king mayor the cities
and reverse fiends to willies
it sound foul, but every girl i meet'd go down-town
i'd open every cell in attica, send 'em to africa
if i ruled the world (imagine that)
i'd free all my sons, i love 'em, love 'em, baby
black diamonds and pearls
(could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
if i ruled the world
(still living for today, in these last days and times)

and then we'll walk right up to the sun
hand in hand
we'll walk right up to the sun
we won't land
we'll walk right up to the sun
hand in hand
we'll walk right up to the sun
we won't land

you love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
running from jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
these are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
wait, i had to let it marinate, we carry weight
trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
making moves in atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
still, nobody want a nigga having shit
if i ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
i push a q-45 infinit(i)
it wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or b felony
strictly living longevity to the destiny
i thought i'd never see, but reality struck
better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
if i ruled the world (imagine that)
i'd free all my sons,i love 'em, love 'em, baby
black diamonds and pearls
(could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
if i ruled the world
(still living for today, in these last days and times)
if i ruled the world, if i ruled, if i ruled (imagine that)
i'd free all my sons, if i ruled, if i ruled
i love 'em, love 'em baby
black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
if i ruled the world
(still living for today, in these last days and times)

if i ruled the world, if i ruled
if i ruled, i'd free all my sons
black diamonds, i love 'em love 'em baby
black diamonds and pearls, if i ruled
if i ruled the world
if i ruled the world
i love 'em, love 'em baby!

straight up, shit is real
and any day could be your last in the jungle
get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
the corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
who don't care, guzzling beers
we all stare at the out-of-towners
(aiyyo, yo, who that?) they better break north
before we get the four pounders and take their face off
the streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
the d's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
and killer coppers even come through in helicopters
i drink a little vodka, spark a l and hold a glock for
the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
thinking it can't happen 'til i trap 'em and clap 'em
and leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
i don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
nas is a rebel of the street corner
pulling a tec out the dresser; police got me under pressure
represent, represent
represent, represent
represent, represent
represent, represent

yo, they call me nas, i'm not your legal type of fella
moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
when i dress, it's never nothing less than guess
cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
love committing sins and my friends sell crack
this nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
the school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
so i guzzle my hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
the brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
the type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
used to sport bally's and cazals with black frames
now i'm into fat chains, sex and tecs
fly new chicks and new kicks, heines and beck's

represent, represent
represent, represent
represent, represent
no doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
before the bdp conflict with mc shan
around the time when shante dissed the real roxanne
i used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
if it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
we was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
nowadays, i need the green in a flash just like the next man
fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
but if i hit rock bottom, then i'ma be the son of sam
then call the crew to get live too, with swoop
bokeem, my brother jungle, big bo cooks up the blow
mike'll chop it; mayo, you count the profit
my shit is on the streets, this way the jakes'll never stop it
it's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'nuff respect to the projects, i'm ghost, one love

represent y'all, represent
represent y'all, represent
represent y'all, represent
represent y'all, represent
one time for your mothafuckin' mind
this goes out to everybody in new york
that's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
to my man big will, he's still here
the 40 side of vernon, my man big l.e.s
big cee-lo from the don, shawn penn, the 40 busters
my crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of vernon posse
the goodfellas, my man cormega, lakey the kid
can't forget draws, the hillbillies
my man slate, wallethead, black jay, big oogie
crazy barrio spot, (big dove), we rock shit a lot, phd
and my man preemo from gang starr
'94 real shit y'all (word up harry o)
fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!
bitch ass niggas! bitch ass niggas!
you bitch ass motherfuckers!
come to queensbridge, motherfucker!
yeah, yeah, let's bring it back
that's just a warm up
‘cause i can– on anybody, anybody 

(nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is;
nas is like; nas is like; nas is like)
umm, premo, nas
yeah, yeah, yo
(nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is;
nas is like)
freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
as far as rap go, it's only natural i explain
my plateau and also what defines my name
first it was nasty, but times have changed
ask me now, i'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
i spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot, flatline, am i sane?
that depends, carry mac-10s to practice my aim
on rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs living large, taking it light
pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
it's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
and of course, n-a-s are the letters that spell (nas, nas, nas)
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (uh)
no doubt
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel (uh, uh)
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (uh)
no doubt (uh)

(nas is like) earth, wind & fire, rims and tires
bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh nas
(nas is like) iron mike, messiah type
before the christ, after the death, the last one left
let my cash invest in stock
came a long way from blasting tecs on blocks
went from seiko to rolex, owning acres
from the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
bet my 9 spit for the pesos
but what's it all worth? can't take it with you under this earth
rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
they just rob your grave, i'd rather be alive and paid
before my number's called, history's made
some'll fall, but i rise, thug or die
making choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob, steal or kill, i'm wondering why
it's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (c'mon)
no doubt
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
no doubt (uh)

(nas is like) sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
i'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
i'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
like greeks in egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
i'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
always got you, i’m like pac, dude you would cry for
i'm like a whole lot of loot, i'm like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
i'm like ecstasy for ladies
i'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
i'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam
i'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
i'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
live it and i write down and i watch it blow up
y'all know what i'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
no doubt
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
no doubt (uh); nas is like 

(right… right…)
check me out y'all
nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria

before a blunt, i take out my fronts
then i start to front, matter of fact, i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like malcolm x catchin' the jungle fever
king poetic, too much flavor, i'm major
atlanta ain't brave-r, i pull a number like a pager
‘cause i'm a ace when i face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
now wait, another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike-head, i wear chains that excite the feds
and ain't a damn thing gonna change, i'm a performer, strange
so the mic warmer was born to gain
nas, why did you do it?
you know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
it's halftime

(right…) it's halftime
(right…) ayo, it's halftime
(right…) it's halftime
(right…) yeah, it's about halftime
this is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
it's like that, you know it's like that
i got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
when i attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
so i react, never calmly on a hype track
i set it off with my own rhyme
‘cause i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i max like cassettes, i flex like sex
in your stereo sets, nas'll catch wreck
i used to hustle, now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young, i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise ‘cause i'm wise
this is exercise 'til the microphone dies
back in '83 i was an mc sparkin'
but i was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
kick my little raps ‘cause i thought niggas wouldn't understand
and now in every jam, i'm the fuckin' man
i rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
i used to watch "chips", now i load glock clips
i got to have it, i miss mr. magic
versatile, my style switches like a faggot
but not bisexual, i'm an intellectual of rap
i'm a professional and that's no question, yo
these are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘cause in the streets, i'm well-known like the number man
am i in place with the bass and format?
explore rap and tell me nas ain't all that
and next time i rhyme, i be foul
whenever i freestyle i see trial, niggas say i'm wild
i hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
stay tuned, nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(right…) it's halftime
(right…) exhale, check it, it's halftime
(right…) it's halftime
(right…) it's real in the field
word life, check it

i got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
every afternoon, i kick half the tune
and in the darkness, i'm heartless like when the narc's hit
word to marcus garvey, i hardly sparked it
‘cause when i blast the herb, that's my word
i be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
but chill, pass the andre, and let's slay
i bag bitches up at john jay and hit a matinée
puttin' hits on 5-0
‘cause when it's my time to go, i wait for god with the .44
and biters can't come near
and yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change, more cash for damp weed
this goes out to manhattan, the island of staten
brooklyn and queens is livin' fat and
the boogie down, enough props, enough clout
ill will, rest in peace, yo i'm out
(right…) it's still halftime
(right…) to the queensbridge crew
to the queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(right…) '92, it's halftime
(right…) yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
halftime… 

aight, fuck that shit! word, word
fuck that other shit, y'know what i'm sayin'?
we gonna do a lil somethin' like this
y'know what i'm sayin'?
(stay up on that shit)
keep it on and on and on and on and
know'm sayin'? big nas, grand wizard, god, what is it?
(it's like…) haha, you know what i'm sayin'?
yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

i rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then i be dissin' a
unofficial that smoke woolie thai
i dropped out of cooley high, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
my man put the battery in my back, a difference from energizer
sentence begins indented with formality
my duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
i drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
i reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
it's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
chill on the block with cognac, cold strap
with my peeps that's into drug money market interact
no sign of the beast in the blue chrysler, i guess that means peace
for niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
with side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(peace, god!) peace, god – now the shit is explained
i'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
it's like that, y'all…
"now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"

one for the money
two for pussy and foreign cars
three for alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
i rap divine, god
check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
my window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
live amongst no roses, only the drama
for real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
you're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 i let blow
and back down po-po when i'm vexed, so
my pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
i see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
my intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
i reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
word to christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
i decipher prophecies through a mic and say "peace"
i hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
they spoke of fat cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
some fiends scream about supreme team, a jamaica queens thing
uptown was alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
yo, fuck, rap is real! watch the herbs stand still
never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
true in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
i pour my heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
"now, let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"now, let me take a trip down memory lane"
"comin' outta queensbridge"

"comin' outta queensbridge"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"the most dangerous mc is…"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"the most dangerous mc is…"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"the most dangerous mc is…"
"comin' outta queensbridge"
"the most dangerous mc is…"
"me number one, and you know where me from" 

this is what, this what they want, huh?
this is what it's all about?
word, time to take affirmative action, son
they just don't understand, you kna'mean?
niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
niggas don't understand the four devils
lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
sip your con-gi-ac
and let's all wash this money through this laundromat
sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
in fact, touch mines and i'll react like a rottweiler
who could relate? we play for high stakes at gunpoint
catch 'em and break
undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
the corleone, fettuccine capone
roam in your own zone
or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
we got it sewn, the firm art of war is unknown
lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
see me, i'm an official mack, lex coupe triple black
criminal thoughts in the blue porsche
my destiny's to be the new boss
that nigga paulie gotta die, he too soft
that nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
they found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
i put the hit out
yo, the smoothest killer since bugsy, bitches love me
in queens where my drugs be, i wear guess jeans and rugbies
yo, my people from medina, they will see ya when you re-up
bring your heater, all your cream go between us
real shit, my desert eagle got an ill grip
i chill with niggas that hit dominican spots and steal bricks
my red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
yukons and ninja black lexus
'mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
it's the firm, nigga, set it!

yo, my mind is seein' through your design like blind fury
i shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
and push cakes inside the casket at just wake
it's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
and now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
it's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
my man smoke know how to expand coke in mr. coffee
feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
life's a bitch, but god forbid the bitch divorce me
i'll be flooded with ice, so hell fire can't scorch me
cuban cigars, meetin' foxy at demars, movin' cars
your top papi señor escobar
in the black camaro, firm deep
all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
wallabee's be the apparel
through the darkest tunnel
i got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
in the lex pushed by my nigga jungle
e money bags got moët chandon
bundle of sixty-two
they ain't got a clue what we about to do
my whole team, we shittin' hard like czar
sosa, foxy brown, cormega and escobar
i keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
armani sweaters, carolina herrera
be the firm, baby, from bk to the bridge, my nigga wiz
operation firm biz, so what the deal is?
i keep a phat jew-el, sippin' cristy
sittin' on top of fifty grand in the nautica van, uh
we stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in marcy
the gods, they praise allah with visions of gandhi
bet it on my whole crew is don juan
on cayman island with a case of cristal
and baba shallah spoke
nigga with them cubans that snort coke
raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
flippin' the bigger picture
the bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
he had a fuckin' villa in manilla
we got to flee to panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
double it, times three, we got 48, which mean a whole lot of cream
divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
now add the other two that 'mega bringin' through
so let's see, if we flip this other ki
then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
now triple that times three
we got three quarters of another ki
the firm, baby, vol.  

one time, yeah, yeah

yo, all i need is one mic, one beat, one stage
one nigga front, my face on the front page
only if i had one gun, one girl and one crib
one god to show me how to do things his son did
pure, like a cup of virgin blood
mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
mad violence, who i'm gon' body? this hood politics
acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
one knee i ducked, could it be my time is up?
but my luck, i got up, the cop shot again
bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his heineken
ricochetin' between the spots that i'm hidin' in
blackin' out as i shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
this is my hood, i'ma rep to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
we need more warriors soon
sent from the stars, sun and the moon
in this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
if you really think you ready to die with 9s out
this is what nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!
yo, all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic (that's all i need)
all i need is one mic (all i need, niggas)
all i need is one mic (yeah)

all i need is one blunt, one page and one pen
one prayer, tell god forgive me for one sin
matter of fact, maybe more than one
look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
from twin glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
my heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
i let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
now i'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many 9s
if y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
there's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
lead flyin', feel it? i feel it in my gut
that we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!
all i need is one mic (that's all i need, niggas, that's all i need)
all i need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
all i need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
all i need is one mic (this is all i need)

all i need is one life, one try, one breath, i'm one man
what i stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
wonder what my secrets is
niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
i have none, too late to grab guns
i'm blastin' ‘cause i'm a cool nigga
thought i wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggas
what you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
war gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
complete with thick scars
brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
drama, where does it start?
you know the block was ill as a youngster
every night it was like a cop'll get killed
body found in the dumpster
for real a hustler, purchased my range
niggas throwin' dirt on my name
jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
bitches left me ‘cause they thought i was finished
shoulda knew she wasn't true
she came to me when her man caught a sentence
diamonds are blindin', i never make the same mistakes
movin' with a change of pace
lighter load, see now the king is straight
swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
this is crazy, i'm on the right track, i'm finally found
you need some soul-searchin', the time is now
all i need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
all i need is one mic (all i ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
all i need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
all i need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby) 

check it out
i call it, yeah, yeah

for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters

i saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
who locked up, first i regretted it, then caught my rage
like, how could i not protect her from this awful phase?
never tried to hide who i was, she was taught and raised
like a princess, but while i'm on stage i can't leave her defenseless
plus she's seen me switchin' women, pops was on some pimp shit
she heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
so if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, i'll love him
never, for her i want better, homie in jail – dead that
wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
niggas got game, they be tryna live
he seen your mama crib, plus i'm sure he know who your father is
although you real, plus a honest kid
don't think i'm slow, i know you probably had that chronic lit
you seventeen, i got a problem with it
she looked at me like i'm not the cleanest father figure
but she rockin' with it
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important

this morning i got a call, nearly split my wig
this social network said: "nas, go and get your kid!"
she's on twitter, i know she ain't gon' post no pic
of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
her mother cried when she answered
said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
a box of condoms on her dresser, then she instagram'd it
at this point i realized i ain't the strictest parent
i'm too loose, i'm too cool with her
should've drove more time to school with her
i thought i dropped enough jewels on her
took her from private school, so she can get a balance
to public school, they're too nurture teen talents
they grow fast, one day she's your little princess
next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
they say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
god gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important

and i ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
but i just wanna see you dream up
i finally understand
it ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
how fathers feel for they daughters
when he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
when she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
love 

where is he, the man who was just like me?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
where is he, the man who was just like me?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
and i'm alone, and i realize that when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry
yes, i'm alone, and i realize when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry

i want someone who like the champagne i like, my a-alike
someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
she teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
she loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
she like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
she tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
for real, the world so ill, yo, i want a girl so real
who not after material wealth but get dough still
or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
as long as there’s no selfishness
yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
you can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
your smile put me at ease
you’re the woman i need, but where is she?
where is he, the man who was just like me?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
where is he, the man who was just like me?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
and i'm alone, and i realize that when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry
yes, i'm alone, and i realize when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry

i hate when people write me hostile texts
on account of my lifestyle's perception
invade my personal life? out of the question
what are they expectin'?
i be tryin' to reply and they never suppose i get my quiet time in?
they think forever i’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
god, wouldn’t they know or am i a fool to ask?
i’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
i had to tell homes, i don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
i drag off the l and try to silence it
the noise in my head, the curse of the talented
strong communicator, vagabond
i'd gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
it's so intense, i'm on my lilo & stitch
pour my pinot grigio and cris' with some lime, what is this?
an immaculate version of "me & my bitch" by biggie
with all respect, 'cause you the only one that gets me
where is he, the man who was just like me?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
where is he, the man who was just like me?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
and i'm alone, and i realize that when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry
yes, i'm alone, and i realize when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry

yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine
everything’s good, everything’s fine
yeah, yeah, we bring it every time
yeah, pour a little cherry wine
yeah, hey yo, salaam
yeah, i think they know the time
everything’s good, everything’s fine
yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
life is good, life is good, yeah
life is good, no matter what, life is good
life is good, life is good, yeah
no matter what, life is good
where is he, the man who was just like me?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
where is he, the man who was just like me?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can't see
and i'm alone, and i realize that when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry
yes, i'm alone, and i realize when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry 

i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
i'll be where i wanna be
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)

be, b-boys and girls, listen up
you can be anything in the world, in god we trust
an architect, doctor, maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
like, i met a woman who's becoming a star
she was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
singing songs, lena horne, but the younger version
hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
no fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best, i'ma tell you how
put your hands in the air, and take the vow
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)

be, b-boys and girls, listen again
this is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be, up in the club with fake id
careful, 'fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
older than you are, give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth, but so
young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
you thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
you don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)

be, be-fore we came to this country
we were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu, where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers, who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold, when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today, you see?
if the truth is told, the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
read more, learn more, change the globe
ghetto children, do your thing
hold your head up, little man, you're a king
young princess, when you get your wedding ring
your man will sing, "she's my queeeeeen"
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)
i know i can (i know i can)
be what i wanna be (be what i wanna be)
if i work hard at it (if i work hard at it)
i'll be where i wanna be (i'll be where i wanna be)

save the music, y'all
save the music, y'all
save the music, y'all
save the music, y'all
save the music
 

escobar season has returned
it's been a long time, been a long time comin'
it's life or death for me now
but you know, there's no turnin' back now
this is what makes me, this is what i am
feel me? let's go

you can hate me now, (q.b.)
but i won't stop now (real niggas)
'cause i can't stop now, (bravehearts)
you can hate me now (c'mon)
but i won't stop now
'cause i can't stop now
you can hate me now
you can hate me now

well, you hate me, i'm gon' hate you too
it's as simple as that
die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
you don't give a fuck, i don't give a fuck
go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
fuck y'all!
don't hate me, hate the money i see, clothes that i buy
ice that i wear, flows that i try
close your eyes, picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, nas get in ya
most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
almost a decade, quite impressive
most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that i stand for
expandin' more to the big screen, bill gates dreams
but it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
want me off the scene fast, but good things last
like your favorite mc still makin' some mean cash
first rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, i suggest

money is power, motherfucker!
i got millions of thugs on salary

you can hate me now, (i won't stop)
but i won't stop now (i can't stop)
'cause i can't stop now, (you can hate me)
you can hate me now (i hate you too)
but i won't stop now (you can hate me now)
'cause i can't stop now (cmon)
you can hate me now (you can hate me now)
you can hate me now
do it now! i told you, do it now!
let's go

you wanna hate me, then hate me; what can i do
but keep gettin' money? funny, i was just like you
i had to hustle hard, never give up, until i made it
now y'all sayin': "that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with."
hate on me, i blew but i'm the same og
people warn me, when you're on top there's envy
took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
my bad, should i step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
criticize when i flow for the streets, hate my dress code
gucci this, fendi that – what you expect, ho?
nickname esco, took this game to its threshold
best flow, i bet the whole u.s. know
try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

you think i'ma come this far
and let you niggas stop me now?
i hate you too!
you can hate me now, (i won't stop)
but i won't stop now (i can't stop)
'cause i can't stop now, (you can hate me)
you can hate me now (i hate you too)
but i won't stop now (you can hate me now)
'cause i can't stop now (you can hate me now)
you can hate me now
you can hate me now

i like this, i like the way this feels

it's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
hell or the pearly gates; i was destined to come
predicted, blame god, he blew breath in my lungs
second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
took a little time to claim my spot
chairman of the board until this game stop, and i side with the lord
ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
plottin' i'm sure, to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
tried stickin' me up, but i flipped on these ducks
instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
niggas fear what they don't understand
hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the fury of man
became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
i'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

you ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
and that's what you can't understand!

you can hate me now, (i won't stop)
but i won't stop now (i can't stop)
'cause i can't stop now, (you can hate me)
you can hate me now (i hate you too)
but i won't stop now (you can hate me now)
'cause i can't stop now (you can hate me now)
you can hate me now
you can hate me now

you can hate me now, (c'mon, niggas!)
but i won't stop now (do it now! get this shit over with!)
it ain't gon' never stop, niggas! 

respectfully

bucket on low like erick and parrish
closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
they don't give you one single rose while you can smell it
so i pick from my own garden (garden)
wanna go out in my garden like godfather
grandkids and a rottweiler got over the block trauma (yeah, trauma)
so what you sayin', nigga? you gots to chill (uh-huh)
thinkin' you the truth, really you not for real (epmd!)
back to back with it, the hardest shit of the year (nasir jones, remix)

epmd, we back in business

just to post it on tumblr, this that "fuck up the summer" shit
i don't care what you comin' with, me and hit-boy runnin' shit (runnin' shit)
big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (yeah, flooded now)
pull up with the ghost like a haunted house (haunted house)
she gettin' scary, blood on my hands like carrie
might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
i said it was dead, but it faked its death like machiavelli
you see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti
(yeah, ready?)
epmd, we're back in business (what?)
livin' in cramped conditions, will give you ammunition
i stock those shelves, i got those shells like taco bell and i'm not gon' fail
i got no l's (noels) like christmas, you don't wanna make the claws (claus) come out (nah)
y'all should call yourselves santa (why?) 'cause none of y'all are real (nah)
not a 'single one' (like what?), like a dollar bill (yeah)
just like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill (appeal)
we got her a 'bond' and she'll
never 'bail' on me (bail on me), not even outta jail (haha, jail)
epmd, but me, i gots no chill (ch-chill)
just a lotta skrill
lady, my paper's so crazy, i just tossed a mil' out the window of my mobile
on the fuckin' freeway on the way here (yeah)
like rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
that's a lot of bucks flyin' when i'm makin' it rain, dear
green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
a pocket full of pills, some are tylenol 3s, prolly two or three molly

poverty at its peak, ocd and ptsd, i guess
r.i.p. out to dmx, stezo e and nipsey
ecstasy and prince markie dee, mf doom, i hit 50 via text
told him that i love him 'cause i don't even know when i'ma see him next (nah)

yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged
and i drank all the dayquil (yeah) i blank on the paper
then wait 'til the page fill up (what?)
hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
i just pray for the day when i'm able to say that i'm placed with the greats
and my name's with the kane's and the wayne's, and the jay's and the dre's
and the ye's, and the drake's and the j dilla's, jada's, cool j's

shout to the golden age of hip-hop and the name of this song is

we at the mafia table next to the kitchen
eatin' michelin stars, countin' a million 

he's the heartbeat of the people
the ghetto people, and when i say ghetto people
the people who cannot afford to go to big concert
some of these people do not even have tv, so they can't afford cable
some of them can afford a radio
so the only thing they can listen to is the music
people the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality
