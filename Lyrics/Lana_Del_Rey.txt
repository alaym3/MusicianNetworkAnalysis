i've seen the world, done it all
had my cake now
diamonds, brilliant, and bel air now
hot summer nights, mid-july
when you and i were forever wild
the crazy days, city lights
the way you'd play with me like a child

will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful?
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul?
i know you will, i know you will, i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful?

i've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
channeling angels in the new age now
hot summer days, rock and roll
the way you'd play for me at your show
and all the ways i got to know
your pretty face and electric soul

will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful?
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul?
i know you will, i know you will, i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful?

dear lord, when i get to heaven
please, let me bring my man
when he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
father, tell me if you can
all that grace, all that body
all that face makes me wanna party
he's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful?
will you still love me when i got nothin' but my aching soul?
i know you will, i know you will, i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful?

will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful?
will you still love me when i'm not young and beautiful?

feet don't fail me now
take me to the finish line
oh, my heart, it breaks every step that i take
but i'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
i feel so alone on a friday night
can you make it feel like home, if i tell you you're mine?
it's like i told you, honey ("louder!")

the road is long, we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime

let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane ("louder!", "alright!")
choose your last words, this is the last time
'cause you and i—we were born to die

lost, but now i am found
i can see that once i was blind
i was so confused as a little child
tried to take what i could get, scared that i couldn't find
all the answers i need ("louder!")

don't make me sad, don't make me cry
sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
i don't know why
keep making me laugh—let's go get high
the road is long, we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime

swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
whistlin' my name
open up a beer and you say, "get over here
and play a video game"
i'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
take that body downtown
i say, "you the bestest," lean in for a big kiss
put his favorite perfume on
go play a video game

everything i do
i tell you all the time

heaven is a place on earth with you

they say that the world was built for two
only worth living if somebody is loving you
and baby, now, you do
hmm, mmm

singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
livin' for the fame
kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
and video games
he holds me in his big arms, drunk and i am seeing stars
this is all i think of
watchin' all our friends fall in and out of old paul's
this is my idea of fun
playing video games

everything i do

down on the west coast, they got a sayin'
"if you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
but you've got the music
you've got the music in you, don't you?
down on the west coast, i get this feeling like
it all could happen, that's why i'm leaving
you for the moment, you for the moment
boy blue, yeah, you

you're falling hard, i push away, i'm feelin' hot to the touch
you say you miss me and i wanna say i miss you so much
but something keeps me really quiet, i'm alive, i'm a lush
your love, your love, my love

i can see my baby swinging
his parliament's on fire and his hands are up
on the balcony and i'm singing
ooh, baby, ooh, baby, i'm in love
i can see my sweet boy swaying
he's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
on the balcony and i'm saying
move, baby, move, baby, i'm in love
i'm in love (i'm in love)
i'm in love (i'm in love)

(mic-check)
(one, two)
(two, two)
(get it, girl)

down on the west coast, they got their icons
their silver starlets, their queens of saigons
and you've got the music
you've got the music in you, don't you?
down on the west coast, they love their movies
their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
and you've got the music
you've got the music in you, don't you?

you push it hard, i pull away, i'm feeling hotter than fire
i guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you i desire
your love, your love, my love

i can see my baby swinging
his parliament's on fire and his hands are up
on the balcony and i'm singing
ooh, baby, ooh, baby, i'm in love

i'm in love

goddamn, man-child
you fucked me so good that i almost said "i love you"
you're fun and you’re wild
but you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
your poetry's bad and you blame the news
but i can’t change that, and i can't change your mood, ah

'cause you're just a man
it's just what you do
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
yeah, you're just a man
all through and through
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
blue, blue, blue

goddamn, man-child
you act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
self-loathing poet, resident laurel canyon know-it-all
you talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
but i don't get bored, i just see it through
why wait for the best when i could have you? you?

'cause you’re just a man
it’s just what you do
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
yeah, you're just a man
all through and through
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
blue, blue
you make me blue

blue, blue
blue, blue, blue
blue, blue, blue

i was reading slim aarons and i got to thinking that i thought
maybe i'd get less stressed if i was tested less like
all of these debutantes
smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
but i'm not, baby, i'm not
no, i'm not, that, i'm not

i've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 sylvia plath
writing in blood on my walls
'cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
don't ask if i'm happy, you know that i'm not
but at best, i can say i'm not sad
'cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

i had 15-year dances
church basement romances, yeah, i've cried
spilling my guts with the bowery bums
is the only love i've ever known
except for the stage, which i also call home, when i'm not
servin' up god in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the ipad
calling from beyond the grave, i just wanna say, "hi, dad"

i've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
like a goddamn near sociopath
shaking my ass is the only thing that's
got this black narcissist off my back
she couldn't care less, and i never cared more
so there's no more to say about that
except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

there's a new revolution, a loud evolution that i saw
born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly i've known
a modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause i've got
monsters still under my bed that i could never fight off
a gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

i've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 sylvia plath
writing in blood on your walls
'cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
they write that i'm happy, they know that i'm not
but at best, you can see i'm not sad
but hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
but i have it
yeah, i have it
yeah, i have it
i have

high-igh-igh-igh

boy, look at you, lookin' at me
i know you don't understand
you could be a bad motherfucker
but that don't make you a man
now you're just another one of my problems
because you got out of hand
we won't survive
we're sinkin' into the sand

all i wanna do is get high by the beach
get high by the beach, get high
all i wanna do is get by by the beach
get by baby, baby, bye bye
the truth is i never bought into your bullshit

high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

anyone can start again
not through love, but through revenge
through the fire, we're born again
peace by vengeance, brings the end
(high-igh-igh-igh)

love (yeah), i said real love is like feelin' no fear
when you're standin' in the face of danger (hey)
'cause you just want it so much
a touch (yeah) from your real love
is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (hey)
and lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (fuck)

darlin', darlin', darlin'
i fall to pieces when i'm with you
i fall to pieces
my cherries (hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme

my rose garden dreams (can i get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
set on fire by fiends (sippin' on ya like a coca-cola)
and all my black beaches (can i get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
are ruined (lookin' at me like a magazine)
my celluloid scenes (can i get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
are torn at the seams (sippin' on ya like a coca-cola, yeah)
and i fall to pieces (bitch)
(yeah) i fall to pieces when i'm with you

(why?) 'cause i love you so much (hey)
i fall to pieces
my cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (yeah)
and all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
are ruined (bitch), are ruined (fuck)

you took my sadness out of context
at the mariners apartment complex
i ain't no candle in the wind
i'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
who you are and who you've been

and who i've been is with you on these beaches
your venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
maybe i could save you from your sins
so kiss the sky and whisper to jesus
my, my, my, you found this, you need this
take a deep breath, baby, let me in

you lose your way, just take my hand
you're lost at sea, then i'll command your boat to me again
don't look too far, right where you are, that's where i am
i'm your man
i'm your man

they mistook my kindness for weakness
i fucked up, i know that, but jesus
can't a girl just do the best she can?
catch a wave and take in the sweetness
think about it, the darkness, the deepness
all the things that make me who i am

and who i am is a big-time believer
that people can change, but you don't have to leave her
when everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'cause even in the dark, i feel your resistance
you can see my heart burning in the distance
baby, baby, baby, i'm your man (yeah)

you lose your way, just take my hand
you're lost at sea, then i'll command your boat to me again
don't look too far, right where you are, that's where i am
i'm your man
i'm your man

catch a wave and take in the sweetness
take in the sweetness
you want this, you need this

he hit me and it felt like a kiss
i can hear violins, violins
give me all of that ultraviolence

darlin', darlin'
doesn't have a problem
lyin' to herself
'cause her liquor's top shelf
it's alarming, honestly
how charming she can be
fooling everyone
telling 'em she's having fun

she says, "you don't want to be like me
don't wanna see all the things i've seen
i'm dyin', i'm dyin'"
she says, "you don't want to get this way
famous and dumb at an early age
lyin', i'm lyin"

the boys, the girls
they all like carmen
she gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
she laughs like god
her mind's like a diamond
audiotune lies
she's still shinin'
like lightning, whoa, whoa
white lightning

carmen, carmen
staying up 'til morning
only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
it's alarming, truly
how disarming you can be
eatin' soft ice cream
coney island queen

she says, "you don't want to be like me
lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
i'm dyin', i'm dyin'"
she says, "you don't want to get this way
street walk at night and a star by day
it's tirin', tirin'"

the boys, the girls
they all like carmen
she gives them butterflies
bats her cartoon eyes
she laughs like god
her mind's like a diamond
audiotune lies
she's still shinin'
like lightning, whoa, whoa
white lightning

baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
that's the little story of the girl you know
relying on the kindness of strangers
tying cherry knots
smiling, doing party favors
put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
sing your song, song, now the camera's on
and you're alive again

mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
tu ne peux vivre sans moi
et je mourrais sans toi
je tuerais pour toi

the boys, the girls
they all like carmen
she gives them butterflies
bats her cartoon eyes
she laughs like god
her mind's like a diamond
audiotune lies
she's still shinin'
like lightning, whoa, whoa
white lightning
like lightning, whoa, whoa
white lightning

darlin', darlin'
doesn't have a problem
lyin' to herself

my old man is a bad man
but i can't deny the way he holds my hand
and he grabs me, he has me by my heart
he doesn't mind i have a las vegas past
he doesn't mind i have a l.a. crass way about me
he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

swimming pool, glimmering darling
white bikini off with my red nail polish
watch me in the swimming pool
bright blue ripples
you sittin', sippin' on your black cristal
oh yeah

light of my life, fire of my loins
be a good baby, do what i want
light of my life, fire of my loins
gimme them gold coins
gimme them coins

and i'm off to the races
cases of bacardi chasers
chasing me all over town
'cause he knows i'm wasted
facing time again at rikers island
and i won't get out
because i'm crazy, baby
i need you to come here and save me
i'm your little scarlet, starlet
singing in the garden
kiss me on my open mouth
ready for you

my old man is a tough man
but he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
and he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
he doesn't mind i have a flat, broke-down life
in fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
admires me, the way i roll like a rollin' stone

likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
chateau marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
says it feels like heaven to him

light of his life, fire of his loins
keep me forever, tell me you own me
light of your life, fire of your loins
tell me you own me
gimme them coins

and i'm off to the races
cases of bacardi chasers
chasing me all over town
'cause he knows i'm wasted
facing time again at rikers island
and i won't get out
because i'm crazy, baby
i need you to come here and save me
i'm your little scarlet, starlet
singing in the garden
kiss me on my open mouth

yo, i'm off to the races, laces
leather on my waist is tight and i am falling down
i can see your face is shameless
cipriani's basement
love you, but i'm going down
god, i'm so crazy, baby
i'm sorry that i'm misbehaving
i'm your little harlot, starlet
queen of coney island
raising hell all over town
sorry 'bout it

my old man is a thief
and i'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
but i trust in the decision of the lord
to watch over us
take him when he may, if he may
i'm not afraid to say that i'd die without him
who else is gonna put up with me this way?
i need you, i breathe you, i'd never leave you
they would rue the day i was alone without you
you're lying with your gold chain on
cigar hanging from your lips
i said, "hon', you never looked so beautiful
as you do now, my man"

and we're off to the races, places
ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
to las vegas, chaos, casino oasis
honey, it is time to spin
boy, you're so crazy, baby
i love you forever, not maybe
you are my one true love
you are my one true love

you are my one true love

money is the anthem of success
so before we go out, what's your address?

i'm your national anthem
god, you're so handsome
take me to the hamptons, bugatti veyron
he loves to romance 'em
reckless abandon
holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
he says to be cool, but i don't know how yet
wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
i said, "can we party later on?" he said, "yes" (yes, yes)

tell me i'm your national anthem
(booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
tell me i'm your national anthem
(sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
red, white, blue is in the sky
summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
i'm your national anthem

money is the reason we exist
everybody knows it, it's a fact
kiss, kiss

i sing the national anthem while i'm standin' over your body
hold you like a python
and you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
see what you've done to me, king of chevron?
he said to be cool, but i'm already coolest
i said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("yes, of course i will, my darling")

tell me i'm your national anthem
(booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
tell me i'm your national anthem
(sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
red, white, blue is in the sky
summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
i'm your national anthem

it's a love story for the new age
for the sixth page
we're on a quick, sick rampage
wining and dining, drinking and driving
excessive buying, overdose and dying
on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
blurring the lines between real and the fake
dark and lonely, i need somebody to hold me
he will do very well, i can tell, i can tell
keep me safe in his belltower hotel
money is the anthem of success
so put on mascara and your party dress

i'm your national anthem
boy, put your hands up
give me a standing ovation
boy, you have landed
babe, in the land of
sweetness and danger, queen of saigon

tell me i'm your national anthem
(booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
tell me i'm your national anthem
(sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
red, white, blue is in the sky
summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
i'm your national anthem

money is the anthem
god, you're so handsome
money is the anthem of success
money is the anthem
god, you're so handsome
money is the anthem of success
money is the anthem
god, you're so handsome
money is the anthem of success
money is the anthem
god, you're so handsome
money is the anthem of success

blue jeans, white shirt
walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
it was like james dean for sure
you're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
you were sorta punk rock, i grew up on hip hop
but you fit me better than my favorite sweater
and i know that love is mean (oh-oh) and love hurts (oh-oh)
but i still remember that day we met in december, oh, baby

i will love you 'til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby, can you see through the tears?
love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember (oh, baby), say you'll remember
oh, baby, ooh—i will love you till the end of time

big dreams, gangsta
said you had to leave to start your life over
i was like, "no, please—stay here
we don't need no money, we could make it all work"
but he headed out on sunday, said he'd come home monday
i stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing
but he was chasing (oh-oh) paper (oh-oh)
caught up in the game, that was the last i heard

i will love you 'til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby, can you see through the tears?
love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember (oh, baby), say you'll remember
oh, baby, ooh—i will love you till the end of time

you went out every night, and baby, that's alright
i told you that no matter what you did, i'd be by your side
'cause i'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
well, shit, at least you tried
but when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
told you i wanted more; that's not what i had in mind
i just want it like before, we were dancing all night
then they took you away, stole you out of my life
you just need to remember

i will love you 'til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby, can you see through the tears?
love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember (oh, baby), say you'll remember
oh, baby, ooh—i will love you till the end of time

i like to see everything in neon
drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
maybe  the way that i'm living is killing me
i like to light up the stage with a song
do shit to keep me turned on
but  one day i woke up like
"maybe  i'll do it differently"

so i moved to california‚ but it's just a state of mind
it  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
it's killing me slowly

dream a little dream of me
make  me into something sweet
turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
fuck it, i love you
fuck it‚ i love you
fuck it, i love you
i really do

i used to shoot up my veins in neon
and shit's even brighter; you're gone
so many things i would say to you
i want you

you moved to california, but it's just a state of mind
and you know everyone adores you
you can't feel it and you're tired
baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
but it's killing me slowly

dream a little dream of me
turn this into something sweet
turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
fuck it, i love you
fuck it, i love you
fuck it, i love you
i really do

it turns out california's more than just a state of mind
i met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
and if i wasn't so fucked up, i think i'd fuck you all the time
(i really do)
it's killing me slowly

fuck it, i love you (i moved to california, but it's just a state of mind)
fuck it, i love you (it turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
fuck it, i love you (wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
i really do (it's killing me slowly)

(fuck it, i love you)
california dreamin', got my money on my mind
(fuck it, i love you)
jazz in my veins, running out of time
(fuck it, i love you)
california dreamin', got my money on my mind
(i really do)
jazz in my veins, running out of time
(fuck it, i love you)
california dreamin', got my money on my mind
(fuck it, i love you)
jazz in my veins, running out of time
(fuck it, i love you)
california dreamin', got my money on my mind
(i really do)
jazz in my veins, running out of time
