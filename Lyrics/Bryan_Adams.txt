i got my first real six string
bought it at the five and dime
played it til my fingers bled
was the summer of '69

me and some guys from school
had a band and we tried real hard
jimmy quit and jody got married
i shoulda known we'd never get far

but when i look back now
that summer seemed to last forever
and if i had the choice
ya, i'd always wanna be there
those were the best days of my life

ain't no use in complainin'
when you got a job to do
spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
and that's when i met you, ya

standin' on your mama's porch
you told me that you'd wait forever
oh, and when you held my hand
i knew that it was now or never
those were the best days of my life
oh yeah!
back in the summer of '69
oh!

man, we were killin' time
we were young and restless
we needed to unwind
i guess nothin' can last forever
forever, no...

yeah!

and now the times are changin'
look at everything that's come and gone
sometimes when i play that old six string
i think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

standin' on your mama's porch
you told me it would last forever
oh, the way you held my hand
i knew that it was now or never
those were the best days of my life

oh yeah
back in the summer of '69
uh-huh

oh yeah
me and my baby in a 69
oh! oh!

who will turn your world around

sound the bugle now
play it just for me
as the seasons change
remember how i used to be
now i can't go on
i can't even start
i've got nothing left
just an empty heart
i'm a soldier wounded
so i must give up the fight
there's nothing more for me
lead me away... or leave me lying here
sound the bugle now
tell them i don't care
there's not a road i know
that leads to anywhere
without a light, i fear that i will
stumble in the dark
lay right down, decide not to go on
then from on high
somewhere in the distance
there's a voice that calls
remember who you are
if you lose yourself
your courage soon will follow
so be strong tonight
remember who you are
you're a soldier now
fighting in a battle
to be free once more
that's worth fighting for

(when you're gone!)

i've been wandering around the house all night
wondering what the hell to do
yeah, i'm trying to concentrate but
all i can think of is you

well, the phone don't ring cause my friends ain't home
i'm tired of being all alone
got the tv on cause the radio's playing
songs that remind me of you

i realize i'm in love
days go on and on
and the nights just seem so long
even food don't taste that good
drink ain't doing what it should
things just feel so wrong
baby, when you're gone

i've been driving up and down these streets
trying to find somewhere to go
yeah, i'm looking for a familiar face
but there's no one i know

oh, this is torture, this is pain
it feels like i'm gonna go insane
i hope you're coming back real soon
cause i don't know what to do

that we'd be able to keep it this way
but it's easier
comin' straight from the heart

oh, give it to me straight from the heart

now it's all for one and all for love
let the one you hold, be the one you want
the one you need
cause when it's all for one, it's one for all

and a little help to find
all the words to say
please stay
before you're walking out the door
i know you want more
so give me one more day
please stay

you were looking after you
i was looking after me
sometimes it's hard to know the difference
between what we want and what we need
i might not settle the right things
but i know the way i feel
so give me one more chance
maybe we can make this real

please stay
don't wanna hear you say goodbye
'cause there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't let it end this way

don't wanna walk away
please stay
we shouldn't let it end this way
i know you wanted more
so give me one more day
please stay

what shall we use
to fill the empty spaces
where waves of hunger roar
shall we set out across this sea of faces
in search of more and more applause
shall we buy a new guitar
shall we drive a more powerful car
shall we work straight through the night
shall we get into fights
leave the lights on
drop bombs
do tours of the east
contract diseases
bury bones
break up homes
send flowers by phone
take to drink
go to shrinks
give up meat
rarely sleep
keep people as pets
train dogs
race rats
fill the attic with cash
bury treasure
store up leisure
but never relax at all
with our backs to the wall

you were born in a small town
always had dreams bigger than your brother, you know it
hit the road where it forks down
made good decisions, start from the gutter, you know it
big city lives, fast lane living but
