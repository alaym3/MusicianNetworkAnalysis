drink up, baby, stay up all night
with the things you could do, you won't but you might
the potential you'll be, that you'll never see
the promises you'll only make
drink up with me now and forget all about
the pressure of days, do what i say
and i'll make you okay and drive them away
the images stuck in your head

people you've been before that you
don't want around anymore
that push and shove and won't bend to your will
i'll keep them still

drink up, baby, look at the stars
i'll kiss you again, between the bars
where i'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
waiting to finally be caught
drink up one more time and i'll make you mine
keep you apart, deep in my heart
separate from the rest, where i like you the best
and keep the things you forgot

people you've been before that you
don't want around anymore
that push and shove and won't bend to your will
i'll keep them still

i'm in love with the world
through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after
we broke up a month ago
and i grew up, i didn't know
i'd be around the morning after
it's always been wait and see
a happy day and then you pay
and feel like shit the morning after
but now i feel changed around
and instead of falling down
i'm standing up the morning after
situations get fucked up
and turned around sooner or later
and i could be another fool
or an exception to the rule
you tell me the morning after
crooked spin can't come to rest
i'm damaged bad at best
she'll decide what she wants
i'll probably be the last to know
no one says until it shows, see how it is
they want you or they don't
say yes
i'm in love with the world
through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after

your hand on his arm
haystack charm around your neck
strung out and thin
calling some friend, trying to cash some check
he's acting dumb
that's what you've come to expect

needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay

he's wearing your clothes
head down to toes a reaction to you
you say you know what he did
but you idiot kid
you don't have a clue
sometimes they just get caught in the eye
you're pulling him through

needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay

now on the bus
nearly touching this dirty retreat
falling out
6th and powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
gonna walk, walk, walk
four more blocks plus the one in my brain
down downstairs to the man
he's gonna make it all okay
i can't be myself
i can't be myself and i don't want to talk
i'm taking the cure so i can be quiet wherever i want
so leave me alone
you ought to be proud that i'm getting good marks

needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay

someone's always coming around here, trailing some new kill
says, "i've seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill"
what's a game of chance to you, to him is one of real skill

so glad to meet you
angeles

picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
go on, lose the gamble that's the history of the trade
did you add up all the cards left to play to zero

and sign up with evil
angeles?
don't start me trying now
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'cause i'm all over it, angeles

i can make you satisfied in everything you do
all your secret wishes could right now be coming true
and be forever with my poison arms around you

no one's gonna fool around with us
no one's gonna fool around with us
so glad to meet you
angeles

first the mic, then a half cigarette
singing "cathy's clown"
that's the man she's married to now
that's the girl that he takes around town
she appears composed, so she is, i suppose
who can really tell?
she shows no emotion at all
stares into space like a dead china doll

i'm never gonna know you now
but i'm gonna love you anyhow

now she's done and they're calling someone
such a familiar name
i'm so glad that my memory's remote
'cause i'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
here it is, the revenge to the tune
"you're no good
you're no good, you're no good, you're no good"
can't you tell that it's well understood?

i'm never gonna know you now
but i'm gonna love you anyhow

i'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
i'm tired, i'm tired

looking out on the substitute scene
still going strong
xo, mom
it's okay, it's all right, nothing's wrong
tell mr. man with impossible plans to just leave me alone
in the place where i make no mistakes
in the place where i have what it takes

i'm never gonna know you now
but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm never gonna know you now
but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm never gonna know you now
but i'm gonna love you anyhow

i'll fake it through the day
with some help from johnnie walker red
send the poison rain down the drain
to put bad thoughts in my head
with two tickets torn in half
and a lot of nothing to do
do you miss me, miss misery
like you say you do?
a man in the park
read the lines in my hand
told me i'm strong and hardly ever wrong
i said, "man, you mean you"
i had plans for both of us
that involved a trip out of town
to a place i seen in a magazine
that you'd left lying around
i don't have you with me
but i keep a good attitude
do you miss me, miss misery
like you say you do?
i know you'd rather see me gone
than to see me the way that i am
but i am in the life anyway
next door, the tv's flashing
blue frames on the wall
it's a comedy of errors, you see
it's about taking a fall
to vanish into oblivion
is easy to do
and i try to be, but you know me
i come back when you want me to
do you miss me, miss misery
like you say you do?

the lite-brite's now black and white
'cause you took apart a picture that wasn't right
pitch burning on a shining sheet
the only maker that you want to meet
a dying man in a living room
whose shadow paces the floor
who'll take you out any open door

this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
it's not what i'm like
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
who couldn't get things right
a fond farewell to a friend

he said, "really, i just want to dance"
good and evil match perfect, it's a great romance
and i can deal with some psychic pain
if it'll slow down my higher brain
veins full of disappearing ink
vomiting in the kitchen sink
disconnecting from the missing link

this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
it's not what i'm like
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
who couldn't get things right
a fond farewell to a friend

i see you're leaving me
and taking up with the enemy
the cold comfort of the in-between
a little less than a human being
a little less than a happy high
a little less than a suicide
the only things that you really tried

this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
it's not what i'm like
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
who couldn't get things right
a fond farewell to a friend
this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend

throwing candy out to the crowd
dragging down the main
the helpless little thing with the dirty mouth
who's always got something to say
you're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
i saw him down in the alley, having had enough of it all

said, "you can do what you want to whenever you want to
you can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you"

all spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day
a tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger

you can do what you want to whenever you want to
you can do what you want to there's no one to stop you
now, you can do what you want to whenever you want to (oh yeah)
do what you want to whenever you want to (oh yeah)
do what you want to whenever you want to
though it doesn't mean a thing
big nothing

you walk down alameda
shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone
like some precious only son
face down, bow to the champion

you walk down alameda
looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
thinking about your friends
how you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense

for your own protection over their affection
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start

walk down alameda
brushing off the nightmares you wish could plague me when i'm awake
so now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate
for one or two minutes she liked you
but the fix is in


you're all pretension, i never pay attention
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you can't finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you can't finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you can't finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
if you're alone, it must be you that wants to be apart

the king's crossing was the main attraction
dominos are falling in a chain reaction
the scraping subject ruled by fear told me
whiskey works better than beer
the judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
and nobody gets a reprieve
and every wave is tidal
if you hang around
you're going to get wet
i can't prepare for death any more than i already have
all you can do now is watch the shells
the game looks easy, that's why it sells
frustrated fireworks inside your head
are going to stand and deliver talk instead
the method acting that pays my bills
keeps the fat man feeding in beverly hills
i got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
and i get my check from the trash treasury
because i took my own insides out
it don't matter because i have no sex life
all i want to do now is inject my ex-wife
i've seen the movie
and i know what happens
it's christmas time
and the needles on the tree
a skinny santa is bringing something to me
his voice is overwhelming
but his speech is slurred
and i only understand every other word
open your parachute and grab your gun
falling down like an omen, a setting sun
read the part and we turn out fine
it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
but i don't care if i fuck up
i'm going on a date
with a rich white lady
ain't life great?
give me one good reason not to do it
(because we love you)
so do it
this is the place where time reverses
dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
instruments shine on a silver tray
don't let me get carried away
don't let me get carried away
don't let me be carried away

he's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
in the cathedral with the glass stained black
singing sweet, high notes that echo back
to destroy their master
may be a long time 'til you get the call-up
but it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
no one'll know where you are

it's just a brief smile crossing your face
i'm running speed trials standing in place

when the socket's not a shock enough
you little child, what makes you think you're tough?
when all the people you think you're above
they all know what's the matter
you're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true
there's always something you go back running to
to follow the path of no resistance

it's just a brief smile crossing your face
i'm running speed trials standing in place
it's just a brief smile crossing your face
i'm running speed trials all over the place

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

i'm going out sleepwalking
where mute memories start talking
the boss that couldn't help but hurt you
and the pretty thing you made desert you
i'm going out like a baby
a naive, unsatisfiable baby
grabbing onto whatever's around
for the soaring high or the crushing down
with hidden cracks that don't show
but that constantly just grow

i'm looking for the man that attacked me
while everybody was laughing at me
you beat it in me, that part of you
but i'm gonna split us back in two
tired of living in a cloud
if you're gonna say shit now, you'll do it out loud

it's 2:45 in the morning
and i'm putting myself on warning
for waking up in an unknown place
with a recollection you've half erased
looking for somebody's arms
to wave away past harms
i'm walking out on center circle
the both of you can just fade to black
i'm walking out on center circle
been pushed away and i'll never go back

haven't laughed this hard in a long time
i better stop now before i start crying
go off to sleep in the sunshine
i don't want to see the day when it's dying
she's a sight to see (sight to see), she's good to me (good to me)
but i'm already somebody's baby
she's a pretty thing (pretty thing) and she knows everything (everything)
but i'm already somebody's baby
you don't deserve to be lonely
but those drugs you got won't make you feel better
pretty soon you'll find it's the only
little part of your life you're keeping together
i'm nice to you (nice to you), i could make it through (make it through)
that you're already somebody's baby
i could make you smile (make you smile) if you stayed a while (stayed a while)
but how long will you stay with me baby?
because your candle burns too bright
well, i almost forgot it was twilight
even if i think that you are right
well, i'm tired of being down, i got no fight
you're wonderful (wonderful), when it's beautiful (beautiful)
but i'm already somebody's baby
and if i went with you (went with you) i'd disappoint you too (disappoint you too)
well, i'm already somebody's baby
already somebody's baby

no bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
christian brothers gonna take him down
but it can't help me get over

don't be cross, it's sick i want
i've seen the boss blink on and off

fake concern says, "what's the matter, man?"
and you think i ought to shake your motherfucking hand
well, i know how much you care

don't be cross, it's sick i want
i've seen the boss blink on and off
come here by me, i want you here
nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

don't be cross, it's sick i want
i've seen the boss blink on and off
come here by me, i want you here
nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
nightmares become me, it’s so fucking clear

start, stop and start
stupid acting smart
flirting with the flicks
you say, "it's just for kicks"
you'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
you got yourself to tease and displease
doors swinging wide
you walked in to hide
looking at your feet
failure's complete
saw you and me on the coin-op tv
frozen in fear every time we appear

i'm not surprised at all and really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong
see nothing wrong
so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
completely wrong
totally wrong

go walking by
here come another guy
jailer who sells personal hells
who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
everybody's dying just to get the disease

hey, hey, hey, hey

i'm not surprised at all and really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong
see nothing wrong
so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
completely wrong
totally wrong
i'm not surprised at all and really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong
see nothing wrong
so sick and tired of all these pictures of me

oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease
everybody's dying just to get the disease
everybody's dying just to get the disease

i'll tell you why i don't want to know where you are
i got a joke i've been dying to tell you
a silent kid is looking down the barrel
to make the noise that i kept so quiet
kept it from you, pitseleh

i'm not what's missing from your life now
i could never be the puzzle pieces
they say that god makes problems just to see what you can stand
before you do as the devil pleases
give up the thing you love
but no one deserves it

the first time i saw you
i knew it would never last
i'm not half what i wish i was
i'm so angry
i don't think it'll ever pass
and i was bad news for you just because
i never meant to hurt you

i had tender feelings that you made hard
but it's your heart, not mine, that's scarred
so when i go home i'll be happy to go
you're just somebody that i used to know

you don't need my help anymore
it's all now to you, there ain't no before
now that you're big enough to run your own show
you're just somebody that i used to know

i watched you deal in a dying day
and throw a living past away
so you can be sure that you're in control
you're just somebody that i used to know


i know you don't think you did me wrong
and i can't stay this mad for long
keeping a hold of what you just let go
you're just somebody that i used to know

you asked me to come down and watch the parade
to march down the street like the duracell bunny
with a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
throwing out candy that looks like money
to people passing by that all seem to be going the other way

said, "won't you follow me down to the rose parade?"

tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
people were shouting and pushing and saying
and i traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
ridiculous marching band started playing
got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

the trumpeter's obviously been drinking
'cause he's fucking up even the simplest lines
you say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
it's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
when they clean the street, i'll be the only shit that's left behind

won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

something's happening
don't speak too soon
i told the boss off and made my move
got nowhere to go

son of sam
son of the shining path, the clouded mind
the couple killer, each and every time

i'm not uncomfortable, feeling weird
lonely leered, options disappeared
but i know what to do
son of sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
acting under orders from above

king for a day


son of sam
son of the shining path, the clouded mind
the couple killer, running out of time

shiva opens her arms now
to make sure i don't get too far
i may talk in my sleep tonight
'cause i don't know what i am
i'm a little like you
more like son of sam

i'll fake it through the day
with some help from johnny walker red
and the cold pain behind my eyes
that shoots back through my head
with two tickets torn in half and a lot nothing to do
but it's alright cause some enchanted night i'll be with you
tarot cards and the lines in my hand
tell me i'm wrong
but they're untrue
i got plans for both of us that involve a trip out of town
to a place i've seen in a magazine that you left lying around
i can't hold my liquor but i keep a good attitude
cause it's alright some enchanted night i'll be with you
and though you'd rather see me gone
than to see there come the day
i'll be waiting for you anyway
next door the tv's flashing blue frames on the wall
it's a comedy from the seventies with a lead no one recalls
he vanished into oblivion
it's easy to do
and i cried a sea when you talked to me
the day you said we were through
but it's alright, some enchanted night i'll be with you
