peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
if your knowledge were your wealth, then it would be well-earned
if we were made in his image, then call us by our names

like one, two, three
(damn, y'all feel that? oh)
like one, two, three
the world keeps turning
oh what a day, what a day, what a day
the man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall?
if we were made in his image, then call us by our names
most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

oh on and on and on and on
my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
on and on and on and on
all night till the vultures swarm
i go on and on and on and on
my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
on and on and on and on
mad props to the god jaborn

i am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
i think i need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning
oh what a day, what a day, what a day
you rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothing left
the mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left
if we were made in his image, then call us by our names
most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

oh on and on and on and on
my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
oh on and on and on, on, on-on, on, on

i met him when i was a
a little girl, he gave me
he gave me poetry
he was my first
but in my heart i knew i
wasn't the only one
'cause when the tables turned
he had to break, but...

whenever i got lonely
or needed some advice
he gave me his shoulder
his words were very nice
but that is all behind me
'cause now there is no other
my love is his and his is mine
a friend became the...

love of my life
you are my friend
love of my life
i can depend
love of my life
without you, baby
it feels like i sampled true love
but the shit didn‚Äôt clear

a freak-freak, y'all, and ya don't stop
a to the beat y'all and ya don't stop
a freak-freak

or could it be that it was
all just so simple then
a teenage love but you said
he's just a friend
he moved around and we kept
in touch through his friend mike
the world was young and we knew
we couldn't rush but...

whenever i got lonely
or needed some advice
he gave me his shoulder
his words were very nice
but that is all behind me
'cause now there is no other
my love is his and his is mine
a friend became the...

love of my life
you are my friend
love of my life
on you i can depend, yeah, yeah
love of my life
without you, baby
it feels like i sampled true love
but the shit didn‚Äôt clear

y'all know how i met her
we broke up and got back together
to get her back, i had to sweat her
thought she'd roll with bad boys forever in many ways
them boys may be better, to grow, i had to let her
she needed cheddar and i understood that
looking for cheese, that don't make her a hoodrat
in fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
i love it when she sings to me
it's like that and a...

love of my life
ooh, you know you rock my world and
love of my life
you b-boy and i'm b-girl'n
love of my life

ooh, hey
i'm trying to decide
which way to go
think i made a wrong turn back there somewhere

didn't cha know, didn't cha know
tried to move but i lost my way
didn't cha know, didn't cha know
stopped to watch my emotions sway
didn't cha know, didn't cha know
knew the toll but i would not pay
didn't cha know, didn't cha know
'cause you never know where the cards may lay

time to save the world
where in the world is all the time?
so many things i still don't know
so many times i've changed my mind
guess i was born to make mistakes
but i ain't scared to take the weight
so when i stumble off the path
i know my heart will guide me back

ooh, hey
i'm trying to decide
which way to go
think i made a wrong turn back there somewhere
ooh, hey, ooh
i'm trying to decide
which way to go
i think i made a wrong turn back there somewhere

stopped to watch my emotions sway
didn't cha know, didn't cha know
knew the toll but i would not pay
didn't cha know, didn't cha know
i said ya never know how the cards may lay

they play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. they move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. they feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. they are us. this is what we have become. afraid to respect the individual. a single person within a circumstance can move one to change. to love herself. to evolve

my eyes are green
'cause i eat a lot of vegetables

you told me we could have a family
wanna run to mama when you're down and low
but times get tough, and there you go
ooh, out the door, you wanna run again
open the arms and you'll come back in
wanna run 'cause you say that you were afraid, afraid, oh
never knew what a friendship was
never knew how to really love
you can't be what i need you to
and i don't know why i fuck with you
i know our love will never be the same
but i can't stand these growing pains

we ain't dead said the children don't believe it
we just made ourselves invisible
underwater, stove-top, blue flame scientists come out with your scales up
get baptized in the ocean of the punk
when niggas turn in to gods
walls come tumblin...(aaahhh)

ascension maintained
rolling through like a burning flame
like a supernova star
she be the light when they in the dark
morning
the moon pass the sun
four constellations start forming
a cross up in the sky
but everybody wanna ask me why

people always tryin' to find the world i'm in
i'm the envy of the women and i rule the men
two fish, one swimmin' up stream
one swimmin' down livin' in a dream
but when she loves she tends to cling
when incense burns, smoke unfurls
analog girl in a digital world
the rasta style flower child
zip dip dow, zip dip dow
the gold tooth smile
split them vowels
bling bloom bling, melanated
i'm 'bout ta give birth to church
but everybody want to ask this earth

"'cause you did not do your math"
"my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone"
"mad props to the god jaborn"
