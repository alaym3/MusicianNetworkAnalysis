and as far as i'm concerned
i'm glad i got the chance to say
that i do believe i love you

to feel the way we do today
and then if you can remember

keep smilin', keep shinin'

for good times and bad times

(ha ha, yeah)

if you see me walkin' down the street
and i start to cry each time we meet
walk on by
walk on by
make believe that you don't see the tears
just let me grieve in private 'cause each time i see you
i break down and cry
walk on by (don't stop)
walk on by (don't stop)
walk on by
i just can't get over losin' you
and so if i seem, broken and blue
walk on by
walk on by
foolish pride, that's all that i have left
so let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me
when you said goodbye
walk on by (don't stop)
walk on by (don't stop)

walk on...
walk on by
walk on by
foolish pride, that's all that i have left
so let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me
when you said goodbye

(don't, don't stop) mm, baby, leave, you'll never see the tears i cry
(don't, don't stop) now you really gotta go, so walk on by
(don't, don't stop)

i got to say it and it's hard for me
you got me crying like i thought i would never be
love is believing, but you let me down
how can i love you when you ain't around?
and i get to the morning and you never call
love should be everything or not at all
and it don't matter whatever you do
i made a life out of loving you

only to find any dream that i follow is dying
i'm crying in the rain
i could be searching my world for a love everlasting
feeling no pain
when will we meet again?

why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
is it a lesson that i never knew?
got to get out of the spell that i'm under
my love for you
why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when i was being what you want me to be?
suddenly, everything i ever wanted
has passed me by
this world may end
not you and i

my love is stronger than the universe
my soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
you made the rules and you could not see
you made a life out of hurting me

out of my mind, i am held by the power of you, love
tell me when do we try
or should we say goodbye?

why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when i was being what you want me to be?
suddenly, everything i ever wanted
has passed me by
oh, oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
is it a lesson that i never knew?
suddenly, everything i ever wanted
my love for you
oh, oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when i was being what you want me to be?
suddenly, everything i ever wanted
has passed me by
tell me, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?

you dream a dream to make it real
to love me more than i thought possible
you lived a life
you by my side in an age of miracles
the light in the dark
you come to me
you make me feel the world is beautiful
who would believe we dared to see an age of miracles

i wanna love you in this age of miracles
yeah, i believe dreams come true
you make me feel real love is possible
my love, baby, that miracle is you

along the wall, the people dance
you take my hand, and i'm in love again
you found the key
you set me free, it's an age of miracles
oh, there's some words, oh, i'm must believe
in every day, hey hey, you're wonderful
burn candles bright, bright up the night
it's an age of miracles

oh, i wanna love you in this age of miracles
yeah, i believe dreams come true
you make me feel real love is possible
my love, oh maybe, that miracle is you

oh, i wonder
who would believe we live to see
oh, light up the night, burn candles bright
oh oh

oh, i wanna love you in this age of miracles
yeah, i believe dreams come true
you make me feel real love is possible
my love, oh maybe, that miracle is you
i wanna love you in this age of miracles
yeah, i believe dreams come true
oh, you make me feel real love is possible
my love, maybe, that miracle is you
i wanna love you in this age of miracles
yeah, i believe dreams come true
you make me feel real, real love is possible
my love...

a chair is still a chair
even though there's no one sitting there

but a chair is not a house
and a house is not a home
when there's no one there to hold you tight
and no one there you can kiss goodnight

a room is still a room
even though there's nothing there but gloom

but a room is not a house
and a house is not a home
when the two of us are far apart
and one of us has a broken heart

now and then i call your name
and suddenly your face appears
but it's just a crazy game
when it ends, it ends in tears

darling, have a heart
don't let one mistake keep us apart

i'm not meant to live alone
turn this house into a home
when i climb the stairs
and turn the key
oh, please be there
still in love with me

i'm not meant to live alone
turn this house into a home
when i climb the stairs
and turn the key
oh, please be there
still in love with me

what the world needs now is love, sweet love
it's the only thing that there's just too little of
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
no, not just for some but for everyone

lord, we don't need another mountain
there are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
there are oceans and rivers enough to cross
enough to last until the end of time

what the world needs now is love, sweet love
it's the only thing that there's just too little of
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
no, not just for some but for everyone

lord, we don't need another meadow
there are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
there are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
oh, listen lord, if you want to know

what the world needs now is love, sweet love
it's the only thing that there's just too little of
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
no, not just for some, oh, but just for every, everyone

what the world needs now is love, sweet love
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
what the world needs now is love, sweet love

you looked inside my fantasies
and made each one come true
something no one else had ever found a way to do
i've kept the memories one by one
since you took me in
i know i'll never love this way again

i know i'll never love this way again
so i keep holding on before the good is gone
i know i'll never love this way again
hold on, hold on, hold on

a fool will lose tomorrow
reaching back for yesterday
i won't turn my head in sorrow
if you should go away
i'll stand here and remember
just how good it's been
and i know i'll never love this way again

i know i'll never love this way again
so i keep holding on before the good is gone
i know i'll never love this way again
hold on, hold on, hold on
i know i'll never love this way again
so i keep holding on before the good is gone
i know i'll never love this way again
hold on, hold on
i know i'll never love this way again
so i keep holding on before the good is gone
i know i'll never love this way again
hold on, hold on

the moment i wake up
before i put on my makeup
i say a little prayer for you
while combing my hair now
and wonder what dress to wear now
i say a little prayer for you

forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
and i will love you
forever, and ever, we never will part
oh, how i'll love you
together, together, that's how it must be
to live without you
would only mean heartbreak for me

i run for the bus, dear
while riding i think of us, dear
i say a little prayer for you
at work, i just take time
and all through my coffee break-time
i say a little prayer for you

forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
and i will love you
forever, and ever, we never will part
oh, how i'll love you
together, together, that's how it must be
to live without you
would only mean heartbreak for me

i say a little prayer for you
i say a little prayer for you

forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
and i will love you
forever, and ever, we never will part
oh, how i'll love you
together, together, that's how it must be
to live without you
would only mean heartbreak for me

my darling, believe me
for me there is no one but you
please love me, too
i'm in love with you
answer my prayer
say you love me, too
why don't you answer my prayer, yeah
you know, every day i say a little prayer
i said i say, i say a little prayer
why don't you just answer my prayer

what do you get when you fall in love?
a guy with a pin to burst your bubble
that's what you get for all your trouble
i'll never fall in love again
i'll never fall in love again

what do you get when you kiss a guy?
you get enough germs to catch pneumonia
after you do, he'll never phone ya
i'll never fall in love again
don't you know that i'll never fall in love again

don't tell me what's it all about
'cause i've been there and i'm glad i'm out
out of those chains, those chains that bind you
that is why i'm here to remind you

what do you get when you fall in love?
you only get lots of pain and sorrow
so for at least until tomorrow
i'll never fall in love again
no, no, i'll never fall in love again

i'm out of those chains, those chains that bind you
that is why i'm here to remind you

what do you get when you fall in love?
you only get lots of pain and sorrow
so for at least until tomorrow
i'll never fall in love again
don't you know that i'll never fall in love again
i'll never fall in love again

do you know the way to san jose?
i’ve been away so long
i may go wrong and lose my way
do you know the way to san jose?
i’m going back to find
some peace of mind in san jose

l.a. is a great big freeway
put a hundred down and buy a car
in a week, maybe two
they’ll make you a star
weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
and all the stars that never were
are parking cars and pumping gas

you can really breathe in san jose
they’ve got a lot of space
there’ll be a place where i can stay
i was born and raised in san jose
i’m going back to find
some peace of mind in san jose

fame and fortune is a magnet
it can pull you far away from home
with a dream in your heart you’re never alone
dreams turn into dust and blow away
and there you are without a friend
you pack your car and ride away

i’ve got lots of friends in san jose
(whoa whoa whoawhoa whoa whoa whoawhoa whoa whoa)
do you know the way to san jose?
(whoa whoa whoawhoa whoa whoa whoawhoa whoa whoa)

mmmm you're gonna want me back in your arms
you're gonna need me, one day
you're gonna want me back in your arms
you're gonna need me, one day
you're gonna want me back in your arms
you're gonna wake up when time has taken your throne
you'll taste the bitterness of being alone
there's no splendor in the darkness of night
when there's no loving arms to hold you tight
(you better stop, and think about what you're doing) x2
mmm give a little back
of what you've been taking
better start being for real and stop your faking
you better prepare yourself for that rainy day
you better throw a little tenderness and affection my way
you're gonna need me
need me one day
you're gonna want me back in your arms
tell me who's gonna take the heartbreak i took
and still be there at the close of the book
when you've grown older and lost your way
and all your rainbows have turned to gray
mmm give a little back
of what you've been taking
better start being for real and stop your faking
you better prepare yourself for that rainy day
you better throw a little tenderness and affection my way

don't make me over
now that i'd do anything for you
don't make me over
now that you know how i adore you
don't pick on the things i say, the things i do
just love me with all my fault
the way that i love you
i'm begging you

don't make me over
now that i can't make it without you
don't make me over
i wouldn't change one thing about you
just take me inside your arms and hold me tight
and always be by my side, if i am wrong or right
i'm begging you

don't make me over
don't make me over
now that you've got me at your command
accept me for what i am
accept me for the things that i do
accept me for what i am
accept me for the things that i do
now that i can't make it without you
i wouldn't change one thing about you

just take me inside your arms and hold me tight
and always be by my side, if i am wrong or right
i'm begging you
don't make me over
don't make me over
now that you've got me at your command

accept me for what i am
accept me for the things that i do
accept me for what i am
accept me for the things that i do

just because you said things have got to change
they won't go away
nothing goes away

not unless you do the things you promised to
so walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

saying something's wrong isn't good enough
that won't make it right
gotta make it right

and the only way is doing what you say
so walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

there's nothing that's so bad that leaving it alone
just doesn't make it worse
time won't wait
maybe tomorrow it may be too late

don't just stand alone on a mountain top
join the world today
do it right away

don't you know that you are only what you do
so walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk


don't you know that you are only what you do
so walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

you see this girl
this girl's in love with you
yes, i'm in love
who looks at you the way i do
when you smile i can tell we know each other very well
how can i show you i'm glad i got to know you 'cause

i've heard some talk they say you think i'm fine
this girl's in love, and what i'd do to make you mine
tell me now, is it so, don't let me be the last to know
my hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause

i need your love, i want your love
say you're in love, and you'll be my guy
if not i'll just die

tell me now, is it so, don't let me be the last to know
my hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
i need your love, i want your love
say you're in love and you'll be my guy
if not i'll just die
my hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking

i got to say it and it's hard for me
you got me crying like i thought i would never be
love is believing but you let me down
how can i love you when you ain't around
and i
get to the morning and you never call
love should be everything or not at all
and it don't matter whatever you do
i made a life out of loving you
only to find any dream that i follow is dying
i'm crying in the rain
i could be searching my world for a love everlasting
feeling no pain
when will we meet again
why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that i never knew?
gotta get out of the spell that i'm under
my love for you
why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when i was being what you want me to be?
suddenly everything i ever wanted has passed me by
this world may end
not you and i
my love is stronger than the universe
my soul is crying for you
and that cannot be reversed
you made the rules and you could not see
you made a life out of hurting me
out of my mind
i am held by the power of you love
tell me when do we try
or should we say goodbye?
why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when i was being what you want me to be?
suddenly everything i ever wanted has passed me by
oh
why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that i never knew?
suddenly everything i ever wanted
my love for you, ooh
why do you have to be a heartbreaker

this is insane
all you did was say hello
speak my name
feeling your love
like a love i used to know
long ago

how can it be?
we're a different space in time
come to me
feel like i'm home in a place i used to know
long ago

déjà vu
could you be the dream that i once knew?
is it you?
déjà vu
could you be the dream that might come true?
shining through
i keep remembering me
i keep remembering you
déjà vu

this is divine
i've been waiting all my life
filling time
looking for you
that's worth more than you could know
long ago

come to me now
we don't have to dream of love
we know how
somewhere before it's as if i loved you so
so long ago

déjà vu
could you be the dream that i once knew?
is it you?
déjà vu
could you be the dream that might come true?
shining through
i keep remembering me
i keep remembering you
déjà vu


déjà vu
could you be the dream that i once knew?
is it you?
déjà vu
could you be the dream that might come true?
shining through
i keep remembering me
i keep remembering you
déjà vu
déjà vu
could you be the dream that i once knew?
is it you?
déjà vu
could you be the dream that might come true?
shining through

come closer now
so i can see you in the dark
i wanna hold your body next to mine
i wanna hurry, love, and take my time, mhm
hold onto me
and let me feel you in my arms
touch me and slowly steal my breath away
then tell me things that no one else would say

and i wanna feel your heart here every night
and i long to hear your voice saying, "it's alright"
to know you, so you

whisper in the dark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, oh
touch me with a spark, oh, oh
and as we join together, love, i'll never let you go, oh no

where we are
is where i always want to stay
i love to kiss you as we break apart
and share the secrets deep inside my heart

and i want to feel you right here every night
i long to hear your voice saying, "it's alright"
to know you, so you

whisper in the dark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, i know
touch me with a spark, oh, oh
and as we join together, love, i'll never let you go
never let you go

travel with me through time and space
each night is all we need
our love will be a private place
to come to, so you

whisper in the dark, in the dark
stuck there in the night, i know, oh
touch me with a spark, oh, oh
and as we join together, love
we will whisper in the dark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, oh
touch me with a spark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, oh
whisper in the dark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, oh
touch me with a spark, oh, oh
stuck there in the night, i know, oh

you led the way for me
in my indecision
you lit the darkest night
just to give me vision

you are the one who i could run to any time and many times
you take my hand and you understand
when friends of mine i cannot find

you're my hero
how can i thank you for what you've done?
said i was zero
now i feel like i'm number one

what made me realize
there's nothing you can't see
you looked at me with eyes
that saw what i could be

somehow with you i'm able to do
what i couldn't do on my own
you're all i need to know that i'm freed
from all my fears of the unknown

there were mountains to climb and some of those times
my strength was fading fast
for me you stood when nobody else would
you saved my future and me from my past

you're my hero
how can i thank you for what you've done?
i was zero
now i feel like i'm number one


when i didn't know which way to go
you showed me in the right direction
and you rescued me from what i could not see
and you're always there for my protection

you're my hero
how can i thank you for what you've done?
i was zero
now i feel like i'm number one
said you're my hero
how can i thank you for what you've done?
i was zero
now i feel like i'm number one
said you're my hero
how can i thank you for what you've done?

anyone who ever loved
could look at me
and know that i love you
anyone who ever dreamed
could look at me
and know i dream of you

knowing i love you so
anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms and love me, too
you couldn't really have a heart
and hurt me like you hurt me
and be so untrue
what am i to do?

every time you go away
i always say
"this time it's goodbye, dear"
loving you the way i do
i take you back
without you i'd die, dear
