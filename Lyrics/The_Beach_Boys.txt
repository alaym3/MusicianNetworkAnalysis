wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
then we wouldn't have to wait so long
and wouldn't it be nice to live together
in the kind of world where we belong?

you know it's gonna make it that much better
when we can say goodnight and stay together

wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
in the morning when the day is new?
after having spent the day together
hold each other close the whole night through

but happy times together we've been spending
i wish that every kiss was never-ending
oh, wouldn't it be nice?

maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
oh, we could be married (oh, we could be married)
and then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)
oh, wouldn't it be nice?

you know it seems the more we talk about it
it only makes it worse to live without it
but let's talk about it
but wouldn't it be nice?

goodnight, my baby
sleep tight, my baby
goodnight, my baby
sleep tight, my baby
goodnight, my baby
sleep tight, my baby

a diamond necklace played the pawn
hand in hand some drummed along, oh
to a handsome mannered baton
(bygone, bygone)

a blind class aristocracy
back through the opera glass you see
the pit and the pendulum drawn
(bygone, bygone)

columnated ruins domino
canvass the town and brush the backdrop
are you sleeping?

hung velvet overtaken me
dim chandelier awaken me
to a song dissolved in the dawn
(bygone, bygone)

the music hall a costly bow
the music all is lost for now
to a muted trumpeter swan
(bygone, bygone)

columnated ruins domino
canvass the town and brush the backdrop
are you sleeping, brother john?


dove nested towers the hour was
strike the street quicksilver moon
carriage across the fog
two-step to lamp lights cellar tune

the laughs come hard in auld lang syne
the glass was raised, the fired rose
the fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
while at port adieu or die

a choke of grief heart hardened, i
beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

surf's up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
aboard a tidal wave
come about hard and join
the young and often spring you gave
i heard the word
wonderful thing
a children's song


child, child, child, child, child
a child is the father of the man
child, child, child, child, child
a child is the father of the man
a children's song
have you listened as they played
their song is love
and the children know the way
that's why the child is the father to the man
child, child, child, child, child
child, child, child, child, child
na na na na na na na na
child, child, child, child, child
that's why the child is the father to the man
child, child, child, child, child

little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got (you don't know what i got)
little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got

well, i'm not bragging babe so don't put me down (deuce coupe)
but i've got the fastest set of wheels in town (deuce coupe)
when something comes up to me, he don't even try (deuce coupe)
'cause if i had a set of wings, man i know she could fly

she's my little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got
(my little deuce coupe)
(you don't know what i got)

just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill (deuce coupe)
but she'll walk a thunderbird like she's standing still (deuce coupe)
she's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
she'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

she's my little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got
(my little deuce coupe)
(you don't know what i got)

she's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
and she purrs like a kitten 'till the lake pipes roar
and if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
there's one more thing, i got the pink slip, daddy

and coming off the line when the light turns green (deuce coupe)
well, she blows them out of the water like you never seen (deuce coupe)
i get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer (deuce coupe)
when i get rubber in all four gears

she's my little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got
(my little deuce coupe)
(you don't know what i got)
she's my little deuce coupe
you don't know what i got

you don't know what i got

well, it's been building up inside of me for
oh, i don't know how long
i don't know why, but i keep thinking
something's bound to go wrong
but she looks in my eyes
and makes me realize

and she says (don't worry baby)
"don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)
everything will turn out alright"
(don't worry baby)
don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)

i guess i should've kept my mouth shut
when i started to brag about my car
but i can't back down now because
i pushed the other guys too far
she makes me come alive
and makes me wanna drive

when she says (don't worry baby)
"don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)
everything will turn out alright"
(don't worry baby)
don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)

she told me "baby, when you race today
just take along my love with you
and if you knew how much i loved you
baby, nothing could go wrong with you"
oh, what she does to me
when she makes love to me

and she says (don't worry baby)
"don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)
everything will turn out alright"
(don't worry baby)
don't worry baby
(don't worry baby)
everything will turn out alright

i keep looking for a place to fit in
where i can speak my mind
and i've been trying hard to find the people
that i won't leave behind
they say i got brains but they ain't doing me no good
i wish they could

each time things start to happen again
i think i got something good goin' for myself
but what goes wrong

sometimes i feel very sad (¿cuándo seré?)
sometimes i feel very sad (un día seré, ain't found the right thing i can put my heart and soul into)
sometimes i feel very sad (oh, ¿cuando seré? ain't found the right thing i can put my heart and soul into)
i guess i just wasn't made for these times

every time i get the inspiration
to go change things around
no one wants to help me look for places
where new things might be found
where can i turn when my fair weather friends cop out?
what's it all about?

each time things start to happen again
i think i got something good goin' for myself
but what goes wrong

sometimes i feel very sad (¿cuándo seré?)
sometimes i feel very sad (un día seré, ain't found the right thing i can put my heart and soul into)
sometimes i feel very sad (oh, ¿cuándo seré? ain't found the right thing  i can put my heart and soul into)
i guess i just wasn't made for these times


i guess i just wasn't made for these times
i guess i just wasn't made for these times
i guess i just wasn't made for these times
i guess i just wasn't made for these times
i guess i just wasn't made for these times
i guess i just wasn't made for these times

if every word i said
could make you laugh
i'd talk forever (together, my love)
i ask the sky just what we had
it shone forever
if the song i sing to you
could fill your heart with joy
i'd sing forever (together, my love)

forever, forever
i've been so happy loving you
together, my love

let the love i have for you
live in your heart
and beat forever (together, my love)

forever, forever
i've been so happy loving you

baby, just let me sing it, my baby
i want to be singing, my baby
baby, baby, baby, baby, my baby
i want to be singing, my baby

so i'm going away
but not forever
i'm gonna love you in your way
forever

i had to prove that i could make it alone now
but that's not me
i wanted to show how independent i'd grown now
but that's not me

i could try to be big in the eyes of the world
what matters to me is what i could be to just one girl

i'm a little bit scared 'cause i haven't been home in a long time
you needed my love and i know that i left at the wrong time

my folks when i wrote them told 'em what i was up to
said that's not me
i went through all kinds of changes, took a look at myself
and said that's not me

i miss my pad and the places i've known
and every night as i lay there alone
i would dream

i once had a dream, so i packed up and split for the city
i soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
i'm glad i went now i'm that much more sure that we're ready

i once had a dream, so i packed up and split for the city
i soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
i once had a dream, so i packed up and split for the city
i soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty

i know perfectly well i'm not where i should be
i've been very aware you've been patient with me
every time we break up you, bring back your love to me
and after all i've done to you, how can it be

you still believe in me

i try hard to be more what you want me to be
but i can't help how i act when you're not here with me
i try hard to be strong, but sometimes, i fail myself
and after all i've promised you so faithfully

you still believe in me

i wanna cry
cry
ah
ah
ah

well, she got her daddy's car
and she cruised through the hamburger stand, now
seems she forgot all about the library
like she told her old man, now
and with the radio blasting
goes cruising just as fast as she can now

and she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the t-bird away)

well, the girls can't stand her
'cause she walks, looks and drives like an ace, now
(you walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
she makes the indy 500 look like a roman chariot race, now
(you look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
a lot of guys try to catch her
but she leads them on a wild goose chase, now

and she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the t-bird away)

well, you knew all along
that your dad was getting wise to you, now
(you shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
and since he took your set of keys
you've been thinking that your fun is all through, now
(you shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
but you can come along with me
'cause we've got a lot of things to do, now
(you shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

and we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
and we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)

wooo-ooo-aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
wooo-ooo-aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
wooo-ooo-aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the t-bird away)

i've been in this town so long that back in the city
i've been taken for lost and gone
and unknown for a long long time
fell in love years ago
with an innocent girl
from the spanish and indian home
of the heroes and villains

once at night catillian squared the fight
and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
but she's still dancing in the night
unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

heroes and villains
just see what you've done
heroes and villains
just see what you've done

stand or fall i know there
shall be peace in the valley
and it's all an affair
of my life with the heroes and villains


my children were raised
you know they suddenly rise
they started so long ago
head to toe, healthy, wealthy and wise

i've been in this town so long
so long to the city
i'm fit with the stuff
to ride in the rough
and sunny down snuff i'm alright
by the heroes and

heroes and villains
just see what you've done
heroes and villains
just see what you've done

where did your long hair go?
where is the girl i used to know?
how could you lose that happy glow?
oh, caroline, no

who took that look away?
i remember how you used to say
you'd never change, but that's not true

oh, caroline, you
break my heart
i want to go and cry
it's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
oh, caroline, why?

could i ever find in you again
the things that made me love you so much then?
could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
oh, caroline, no
