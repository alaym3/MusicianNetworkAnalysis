first you was down with the ak
and now i see you on a video with michel'le
looking like straight bozos
i saw it coming, that's why i went solo
and kept on stompin'
while y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta compton
living with the whites
one big house and not another nigga in sight
i started off with too much cargo
dropped four niggas, now i'm making all the dough
white man just ruling
the niggas with attitudes? who you foolin'?

eazy-e saw your ass and went in it quick
you got jealous when i got my own company
but i'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
trying to sound like amerikkka's most
you could yell all day, but you don't come close
'cause you know i'm the one that flow
you done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
with the l-e-n-c-h m-o-b
and y'all disgrace the c-p-t
'cause you're getting fucked out your green
by a white boy, with no vaseline

tried to tell you a year ago
but willie d told me to let a ho be a ho, so
i couldn't stop you from getting ganked

tried to diss ice cube, it wasn't worth it
'cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
cut my hair? nah, cut them balls
'cause i heard you like giving up the drawers
gang-banged by your manager, fella
getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
giving up the dollar bills
now they got the villain with a purse and high-heels
so don't believe what ren say
'cause he's going out like kunta kinte
but i got a whip for you, toby
used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
it's a case of divide and conquer
'cause you let a jew break up my crew
house nigga gotta run and hide
yelling compton, but you moved to riverside
so don't front, mc ren
'cause i remember when you drove a b210
broke as a motherfucking joke
let you on the scene to back up the first team

half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
eazy-e turned faggot
with your manager, fella
fucking mc ren, dr. dre, and yella
but if they were smart as me
eazy-e would be hanging from a tree
with no vaseline
just a match and a little bit of gasoline
light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'til that jheri curl is gone
on a permanent vacation
off the massa plantation
heard you both got the same bank account
dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
get rid of that devil real simple
put a bullet in his temple
'cause you can't be the nigga 4 life crew
with a white jew telling you what to do
pulling wools with your scams
now i gotta play the silence of the lambs
with a midget who's a punk too
tryin' to fuck me, but i'd rather fuck you
eric wright

motherfuckin' jheri curl light, ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch

break 'em
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh

just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank god
i don't know, but today seems kinda odd
no barking from the dog, no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on, but didn't pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin', "will i live another twenty-four?"
i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop-top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim, and she can fuck all night
called up the homies and i'm askin' y'all
"which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, fucked around and got a triple double
freakin' niggas every way, like mj
i can't believe today was a good day

drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin' yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of niggas
and watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door little joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones, and i'm yellin': "domino!"
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day

left my nigga's house paid
picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
it's ironic, i had the brew, she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
and my dick runs deep, so deep
so deep put her ass to sleep
woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and i'm coastin'
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
no helicopter lookin' for a murder
two in the morning, got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read "ice cube's a pimp" (yeah)
drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
today i didn't even have to use my ak
i gotta say, it was a good day

hey, wait, wait a minute!
pooh, stop this shit!
what the fuck am i thinkin' about?

- prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. and then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. these are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- but wasn't compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- wrong! compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. when gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!
(maestro!!!) blame me!
you niggas know my pyroclastic flow
you niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
you niggas know my pyroclastic flow
it's r-a-w, r-a-w

you lookin' at the grand wizard

fuck a punk, 'cause i ain't him
you gotta deal with the nine-double-m
the day is coming that you'll all hate
just think if niggas decide to retaliate
they try to keep me from running up
i never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
so what they do, go and ban the ak?
my shit wasn't registered any fucking way
so you better duck away, run and hide out
when i'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'cause i'm about to fuck up the program
shooting out the window of a drop-top brougham
when i'm shooting, let's see who drop
the police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
and motherfuckers that say they too black
put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
and say we promote gangs and drugs
you wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
kicking shit called street knowledge
why more niggas in the pen than in college?
because of that line, i might be your cellmate
that's from the nigga ya love to hate

(fuck you ice cube!)

in slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
puddle full of blood
left for dead, the pain starts to spread
now i can’t feel my legs
i meet doctor who at king drew medical center
as i enter i.c.u
he said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
i said i can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
i sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
at night i jerk and jerk
but my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as ice cube
a'be pissing through a tube
fool i'm a vet

fool, i'm a vet you can bet
i can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
it’s raining bullets and i'm still there
young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

fuck a v-a they need g-a
gang hospital for a cripple
now i'm drinking ripple
same corner, same hood i'm still there
with bandanas tied to my wheel chair
to all the hood rat hoes i'm fired
they mad cause my tongue get tired
now everybody want to put they dope on me
sayin i won't get searched by the lapd
i'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
depending on that to keep my ass alive
i don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
with fucking legs looking like tooth picks
some times i can’t deal
got to beg the bg's to roll me up the hill
put me on the porch
now i'm on the torch
smoking cocaine
just to maintain
nothing to gain nothing to lose
and last night i couldn’t make it to the bathroom
feeling like a 2-year-old
you can’t get a sip from the brew i hold
it’s the only friend to a stranger
aka: handicapped gangbanger
there's a lot in my life i regret becoming a ghetto vet
fool i'm a vet

fool i'm a vet you can bet
that i could dance underwater and not get wet
check it
it's raining bullets and i'm still there
i'm still there
dedicated to all the ghetto vets
for every nigga that done took one for the hood

i gots ten to spend on the hen
so let the games begin
yakety yak don't talk back or it's on
callin' up earl on the car phone
mack 10 just got out of court
rollin' through the hood in his super sport bumping too $hort

and deep-dish daytons

flyin' in and out of town with half a chicken in her cock
and i love her, 'cause she down
to fuck around with the underground pussy hound
and her ass is big round and wide
jacked up, make a nigga down to ride
smoking indo, playing that super nintendo

gave her ass that pelvic thrust
don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound to bust
in the oven, in the nappy

'cause that hiv'll make your dick hang sideways
and that ain't cool, fool, 'cause it's friday

let 'em see a nigga invasion
point blank on a caucasian
cocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile
take me to your house, pal

crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
three weeks later, i'm at the p-a-d
had a little fly ass bitch wit me
sittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be
(what up, g?) saw my face on tv
damn (oh shit!) i didn't know i lucked out
struck out, i gotta get the fuck out
packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
the ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
cos the feds was out there ten deep
i got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
i think back when i was robbin' my own kind
the police didn't pay it no mind
but when i start robbing the white folks
now i'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope
i said it before and i'll still taught it
every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

amerikkka's most wanted, uh,  reports that ice cube is the leader of the, uh, lench mob. uh, also in the group they have j-dee, chill, t-bone, yo-yo, del, k-dee
sounds like a black thing

and when dealin' with da lench mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam
but a way of life
bound together by motherfuckers that's known to break em' off something

and fools can't hold us
every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
comin' up short of the green guys
and i might start slangin' bean pies
or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
with "u can't touch this" on the front
i'm out to get rich
'cause life ain't nothin' but money and fuck a bitch
they drop like dominoes
and if you didn't know, ice cube got drama, hoes
so after the screwin'
i bust a nut and get up and put on my white ewings
i'm out the door
all you might get is a rubber on the floor
'cause i'm ready to hit the road like mario andretti
bitch, cause i'm steady mobbin'

went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
jumped back in my lowrider
comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
went to bone's house so i can get the gat
looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
lench mob ain't nothin' but tramps
for hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
one fool bumpin' music for the yamps
but ice cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'cause i had the jam on
and i don't want to hear shit about a tampon
gimme the nappy and make me happy
the ho said, "pappy, could you slap me
on the ass hard and fast
and could please try not to leave a gash?"
i said, "yeah, but i don't play sex
without puttin' on the latex"
slipped on the condom
fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
and it came out sort of like confetti
in for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

every time i wanna go get a fuckin' brew
i gotta go down to the store with the two
oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
that make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
so they watch every damn move that i make
they hope i don't pull out a gat and try to rob
they funky little store, but, bitch, i got a job
look, you little chinese motherfucker
i ain't tryin' to steal none of this shit
leave me alone! (mother fuck you, yo, yo, check it out)
so don't follow me up and down your market
or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
of a nationwide boycott
juice with the people, that's what the boy got
so pay respect to the black fist
or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
and then we'll see ya
'cause you can't turn the ghetto into black korea

mother fuck you
