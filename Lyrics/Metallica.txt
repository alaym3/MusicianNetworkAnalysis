i can't remember anything
can't tell if this is true or a dream
deep down inside i feel to scream
this terrible silence stops me
now that the war is through with me
i'm waking up, i cannot see
that there's not much left of me
nothing is real but pain now

hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god, wake me

back in the womb it's much too real
in pumps life that i must feel
but can't look forward to reveal
look to the time when i'll live
fed through the tube that sticks in me
just like a wartime novelty
tied to machines that make me be
cut this life off from me

hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god, wake me


now the world is gone, i'm just one
oh, god help me
hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god, help me


darkness imprisoning me
all that i see, absolute horror
i cannot live, i cannot die
trapped in myself, body my holding cell
landmine has taken my sight
taken my speech, taken my hearing
taken my arms, taken my legs
taken my soul, left me with life in hell

end of passion play, crumbling away
i'm your source of self-destruction
veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
leading on your death's construction

taste me, you will see
more is all you need
dedicated to
how i'm killing you

come crawling faster (faster)
obey your master (master)
your life burns faster (faster)
obey your

master, master
master of puppets, i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master, master
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master, master

needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
pain monopoly, ritual misery
chop your breakfast on a mirror

taste me, you will see
more is all you need
dedicated to
how i'm killing you

come crawling faster (faster)
obey your master (master)
your life burns faster (faster)
obey your

master, master
where's the dreams that i've been after?
master, master
you promised only lies
laughter, laughter
all i hear or see is laughter
laughter, laughter
laughing at my cries
fix me


hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season

i will occupy
i will help you die
i will run through you
now i rule you too

come crawling faster (faster)
obey your master (master)
your life burns faster (faster)

new blood joins this earth, and quickly he's subdued
through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
his will they'll take away, yeah

what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never be, never see
won't see what might have been
what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"

they dedicate their lives to running all of his
he tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares to die regretfully
that old man here is me, yeah

what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never be, never see
won't see what might have been
what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"


what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never be, never see
won't see what might have been
what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven," whoa

never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"
you labeled me, i'll label you
so i dub thee "unforgiven"
ah, never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"
you labeled me, i'll label you
so i dub thee "unforgiven"
never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"

life, it seems, will fade away
drifting further every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters, no one else
i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free

things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly lost, this can't be real
cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me, but now he's gone

no one but me can save myself, but it's too late
now i can't think, think why i should even try
yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye

make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for their right, yes, but who's to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls

take a look to the sky just before you die
it's the last time you will
blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls

to kill the first born pharaoh son
i'm creeping death

welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full, never seems to change
just labelled mentally deranged
dream the same thing every night
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors, no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred
sleep, my friend, and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?

sanitarium
leave me be
sanitarium
just leave me alone


build my fear of what's out there
cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that i'm insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied, it makes him well
he's getting better, can't you tell?
no more can they keep us in
listen, damn it, we will win
they see it right, they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell

sanitarium
leave me be
sanitarium
just leave me alone

sanitarium
(just leave me alone)

fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill, it's such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again

lashing out the action, returning the reaction
weak are ripped and torn away
hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
battery is here to stay

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery, battery

crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
never-ending potency
hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
breeding on insanity

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery, battery

circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
powerhouse of energy
whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
we create the battery

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery, battery
battery, battery

(and the road becomes my bride)

halls of justice painted green, money talking
power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
soon you'll please their appetite they devour
hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe, i can't believe the price
you pay

nothing can save you
justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
pulling your strings, justice is done
seeking no truth, winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real

apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
inquisition sinking you with prying minds

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe, i can't believe the price
you pay

nothing can save you
justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
pulling your strings, justice is done
seeking no truth, winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real


lady justice has been raped, truth assassin
rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
their money tips her scales again, make your deal
just what is truth? i cannot tell, cannot feel

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe, i can't believe the price
we pay

nothing can save us
justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
pulling your strings, justice is done
seeking no truth, winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real

seeking no truth, winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real

lay beside me, tell me what they've done

the door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
if you can understand the me, then i can understand the you
lay beside me, under wicked sky
through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
the door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

or are you unforgiven too?

come lay beside me, this won't hurt i swear
she loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
she lay beside me, but she'll be there when i'm gone
black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when i'm gone
yes, she'll be there when i'm gone
dead sure she'll be there...

turn the pages, turn the stone
behind the door, should i open it for you?

by the last breath of the fourth winds blow
better raise your ears
the sound of hooves knock at your door
lock up your wife and children now
it's time to wield the blade
for now you've got some company

the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
they've come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah!

on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah!

the lines that crack your face
famine! your body, it has torn through
withered in every place
pestilence! for what you've had to endure
and what you have put others through
death! deliverance for you for sure
now there's nothing you can do


so gather round, young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
killing scores with demon swords
now's the death of doers of wrong
swing the judgment hammer down
safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
they've come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah!

guilty as charged, but dammit, it ain't right
there's someone else controlling me
death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
this can't be happening to me

who made you god to say
"i'll take your life from you?"

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
it's the beginning of the end
sweat, chilling cold, as i watch death unfold
consciousness, my only friend

my fingers grip with fear
what am i doing here?

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

someone help me
oh please, god, help me
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die


someone help me
oh please, god, help me
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die

time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
the final curtain call i see
how true is this? just get it over with
if this is true, just let it be

wakened by a horrid scream
freed from this frightening dream

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

bitterness and burden
curses rest on thee
solitaire and sorrow
all eternity
save the earth and claim perfection
deem the mass and blame rejection
hold the pose, feign perception
grudges break your back

all you bear
all you carry
all you bear
place it right on
right on me

die as you suffer in vain
own all the grief and the pain
die as you hold up the skies
atlas, rise!
how does it feel on your own?
bound by the world all alone
crushed under heavy skies
atlas, rise!

crucify and witness
circling the sun
bastardized in ruin
what have you become?
blame the world and blame your maker
wish 'em to the undertaker
crown yourself the other savior
so you carry on

all you bear
all you carry
all you bear
place it right on
right on me

die as you suffer in vain
own all the grief and the pain
die as you hold up the skies
atlas, rise!
how does it feel on your own?
bound by the world all alone
crushed under heavy skies
crushed under heavy skies
atlas, rise!


masquerade as maker
heavy is the crown
beaten down and broken
drama wears you down
overload, the martyr stumbles
hit the ground and heaven crumbles
all alone thy fears shall humble
swallow all your pride

all you bear
all you carry
all you bear
place it right on
right on me

die as you suffer in vain
own all the grief and the pain
die as you hold up the skies
atlas, rise!

bound by the world all alone
crushed under heavy skies

alright

we're scanning the scene in the city tonight
we're looking for you, to start up a fight
there's an evil feeling in our brains
but it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths
running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths

searching, seek and destroy
searching, seek and destroy!
searching, seek and destroy
searching, seek and destroy

there is no escape and that's for sure
this is the end, we won't take any more
say goodbye to the world you live in
you've always been taking and now you're giving

running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths
running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths

searching, seek and destroy
searching, seek and destroy!
searching, seek and destroy
searching, seek and destroy!


our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
and it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
there is only one thing on our minds
don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths
running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
dying, one thousand deaths

searching, seek and destroy
searching, seek and destroy!

searching, seek and destroy, a-ha ha ha ha

on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
you can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
there i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page

so you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
and most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
all the same old cliches: is it woman? is it man?
and you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page

out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
every ounce of energy, you try to give away
and the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
with the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
you smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
what she said

but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page

there i go, turn that page
there i go, yeah, there i go, yeah
there i go, yeah, here i go
there i go, there i go
and i'm gone
