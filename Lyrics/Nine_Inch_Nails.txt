i hurt myself today
to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but i remember everything

what have i become?
my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

i wear this crown of shit
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here
what have i become?
my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt
if i could start again
a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find a way 

you let me violate you
you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you
you let me complicate you

(help me)
i broke apart my insides
(help me)
i've got no soul to sell
(help me)
the only thing that works for me
help me get away from myself

i wanna fuck you like an animal
i wanna feel you from the inside
i wanna fuck you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to god

you can have my isolation
you can have the hate that it brings
you can have my absence of faith
you can have my everything
(help me)
you tear down my reason
(help me)
it's your sex i can smell
(help me)
you make me perfect
help me become somebody else

i wanna fuck you like an animal
i wanna feel you from the inside
i wanna fuck you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to god

through every forest
above the trees
within my stomach
scraped off my knees
i drink the honey
inside your hive
you are the reason
i stay alive 

god money, i'll do anything for you
god money, just tell me what you want me to
god money, nail me up against the wall
god money, don't want everything, he wants it all

no, you can't take it
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take that away from me
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take that away from me

head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control

bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
god money's not looking for the cure
god money's not concerned about the sick among the pure
god money, let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised
god money's not one to choose

no, you can't take it
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take that away from me
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take it
no, you can't take that away from me

head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control

bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole, black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control

bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve 

she spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
she leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
she has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

oh, my beautiful liar
oh, my precious whore
my disease, my infection
i am so impure

give it

devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
i now know the depths i reach are limitless
oh my beautiful liar
oh my precious whore
my disease, my infection
i am so impure
oh, my beautiful liar
oh, my precious whore
my disease, my infection
i am so impure
oh, my beautiful liar
oh, my precious whore
my disease, my infection
i am so impure 

he couldn't believe how easy it was
he put the gun into his face
bang!
(so much blood from such a tiny little hole)
problems do have solutions, you know
a lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash
everything's blue
everything's blue in this world
the deepest shade of mushroom blue
all fuzzy
spilling out of my head 

i am the voice inside your head
(and i control you)
i am the lover in your bed
(and i control you)
i am the sex that you provide
(and i control you)
i am the hate you try to hide
(and i control you)

i take you where you want to go
i give you all you need to know
i drag you down, i use you up
mr. self destruct

i speak religion's message clear
(and i control you)
i am denial, guilt, and fear
(and i control you)
i am the prayers of the naive
(and i control you)
i am the lie that you believe
(and i control you)
i take you where you want to go
i give you all you need to know
i drag you down, i use you up
mr. self destruct

you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)
you let me do this to you (i am an exit)

i am the needle in the vein
i am the high you can't sustain
i am the pusher, i'm a whore
i am the need in you for more

i am the bullet in the gun
(and i control you)
i am the truth from which you run
(and i control you)
i am the silencing machine
(and i control you)
i am the end of all your dreams
(and i control you)

step right up, march, push
crawl right up on your knees
please, greed, feed
(no time to hesitate)
i want a little bit
i want a piece of it
i think he's losing it
i want to watch it come down
don't like the look of it
don't like the taste of it
don't like the smell of it
i want to watch it come down

all the pigs are all lined up
i give you all that you want
take the skin and peel it back
now doesn't it make you feel better?

shove it up, inside, surprise!
lies, stains like the blood on your teeth
bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
i want to break it up
i want to smash it up
i want to fuck it up
i want to watch it come down
maybe afraid of it
let's discredit it
let's pick away at it
i want to watch it come down
all the pigs are all lined up
i give you all that you want
take the skin and peel it back
now doesn't it make you feel better?
the pigs have won tonight
now they can all sleep soundly
and everything is all right 

hey pig
yeah you
hey pig piggy pig pig pig
all of my fears came true
black and blue and broken bones
you left me here, i'm all alone
my little piggy needed something new

nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i just don't care

hey pig
nothing's turning out the way i planned
hey pig
there's a lot of things i hoped you could help me understand
what am i supposed to do?
i lost my shit because of you

nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now, 'cause i just don't care
nothing can stop me now

nothing can stop me
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now

nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop 

you had all of them on your side
didn't you? didn't you?
you believed in all your lies
didn't you? didn't you?
the ruiner's got a lot to prove
he's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
the ruiner's your only friend
well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
the raping of the innocent
you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
now the only pure thing left
in my fucking world is wearing your disease

how'd you get so big?
how'd you get so strong?
how'd it get so hard?
how'd it get so long?

you had to give them all a sign
didn't you? didn't you?
you had to covet what was mine
didn't you?  didn't you?
the ruiner's a collector
he's an infector serving his shit to his flies
maybe there will come a day
when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
maybe it's a part of me you took
to a place i hoped it would never go
and maybe that fucked me up
much more than you'll ever know
how'd you get so big?
how'd you get so strong?
how'd you get so hard?
how'd it get so long?
and what you gave to me
my perfect ring of scars
you know i can see
what you really are

you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop me now
you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop me now
you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop me now
you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop me now
you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop me now
you didn't hurt me
nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me
nothing can stop-- 

this is the first day of my last days
i built it up, now i take it apart
climbed up real high, now fall down real far
no need for me to stay
the last thing left, i just threw it away
i put my faith in god and my trust in you
now there's nothing more fucked up i could do

wish there was something real
wish there was something true
wish there was something real
in this world full of you

i'm the one without a soul
i'm the one with this big fucking hole
no new tale to tell
twenty-six years, on my way to hell
gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
don't think you're having all the fun
you know me, i hate everyone

wish there was something real
wish there was something true
wish there was something real
in this world full of you
i want to but i can't turn back
but i want to, but i can't turn back
i want to but i can't turn back
but i want to, but i can't turn back

wish there was something real
wish there was something true
wish there was something real
in this world full of you
wish there was something real
wish there was something true
wish there was something real
in this world full of you

this world full of you
this world full of you
this world full 

i beat my machine
it's a part of me, it's inside of me
i'm stuck in this dream
it's changing me, i am becoming
the me that you know
he had some second thoughts
he's covered with scabs
he is broken and sore
the me that you know
he doesn't come around much
that part of me isn't here anymore

all pain disappears
it's the nature of of my circuitry
drowns out all i hear
no escape from this, my new consciousness
the me that you know
he used to have feelings
but the blood has stopped pumping
and he is left to decay
the me that you know
is now made up of wires
and even when i'm right with you
i'm so far away
i can try to get away
but i’ve strapped myself in
i can try to scratch away
the sound in my ears
i can see it killing away
all of my bad parts
i don't want to listen
but it's all too clear
hiding backwards inside of me
i feel so unafraid
annie, hold a little tighter
i might just slip away

it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
it won't give up, it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head 

he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
he tries to tell me what i put inside of me
he's got the answers to ease my curiosity
he dreamed a god up and called it christianity

god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell i'll see you there

he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
his perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
demands devotion atrocities done in his name

god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell i'll see you there
your god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell i'll see you there

burning with your god in humility
will you die for this?
god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell i'll see you there
(your god is dead)
god is dead
(and no one cares)
and no one cares
(drowning in his own hypocrisy)
if there is a hell i'll see you there 

focus?
we didn't even notice
we awake in a place
we can barely recognize
yeah, hypnosis

and you can justify it all
your back was up against the wall again

shut up, silence
add a little violence
and offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

and you can always justify
the missile trails across the sky again

so, what are you waiting for?
you got what you asked for
did it fix what was wrong with you?
are you less than?
go and look what you gone done
welcome oblivion
did it fix what was wrong with you?
are you less than?
needful
too many fucking people
you'll have to take care of yourselves
you know i've got my hands full

and you can always justify
the missile trails across the sky again

oh, what are you waiting for?
you got what you asked for
did it fix what was wrong with you?
are you less than?
hey, look what you gone done
welcome oblivion
did it fix what was wrong inside?
are you less than?


so, what are you waiting for?
you got what you asked for
did it fix what was wrong with you?
are you less than? (are you less- are you less than?)
and look what you gone done
welcome oblivion
did it fix what was wrong inside?
are you less than?
yes this is about you

true believers
did it feel that hole
doesn't it make you feel better 

i'm losing ground
well you know how this world can beat you down
and i'm made of clay
i fear i'm the only one who thinks this way

i'm always falling down the same hill
bamboo puncturing this skin
and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall i'm drowning in
two feet below the surface i can still make out your wavy face
and if i could just reach you maybe i could leave this place

i do not want this
i do not want this
i do not want this
i do not want this
don't you tell me how i feel
don't you tell me how i feel
don't you tell me how i feel
you don't know just how i feel

i stay inside my bed
i have lived so many lives all in my head
don't tell me that you care
there really isn't anything, now, is there?
you would know, wouldn't you?
you extend your hand to those who suffer
to those who know what it really feels like
to those who've had a taste
like that means something
and oh so sick i am
and maybe i don't have a choice
and maybe that is all i have
and maybe this is a cry for help

i do not want this
i do not want this
i do not want this
i do not want this
don't you tell me how i feel
don't you tell me how i feel
don't you tell me how i feel
you don't know just how i feel

i want to know everything
i want to be everywhere
i want to fuck everyone in the world
i want to do something that matters
i want to know everything
i want to be everywhere
i want to fuck everyone in the world
i want to do something that matters
i want to know everything
i want to be everywhere
i want to fuck everyone in the world
i want to do something that matters
i want to know everything
i want to be everywhere
i want to fuck everyone in the world
i want to do something that matters
i want to know everything
i want to be everywhere
i want to fuck everyone in the world
i want to do something that matters 

i've become impossible
holding on to when
when everything seemed to matter more
the two of us
all used and beaten up
watching fate
as it flows
down the path
we have chose

you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you

awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
they pick and they pull
trying to get their fingers in
well, they've got to kill what we found
well, they've got to hate what they fear
well, they've got to make it go away
well, they've got to make it disappear
the farther i fall i'm beside you
as lost as i get i will find you
the deeper the wound i'm inside you
for ever and ever i am a part of
you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you

all that we were is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone we have to hold on
when all our hope is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone but we can hold on

you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
even after everything
you're the queen and i'm the king
nothing else means anything 

need you
dream you
find you
taste you
fuck you
use you
scar you
break you
lose me
hate me
smash me
erase me
kill me
kill me
kill me
kill me
kill me
kill me
kill me
kill me 

she shines in a world full of ugliness
she matters when everything is meaningless
fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
she tries to get away
sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
i can't watch her slip away

i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart

she reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
hoping someone can see
if i could fix myself i'd--
but it's too late for me

i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart
i won't let you fall apart
we'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
i'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
...but they keep waiting
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...

it's something i have to do
(i won't let you fall apart)
i was there, too
(i won't let you fall apart)
before everything else
(i won't let you fall apart)
i was like you
(i won't let you fall apart) 

i still recall the taste of your tears
echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
scraping through my head 'til i don't want to sleep anymore

you make this all go away
you make this all go away
i'm down to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself
you make this all go away
you make this all go away
i just want something
i just want something i can never have

you always were the one to show me how
back then i couldn't do the things that i can do now
this thing is slowly taking me apart
grey would be the color if i had a heart
come on, tell me!

you make this all go away
you make this all go away
i'm down to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself
you make this all go away
you make this all go away
i just want something
i just want something i can never have
in this place it seems like such a shame
though it all looks different now, i know it's still the same
everywhere i look you're all i see
just a fading fucking reminder of who i used to be
come on, tell me!

you make this all go away
you make this all go away
i'm down to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself
you make this all go away
you make it all go away
i just want something
i just want something i can never have
i just want something i can never have 

i believe i can see the future
'cause i repeat the same routine
i think i used to have a purpose
then again, that might have been a dream
i think i used to have a voice
now i never make a sound
i just do what i've been told
i really don't want them to come around
oh no

every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

i can feel their eyes are watching
in case i lose myself again
sometimes i think i'm happy here (sometimes)
sometimes, yet i still pretend
i can't remember how this got started, oh
but i can tell you exactly how it will end

every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same
i'm writing on a little piece of paper
i'm hoping someday you might find
well i'll hide it behind something
they won't look behind
i am still inside
a little bit comes bleeding through
i wish this could've been any other way
but i just don't know, i don't know
what else i can do

every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain (every day)
every day is exactly the same (exactly the same, every day)
every day is exactly the same (every day)
every day is exactly the same (there is no pain)
there is no love here and there is no pain (every day)
every day is exactly the same (every day is the same) 

you're keeping in step
in the line
got your chin held high and you feel just fine
cause you do
what you're told
but inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off your knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you want to change it?

what if this whole crusade's
a charade
and behind it all there's a price to be paid
for the blood
which we dine
justified in the name of the holy and the divine

just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off your knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you wanna change it?
so naïve
i keep holding on to what i want to believe
i can see
but i keep holding on and on and on and on

will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
