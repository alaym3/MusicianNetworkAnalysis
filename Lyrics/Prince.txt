until the end of time
i'll be there for you
you own my heart and mind
i truly adore you
if god one day struck me blind
your beauty i'll still see
love is too weak to define
just what you mean to me

from the first moment i saw you
i knew you were the one
that night i had to call you
i was rappin' 'till the sun came up
tellin' you just how fine you look
in a word, you were sex
all of my cool attitude you took
my body was next
you made love to me
like you was afraid
was you afraid of me?
was i the first?
was i your every fantasy?

that's why
until the end of time
i'll be there for you
you own my heart and mind
i truly adore you
if god one day struck me blind
your beauty i'll still see
love is too weak to define
just what you mean to me

when we be makin' love
i only hear the sounds
heavenly angels cryin' up above
tears of joy pourin' down on us
they know we need each other
they know you are my fix
i know, you know that i ain't cheatin' baby
they know this is serious
i ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
this condition i got is crucial
you could say that i'm a terminal case
you could burn up my clothes
smash up my ride--
well maybe not the ride
but i got to have your face
all up in the place
i'd like to think that i'm a man of exquisite taste
a hundred percent italian silk, imported egyptian lace
nothin', baby, i said nothin', baby, can compare
to your lovely face
do you know what i'm sayin' to you this evening?
i'm just tryin' to say

that until, until the end of time
i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you
you own my heart, you own my mind
i truly adore you
i truly adore you, darlin'
adore you
you don't know what you mean to me, baby
baby, baby
until the end of time
i'll be there for you
you own my heart and mind, i truly adore you
adore you

can i talk to you?
tell you what you mean to me
every time you wander
i'll be your eyes so you can see
i wanna show you things
that i never showed no other, i wanna be
more than your mother
more than your brother
i wanna be like no other
if you need me, i'll never leave
i know, that you know, without you there is no me
there is no me
without you there is no sea
there is no shore
love is too weak to define how much i adore
you child, you child
the last words you hear
be with me darlin' til the end of all time
i'll give you my heart
i'll give you my mind
i'll give you my body
i'll give you my time
for all time i am with you

you are with me
you are with me

nuestra presentacion especial comenzara en breve

good morning ladies and gentlemen
"what hotel number is she in?"
boys and motherfucking girls
"319, 319"
"cool"
this is your captain with no name speaking
and i'm here to rock your world
with a tale that will soon be classic
about a woman you already know
no prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
pussy control
are you ready?

aaah, pussy control, oh
aaah, pussy control, oh

our story begins in a schoolyard
a little girl skipping rope with her friends
a tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
just school books for the fight she would be in
one day over this hoodie
she got beat for some clothes and her rep
with her chin up, she scolded "all y'all's molded
when i'm rich, on your neck i will step"
and step she did to the straight a's
then college, the master degree
she hired the heifers that jumped her
and made everyone of them work for free?
no! why?
so what if my sisters are trifling?
they just don't know
she said "mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'girl, you need pussy control'"
are you ready?

aaah, pussy control, oh
aaah, pussy control, oh

pussy got bank in her pockets
before she got dick in her drawers
if brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
in love pussy never did fall
and this fool named trick want to stick her
uh, talking more shit than a bit
'bout how he going to make pussy a star
if she come and sing a lick on his hit
pussy said "nigga, you crazy if you don't know
every woman in the world ain't a freak
you can go platinum four times
still couldn't make what i make in a week
so push up on somebody want to hear that
cuz this somebody here don't want to know
boy, you better act like you understand
when you roll with pussy control"
are you ready?

aaah, pussy control, oh
aaah, pussy control, oh

with one more verse to the story
i need another piece of your ear
i want to hip you all to the reason
i'm known as the player of the year
'cause i met this girl named pussy
at the club international balls
she was rolling four-deep
three sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving her haul
i pulled up right beside her
and my electric top went down
i said motherfucker, i know your reputation
and i'm astounded that you're here
i fear you're lonely and you want to know
a 12 o'clock straight up nigga
that don't give a shit that you're pussy control
well i'm that nigga, at least i want to be
but it's going to be hard as hell
to keep my mind off a body
that would make every rich man
want to sell, sell, sell
75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!
can i tell you what i'm thinking that you already know?
you need a motherfucker that respects your name"
now say it, pussy control
are you ready?

aaah, pussy control, oh
aaah, pussy control, oh

and the moral of this motherfucker is
ladies, make'em act like they know
you are, was, and always will be pussy control
are you ready?
peace and be wild
aaah, pussy control

oh
oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho

are you ready?
aaah, pussy control
are you ready?

i can see whomever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
but nothing, i said nothing can take away these blues

'cause nothing compares

nothing, nothing

it's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling

i could put my arms around every girl i see
but they'd only remind me of you
i went to the doctor and guess what he told me
guess what he told me
he said, "boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
but he's a fool

'cause nothing compares
no, nothing compares to you
nothing, nothing


all the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
all died when you went away
i know that living with me, baby, was some kind of hard
but i'm willing to give it another try

'cause nothing compares
no, nothing compares to you
i said nothing compares
nothing compares to you

i ain't got no money
i ain't like those other guys you hang around

and when the night falls before that day i will cry
i will cry tears of joy cuz after you all one can do is die, oh

i remember when i met you, baby
you were on your way to be wed
you were such a sexy thing
i loved the way you walked, the things you said
and i was so nonchalant
i didn't want you to be misled
but i've got to have you, baby
i got to have you in my bed
you said:
"but i'm just a virgin, and i'm
on my way to be wed
but you're such a hunk
so full of spunk"

i'll give you head till you're burning up
head till you get enough
head till your love is red
head, love you till you're dead

you know you're good, girl
i think you like to go down
you wouldn't have stopped
but uh, i came on your wedding gown
and you said:
"i must confess
i wanna get undressed and go to bed"
with that i jammed, you fool
you married me instead

now morning, noon, and night

when you were mine
i gave you all of my money
time after time
you done me wrong
it was just like a dream
you let all my friends come over and meet
and you were so strange
you didn't have the decency to change the sheets
oh girl, when you were mine
i used to let you wear all my clothes
you were so fine (so fine)
maybe that's the reason
that it hurt me so

i know (i know)
that you're going with another guy
i don't care (don't care)
cause i love you, baby, that's no lie
i love you more than i did
when you were mine

when you were mine
you were kinda sorta my best friend
so i was blind (so blind)
i let you fool around
i never cared (didn't care)
i never was the kind to make a fuss
when he was there
sleeping in between the two of us

i know (i know)
that you're going with another guy
i don't care (don't care)

i was only 16, but i guess that's no excuse
my sister was 32, lovely and loose
she don't wear no underwear
she said it only gets in her hair
and it's got a funny way of stopping the juice
my sister never made love to anyone else but me
she's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
showed me where it's supposed to go
a blow job doesn't mean blow
incest is everything it's said to be

oh, sister
don't put me on the street again
oh, sister
i just want to be your friend

i was only 16 and only half a man
my sister didn't give a goddamn
she only wanted to turn me out
she took a whip to me until i shout
"oh, motherfucker, sister,  motherfucker
can't you understand?

oh, sister
don't put me on the street again
oh, sister
i just want to be your friend

i'll do what you want me to do
don't put me on the street and make me blue
oh, sister, ooh sister, ooh

it was 7:45 we were all in line
to greet the teacher miss cathleen
first was kevin, then came lucy, third in line was me
all of us were ordinary compared to cynthia rose
she always stood at the back of the line
a smile beneath her nose
her favourite number was 20 and every single day
if you asked her what she had for breakfast
this is what she'd say

starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham
if you set your mind free, baby
maybe you'd understand
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam

cynthia wore the prettiest dress
with different colour socks
sometimes i wondered if the mates were in her lunch box
me and lucy opened it when cynthia wasn't around
lucy cried, i almost died, you know what we found?

starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham
if you set your mind free, baby
maybe you'd understand
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam

(starfish and coffee)
cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
on every wall in every school
but it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
go on, cynthia, keep singing

starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham
if you set your mind free, baby
maybe you'd understand
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam

(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told you so)
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told you so)

ohh, ah, yeah
page one

you work so hard, you really do
i don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as you
hot desert sun, you can feel the heat
every drop of sweat on your brow is well earned
so you best believe

i got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(ooh woo)
i got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(ooh woo)

when you give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
you can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
every one of your worries
(all your worries)
all your miseries
(all your miseries)
you can put them in a little boat and ship them off to sea
'cause

i got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(ooh woo)
i got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(ooh woo)

i got a thousand hugs and kisses
for when you come back home
uh, come here!

the world can be
well to put it frankly
such a bitch sometimes
seems like love that lasts forever
is kinda hard to find
most of the people we know just lookin' for a reason to cry
as long as you got me i got your back and this is why

you work so hard, you really do
i don't think that anyone could work as hard as you
you can lock the door (lock the door)
you better turn off the phone (turn off your phone)
'cause i'm gonna give you a thousand reasons why we need to be alone

oh oh
ooooh oooh
hey baby
i got a thousand hugs for you
and when you come back home
sugar baby

i wanna hold you
tie you up in lace
and i wanna kiss you
kiss you all over your face
i wanna love you all up and down
give you love like you never had
blindfold, gagged, and bound
i'm wanna love you, baby
one time
two time
three time

i got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
love you up and love you down
love you 'til you make them sounds

dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
she worked the night shift
dishwater blonde, tall and fine
she got a lot of tips

well, earlier i'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
fightin' with lover's past
i needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
dorothy was fast

well, i ordered: "yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, i ain't too hungry"
dorothy laughed
she said: "it sound like a real man to me
(you're kinda cute)
you're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?"
(do you wanna, do you wanna?)
... bath?

oh, i said: "cool, but i'm leavin' my pants on (what you say?)
'cause i'm kinda goin' with someone"
she said: "sound like a real man to me
mind if i turn on the radio?"
"oh, my favorite song," she said
and it was joni singing: "help me, i think i'm falling"
(drring) the phone rang and she said
"whoever's calling can't be as cute as you"
right then and there i knew i was through
(dorothy parker was cool)
well

my pants were wet, they came off
but she didn't see the movie 'cause she hadn't read the book first
instead she pretended she was blind
an affliction brought on by a witch's curse
dorothy made me laugh
(ha ha, ha ha)
i felt much better so i went back to the violent room
(tell us what you did, what you did)
let me tell you what i did

i took another bubble bath with my pants on
all the fighting stopped
next time i'll do it sooner
this is the ballad of dorothy parker
dorothy parker, dorothy parker, dorothy parker
dorothy parker, dorothy parker, dorothy parker

well
dorothy parker, dorothy parker
well
oh
