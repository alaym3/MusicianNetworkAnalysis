i've been long, a long way from here
put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
and drank 'til i was thirsty again
we went searching through thrift store jungles
found geronimo's rifle, marilyn's shampoo
and benny goodman's corset and pen

well, okay, i made this up
i promised you i'd never give up

if it makes you happy
it can't be that bad
if it makes you happy
then why the hell are you so sad?

you get down, real low down
you listen to coltrane, derail your own train
well, who hasn't been there before?
i come 'round, around the hard way
bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
and serve you french toast again

well, okay, i still get stoned
i'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

if it makes you happy
it can't be that bad
if it makes you happy
then why the hell are you so sad?

if it makes you happy
it can't be that bad
if it makes you happy
then why the hell are you so sad?

we've been far, far away from here
put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
and everywhere in between

well, okay, we get along
so what if right now everything's wrong?

if it makes you happy
it can't be that bad
if it makes you happy
then why the hell are you so sad?

if it makes you happy
it can't be that bad
if it makes you happy
then why the hell are you so sad?

my friend the communist
holds meetings in his rv
i can't afford his gas
so i'm stuck here watching tv

i don't have digital
i don't have diddly squat
it's not having what you want
it's wanting what you've got

i'm gonna soak up the sun
i'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
i'm gonna tell 'em that i've got no one to blame

i've got a crummy job
it don't pay near enough
to buy the things it'd take
to win me some of your love

every time i turn around
i'm looking up, you're looking down
maybe something's wrong with you
that makes you act the way you do

i'm, i'm gonna soak up the sun
i'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
i'm gonna tell 'em that i've got no one to blame
for every time i feel lame i'm lookin' up

i'm gonna soak up the sun
while it's still free
i'm gonna soak up the sun
before it goes out on me

don't have no master suite
but i'm still the king of me
you have a fancy ride, but baby
i'm the one who has the key

every time i turn around
i'm lookin' up, you're lookin' down
maybe something's wrong with you
that makes you act the way you do
maybe i am crazy too

i'm gonna soak up the sun
i'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
i'm gonna tell 'em that i've got no one to blame
for every time i feel lame i'm lookin' up
i'm gonna soak up the sun
i'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up (to lighten up)
i'm gonna tell 'em that i've got no one to blame
for every time i feel lame i'm lookin' up (i'm lookin' up)

i'm gonna soak up the sun

"all i wanna do is have a little fun before i die"
says the man next to me, out of nowhere
it's apropos of nothing
he says his name is william
but i'm sure he's bill or billy or mac or buddy
and he's plain ugly to me
and i wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
we are drinking beer at noon on tuesday
in a bar that faces a giant car wash
the good people of the world
are washing their cars on their lunch break
hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts and suits
they drive their shiny datsuns and buicks
back to the phone company, the record store too
well, they're nothing like billy and me, 'cause

all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard

i like a good beer buzz early in the morning
and billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of bud
he shreds them on the bar
then he lights every match in an oversized pack
letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
and he's watching the bottles of bud as they spin on the floor
and a happy couple enters the bar
dangerously close to one another
the bartender looks up from his want ads, but

all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard

otherwise the bar is ours
the day and the night and the car wash too
the matches and the buds and the clean and dirty cars
the sun and the moon, but

all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling the party has just begun
all i wanna do is have some fun
i won't tell you that you're the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard
until the sun comes up over santa monica boulevard

i'm american made, bud light, chevrolet
my mama taught me wrong from right
i was born in the south
sometimes i have a big mouth
when i see something that i don't like
i gotta say it
well, we've been driving this road for a mighty long time
paying no mind to the signs
well, this neighborhood's changed
it's all been rearranged
we left that dream somewhere behind

slow down, you're gonna crash
baby you were screaming it's a blast, blast, blast
look out babe, you've got your blinders on
everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
real gone
real gone

but there's a new cat in town
he's got high-paid friends
thinks he's gonna change history
you think you know him so well
yeah you think he's so swell
but he's just perpetuatin' prophecy

(c'mon now)
slow down, you're gonna crash
baby you were screaming it's a blast, blast, blast
look out, you've got your blinders on
everybody's looking for a way
to get real gone (uh uh uh uh)
real gone (uh uh uh uh)
real gone (uh uh uh uh)
real gone (uh uh uh uh)
uh

well you can say what you want
but you can't say it 'round here
cause they'll catch you and give you a whippin'
well, i believe i was right when i said you were wrong
you didn't like the sound of that
now, did ya?

slow down, you're gonna crash
baby you were screaming it's a blast, blast, blast
look out, you've got your blinders on
everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
well here i come and i'm so not scared
got my pedal to the metal, got my hands in the air
look out, you take your blinders off
everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
real gone
real gone
ooh

i hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
he said he's been down this road more than twice
he was high on intellectualism
i've never been there, but the brochure looks nice

jump in, let's go
lay back, enjoy the show
everybody gets high, everybody gets low
these are the days when anything goes

everyday is a winding road
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a faded sign
i get a little bit closer to feeling fine

he's got a daughter, he calls easter
she was born on a tuesday night
i'm just wondering why i feel so all alone
why i'm a stranger in my own life

jump in, let's go
lay back, enjoy the show
everybody gets high, everybody gets low
these are the days when anything goes

everyday is a winding road
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a faded sign
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a winding road
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a faded sign
i get a little bit closer to feeling fine

i've been swimmin' in a sea of anarchy
i've been living on coffee and nicotine
i've been wondering if all the things i've seen
were ever real, were ever really happening (really happening)

everyday is a winding road
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a faded sign
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a winding road
i get a little bit closer
everyday is a faded sign
i get a little bit closer to feeling fine

everyday is a winding road
everyday is a winding road
everyday is a winding road
everyday is a winding road

ooooooooh
ooooooooh
ooooooooh

i woke up and called this morning
the tone of your voice was a warning
that you don't care for me anymore

i made up the bed we sleep in
i looked at the clock when you creep in
it's 6 a.m., and i'm alone

did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
to the bad day i was just beginning?
when you go all i know is
you're my favorite mistake

your friends are sorry for me
they watch you pretend to adore me
but i'm no fool to this game

now here comes your secret lover
she'd be unlike any other
until your guilt goes up in flames

did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
to the bad day i've gotten used to spending?
when you go all i know is
you're my favorite mistake
you're my favorite mistake

well, maybe nothing lasts forever
even when you stay together
i don't need forever after
it's your laughter won't let me go
so i'm holding on this way

did you know, could you tell
you were the only one that i ever loved?
now everything's so wrong
did you see me walking by?
did it ever make you cry?
you're my favorite mistake
you're my favorite mistake
you're my favorite mistake

ten years living in a paper bag

god, i feel like hell tonight
tears of rage i cannot fight
i'd be the last to help you understand
are you strong enough to be my man?
my man

nothing's true and nothing's right
so let me be alone tonight
'cause you can't change the way i am
are you strong enough to be my man?

lie to me
i promise i'll believe
lie to me
but please don't leave, don't leave

i have a face i cannot show
i make the rules up as i go
just try and love me if you can
are you strong enough to be my man?
my man

(are you strong enough)
to be my man?
(are you strong enough)
to be my man?
(are you strong enough?)
my man

when i've shown you that i just don't care
when i'm throwing punches in the air
when i'm broken down and i can't stand
would you be man enough to be my man?

lie to me
i promise i'll believe
lie to me
but please don't leave

i would've given you all of my heart
but there's someone who's torn it apart
and he's taken just all that i have
but if you want, i'll try to love again
baby, i'll try to love again, but i know

the first cut is the deepest
baby, i know
the first cut is the deepest
but when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
when it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

i still want you by my side
just to help me dry the tears that i've cried
but i'm sure gonna give you a try
'cause if you want, i'll try to love again (try)
baby, i'll try to love again, but i know, oh

the first cut is the deepest
baby, i know
the first cut is the deepest
but when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed

darling, i'm killed
i'm in a puddle on the floor
waiting for you to return
oh, what a thrill
fascinations galore
how you tease
how you leave me to burn
it's so deadly, my dear
the power of having you near

until that day
until the world falls away
until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
i see it in your eyes
tomorrow never dies

darling, you've won
it's no fun
martinis, girls and guns
it's murder on our love affair
but you bet your life, every night
while you're chasing the morning light
you're not the only spy out there
it's so deadly, my dear
the power of wanting you near

but until that day
until the world falls away
until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
i see it in your eyes
tomorrow never dies


until that day
until the world falls away
until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
i see it in your eyes

until that day

until that day

come to me now
and lay your hands over me
even if it's a lie
say it will be alright
and i shall believe
i'm broken in two
and i know you're on to me
that i only come home
when i'm so all alone
but i do believe

that not everything is going to be the way
you think it ought to be
it seems like every time i try to make it right
it all comes down on me
please say honestly you won't give up on me
and i shall believe
and i shall believe

open the door
and show me your face tonight
i know it's true
no one heals me like you
and you hold the key
never again
would i turn away from you
i'm so heavy tonight
but your love is alright
and i do believe

that not everything is going to be the way
you think it ought to be

it all comes down on me

he's got a smile
and it seems to me
reminds me of childhood memories
where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky

and now and then when i see his face
it takes me away to that special place
and if i stared too long
i'd probably break down and cry

oh, ooh oh, sweet child 'o mine
ooo, oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

he's got eyes of the bluest skies
as if they thought of rain
i'd hate to look into those eyes
and see an ounce of pain

his hair reminds me
of a warm safe place
where as a child i'd hide
and pray for the thunder
and the rain
to quietly pass me by

ohh, ooh oh sweet child o' mine
ooh oh oh ohh, sweet love of mine

oh, oh oh ohh, sweet child o' mine
ooh, hey, hey
ohh oh, sweet love of mine

where do we go
where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go
where do we go now
where do we go

where do we go, sweet child
where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go, sweet child
where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go now
now, now, now, now, now, now, now
sweet child
sweet child o' mine

my yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away
but every now and then you come to mind
'cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
but when your name was called, you found a place to hide
when you knew that i was always on your side

everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
but my demons and my angels reappeared
leavin' only traces of the man you thought i'd be
too afraid to hear the words i'd always feared
leavin' you with only questions all these years

but is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
or are you left to wonder, all alone eternally?
this isn't how it's really meant to be
no it isn't how it's really meant to be

well they say that love is in the air (love is in the air), never is it clear
how to pull it close and make it stay
well butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away
and i'm left to carry on and wonder why
even through it all, i'm always on your side

but is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally?
this isn't how it's really meant to be
no it isn't how it's really meant to be

well they say that love is in the air, never is it clear
how to pull it close and make it stay
if butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away?
leavin' me to carry on and wonder why
was it you that kept me wandering through this life
when you know that i was always on your side?

you pull up in your hummer and you park next to my volt
wearing armani three piece, i wear levi's full of holes
well, i walk along the left side, and you walk along the right
we're both tryin' to reach the same place
we might not get there on time

but you know what's best
i know what's best
let's just agree to disagree
and we all know the rest, yeah

baby, if you dare
if you really care
baby, if you dare
won't you meet me halfway there?
baby, if you care
if you really care
baby, if you dare
won't you meet me halfway there?
yeah

each and every sunday morning, you sit in your church pew
i'm sittin' on a mountain, takin' in this glorious view
well, i know your god is listening, and i know mine must be too
and if god is love and love is godly, why do we argue?

i don't know why
but i wanna try
well, we can listen to each other
before we criticize, yeah

baby, if you care
if you really care
baby, if you dare
won't you meet me halfway there?
baby, if you care
if you really care
baby, if you care
won't you meet me halfway there?
whoo!

could you meet me down the river, hash it out over a beer?
could you smoke from the same peace pipe 'til our anger disappears?
you want respect (respect)
you just want love (love)
i want that too, for you, and for me, and everyone, yeah

but you know what's best
and i know what's best
let's just agree to disagree
and give this thing a rest

baby, if you care
if you really care
baby, if you dare
won't you meet me halfway there?
baby, if you care

where the grass is green

she was born in november 1963
the day aldous huxley died
and her mama believed
that every man could be free
so her mama got high, high, high
and her daddy marched on birmingham
singing mighty protest songs
and he pictured all the places
where he knew that she belonged
but he failed and taught her young
the only thing she'd need to carry on
he taught her how to

run baby run baby run baby run
baby run
run baby run baby run baby run
baby run
past the arms of the familiar
and their talk of better days
to the comfort of the strangers
slipping out before they say
so long
baby loves to run

she counts out all her money
in the taxi on the way to meet her plane
stares hopeful out the window
at the workers fighting
through the pouring rain
and she's searching through the stations
for an unfamiliar song
and she's thinking about the places
that she knows she still belongs
she smiles the secret smile
that's sure she knows exactly how
to carry on

so run baby run baby run baby run
baby run
so run baby run baby run baby run
baby run
from the old familiar faces and
their old familiar ways
to the comfort of the strangers
slipping out before they say
so long
baby loves to run

and she's searching through the stations
for an unfamiliar song
and she pictures all the places
that she knows she still belongs
she smiles the secret smile
because she knows exactly how
to carry on

life springs eternal
on a gaudy neon street
not that i care at all
i spent the best part of my losing streak
in an army jeep
for what i can't recall
oh, i'm banging on my tv set
and i check the odds
and i place my bet
i pour a drink
and i pull the blind
and i wonder what i'll find

i'm leaving las vegas
lights so bright
palm sweat, blackjack
on a saturday night
leaving las vegas
leaving for good, for good
i'm leaving for good
i'm leaving for good

used to be i could drive up to
barstow for the night
find some crossroad trucker
to demonstrate his might
but these days it seems that
nowhere is far enough away
so i'm leaving las vegas today

i'm leaving las vegas oh
lights so bright
blackjack
on a saturday night
i'm leaving las vegas
i'm leaving for good
i'm leaving for good
for good

i'm standing in the middle of the desert
waiting for my ship to come in
but now no joker, no jack, no king
can take this loser hand
and make it win

i'm leaving las vegas
i'm leaving las vegas
for good
for good

i quit my job as a dancer
at the lido des girls
dealing blackjack until one or two
such a muddy line between
the things you want
and the things you have to do

i'm leaving las vegas (oh, oh, oh)
lights so bright
palm sweat
blackjack
on a saturday night
leaving las vegas
i'm leaving for good

on a saturday night

i'm leaving las vegas
and i won't be back
no, no, no, no
no, i won't be back

i woke up this morning
now i understand
what it means to give your life
to just one man
afraid of feeling nothing
no bees or butterflies
my head is full of voices
and my house is full of lies

this is home, home
and this is home, home
this is home

i found your standing there
when i was seventeen
now i'm thirty-two
and i can't remember what i'd seen in you
i made a promise
said it everyday
now i'm reading romance novels
and i'm dreaming of yesterday

this is home, home
and this is home, home
this is home

i'd like to see the riviera
and slow dance underneath the stars
i'd like to watch the sun come up
in a stranger's arms

this is home, home
and this is home, home
this is home

i'm going crazy
a little everyday
and everything i wanted
is now driving me away
i woke this morning
to the sound of breaking hearts
mine is full of questions
and it's tearing yours apart...

there's a fly on the wall, in the house on the hill
where the king of the world, watches tv
and the people await, for his latest mandate
to a nation of angry believers
his words are a trap, while his loyal band of thugs
cover up all his many transgressions
the fly, lands on his ear and whispers, "what's there to fear, as long as you're still the obsession?"
is it too late to turn back now?
too late to see the light?
do you make a vow to heaven and hell?
when you wake up at night, do you ask yourself?

in thе end
did you feed them? how'd you treat thеm?
is it so hard to love?
in the end
like you mean it, like you've seen it
you get back what you give, in the end

there's a man on the cross with his arms open wide
and a fear that they'll quench the world's fires
but his name is a shield to the ones who would fear
their own power and greed, and desire

in the end
did you need them? how'd you treat them?
is it so hard to love?
in the end
like you mean it, like you've seen it
you get back what you give, in the end
is it so hard to love?
in the end
you get back what you give, in the end


you'll only live once, or maybe you'll live twice
depending on how well you spend it
you see, karma's a drag, you come back as a rat
dozen traps, they'll bite your own descendants
is it too late to turn back now?
too late to turn around?
you'll get, one chance in this life
you can turn around things or you can close your eyes

in the end
did you feed them? how'd you treat them?
is it so hard to love?
in the end
like you mean it, like you've seen it
you get back what you give, in the end
in the end
did you hear them? did you feed them?
is it so hard to love?
in the end
like you mean it, like you've seen it
you get back what you give, in the end
you get back what you give in, the end

oh, in the end
oh, in the end

money is the bentley parked on wall street
money is the new friends you make each week
money is the inside guy at the bank
money is the yacht right before it sank
bet you never thought you'd want so much
bet you never thought it'd be so tough
so you sell your soul for a piece of the pie
now you can't sleep so you don't even try

i wouldn't want to be like you
i wouldn't want to be like you
no way
i wouldn't want to be like you
you tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
but that don't make it true

money is the monkey giving you a back ache
money is the grease in the palm of a handshake
money covers up all the evidence
not taking all the money would have made the best sense
bet you never thought you'd bleed that much
bet you never thought it'd be so rough
you thought you could beat them at their game
but they wrote the rules, now you take the blame

i wouldn't want to be like you
i wouldn't want to be like you
no way
i wouldn't want to be like you
you tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
but that don't make it true

all the players on the sidelines
feigning shock and innocence
hear no, see no, speak no evil
take the fall for all of the place

money is the orange jumpsuit you're wearing
money is the gray roots in your blonde hair and
money is the ex-wife and the ex-girlfriends
money you hid is the money they're spending
here's to the brand new diamond bracelet
here's to the too tight ankle bracelet
here's to the days before you went down
'cause what goes around comes around and around

i wouldn't want to be like you
i wouldn't want to be like you
no way
oh, i wouldn't want to be like you
you tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
but that don't make it true

i wouldn't want to be like you
no way
oh, i wouldn't want to be like you
you tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
but that don't make it true
no, that don't make it true
no, that don't make it true

you wanna build your walls
i wanna knock them down
looking for a heartbeat
but i don't hear a sound

but anything's better than hanging 'round together
knowing that the other one's through
and honestly, i don't think it's the biggest when we sink
but it's feeling like we're breaking in two

tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over
'cause i don't wanna be the last to know

and i count the days
but i think our number's up
is there anyway, oh
to make you feel enough?

and i can see something's changed
everything's feeling strange
and neither one of us knows why
and i don't wanna face it
we're in a situation where somebody's always saying goodbye

tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over
'cause i don't wanna be

caught up in a dream (caught up in a dream)
ridin' love supreme
but i know it's coming (and i know it's coming)
yeah, i know it's coming (and i know it's coming, coming)
see it in your face (see it in your face)
you let a good thing go to waste
'cause you keep on running (keep on running)
you keep on running away from love

tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (oh, tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (tell me when it's over)
tell me when it's over (oh)

caught up in a dream (caught up in a dream)
where i  love supreme
but i know it's coming (and i know it's coming)
yeah, i know it's coming (and i know it's coming, coming)
see it in your face (see it in your face)
you let a good thing go to waste
'cause you keep on running (keep on running)
you keep on running away from love
hold me in your arms (hold me in your arms)
come on, let me feel your heart
though i know it's coming (and i know it's coming)
yeah, i know it's coming (and i know it's coming, coming)
see it in your face (see it in your face)
you let a good thing go to waste
'cause you keep on running (keep on running)
you keep on running away from love

keep on running
keep on running, ooh-ooh
keep on running
keep on running
keep on running
keep on running
yeah, yeah
