turn my mic up
turn my mic up

(ready on the right) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the left) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the right) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the left) fuck it, blackout, niggas!

(oh, my lord!) lower the casket down (down!)
sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (pow!)
frown while i shit on your crown, skip town (town!)
ground zero, shapiro, the king cash cow (cow—cow)
do i make 'em say "wow!"? strip! (ow!)
bow! i sit with the pound, click, (blaow!) blaow!
click, click, (blaow!) click, (blaow!)
stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now
bitches, i’m making them skip with thou
art, you don’t really want start, when i growl (growl)
(rawr, rawr, rawr!)
let me come and mop up the knockoffs​
when i pop off and never stop, 'cause
when we do come through, you better lock doors (pause!)
the wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
no need to cook up the coke, you see? we cop raw
and if you ain’t had enough—
what in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
back with the b.a baracus, callous bang, on another song
i’mma have these niggas nervous
and clipping they nails and dribbling
and witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
see these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
and i shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
fouler, than a weed smell, nigga, your tree fell
see how they twitter, facebook and instagramming an email?
talking i'm sick, i got them shook and i bang 'em at retail
until they cripple, see i cook, like i’m slanging a weed sale
until i triple bred, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (*gasp!*)oh, see well, these niggas already know
the way that i fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
your bitch remind me of replacement butt
kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
like she was a basement fuck
swell up this shit, like i’m sticking steaks in they gut
so gracefully and graciously, i painfully wake niggas up
ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
like apes in the cut, i’m waiting for the taking
while i break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
it’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
and drinking ‘til i’m blasted
harassing and erase a nigga (what!?)
keeping 'em open and blacking until i’m leaving ‘em stuck
and got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
while i’m chasing a buck
these funny niggas be chasing they luck
i be lacing them up, like boots
when i’m pushing they face in the mud— (ahh!)
missiles i fling, while i spit live wire
‘til this shit circling back around
with more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
while i light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
and gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
painful and make ‘em scatter (blink!)
shameful, the way i shatter (split!)
shit apart, it doesn't matter (rip!)
your head up off your shoulders (with)
bullets bigger than a boulder
and they break ‘em and they know it's (classic!)
and the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
see, me and shady together; we’re crazy
like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(we that sick!) like i come from haiti
i’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(al-la-la!) like i’m a crazy israeli (bastards!)
while i bite the beat up, and i'm starting to heat up (yack!)
i’m chopping your foot off
now it’s mine, and i’m putting my feet up (black!)
back to the hood and off to the wild
and i’m hoping you protect your child
and i been blacking out so long
niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
but the beat is fried!

yo
(ready on the right) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the left) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on-)
("yo, chill, man—chill!")
(ready on the right) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the left) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the right) ayo, calm down, nigga
(ready on the left) fuck it, blackout, niggas!

apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
it just might make you sick, so irate
with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
is my mind scrambled? 'cause i'm lit—narrow minded
but go through such a wide range of this emotion
that my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
i just pulled up in clive davis's driveway
with his personal memoir, saying "he's bi!"
waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
making him cry, "rape!"—then arrive naked
and drive straight through the gay pride parade
"yay! yippee-ki-yay!", 'cause here i—
wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
and should i take it as a sign
maybe to take 'em back into time? (shady!)
i stuck out like a sore thumb, so i gave 'em the finger
to take the attention away
from my stinking face it was bringing
changed the whole complexion of the game
but just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
the kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
so if this is any indication of what you may be facing
you better make a distinction 'cause you fake imitations
are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
that's the worst impersonation i've ever seen, and
who raps nasally? eyes hazely?
rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
need some flonase when he's speaking?
what kind of stupid question is that?
"hey, mrs. abraham lincoln!
other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
how'd you think that play was this weekend?"
you ain't the real slim shady, sit your ass down, faggot (ew)
see me on a ballot, i'm running for class clown
rich democrat, bitch, so i'm just the candidate
to come fuck up the whole party
me and flipmode starting a campaign
to have every campus, on a fucking rampage
act my goddamn age? i am—eight!
so let's get smashed and wake up the next day
with the room trashed, covered in band-aids
glass ashtray smashed
champagne splashed on the lampshades
but this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
shady for president, ho, don't make me go take it back
to the days of old, with sway & tech radio
when i was taking so much nodoz and lsd
i almost fell asleep on the wake up show
fuck you telling me, fools?
i was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in drew's
when penelope cruz was still developing boobs
me and bus put it down, like a sick pet
you're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
"i sit in front of my computer all day
and comment on everything, i'm an expert on everything, everything sucks—play the next song!"
guess if i hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
with biggie and kicked the living shit out you, i'd be dead wrong
son of god; i'm the s.o.g
like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'cause i'm so full of self-esteem that i sweat fog
yes, yes, y’all (wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
step off, 'fore you get stepped on
soft? 'bout as commercial as my fucking learjet
jealousy’ll get you green as a chia pet
i can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
alert, alert, girl—alert
once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
so ("jump around! jump! jump!")
get that ass shaking ("jump around! jump!")
came to hit you with a fan favorite
but if you too fly for coach, better get them arms
and freaking hands flailing and ("jump!")
like van halen and pray for a damn tailwind
more afraid of success than i am of failure
so what does that tell ya?
that on a grand scale i don’t give a fuck about nothing
like stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
before he ran straight into the damn railing

"yo, chill, man—chill!"

woo! welcome to the bank
where you deposit young money
and, and you get cash money
i'm tunechi the boss
and live from the vault, is busta buss

yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
beautiful bitches with us happily toast
keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
got them od-ing, leaning in each coast
scenery froze, take notes, rock rolls, diamonds that fit us
chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
we coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
king kongs, godzillas when we roll up
seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

uhh, shit
please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
if you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
thank your lucky stars it's the rap czar, tuck your shit in
my niggas bite like rin tin tin, my chagrin
you never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
she gives in every time that i spin
square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
we wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

native new yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
call the reporter, stepping like british walkers
legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
get them into it steadily, god i'm stupid, so undisputed
act fool, back tool until they pop off
police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
got these niggas wilding while i signal my soldiers
bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
see how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
and tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
and count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

i want to thank you, heavenly father
yeah, it feel good, don't it? uhh
for shining your light on me
it feel good, don't it? uhh
i want to thank you, heavenly father
ay, i want to let y'all know
ay, ay, i want to let y'all know, this yeezy
for shining your light on me
and you listening to q-tip

settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
good times, only difference, niggas making it though
chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
on top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
you dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
you're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

see how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
beat him in the head again, "stop killing me, wolf"
whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
ock see him, he puss, he don't want no problem with niggas
fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
dammit we sinners, when me and abstract together, see we deliver
she got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
kill everything until it's time for me to go
that's when i bomb it with a blow and then i black and get a little bit dummy
the microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, itune it, youtube it
it could never ever be refuted
it's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
kicking it in pele adidas, drink alizé liters
all of you must reconcile a leader
she's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
but never a scandal because me and bus, we're prone to handle
we're gentlemen

not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
before i black as he get off my premises
better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
you need a suit for your funeral measurements
see me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
giving your shit to convince a better preference
watch me turn them to skeletons, see how i come and bring out the betterness?
time is with it, i rep the foreverness
flying united emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
now you need you a better ref
you could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

i want to thank you, heavenly father

ayo, dre, i think they in trouble
whoo!
scott storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?!
feels like a new day!

listen, now every time i come
and i hit you niggas with shit regardless
you get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
on how the fuck i do what i do and say what i say
and spit what i spit you ain't never even gotta question who
‘cause you know that i'm the only nigga that can ever come
and spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
then i come and i spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
and m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what i want 'em to
from my point of view, instead of trying to step up
you still trying to play catch up
and keep up with the way a nigga grew
these niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
and let they emotions out
and i doubt they can ever test my crew
take a second, check it, i reckon my records are better than
whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through (whoo!)
you fuckin idiot, i don't think you get it
i'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true

now if you ain't blind
and you ain't handicapped in your vision
i think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
no matter how much you try
no matter how much you make an effort
you niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘cause i'll hurt you, and i will learn you a thing or two
and i'll hurt you, and i'll finish your career for you, i'll…

shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move you, you were covered in my poo-poo
smothered in my manure while i spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
you don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
so just sit back and watch somethin'
you just gon' have an a-chew
you just made me sneeze, i'm allergic to beats like these
please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, scott
you're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
and everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
under everything up on the block
‘cause busta bus and flipmode just tip toed into the club
then with shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with doc
but since we all been spotted
we might as well have a party
so gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
and you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club

now if you ain't blind
and you ain't handicapped in your vision
i think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
no matter how much you try
no matter how much you make an effort
you niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘cause i'll hurt you, and i will learn you a thing or two
and i'll hurt you, and i'll finish your career for you, i'll…

catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
you bunch of bumblin' fools
who got me rumblin' dudes all the way down the block
keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
and you runnin' out of time, see, i'm tired of all y'all
m-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga i got it locked
every single time you put my shit in your cd player
and turn up the volume
you bang your head, because your shit is not
i continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
you struggle while i humble a nigga with the glock
then i watch you while i'll keep on fumblin'
while i got you tr-tr-tremblin'
before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
before i start to do another thing
then to make you crown me the king
with such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
while i'm climbing and fuck her
then tell you bitch to get off my yacht

now if you ain't blind
and you ain't handicapped in your vision
i think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
no matter how much you try
no matter how much you make an effort
you niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘cause i'll hurt you, and i will learn you a thing or two
and i'll hurt you, and i'll finish your career for you, i'll…

just look over your shoulders, honey
yeah, i know, it's been a minute
don't you know?
just look over your shoulders, honey
whenever you need me
just look— just over your shoulders
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders, honey

i wrote my first bars in the car with stacy
how bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
big marbles, nigga
i lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
and it's all for the literature
and it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
i ain't afraid to say i need you, ah, yeah (hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
i promise i'd never leave you, ah, yeah
my life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes i write
for sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
the poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
my share of deeds and r.i.p.s
you know my type of style is like my everything
apparently, my appetite stay famished
bite no hand that feed
the culture vulture die and bleed
my focus hold these thoughts and dreams
control this pen (look over your shoulder)
boldest lines of rhymes and things
devote my time and mind it seems
i'm 'posed to shine, remind i'm king
provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
the pros, the cons, the diamond rings
i'm full with time but i'ma bring
the soul divine and cross between
what's yours and mines, the gold, the green
the ropes that show just what it mean
then grab shakur right by the wing
and fly before my vocals (scream)
for hip-hop, look at my ziploc
bag full of goodies, you chris rock
hit the pookie and pit stops
since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
i know ya (woo)

don't you know, baby?
don't you know, baby?
just look over your shoulders, honey
whenever you need me
just look— just over your shoulders
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders, honey
yeah, yeah, you need me (woo)

shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'cause i done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of black history
and yes, i see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
them bars and i spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
you trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
and you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (woo)
i am the buddha, the ali baba, the believer-er maker
so pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when i shake 'em
so rude, i'm so ice cold but i'm what you need to just wake 'em
all them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
when i arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
and when i leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'cause i'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
i spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
and beating you niggas, completely conquer
extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
and deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
bikini your broad up (you guinea pig)
see me, now give me the startup and treat me
you greet me and meet me with arms up
so sweet when i speak, have a seat, it was deep
i was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
do i have your entendimiento?
while i clap these raps like thunders
look over your shoulder, boy, and wonder (woo)

don't you know, baby? (ooh, woah)
don't you know, baby? (mhm, oh, yeah)
just look over your shoulders, honey
whenever you need me (when you need me)
just look— just over your shoulders
whenever you need me (whenever you need me)
just look over your shoulders, honey
yeah, you need me (woo)
don't you know, baby?
don't you know, baby?
just look over your shoulders, honey
whenever you need me

hello rap game, nǐ hǎo, how you durrn'?
i done took my time, now it's time to take my turn
my curses been in verses since my firstest brain cells burnt
but i done been deferred to assistants and interns
and i done been on hold for some years, it's getting old
i'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul
or not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode
or expand across the globe, but look like i just skipped the cold
hello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear
we was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here
how we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them
cleaning in that thing and my sprite don't got a stain on it
lil xan fuck the chance up, donnie trumpet said bands up
donnie mcclurkin said stand up
i know contracts are like handcuffs
i know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns
i know answers, i know man to man, can't stand us
i know exactly how you wanna brand us
i take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus
fast like twista mixed with bust
when windy lost boys i had pixie dust for a pick me up
spit shine 'til it's crystal clean like listerine from a dixie cup
mama jann band-aid kiss the cut
now i'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities
and runneth over pools and infinities
award shows and house wives and games shows and hennessy
it's different from the energy i see being in your vicinity
mistaken identity, you behaving differently
(ayo chance, don't stop now nigga)
you the protest you the marches
you on the forefront you the farthest
you the melanin in the darkness
wrong number what a shame
you and i look just the same
that's why i got you in my name
lets push it to the masses give them wavy, give them surf
one time shout-out to bust, i know this a long ass verse
but i'm just getting started i'm taking this rap shit global
put my music in the museum, put my bars in barnes and noble
shape the office like an oval, make the triangle a circle
teach the little boys and girls, tell them i was your referral
i'm chicago like a gyro, i'm chicago like some harolds
i will borrow from the boroughs , show tomorrow to the world
place the urban and the rural, make the wall into a mural
lead it where it need to be, they jocking like a nitti beat
now they cannot get rid of me, bye, bye to the industry
lionel richie is it me? hello?

(chance the rapper sing it to 'em)
is it me you're looking for?
gonna find you
and make you want me

bust rhymes it come with the force and lay it across
hit you like i'm playing lacrosse
and if it was july i'd drop it on the day of the fourth
the fire make you bust a shot
pull a string and get lost
stinging guitars (hello)
i'm here with the floss
a chain with a frost
while the yellow diamonds shine with a gloss, i'm cold (ah)
shit heavy like we weighing a horse
violate, one shot will turn your brain into sauce
just pray i remorse
nigga you know we whip from the start
you slept on the art
bugging on how we put out your spark
we separate the heat from corny shit and kept it apart
step on a dart, spit will test the rest of your heart
no rest in the dark (hello)
we the best of the sharks, we love and we fart
and leave a mark so put it in park
whenever we bark, we make you come and get with this nigga
get next to this nigga, we past professional
you can call me a specialist nigga
we fuck shit up while you call me the best at this nigga
the way we put it down you'll be calling a censorship nigga
we holding a higher rank and we holding it back
and i'm grimey niggas home when they shank
or they clickity clank (hello)
now just clap from front to back and just react (what?)
like you know you posted till you die it is the feeling (what?)
keep on clapping get to acting up now keep on packing (what?)
all inside (is high) now feel the fire in the building
you can never test the way i do it
and the way i be moving and bouncing and
shaking and shouting and breaking a mountain
and making the noise that i be making everytime
that you be hating, sorry for keeping you waiting
(real talk) shit
and i see a lot of y'all couldn't cope while
i hit you with another banger after the fact

together we made it
we made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

see, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
better know that i leaped every hurdle and i'm so victorious
take a look, i'm a symbol of greatness
now call a nigga morpheus
as force securin' the win, better believe i'm so notorious
you know that i've been 'bout my bread
even though we rappin' now (yes)
and yes, we used to live on the strip
even though a nigga higher level trappin' now (uh!)
superseded every one of my little struggles and (huh!)
failure has never ever been an option (trust)
a nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
and i'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

oh, together we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)
we made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(c'mon!) forever we waited (ha ha!)
and they told us we were never gonna get it
but we took it on the road (to the riches)
on the road (to the ghetto)
on the road (in the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road (ride with me!)
on the road (we come to get it)
on the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
when it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
it seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
at best we were stressed
at the worst they probably said we're pathetic
had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
i was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
never restin' the question if i was out of my mind
it finally came time to do it or let it die
so we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
sing it, yeah!

oh, together we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)
we made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(c'mon!) forever we waited (ha ha!)
and they told us we were never gonna get it
but we took it on the road (to the riches)
on the road (to the ghetto)
on the road (in the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road (ride with me!)
on the road (we come to get it)
on the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

look, in case you misunderstand exactly what i'm buildin'
shit that i can leave for my children's children's children's children
now on my wake-up i smile to see how far i've come
fightin' for sales on a strip to i gained the hustle from
from nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
to countin' money like dre and jimmy and russell was
but now i live when i dream, you see we finally did it
let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
sing it!

oh, together we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)
we made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(c'mon!) forever we waited (ha ha!)
and they told us we were never gonna get it
but we took it on the road (to the riches)
on the road (to the ghetto)
on the road (in the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road (ride with me!)
on the road (we come to get it)
on the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)
oh...
