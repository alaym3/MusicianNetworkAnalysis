we chase misprinted lies
we face the path of time
and yet i fight, and yet i fight this battle all alone
no one to cry to, no place to call home

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

my gift of self is raped
my privacy is raked
and yet i find, and yet i find repeating in my head
if i can't be my own, i'd feel better dead

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

know me, broken by my master
teach thee on child, of love hereafter

into the flood again
same old trip it was back then
so i made a big mistake
try to see it once my way

drifting body, its sole desertion
flying, not yet quite the notion

into the flood again
same old trip it was back then
so i made a big mistake
try to see it once my way


into the flood again
same old trip it was back then
so i made a big mistake
try to see it once my way

am i wrong?
have i run too far to get home?
have i gone?
left you here alone
am i wrong?
have i run too far to get home? yeah
have i gone?
left you here alone
if i would, could you?

ain't found a way to kill me yet
eyes burn with stinging sweat
seems every path leads me to nowhere
wife and kids, household pet
army green was no safe bet
the bullets scream to me from somewhere

here they come to snuff the rooster
here come the rooster
you know he ain't gonna die
no, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die


here they come to snuff the rooster
here come the rooster
you know he ain't gonna die
no, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

walking tall machine gun man
they spit on me in my home land
gloria sent me pictures of my boy
got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
my buddy's breathing his dying breath
oh god, please, won't you help me make it through?

here they come to snuff the rooster
here come the rooster, yeah
you know he ain't gonna die
no, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

i'm the man in the box
buried in my shit

won't you come and save me?

feed my eyes
(can you sew them shut?)
jesus christ
(deny your maker)
he who tries
(will be wasted)
feed my eyes
(now you've sewn them) shut

i'm the dog who gets beat
shove my nose in shit

won't you come and save me?

bury me softly in this womb
i give this part of me for you
sand rains down and here i sit
holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom

down in a hole and i don't know if i can be saved
see my heart, i decorate it like a grave
you don't understand who they thought i was supposed to be
look at me now, a man who won't let himself be

down in a hole, feelin' so small
down in a hole, losin' my soul
i'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied

down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
i've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
i have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
i will speak no more of my feelings beneath

down in a hole, feeling so small
down in a hole, losin' my soul
i'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied

bury me softly in this womb
oh, i want to be inside of you
i give this part of me for you
oh, i want to be inside of you
sand rains down and here i sit
oh, i want to be inside of you
holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom
oh, i want to be inside

down in a hole, feeling so small
down in a hole, losin' my soul
down in a hole, feeling so small
down in a hole, out of control
i'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied

it's alright, there comes a time
got no patience to search for peace of mind
layin' low, wanna take it slow
no more hidin' or disguisin' truths i've sold

every day it's somethin'
hits me all so cold
you find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know

it's okay, had a bad day
hands are bruised from breakin' rocks all day
drained and blue, i bleed for you
you think it's funny, well, you're drownin' in it, too

every day it's somethin'
hits me all so cold
you find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know


yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
leave our rain and cold, trade for warm sunshine
you, my friend, i will defend
and if we change, well, i'll love you anyway

every day it's somethin'
hits me all so cold
you find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know

ah! ah! ah! ah!

i believe them bones are me
some say we're born into the grave

i feel so alone
gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones

ah! ah! ah!

dust rise right on over my time
empty fossil of the new scene

i feel so alone
gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones


toll due, bad dream come true
i lie dead gone under red sky

i feel so alone
gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
i feel so alone
gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
i feel so alone
gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones

sitting on an angry chair
angry walls that steal the air
stomach hurts and i don't care
what do i see across the way, hey
see myself molded in clay, oh
stares at me, yeah, i'm afraid, hey
changing the shape of his face, aw yeah

candles red, i have a pair
shadows dancing everywhere
burning on the angry chair
little boy made a mistake, hey
pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh
all that i want is to play, hey
get on your knees, time to pray, oh

i don't mind, yeah, i don't mind, i-i-i
i don't mind, yeah, i don't mind, i-i-i
lost my mind, yeah, but i don't mind, i-i-i
can't find it anywhere, i don't mind, i-i-i

corporate prison, we stay, hey
i'm a dull boy, work all day, oh
so i'm strung out anyway, hey


loneliness is not a phase
field of pain is where i graze
serenity is far away
saw my reflection and cried, hey
so little hope that i died, oh
feed me your lies, open wide, hey
weight of my heart, not the size, oh

i don't mind, yeah, i don't mind, i-i-i
i don't mind, yeah, i don't mind, i-i-i
lost my mind, yeah, but i don't mind, i-i-i
can't find it anywhere, i don't mind, i-i-i

pink cloud has now turned to gray
all that i want is to play
get on your knees, time to pray, boy

ooh, oh yeah
ooh, oh yeah
ooh, oh yeah

you insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake and "i'm high"
look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size
carton size, carton size, carton size

call me up, congratulations ain't the real why
there's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day nine
endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
"by the way", "by the way", "by the way", "by the way"

once again, you see an in
discolored skin gives you away
so afraid, you kindly gurgle
out a date for me

now the body of one soul i adore wants to die
you have always told me you'd not live past twenty-five
i say stay long enough to repay all who caused strife

once again, you see an in
discolored skin gives you away
so afraid, you kindly gurgle
out a date for me
once again, you see an in
discolored skin gives you away
so afraid, you kindly gurgle
out a date for me

i bear true and an existing witness
to this barrel of monkeys
a self-proclaimed immoral success
perfected by each whereof
individually deadly, and equally so
and spread about the surrendered troops
for even thousands of miles
will not tear apart their communication
or the lack thereof
vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence
in no suggestion or rhyme
your weapon is contained
in the wrecking of the keeping the desired effect
the breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being
your weapon is guilt
your weapon is guilt
your weapon is guilt
guilt

i have never felt such frustration
or lack of self-control
i want you to kill me and dig me under
i wanna live no more

one who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
i've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
for me

i want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
in my mouth, on my tongue
i want you to scrape me from the walls
and go crazy like you've made me

one who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
i've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
one who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
i've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
for me


you, you are so special
you have the talent to make me feel like dirt
and you, you use your talent to dig me under
and cover me with dirt

one who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
i've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
one who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
i've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me

hey-ah-na-na, innocence is over
hey-ah-na-na, o-o-ve-er
hey-ah-na-na, ignorance is spoken

yeah, hey, i want to travel south this year

why you act crazy

so close, a lady
shifty eyes, shady

yeah, hey, yeah, tears that soak a callous heart

why you act frightened
i am enlightened
your weakness builds me
so someday you'll see

i stay away

why you act crazy
not an act, maybe
so close, a lady
shifty eyes, shady

i stay away
i stay away
i stay away
i stay away

"junk, fuck"
yeah, yeah

a good night, the best in a long time
a new friend turned me on to an old favorite
nothing better than a dealer who's high
be high, convince them to buy, yeah

what's my drug of choice?
well, what have you got?
i don't go broke
and i do it a lot

seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
running their boring drills
but we are an elite race of our own
the stoners, junkies, and freaks
are you happy? i am, man
content and fully aware, yeah
money, status, nothing to me
'cause your life's empty and bare, yeah

what's my drug of choice?
well, what have you got?
i don't go broke
and i do it a lot
i do it a lot, yeah


yeah
yeah
yeah

you can't understand a user's mind
but try, with your books and degrees
if you let yourself go and open your mind
i'll bet you'd be doing like me
and it ain't so bad

what's my drug of choice?
well, what have you got?
see, i don't go broke
(and i do it a lot) say i do it a lot

i do it a lot
i do it a lot
said i do it a lot

be what you wanna be
see what you came to see
been what you wanna be
i don't like what i see

like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter will
heaven beside you, hell within
and you think you have it still
heaven inside you

so there's problems in your life
that's fucked up, and i'm not blind
i'm just see-through, faded
super jaded, and out of my mind

do what you wanna do
go out and seek your truth
when i'm down and blue
rather be me than you

like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter will
heaven beside you, hell within
and you wish you had it still
heaven inside you

so there's problems in your life
that's fucked up, and i'm not blind
i'm just see-through, faded
super jaded, and out of my mind

like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter chill
heaven beside you, hell within
like the coldest winter will
heaven beside you, hell within
and you know you have it still
heaven inside you

so there's problems in your life
that's fucked up, but you're not blind
you're just see-through, faded
overrated, and out of your mind

i tried to love you, i thought i could
i tried to own you, i thought i would
i wanna peel the skin from your face
before the real you lays to waste

you told me i'm the only one
sweet little angel, you should have run
lying, crying, dying to leave
innocence creates my hell

cheated myself, still, you know more
it would be so easy with a whore
try to understand me, little girl
my twisted passion to be your world

lost inside my sick head
i live for you but i'm not alive
take my hands before i kill
i still love you, but i still burn

yeah, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love
ooh, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love

is she ready to know my frustration?
what she slipping inside, slow castration
i'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
did she come here to try, try to take me?

did she call my name?
i think it's gonna rain
oh, when i die

was it something i said, held against me?
ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
i can help her but won't, now she hates me

did she call my name?
i think it's gonna rain
oh, when i die

she won't let me hide
she don't want me to cry

will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me?
slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
could she love me again, or will she hate me?
probably not, i know why, can't explain me

did she call my name?
i think it's gonna rain
oh, when i die

hey, i ain't never coming home
hey, i'll just wander my own road
hey, hey, i can't meet you here tomorrow, no
say goodbye, don't follow
misery so hollow

hey you, you're livin' life full throttle
hey you, pass me down that bottle, yeah
hey, hey you, you can't shake me 'round now
i get so lost and don't know how, yeah
and it hurts to care, i'm going down

ooh, forgot my woman, lost my friends
things i'd done and where i've been
sleep in sweat, the mirror's cold
see my face, it's growin' old
scared to death, no reason why
do whatever to get me by
think about the things i said
read the page, it's cold and dead
and take me home
yeah, take me home, oh oh
take me home
take me home, yeah
take me home

say goodbye, don't follow

what does friend mean to you?
a word so wrongfully abused
are you like me, confused?
all included but you
alone

the sounds of silence often soothe
shapes and colors shift with mood
pupils widen, change their hue
rapid brown avoid clear blue

why's it have to be this way?
be this way, be this way
be this way, be this way
be this way

flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
a child sings an unclaimed tune
innocence spins cold cocoon
grow to see the pain too soon

why's it have to be this way?
be this way, be this way
be this way, be this way
be this way

at 7 am
on a tuesday in august
next week i'll be 28
i'm still young, it'll be me
off the wall, i scraped you
i gotta wake
i gotta wake, it comes this way
i can't wait no more
it comes this way (it comes this way)
to drown this ache
to reinstate (everyone dead, everyone)
(you put me through) take your place (put me through hell)
heaven direct your shape (heaven direct)
you see i can do it so well
your expiration date
your expiration date
fate, date
expiration date
this one is gonna last too, hate
never gonna fuck with me again
my own clean slate
don't fuck with me again
makes your eyes dilate
makes you shake
irate

my cup runneth over
like blood from a stone

these stand for me
name your god and bleed the freak
i'd like to see
how you all would bleed for me

when the pig runs slower
let the arrow fly
when the sin lies bolder
i'll pluck out thine eye

these stand for me
name your god and bleed the freak
i'd like to see
how you all would bleed for me

if you scorn my lover
satan got your thigh
if you steal in hunger
i will kick you when you try

these stand for me
name your god and bleed the freak
i'd like to see
how you all would bleed for me


all these things that you've done for me
have left me so fucking tired
i'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good
but if there's one thing you can do
you can bleed for me, bleed for me

these stand for me
name your god and bleed the freak
i'd like to see
how you all would bleed for me
these stand for me
name your god and bleed the freak
i'd like to see
how you all would bleed for me

frozen in the place i hide
not afraid to paint my sky with
some who say i've lost my mind
brother, try and hope to find

you were always so far away
i know that pain, so don't you run away
like you used to do

roses in a vase of white
bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
that fall because my hand is
pulling them hard as i can

you were always so far away
i know that pain, i won't run away
like i used to do


pictures in a box at home
yellowing and green with mold
so i can barely see your face
wonder how that color taste

you were always so far away
i know the way, so don't you run away
like you used to do
like you used to do
like you used to do
like you used to do
