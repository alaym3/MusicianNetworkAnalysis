pretty woman walking down the street
pretty woman, the kind i'd like to meet
pretty woman, i don't believe you, you're not the truth
no one could look as good as you
mercy!

pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
pretty woman, i couldn't help but see
pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
are you lonely just like me?

pretty woman, stop a while
pretty woman, talk a while
pretty woman, give your smile to me
pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
pretty woman, look my way
pretty woman, say you'll stay with me
'cause i need you, i'll treat you right
come with me, baby, be mine tonight

pretty woman, don't walk on by
pretty woman, don't make me cry
pretty woman, don't walk away, hey
okay, if that's the way it must be, okay

i guess i'll go on home, it's late
there'll be tomorrow night
but wait! what do i see?
is she walking back to me?
yeah, she's walking back to me
oh woah, pretty woman 

a candy-colored clown they call the sandman
tiptoes to my room every night
just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
"go to sleep, everything is alright"

i close my eyes, then i drift away
into the magic night, i softly say
a silent prayer like dreamers do
then i fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you

in dreams, i walk with you
in dreams, i talk to you
in dreams, you're mine all of the time
we're together in dreams, in dreams

but just before the dawn
i awake and find you gone
i can't help it, i can't help it if i cry
i remember that you said goodbye

it's too bad that all these things
can only happen in my dreams
only in dreams
in beautiful dreams 

every time i look into your loving eyes
i see a love that money just can't buy
one look from you, i drift away
i pray that you are here to stay

anything you want, you got it
anything you need, you got it
anything at all, you got it
baby

every time i hold you, i begin to understand
everything about you tells me i'm your man
i live my life to be with you
no one can do the things you do

anything you want, you got it
anything you need, you got it
anything at all, you got it
baby
anything you want
anything you need
anything at all
i'm glad to give my love to you
i know you feel the way i do

anything you want, you got it
anything you need, you got it
anything at all, you got it
baby
anything you want, you got it
anything you need, you got it
anything at all, you got it
baby

anything at all
baby
you got it 

i was alright for a while
i could smile for a while
but i saw you last night
you held my hand so tight
as you stopped to say, "hello"

oh, you wished me well
you couldn't tell
that i'd been crying over you
crying over you
when you said, "so long"
left me standing all alone
alone and crying, crying
crying, crying

it's hard to understand
but the touch of your hand
can start me crying

i thought that i was over you
but it's true, so true
i love you even more
than i did before
but, darling, what can i do?
for you don't love me
and i'll always be
crying over you
crying over you
yes, now you're gone
and from this moment on
i'll be crying, crying
crying, crying

yeah, i'm crying, crying
over you 

i feel so bad i've got a worried mind
i'm so lonesome all the time
since i left my baby behind on blue bayou
saving nickels, saving dimes
working 'till the sun don't shine
looking forward to happier times
on blue bayou
i'm going back some day
come what may to blue bayou
where you sleep all day
and the catfish play on blue bayou
all those fishing boats
with their sails afloat
if i could only see
that familiar sunrise
through sleepy eyes
how happy i'd be
go to see my baby again
and to be with some of my friends
maybe i'd be happy then on blue bayou
i'm going back some day
gonna stay on blue bayou
where the folks are fine
and the world is mine
on blue bayou
oh, that girl of mine by my side
the silver moon and the evening tide
oh, some sweet day gonna take away
this hurtin' inside
i'll never be blue
my dreams come true on blue bayou 

dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
only the lonely
only the lonely

only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
know the way i feel tonight (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
know this feeling ain't right (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)

and there goes my baby
there goes my heart
they're gone forever
so far apart

but only the lonely
know why
i cry
only the lonely

dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
only the lonely
only the lonely
only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
know the heartaches i've been through (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
know i cry and cry for you (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)

and maybe tomorrow
a new romance
no more sorrow
but that's the chance

you gotta take
if your lonely heart breaks
only the lonely
(dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah) 

i had to escape
the city was sticky and cruel
maybe i should have called you first
but i was dying to get to you
i was dreaming while i drove the long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah
could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you was just burning me up inside

i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room
woke you from your sleep to make love to you
is that all right?
i drove all night
what in this world
keeps us from falling apart?
no matter where i go i hear
the beating of our one heart
i think about you when the night is cold and dark
uh-huh, yeah
no one can move me the way that you do
nothing erases this feeling between me and yoooooou
ohhhhhhh
i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room
woke you from your sleep to make love to you
is that all right?
i drove all niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you was just burning me up
insiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
i drove all night to get to you (all night)
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room (all right)
is that all right?
i drove all niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
i drove all night to get to you (all night)
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room (all right) 

workin' all day
and the sun don't shine
trying to get by
and i'm just killing time

i feel the rain
fall the whole night through
far away from you
california blue

california blue
dreaming all alone
nothing else to do
california blue

everyday i pray
i'll be on my way
saving love for you
california blue

one sunny day
i'll get back again
somehow, someway
but i don't know when
california blue
california blue
living my life
with you on my mind
thinking of things
that i left far behind

it's been so long
doing all i can do
to get back to you
california blue

california blue (california blue)
dreaming all alone (california blue)
nothing else to do (california blue)
california blue

everyday i pray
i'll be on my way
saving love for you
california blue

one sunny day
i'll get back again
somehow, someway
but i don't know when
california blue
california blue
still missing you
california blue
still missing you
california blue
still missing you
california blue 

just runnin' scared each place we go
so afraid that he might show
yeah, runnin' scared, what would i do?
if he came back and wanted you
just runnin' scared, feelin' low
runnin' scared, you love him so
just runnin' scared, afraid to lose
if he came back which one would you choose
then all at once he was standing there
so sure of himself, his head in the air
my heart was breaking, which one would it be
you turned around and walked away with me 

darkness falls and she
will take me by the hand
take me to some twilight land
where all but love is grey
where i can’t find my way
without her as my guide

night falls, i’m cast beneath her spell
daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
am i left to burn
and burn eternally?
she’s a mystery to me

she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl

in the night of love
words tangled in her hair
words soon to disappear
a love so sharp it cut
like a switchblade to my heart
words tearing me apart
she tears again my bleeding heart
i wanna run, she’s pulling me apart
fallen angel cries
and i just melt away
she’s a mystery to me

she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl

haunted by her side
it’s the darkness in her eyes
that so enslaves me
but if my love is blind
then i don’t want to see
she’s a mystery to me

night falls, i’m cast beneath her spell
daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
am i left to burn
and burn eternally?
she’s a mystery to me
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl

she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl

she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl
she’s a mystery girl 

your baby doesn't love you anymore
golden days before they end
whisper secrets to the wind
your baby won't be near you any more
tender nights before they fly
send falling stars that seem to cry
your baby doesn't want you anymore
it's over
it breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
but oh what will you do? then she said to you
there's someone new we're through we're through
it's over it's over it's over
all the rainbows in the sky
start to weep, then say goodbye
you won't be seeing rainbows any more
setting suns before they fall, echo to you that's all that's all
but you'll see lonely sunset after all
it's over it's over it's over it's over 

listen all you people
try and understand
you may be a soldier
woman, child or man

but there won't be many coming home
no, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many
maybe ten out of twenty
but there won't be many coming home

now the old folks will remember
on that dark and dismal day
how their hearts were choked with pride
as their children marched away
now the glory is all gone
they are left alone

and there won't be many coming home
no, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many
maybe five out of twenty
but there won't be many coming home
look real closely at the soldier
coming at you through the haze
he may be the younger brother who ran away
and before you kill another
listen to what i say

oh, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many
there may not be any
but there won't be many coming home

if they all came back but one
he was still some mother's son
and there won't be many coming home

oh, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many coming home
oh, there won't be many coming home... 

where the nile flows
and the moon glows
on the silent sand
of an ancient land
when a dream dies
and a heart cries
shahdaroba
is the word they whisper alone
shahdaroba, shahdaroba
means the future is much better than the past
shahdaroba, shahdaroba
in the future you will find a love that lasts
so when tears flow
and you don't know
what on earth to do
and your world is blue
when your dream dies
and your heart cries
shahdaroba
fate knows what's best for you
shahdaroba, shahdaroba
face the future and forget about the past
shahdaroba, shahdaroba
in the future you will find a love that lasts
shahdaroba 

dream, when you're feeling blue
dream, that's the thing to do
just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
you'll find your share of memories there
so dream, when the day is through
dream, and they might come true
things never are as bad as they seem
so dream, dream, dream
dream, when the day is through
dream, and they might come true
things never are as bad as they seem
so dream, dream, dream 

i sat there alone upon the ferris wheel
a pastel colored carriage in the air
i thought you'd leave me dangling for a little while
a silly twist upon a childish dare
below i saw you whispering to another man
who held the lever that could bring me down
he'd stop the world from turning at your command
it's always something cruel that laughter drowns
and i'm up while the dawn is breaking
even though my heart is aching
i should be drinking a toast
to absent friends
instead of these comedians
i can hardly hear the music from the carousel
the wind picks up, the carriage starts sway
as one by one the lights go out
it's closing time
i see you take his hand and walk away walk away
they say that you will always be the last to know
they say that all that glitters is not gold
it's not just that you're never coming back to me
it's the bitter way that i was told
and i'm up while the dawn is breaking
even though my heart is aching
i should be drinking a toast
to absent friends
instead of these comedians 

in dreams we do so many things
we set aside the rules we know
and fly the world so high
in great and shining rings
if only we could always live in dreams
if only we could make of life
what, in dreams, it seems
but in the real world
we must say real goodbyes
no matter if the love will live
it will never die
in the real world
there are things that we can't change
and endings come to us
in ways that we can't rearrange
i love you, and you love me
but sometimes we must let it be
in the real world
in the real world
when we were dreaming heart to heart
i wish that we had stayed right there
for when the dreamers do awake
the dreams do disappear
if only we could always live in dreams
if only we could make of life
what, in dreams, it seems
but in the real world
we must say real goodbyes
no matter if the love will live
it will never die
in the real world
there are things that we can't change
and endings come to us
in ways that we can't rearrange
i love you, and you love me
but sometimes we must let it be
in the real world
in the real world

hey, leah leah
hey, leah leah
here i go
from the hut to the boat to the sea for leah
uh huh! i gotta go diving in the bay
gotta get a lot of oysters
find some pearls today
to make a pretty necklace for leah
leah
i gotta go deep and find the ones just right
i'll bet my leah will be surprised tonight
i'll place the pearls around the only girl for me
leah
but something's wrong
i cannot move around
my leg is caught
it's pulling me down
but i'll keep my hands shut tight for if they find me
they'll find the pearl for leah
and now it's over
i'm awake at last
oh, heartaches and memories from the past
it was just another dream about my lost love
about leah
hey, leah leah
hey, leah leah
here i go
back to sleep and in my dreams
i'll be with leah
leah

the summer sun looked down
on our love long ago
but in my heart i feel
the same old afterglow
a love so beautiful
in every way
a love so beautiful
we let it slip away
we were too young to understand
to ever know
that lovers drift apart
and that's the way love goes
a love so beautiful
a love so sweet
a love so beautiful
a love for you and me
and i when i think of you
i fall in love again
a love so beautiful
in every way
a love so beautiful
we let it slip away
a love so beautiful
in every way
a love so beautiful
we let it slip away 

love hurts, love scars
love wounds and mars
any heart not tough
nor strong enough
to take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
love hurts
love hurts
i'm young, i know
but even so
i know a thing or two
i learned from you
i really learned a lot, really learned a lot
love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot
love hurts
love hurts
some fools rave of happiness
blissfulness, togetherness
some fools fool themselves, i guess
but they're not foolin' me
i know it isn't true, know it isn't true
love is just a lie made to make you blue
love hurts
love hurts
love hurts
...
