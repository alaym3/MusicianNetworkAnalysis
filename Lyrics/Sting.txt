he deals the cards as a meditation
and those he plays never suspect
he doesn't play for the money he wins
he doesn't play for respect

he deals the cards to find the answer
the sacred geometry of chance
the hidden law of a probable outcome
the numbers lead a dance

i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that's not the shape of my heart

he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades
he may conceal a king in his hand
while a memory of it fades

i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that's not the shape of my heart

that's not the shape, shape of my heart
​​

and if i told you that i loved you
you'd maybe think there's something wrong
i'm not a man of too many faces
the mask i wear is one

but those who speak know nothing
and find out to their cost
like those who curse their luck in too many places
and those who fear are lost

i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that's not the shape of my heart

that's not the shape of my heart
that's not the shape, the shape of my heart

i don't drink coffee, i'll take tea my dear
i like my toast done on one side
and you can hear it in my accent when i talk
i'm an englishman in new york

see me walking down fifth avenue
a walking cane here at my side
i take it everywhere i walk
i'm an englishman in new york

i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york

if "manners maketh man" as someone said
then he's the hero of the day
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
be yourself, no matter what they say

i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york

modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
you could end up as the only one
gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
at night a candle's brighter than the sun


takes more than combat gear to make a man
takes more than a license for a gun
confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
a gentleman will walk but never run

if "manners maketh man" as someone said
then he's the hero of the day
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
be yourself, no matter what they say
be yourself, no matter what they say
be yourself, no matter what they say
be yourself, no matter what they say
be yourself, no matter what they say

i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york

i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
(be yourself, no matter what they say)
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien, i'm a legal alien
(be yourself, no matter what they say)
i'm an englishman in new york

i dream of rain
i dream of gardens in the desert sand
i wake in vain
i dream of love as time runs through my hand
i dream of fire
those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
and in the flames
her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
this desert rose
each of her veils, a secret promise
this desert flower
no sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
and as she turns
this way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
this fire burns
i realize that nothing's as it seems
i dream of rain
i dream of gardens in the desert sand
i wake in vain
i dream of love as time runs through my hand
i dream of rain
i lift my gaze to empty skies above
i close my eyes
this rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

aman aman aman
omry feek antia
ma ghair antia
ma ghair antia

i dream of rain
i dream of gardens in the desert sand
i wake in vain
i dream of love as time runs through my hand
sweet desert rose
each of her veils, a secret promise
this desert flower
no sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
sweet desert rose
this memory of eden haunts us all
this desert flower
this rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

ya lili ah ya leel

you'll remember me when the west wind moves
upon the fields of barley
you'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
as we walk in fields of gold

so she took her love for to gaze awhile
upon the fields of barley
in his arms she fell as her hair came down
among the fields of gold

will you stay with me? will you be my love?
among the fields of barley
we'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
as we lie in fields of gold

see the west wind move like a lover so
upon the fields of barley
feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
among the fields of gold

i never made promises lightly
and there have been some that i've broken
but i swear in the days still left
we'll walk in fields of gold
we'll walk in fields of gold

many years have passed since those summer days
among the fields of barley
see the children run as the sun goes down
among the fields of gold

you'll remember me when the west wind moves
upon the fields of barley
you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold

if blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
drying in the color of the evening sun
tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
but something in our minds will always stay
perhaps this final act was meant
to clinch a lifetime's argument
that nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
for all those born beneath an angry star
lest we forget how fragile we are

on and on the rain will fall
like tears from a star like tears from a star
on and on the rain will say
how fragile we are how fragile we are
on and on the rain will fall
like tears from a star like tears from a star
on and on the rain will say
how fragile we are how fragile we are
how fragile we are how fragile we are

in europe and america
there’s a growing feeling of hysteria
conditioned to respond to all the threats
in the rhetorical speeches of the soviets
mr. khrushchev said we will bury you
i don’t subscribe to this point of view
it would be such an ignorant thing to do
if the russians love their children too

how can i save my little boy
from oppenheimer's most deadly toy?
there is no monopoly of common sense
on either side of the political fence

we share the same biology
regardless of ideology
believe me when i say to you
i hope the russians love their children too


there is no historical precedent
to put the words in the mouth of the president
there’s no such thing as a winnable war
it’s a lie we don’t believe anymore
mr. reagan says we will protect you
i don’t subscribe to this point of view
believe me when i say to you
i hope the russians love their children too

we share the same biology
regardless of ideology
what might save us me and you
is if the russians love their children too

if the night turned cold and the stars looked down
and you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
you wake the morning in a stranger's coat
no one would you see
you ask yourself, who's watched for me
my only friend, who could it be
it's hard to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me

when your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
and you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
you search the city for your only friend
no one would you see
you ask yourself, who's watched for me
a solitary voice to speak out and set me free
i had to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me

you're not the easiest person i ever got to know
and it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
some would say i should let you go your way
you'll only make me cry
if there's one guy, just one guy
who'd lay down his life for you and die
i hate to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me

when the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
there's only one voice that comes to your defense
and the jury's out and your eyes search the room
and one friendly face is all you need to see
if there's one guy, just one guy
who'd lay down his life for you and die
i hate to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me

i hate to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me
i hate to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me
i hate to say it
i hate to say it, but it's probably me

you could say i lost my faith in science and progress
you could say i lost my belief in the holy church
you would say i lost my sense of direction
yes, you could say all of this and worse but

if i ever lose my faith in you
there'd be nothing left for me to do

some would say i was a lost man in a lost world
you could say i lost my faith in the people on tv
you would say i lost my belief in our politicians
they all seem like game show hosts to me

if i ever lose my faith in you
there'd be nothing left for me to do

i could be lost inside their lies without a trace
but every time i close my eyes i see your face

i never saw no miracle of science
that didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
i never saw no military solution
that didn't always end up as something worse but
let me say this first

if i ever lose my faith in you
(if i ever lose my faith in you)
there'd be nothing left for me to do
(there'd be nothing left for me to do)
if i ever lose my faith
if i ever lose my faith
if i ever lose my faith
if i ever lose my faith
in you

i am a monster you created
you ripped out all my parts
and worst of all, for me to live, i gotta kill the part of me that saw
and i needed you more

i hope you know we had everything
when you broke me and left these pieces
i want you to hurt like you hurt me today and
i want you to lose like i lose when i play
what could have been
oh, what could have been

why don't you love who i am?
what we could have been

i am your ghost, a fallen angel
you ripped out all my parts
i couldn't care what invention you made me
'cause i, i was meant to be yours


i hope you know we had everything
when you broke me and left these pieces
i want you to hurt like you hurt me today and
i want you to lose like i lose when i play—

i want you to hurt like you hurt me today and
i want you to lose like i lose when i play
what could have been

"seven days" was all she wrote
a kind of ultimatum note
she gave to me, she gave to me
when i thought the field had cleared
it seems another suit appeared
to challenge me, woe is me
though i hate to make a choice
my options are decreasing mostly rapidly
well we'll see
i don't think she'd bluff this time
i really have to make her mine
it's plain to see
it's him or me

monday, i could wait till tuesday
if i make up my mind
wednesday would be fine
thursday's on my mind
friday'd give me time
saturday could wait
but sunday'd be too late

the fact he's over six feet ten
might instill fear in other men
but not in me
the mighty flea
ask if i am mouse or man
the mirror squeaked, away i ran
he'll murder me
in time for his tea
does it bother me at all
my rival is neanderthal
it makes me think
perhaps i need a drink
iq is no problem here
we won't be playing scrabble for
her hand i fear
i need that beer

monday, i could wait till tuesday
if i make up my mind
wednesday would be fine
thursday's on my mind
friday'd give me time
saturday could wait
but sunday'd be too late

seven days will quickly go
the fact remains, i love her so
seven days, so many ways
but i can't run away
i can't run away

monday, i could wait till tuesday
if i make up my mind
wednesday would be fine, thursday's on my mind
friday'd give me time, saturday could wait
but sunday'd be too late
(sunday'd be too late)
sunday'd be too late

do i have to tell a story
of a thousand rainy days since we first met
it's a big enough umbrella
but it's always me that ends up getting wet

how many of you people out there
been hurt in some kind of love affair
and how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
how many lonely, sleepless nights
how many lies, how many fights
and why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
"love is pain," i hear you say
love has a cruel and bitter way
of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
how could it be that what you need the most
can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
you never want to feel so sad and lost again
one day you could be looking
through an old book in rainy weather
you see a picture of her smiling at you
when you were still together
you could be walking down the street
and who should you chance to meet
but that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

you can turn the clock to zero, honey
i'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
we're starting up a brand new day
turn the clock all the way back
i wonder if she'll take me back
i'm thinking in a brand new way
turn the clock to zero, sister
you'll never know how much i missed her
starting up a brand new day
turn the clock to zero, boss
the river's wide, we'll swim across
started up a brand new day

it could happen to you - just like it happened to me
there's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
i say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
and sometimes no reflection is there
baby wait a minute, wait a minute
wait a minute, wait a minute
wait a minute, wait a minute
wait a minute, wait a minute

you can turn the clock to zero, honey
i’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
we’re starting up a brand new day
turn the clock to zero, mac
i begging her to take me back
i’m thinking in a brand new way
turn the clock to zero, boss
the river’s wide, we’ll swim across
started up a brand new day
turn the clock to zero, buddy
don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
started up a brand new day

i'm the rhythm in your tune
i'm the sun and you're the moon
i'm a bat and you're the cave
you're the beach and i'm the wave
i’m the plow and you’re the land
you're the glove and i'm the hand
i'm the train and you're the station
i'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

i’m the present to your future
you’re the wound and i’m the suture
you’re the magnet to my pole
i’m the devil in your soul
you’re the pupil, i’m the teacher
you’re the church and i’m the preacher
you’re the flower, i’m the rain
you’re the tunnel, i’m the train

stand up all you lovers in the world
stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
stand up all you lovers in the world
starting up a brand new day

you’re the crop to my rotation
you’re the sum of my equation
i’m the answer to your question
if you follow my suggestion
we can turn this ship around
we’ll go up instead of down
you’re the stair and i’m the handle
you’re the flame and i’m the candle
stand up all you lovers in the world
stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
stand up all you lovers in the world
we're starting up a brand new day
it's a brand new day
it's a brand new day
it's a brand new day

a stone's throw from jerusalem
i walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
and though a million stars were shining
my heart was lost on a distant planet
that whirls around the april moon
whirling in an arc of sadness
i'm lost without you
i'm lost without you
though all my kingdoms turn to sand
and fall into the sea
i'm mad about you
i'm mad about you
and from the dark secluded valleys
i heard the ancient songs of sadness
but every step i thought of you
every footstep only you
and every star a grain of sand
the leavings of a dried up ocean
tell me, how much longer?
how much longer?
they say a city in the desert lies
the vanity of an ancient king
but the city lies in broken pieces
where the wind howls and the vultures sing
these are the works of man
this is the sum of our ambition
it would make a prison of my life
if you became another's wife
with every prison blown to dust
my enemies walk free
i'm mad about you
i'm mad about you
and i have never in my life
felt more alone than i do now
although i claim dominions over all i see
it means nothing to me
there are no victories
in all our histories, without love
a stone's throw from jerusalem
i walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
and through a million stars were shining
my heart was lost on a distant planet
that whirls around the april moon
whirling in an arc of sadness
i'm lost without you
i'm lost without you
and though you hold the keys to ruin
of everything i see
with every prison blown to dust
my enemies walk free
though all my kingdoms turn to sand
and fall into the sea
i'm mad about you
i'm mad about you

a thousand years, a thousand more
a thousand times a million doors to eternity
i may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
an endless turning stairway climbs
to a tower of souls
if it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
the towers rise to numberless floors in space
i could shed another million tears, a million breaths
a million names but only one truth to face
a million roads, a million fears
a million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
i could speak a million lies, a million songs
a million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
but if there was a single truth, a single light
a single thought, a singular touch of grace
then following this single point, this single flame
the single haunted memory of your face

i still love you
i still want you
a thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
like galaxies in my head

i may be numberless, i may be innocent
i may know many things, i may be ignorant
or i could ride with kings and conquer many lands
or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
i could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
i've kept this single faith, i have but one belief

i still love you
i still want you
a thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
like galaxies in my head
on and on the mysteries unwind themselves
eternities still unsaid
'til you love me

white page, an empty field of snow
my room is 25 below
this cold man chasing ghosts
a road lies underneath the buried posts
dogs search the under forest
we scour the empty streets
the fact remains until we find you
our lives are incomplete

do i hear laughter through a veil of snow and ice?
where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?

i can't stop thinking about you
i can't stop wanting you this way
i can't face living without you
that's why i'm searching night and day
this heart's a lonely hunter
these hands are frozen fists
i can't stop thinking about you
i don't care if you exist

do i hear laughter from behind this veil of midnight?
what are you hiding in the frozen heart of winter?
somewhere a church bell tolls
i know you're close, the scent's still warm
then the trail turns cold, cold, cold

i can't stop thinking about you
i can't stop wanting you this way
i can't face living without you
that's why i'm searching night and day
this heart's a lonely hunter
these hands are frozen fists
i can't stop thinking about you
i don't care if you exist

do i hear laughter in the silence of the snow?
i know you're hiding in this frozen heart of winter
the midnight church bell tolls
i know you're close, your scent's still warm
then the trail turns cold, cold, cold

i can't stop thinking about you
i can't stop wanting you this way
i can't face living without you
that's why i'm searching night and day
this heart's a lonely hunter
these hands are frozen fists
i can't stop thinking about you
i don't care if you exist

i can't stop thinking about you
i can't stop wanting you this way
i can't face living without you
i can't stop wanting you...

i looked out across the river today
saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
two priests on the ferry
october geese on a cold winter's night

all this time the river flowed
endlessly to the sea

two priests came 'round our house tonight
one young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
one to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
and fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

all this time the river flowed
endlessly to the sea
if i had my way
i'd take a boat from the river
and i'd bury the old man
i'd bury him at sea

blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
as these words were spoken i swear i hear the old man laughing
what good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
all this time the river flowed
endlessly like a silent tear
all this time the river flowed
father, if jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

teachers told the romans built this place
they built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
they lived and they died
they prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
and their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
were the stones the workmen found

all this time the river flowed
in the falling light of a northern sun
if i had my way, take a boat from the river
men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
one by one

if he loves you
like i love you
i would walk away in shame
i'd move town
i'd change my name

when he watches you
when he counts to buy your soul
on your hand his golden rings
like he owns a bird that sings

when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

the priest has said my soul's salvation
is in the balance of the angels
and underneath the wheels of passion
i keep the faith in my fashion
when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
i'm still in love with you
i'm going to find a place to live
give you all i've got to give

when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

if i could break down these walls
and shout my name at heaven's gate
i'd take these hands
and i'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
cathedrals are broken
heaven's no longer above
and hellfire's a promise away
i'd still be saying
i'm still in love
he won't love you
like i love you
he won't care for you this way
he'll mistreat you if you stay
come and live with me
we'll have children of our own
i would love you more than life
if you'll come and be my wife

when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
when we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

it's all there in the gospels, the magdalene girl
comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl
when she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled
not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
when she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
there's this solitary figure in a halo of light
he just carries on floating past calvary hill
in an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still
"tell me where are you going lord, and why in such haste?"
now don't hinder me woman, i've no time to waste!
for they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
and i have to be there before daybreak
oh, i can not be missing, the lads will expect me
why else would the good lord himself resurrect me?
for nothing will stop me, i have to prevail
through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
may the angels protect me if all else should fail

and the last ship sails

oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
the noise at the end of the world in your ears
as a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea

and the last ship sails

it's a strange kind of beauty
it's cold and austere
and whatever it was that you've done to be here
it's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears

and the last ship sails

well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
like that strange moving finger at balthazar's feast
where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
and the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
and whatever got said, they'd be counted at least

and the last ship sails

oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
the noise at the end of the world in your ears
as a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
and the last ship sails
and whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done
and whatever the station in life you've become
in the name of the father, in the name of the son
and whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
on the earth or in heaven or under the sun

and the last ship sails

under the ruins of a walled city
crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
no flags of truce, no cries of pity
the siege guns had been pounding all through the night
it took a day to build the city
we walked through its streets in the afternoon
as i returned across the fields i'd known
i recognized the walls that i'd once made
i had to stop in my tracks for fear
of walking on the mines i'd laid

and if i built this fortress around your heart
encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
then let me build a bridge
for i cannot fill the chasm
and let me set the battlements on fire

then i went off to fight some battle
that i'd invented inside my head
away so long for years and years
you probably thought or even wished that i was dead
while the armies are all sleeping
beneath the tattered flag we'd made
i had to stop in my tracks for fear
of walking on the mines i'd laid

and if i built this fortress around your heart
encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
then let me build a bridge
for i cannot fill the chasm
and let me set the battlements on fire

this prison has now become your home
a sentence you seem prepared to pay
it took a day to build the city
we walked through its streets in the afternoon
as i returned across the lands i'd known
i recognized the fields where i'd once played
i had to stop in my tracks for fear
of walking on the mines i'd laid

and if i built this fortress around your heart
encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
then let me build a bridge
for i cannot fill the chasm
and let me set the battlements on fire
