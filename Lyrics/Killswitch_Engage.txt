i watched you walk away
hopeless, with nothing to say
i strain my eyes
hoping to see you again

this is my curse (the longing)
this is my curse (time)
this is my curse (the yearning)
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me?
will you be there?

your silence haunts me
but still i hunger for you

this is my curse (the wanting)
this is my curse (time)
this is my curse (the healing)
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me?
and still i want
and still i ache
but still i wait

to see you again
dying, inside, these walls
dying, inside, these walls
and i see your face in these tears
in these tears
and i see your face

there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love 

seek me, call me
i'll be waiting
seek me, call me
i'll be waiting

this distance, this dissolution
i cling to memories while falling
sleep brings release, and the hope of a new day
waking the misery of being without you
surrender, i give in
another moment is another eternity

(seek me) for comfort, (call me) for solace
(i'll be waiting) for the end of my broken heart
(seek me) completion, (call me) i'll be waiting
(i'll be waiting) for the end of my broken heart

you know me, you know me all too well
my only desire - to bridge our division
in sorrow i speak your name
and my voice mirrors, mirrors my torment
(seek me) for comfort, (call me) for solace
(i'll be waiting) for the end of my broken heart
(seek me) completion, (call me) i'll be waiting
(i'll be waiting) for the end of my broken heart

am i breathing?
my strength fails me
your picture, a bitter memory

for comfort, for solace
(seek me) for comfort, (call me) for solace
(i'll be waiting) for the end of my broken heart 

yeah!
yeah!

all i've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled
it is in my hands, i must not fail, and i must not fail

even through the darkest days
this fire burns, always
this fire burns, always

this is the proving ground
as the heat begins to rise
turn away from yesterday
tomorrow's in my eyes, oh

nevermore to be held down
by the wings of history
nevermore to be cast aside
this day is mine

even through the darkest days
this fire burns, always
this fire burns, always
i will not be denied in this final hour
i will not be denied, this day is mine
this passion inside me is burning, is burning
this passion inside me is burning, is burning

even through the darkest days
this fire burns, always (always)
this fire burns (fire burns), always
always (always) 

yeah, no more following this endless maze
separation will define the new way
what's broken is what leads us all astray
the chosen are renewed in amnesty
broken, hopeless, the state of all our fates
revolted, woken, lead us from this place

nowhere to hide, strength realigned
the signal fire's alight
given to fight, there's hope just in sight
the signal fire's alight
can we walk a mile in another's shoes
to determine what we have to lose? (to lose)
disconnection of a common reality
becomes so lost in this world of hypocrisy

nowhere to hide, strength realigned
the signal fire's alight
given to fight, there's hope just in sight
the signal fire's alight
alight
this is our beacon to deliver us all
to guide us away from this decay of humanity
yeah

nowhere to hide, strength realigned
the signal fire's alight
given to fight, there's hope just in sight
the signal fire's alight
alight (alight)
i won't give up this fight
alight
the signal fire is alight 

this is my last serenade
this is my last

this revelation is the death of ignorance
tangled in a state of suffocation
slave to self righteousness
damnation is on your lips

from sorrow to serenity
the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity
it's on your head

this is my last serenade
i feel you as you fall away
this is my last serenade
from yourself you can't run away

it's your choice, point the finger
but it's on your head
your destination is a choice within yourself
will you rise or become a slave
to self righteousness
open up your heart and gaze within
from sorrow to serenity
the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity
it's on your head

this is my last serenade
i feel you as you fall away
this is my last serenade
from yourself you can't run away

this is my last serenade
this is my last serenade
this is my last serenade 

numb and broken
here i stand alone
wondering what were
the last words i said to you?
hoping, praying that i'll find a way to turn back time
can i turn back time?

what would i give to behold
the smile, the face of love?
you never left me
the rising sun
will always speak your name

numb and broken
here i stand alone
wondering what were
the last words i said to you?
it won't be long
we'll meet again

what would i give to behold
the smile, the face of love?
you never left me
the rising sun
will always speak your name
it won't be long, we'll meet again
your memory is never passing
it won't be long, we'll meet again
my love for you is everlasting

i mourn for those who never knew you
i mourn (i mourn for those) for those who never knew you (who never knew you)

it won't be long, we'll meet again
your memory is never passing
it won't be long, we'll meet again
my love for you is everlasting

it won't be long, we'll meet again
it won't be long, we'll meet again
it won't be long, we'll meet again
it won't be long, we'll meet again 

let's go
deceive me, release me, unleash me
you've unleashed the wild within

welcome to the madness that dwells inside these eyes
pushed unto the breaking point, you're running out of time, time

this innocent blood is on your hands
deceive me
come face to face with the final stand
release me
it's the part of me you can't comprehend
unleash me
you've unleashed the wild within
the wild within, yeah

you who spoke defiance, you who spoke in jest
(you who spoke in jest)
the last of all my tolerance has left this broken man

this innocent blood is on your hands
deceive me
come face to face with the final stand
release me
it's the part of me you can't comprehend
unleash me
you've unleashed the wild within
i remind you time and time again
you've broken the restraints against your heart, against the dark
can you feel the pain of those you betrayed?
the promises unmade
broken hearts that fill with shame
and you're to blame, you're to blame
do they call your name? (your name)
there's nothing left to say
nothing left to say

this innocent blood is on your hands
deceive me
come face to face with the final stand
release me
it's the part of me you can't comprehend
unleash me
you've unleashed the wild within 

imprisoned inside this mind
hiding behind the empty smiles
so simple (the anguish)
as it mocks me
crawling back into the dark
running, always running, into the distance
stop me before i bleed, again

the echoes of my voice
follow me down
the shadows i cast
follow me down

deeper, i'm falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

there must be serenity

the echoes of my voice
follow me down
the shadows i cast
follow me down
deeper, i'm falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

the demons of my own design
this horror must not remain

deeper, i'm falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

there must be serenity
there must be deliverance

deeper, i'm falling
blindly descending
deeper, i'm falling 

you carry this weight
trying to cover your mistakes
to make it seem
like nothing could ever break you
but i see right through
'cause i am broken too
in all the same places as you

and if you needed proof
i'd reopen my wounds, reopen my wounds (yeah)
i see myself in you (in you)
i know you can make it through
if you needed proof
i'll reopen my wounds
in all the right places for you
so now you see the truth
that you are broken too
i'll reopen my wounds for you

i keep making the same mistakes
just to feel alive again
it's the only way to break on through
so stop numbing all the pain
because it just won't go away (won't go away)
if you only knew how much i needed you
and if you needed proof
i'd reopen my wounds (my wounds)
in all the right places for you
i can see the truth (the truth)
'cause i am broken too

i am broken too
broken just like you 

holy diver
you've been down too long in the midnight sea
oh, what's becoming of me?

ride the tiger
you can see his stripes but you know he's clean
oh, don't you see what i mean?

gotta get away
holy diver
yeah

shiny diamonds
like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
something is coming for you
look out

race for the morning
you can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
oh, we will pray it's all right
gotta get away
get away

between the velvet lies
there's a truth that's hard as steel
the vision never dies
life's a never ending wheel, yeah

holy diver
you're the star of the masquerade
no need to look so afraid

jump, jump
jump on the tiger
you can feel his heart but you know he's mean
some light can never be seen, yeah

holy diver
you've been down too long in the midnight sea
oh, what's becoming of me?
no! yeah!
ride the tiger
you can see his stripes but you know he's clean
oh, don't you see what i mean?

gotta get away, get away (get away)
gotta get away, get away

holy diver, sole survivor
your heart is clean
yeah, holy diver (holy diver)
holy diver (holy diver)
you're caught in the middle coming after you, holy diver
oh, holy diver (holy diver)
get away, get away, get away, come on 

pacing aimlessly, with my mind at unrest
unsure of what may come
what have i done to bring this down on me?
helpless to make this undone

all in due time
see the world through different eyes
all in due time
shadows will give way to light

how much more can i give of myself?
as these walls, close in on me
as i slip down into this despair (to this despair)
there is nothing to attain

what victory? (what victory?)
when my soul is weak (is weak)
where does my help come from?

all in due time
see the world through different eyes
i see the world through different eyes
all in due time
shadows will give way, give way to light
all that we suffer through
leads to determination
the trials we all go through
gives us the strength to carry on
something within us burns
desire feeds the will to live
a reason to believe
i will see redemption
yeah

all in due time
see the world through different eyes
i see the world through different eyes
all in due time
shadows will give way, give way to light

all in due time 

in these moments of loss and torment
when the vast skies don't seem to call to you
when the weight of this world bears down
and the stars have fallen like tears

i am with you always
from the darkness of night until the morning
i am with you always
from life until death takes me

monuments built in remembrance of me
but monuments fade, erode and decay
the memories are all that remain (all that remain)
as far as east is from the west, remember

i am with you always
from the darkness of night until the morning
i am with you always
from life until death takes me

when hope seems lost down and lowly
i am here with you always
i am with you always
from the darkness of night
i am with you always
from the darkness of night until the morning
i am with you always
from life until death takes me

i am with you always
from life until death takes me 

i never knew the words to say
at a loss as the world was falling around me
i see that look upon your face
feeling so desperate as we count down to dismay
how did it ever come to this?
pick up the pieces and know something's got to give
don't lose your faith (don't lose your faith)
try to believe (try to believe)
that the ends will justify the means

divided we've become, this fight has just begun
but i can't be the only one
together we overcome with a truth they can't outrun
but i can't be the only one

i see that look upon your face (your face)
feeling so desperate as we count down to dismay
how did this come to be?
there's so much more to this than what we all see, yeah
don't lose your passion (your passion)
don't lose your love, yeah
it can't just be only me (only me)
it must be us in unity
divided we've become, this fight has just begun
but i can't be the only one
together we overcome (together we overcome)
with a truth they can't outrun
but i can't be the only one

not getting through this on my own
what have we become when there is no love?
i gotta believe that things will change
and i believe things will change

divided we've become (we've become)
this fight has just begun (just begun)
but i can't be the only one (only one)
just begun (only one)
and overcome (only one)
but i can't be the only one

united, we overcome
undivided, we are the sum
but i can't be the only one 

born into this world of hatred

we are born free
from the restraints of this society
helpless to what is instilled
to all those who raise us, mold us and shape us
there is a time to separate
from this

a reason why, a state of mind
there's a disconnection
a judgement made
fueled by hate, it's your mistake
it's a choice you made
it's tearing us apart

hate
hate by design
is destroying our lives
seek to find
some understanding
redefine your life
consequence, effected
in a life that is rejected
anger misplaced
a burden on our hearts
that's keeping us apart
no love
no understanding

what we design is hate inside
a misconception
a judgement made (a judgement made)
it's our mistake
what we create
when we lose compassion
it's tearing us apart

hate
hate by design (hate by design)
is destroying our lives
seek to find (we'll seek to find)
some understanding
redefine your life
redefine your understanding
redefine your own life
go

hate
hate by design (hate by design)
is destroying our lives (our lives)
seek to find
some understanding
redefine your life 

we will not die this way, in unification
they cannot break these chains of faith
let them do their worst (let them do their worst)
never slaves to iniquity

we will not die this way (this is absolution)
death claims us no more (no more)
do not grieve, end the suffering
we will live, live eternal

will you take the stand among the dead?
bury your fear, and hold fast to life
come on

we will not die this way (this is absolution)
death claims us no more (no more)
do not grieve, end the suffering
we will live, live eternal

anchor yourself to the foundation of everything you love
believe you have just begun to live, to live
don't let the world deceive you
don't let their words betray you
don't let their lies deceive you
let them do their worst

we will not die this way (this is absolution)
death claims us no more (no more)
do not grieve, end the suffering
we will live, live eternal 

their cries are blown away with the wind
how passive can we be before humanity is lost?
turning our backs on those who need love
we must not rest while healing is needed

tear down the veil
that bars your heart from feeling this
dedicate yourself
give your soul to compassion
with open arms, embrace this heart
with open eyes, behold the truth
embrace this life

so little time is left
we must be relentless in our pursuit of those in torment

tear down the veil (tear down the veil)
that bars your heart from feeling this
dedicate yourself (dedicate yourself)
become the voice of compassion
with open arms, embrace this heart
with open eyes, behold the truth
embrace this life
can you reject yourself?
can you feel their agony?
in a world that feeds on disregard
heal the broken hearted 

fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people
change
change
fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people

return to the womb, new life
lay your head to rest, mercy
to give you a peace of mind
lay your head to rest

come together inside
this body is only a shell
change, the only way we will survive
light, transfiguration of the soul
of the soul, of the mind
fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people
return to the womb, new life
lay your head to rest, mercy
to give you a peace of mind
lay your head to rest

tell them
they will not hold us down
it's time for change, change
it's time for change, change
it's time for change
they will not hold us down
they will not hold us down
it's time for change
it's time for change 

go

abolition to this illusion
and all the monuments of hypocrisy
burn them, burn them to the ground
destroy them, they're useless to us now

tear down reminders of a crownless king
this impostor claims authority
indignation is closing in
you choose a war, a war you cannot win

no one, no one can save you now
cast down where no mercy can be found
no willingness to bow to a king without a crown
where the virtuous can't be found

defy you, to the depths you descend
i defy you, to the death we defend
defy you, your rule will come to an end
i defy you, you've become the crownless king
the penitent pray for the downfall of your
of your reign
the warrior soul shall break the hold of constraints
in the end you will suffer

defy you, to the depths you descend
i defy you, to the death we defend
defy you, your rule will come to an end
i defy you, you've become the crownless king

this storied confusion, distorted and diluted
will come undone when the balance shifts
and the framework breaks, yeah
the framework breaks

to the depths you descend
become the crownless king
defy you, i defy you
defy you, we defy you 

this day will resound in our melodies
the voices of fate
a testament to all we hope for
they will learn of the passion and tragedy
that lies in wait, when they stand up
stand up against the onslaught
nothing could ever tear us apart

our spirit is never ending
i'll be the protection when you fall
our spirit is never ending
so tell them it's us, us against the world
yeah

yeah, this catastrophe will serve to redeem our purpose
do you believe they could never come between us?

our spirit is never ending
i'll be the protection when you fall
our spirit is never ending
tell them it's us against the world
(it's us against the world)
the saga unfolds, the legends of old will guide us all
the crack of the skull, the blood and the soul
we heed the endless call

our spirit is never ending (never ending)
i'll be the protection when you fall
our spirit is never ending (never ending)
tell them it's us against the world
(it's us against the world) 

slowly we watch the degradation of the civilization
the rise and fall of all we are stands before us

this place is evil
is there an answer?
this world is vile
we are the answer
oh

how long until we die?
die from the inside out
how much is enough for us to see the light?
how much blood must be spilled?

contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
don't wait 'til daylight dies (daylight dies)

when there is blood on our hands
how can we (how can we) ignore the truth?
contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
don't wait 'til daylight dies

the cost of one life
the price of one soul
is too much to bear

no more broken promises
our shattered hearts will heal
no more broken promises
no more, no more

contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
don't wait 'til daylight dies

how long until it dies?
how long? how long?
how long until it dies?
how long? how long?
