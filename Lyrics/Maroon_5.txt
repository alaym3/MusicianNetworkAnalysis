all of our bridges burned down

wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
made it from the bottom, now when you see me, i'm stuntin'
and all of my cars start with the push of a button
telling me i changed since i blew up or whatever you call it
switched the number to my phone so you never could call it

so you talk about who you see at the top
or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
phantom pulled up, valet open doors

now it's me who they want
so you can go take that little piece of shit with you

i'm at a payphone, trying to call home
all of my change i spent on you (whoo!)
where have the times gone? baby, it's all wrong
where are the plans we made for two? (for two?)
(yeah)

i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore

oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
oh oh oh, ohh

i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied, oh
keep playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again
but, oh
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore

oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
oh oh oh, ohh

i'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
and make sure everything's alright (it's alright, it's alright)
my pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you 'cause i know that's what you want me to do

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breaking in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore 

yeah

sunday morning, rain is falling
steal some covers, share some skin (like that)
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you twist to fit the mold that i am in

but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road, get up and go if i knew
that someday, it would lead me back to you
that someday, it would lead me back to you (someday)

that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave

fingers trace your every outline
paint a picture with my hands
back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
change the weather, still together when it ends
that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave

oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
sunday morning, rain is falling and i'm calling out to you
singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (oh yeah, oh yeah)
find a way to bring myself back home to you

and you may not know
that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see (you are all i see)
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
driving slow, yeah, yeah

leaves are fallin', it's september
the night came in, it made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young 'til she kissed me
like a whiskey, like a whiskey

i never knew that love was blind
'til i was hers, but she was never mine
yeah, i was reckless
but i let it burn, i let it burn, yeah
the feelin', it was bittersweet
realizin' i was in too deep
she was a lesson
i had to learn, i had to learn, yeah

i used to try to forget her
but now i smile when i remember
ooh

leaves are fallin' in september
the night came in, it made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young 'til she kissed me
like a whiskey, like a whiskey
ooh, like a whiskey, ooh
would've left this world behind
just to wake up by your side
every mornin', i would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
would've waited a thousand nights
if she never said goodbye
i admit that i
would've sold my soul for a little more time
ooh

i used to try to forget her
but now i smile when i remember

leaves are fallin', it's september
the night came in, it made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young 'til she kissed me
like a whiskey, like a whiskey

i ain't like the other cognacs
or type of cat that'd never call back
or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
all of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
break her off somethin' proper
pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
punch drunk love, it's a fine line
dom pérignon, she the fine wine
someone call 911, i'm runnin' out of time
she done got off with my heart
leaves are fallin', it's september (oh)
the night came in, it made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young (so young)
'til she kissed me (yeah)
like a whiskey (yeah)
and i was so young (so young)
'til she kissed me
like a whiskey, like a whiskey 

here i am waiting
i'll have to leave soon
why am i holding on?
we knew this day would come
we knew it all along
how did it come so fast?

this is our last night, but it's late
and i'm trying not to sleep
'cause i know, when i wake
i will have to slip away

and when the daylight comes, i'll have to go
but tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
'cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
but tonight i need to hold you so close

ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

here i am staring
at your perfection
in my arms, so beautiful
the sky is getting bright
the stars are burning out
somebody slow it down
this is way too hard
'cause i know, when the sun comes up
i will leave, this is my last glance
that will soon be memory

and when the daylight comes, i'll have to go
but tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
'cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
but tonight, i need to hold you so close

ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

i never want it to stop
because i don't wanna start all over, start all over
i was afraid of the dark
but now it's all that i want, all that i want, all that i want

and when the daylight comes, i'll have to go
but tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
'cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
but tonight i need to hold you so close
and when the daylight comes i'll have to go
but tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
'cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own

you keep me connected to you like i was your shadow
you're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
can't nothing get in between us, baby
we've been waiting on this moment for so long
you wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
wait

when i put my lips on you
you feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
make you cry for me
when i put my lips on you
i hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
baby, cry for me
when i put my lips on you (when i, when i, when i)
when i put my lips on you (when i, when i, when i)

just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
when we close the curtains
you and me can forget all our manners, oh
the neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'cause look how easily we keep coming undone
you wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
wait
when i put my lips on you
you feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
make you cry for me
when i put my lips on you
i hear your voice echoing all through the night for me

oh yeah
oh yeah

so scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
and i wrote two hundred letters i will never send
sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
you'd rather cover up, i'd rather let them bleed
so let me be, and i'll set you free (oh yeah)

i am in misery
there ain't nobody who can comfort me (oh yeah)
why won't you answer me?
the silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

girl, you really got me bad
you really got me bad
now i'm gonna get you back
i'm gonna get you back

your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
the way it feels to be completely intertwined
not that i didn't care, it's that i didn't know
it's not what i didn't feel, it's what i didn't show
so let me be, and i'll set you free
i am in misery
there ain't nobody who can comfort me (oh yeah)
why won't you answer me?
the silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah)

girl, you really got me bad
you really got me bad
now i'm gonna get you back
i'm gonna get you back, yeah

you say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
you keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
i'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
i'm getting there, i don't care where i have to roam

why do you do what you do to me? yeah
why won't you answer me, answer me? yeah
why do you do what you do to me? yeah
why won't you answer me, answer me? yeah

i am in misery
there ain't nobody who can comfort me (oh yeah)
why won't you answer me?
the silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah)
