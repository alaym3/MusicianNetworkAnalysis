he's the wolf screaming lonely in the night
he's the blood stain on the stage
he's the tear in your eye
been tempted by his lie
he's the knife in your back, he's rage
he's the razor to the knife
oh, lonely is our lives
my head's spinning 'round and 'round
but in the seasons of wither
we'll stand and deliver
be strong and laugh and

shout, shout, shout
shout at the devil
shout, shout, shout

he'll be the love in your eyes
he'll be the blood between your thighs
and then he'll have you cry for more
he'll put strength to the test
he'll put the thrill back in bed
sure you've heard it all before
he'll be the risk in the kiss
might be anger on your lips
might run scared for the door
but in seasons of wither
we'll stand and deliver
be strong and laugh and
shout, shout, shout
shout at the devil
shout, shout, shout
shout at the devil

he's the wolf screaming lonely in the night
he's the blood stain on the stage

greed's been crowned the new king
hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
save the blessings for the final ring, amen

take a ride on the wild side

forward my mail to me in hell
liars and the martyrs lost faith in the father
long lost is the wishing well

take a ride on the wild side
wild side

fallen angels so fast to kill
thy kingdom come on the wild side
our father, who ain't in heaven
be thy name on the wild side
holy mary, mother, may i
pray for us on the wild side?
wild side, wild side
name dropping no names, glamorize cocaine
puppets with strings of gold
east la at midnight, papa won't be home tonight
found dead with his best friend's wife

take a ride on the wild side
wild side
take a ride on the wild side
wild side

gang fights, fatal strikes
we lie on the wild side
no escape, murder rape
doing time on the wild side
a baby cries, a cop dies
a days pay on the wild side

wild side, wild side
tragic life on the wild side
wild side, wild side
kicking ass on the wild side
no going back on the wild side 

friday night and i need a fight
my motorcycle and a switchblade knife
handful of grease in my hair feels right
but what i need to make me tight are those

frankie died just the other night
some say it was suicide
but we know
how the story goes
with his six string knife
and his street-wise pride
the boy was a man before his time
and she knew
all their dreams would come true
but ya see, frankie was fast
he was too fast to know
he wouldn't go slow
until his lethal dose
and she knows
he'll finally come too close

well, on with the show
going on with the show
come on baby
no, no, no
oh my, my, my
my, my, oh my
well, on with the show
going on with the show
come on baby
no, no, no
oh my, my, my
my, my, oh my
he was bad, he was never good
but one thing that he understood
and she knew
all those lies would come true
the time has come and he's paid his dues
suzy finally got the news
she always knew
this day would come soon

going on with the show
going on with the show
come on baby
no, no, no
oh my, my, my
my, my, oh my
well, on with the show
going on with the show
come on baby
no, no, no
oh my, my, my
my, my, oh my

he was stopped on a dime with a switchblade knife
some damn punk went and took frankie's life
and she knew
she'd have to pull through
broken down, with his broken dreams
with a wink of an eye, said suzy, "listen to me"
you must go on with the show
going on with the show
going on with the show
come on baby
no, no, no
oh my, my, oh my

ooh, baby 

here i come, my mind is set
get ready for love
you're my ten second pet
touch my gun but don't pull my trigger
let's make history in the elevator
or lock the door
shine my pistol some more
here i come, just ten seconds more

ten seconds to love 
pull my trigger
my guns loaded with your love
ten seconds to love 
just wait honey
until i tell the boys about you

bring a girlfriend
maybe bring two i got my camera
make a star outta you
let's inject it
photograph it
down to the subway
let the boys have it

reach down low
slide it in real slow
i wanna hear your engine roar
before i'm in the door
you feel so good
do you want some more
i got one more shot
my guns still warm


was it hot for you
did you fire this round
the second i'm through
i'll be leaving this town 

the blade of my knife
faced away from your heart
those last few nights
it turned and sliced you apart
this love that i tell
now feels lonely as hell
from this padded prison cell
so many times i said
you'd only be mine
i gave my blood and my tears
and loved you, cyanide
when you took my lips
i took your breath
sometimes love's better off dead

you're all i need
make you only mine
(i loved you)
so i set you free
i had to take your life
(you're all i need)
you're all i need
you're all i need
and i loved you so
but you didn't love me
laid out cold
now we're both alone
but killing you
helped me keep you home
i guess it was bad
cause love can be sad
but we finally made the news
tied up smiling
i thought you were happy
never opened your eyes
i thought you were napping
well, i got so much to learn
about love in this world
but we finally made the news

you're all i need
make you only mine
(i loved you)
so i set you free
i had to take your life
(you're all i need)
you're all i need
you're all i need
and i loved you so
so i put you to sleep
you're all i need
make you only mine
(you're all i need)
you're all i need
(you're all i need)
you're all i need
you're all i need
you're all i need
you're all i need
you're all i need
you're all i need
you're all i need 

without you, there's no change
my nights and days are grey
if i reached out and touched the rain
it just wouldn't feel the same
without you, i'd be lost
i'd slip down from the top
i'd slide down so low
girl you'd never, never know
without you, without you
a sailor lost at sea
without you, woman
the world comes down on me
without you in my life
i'd slowly wilt and die
but with you by my side
you're the reason i'm alive
but with you in my life
you're the reason i'm alive
but without you, without you
without you, my hope is small
let me be me all along
you let the fires rage inside
knowing someday i'd grow strong
without you, without you
a sailor lost at sea
without you, woman
the world comes down on me
without you in my life
i'd slowly wilt and die
but with you by my side
you're the reason i'm alive
but with you in my life
you're the reason i'm alive
but without you, without you
i could face a mountain
but i could never climb alone
i could start another day
but how many, just don't know
you're the reason the sun shines down
and the nights, they don't grow cold
only you that i'll hold when i'm young
only you as we grow old
without you in my life
i'd slowly wilt and die
but with you by my side
you're the reason i'm alive
but with you in my life
you're the reason i'm alive
but without you, without you

ooh, red hot, red hot
oh, to the top, we are red hot
red hot, red hot
oh, to the top, we are red hot

red hot
red hot
red hot
red hot
ow! 

yeah yeah yeah yeah
what time, oh oh oh oh

we could sail away
or catch a freight train
or a rocketship into outer space
nothin' left to do
too many things were said
to ever make it feel
like yesterday did
seasons must change
separate paths, separate ways
if we blame it on anything
let's blame it on the rain
i knew it all along
i'd have to write this song
too young to fall in love
guess we knew it all along
that's alright, that's okay
we were walkin' through some youth
smilin' through some pain
that's alright, that's okay
let's turn the page
my friends called today
down from l.a
they were shooting pool all night
sleeping half the day
they said i could crash
if i could find my own way
i told them you were leaving
on a bus to go away
that's alright, that's okay
we were two kids in love
trying to find our way
thats's alright, that's okay
held our dreams in our hands
let our minds run away
that's alright, that's okay
we were walkin' through some youth
smilin' through some pain
that's alright, let's turn the page
and remember what i say girl
and it goes this way

girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away
girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away
here we go
don't go away now
i want to stay
com'on girl
com'on baby
i'll say it one more time
girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away
girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away
girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away, yeah
girl, don't go away mad
and girl, just go away
now see girl, don't go away mad
and girl, just go away, yeah
girl, don't go away mad
girl, just go away
