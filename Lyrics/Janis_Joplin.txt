i'd like to do a song
of great social and political import
it goes like this

oh lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz
my friends all drive porsches, i must make amends
worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
so lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz

oh lord, won't you buy me a color tv
dialing for dollars is trying to find me
i wait for delivery each day until three
so oh lord, won't you buy me a color tv

oh lord, won't you buy me a night on the town
i'm counting on you, lord, please don't let me down
prove that you love me and buy the next round
oh lord, won't you buy me a night on the town

oh lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz
my friends all drive porsches, i must make amends
worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
so lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz
spoken:

busted flat in baton rouge, waiting for a train
when i was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
and rode us all the way to new orleans
i pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
i was playing soft while bobby sang the blues, yeah
windshield wipers slapping time i was holding bobby's hand in mine
we sang every song that driver knew

freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
nothing, i mean nothing, honey if it ain't free, no no
yeah feeling good was easy lord, when he sang the blues
you know feeling good was good enough for me
good enough for me and my bobby mcgee

from the kentucky coal mines to the california sun
yeah, bobby shared the secrets of my soul
through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
yeah, bobby baby kept me from the cold
one day up near salinas, lord, i let him slip away
he's lookin' for that home, and i hope he finds it
but i'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
to be holdin' bobby's body next to mine

freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
nothing, and that's all that bobby left me
feeling good was easy lord, when he sang the blues
you know feeling good was good enough for me (mm-hmm)
