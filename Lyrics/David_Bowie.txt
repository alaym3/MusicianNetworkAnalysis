take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(ten) ground control (nine) to major tom (eight, seven)
(six) commencing (five) countdown, engines on
(four, three, two)
check ignition (one) and may god's love (lift off) be with you


this is ground control to major tom
you've really made the grade
and the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
this is major tom to ground control
i'm stepping through the door
and i'm floating in a most peculiar way
and the stars look very different today

for here am i sitting in my tin can
far above the world
planet earth is blue
and there's nothing i can do


though i'm past one hundred thousand miles
i'm feeling very still
and i think my spaceship knows which way to go
tell my wife i love her very much
she knows
ground control to major tom
your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
can you hear me, major tom?
can you hear me, major tom?
can you hear me, major tom?
can you-

-here am i floating 'round my tin can
far above the moon
planet earth is blue
and there's nothing i can do

i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive them away
we can beat them just for one day
we can be heroes just for one day

and you, you can be mean
and i, i'll drink all the time
'cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
yes, we're lovers, and that is that

though nothing will keep us together
we could steal time just for one day
we can be heroes forever and ever
what d'you say?

i, i wish you could swim
like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

though nothing, nothing will keep us together
we can beat them forever and ever
oh, we can be heroes just for one day

i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive them away
we can be heroes, just for one day
we can be us just for one day

i, i can remember (i remember)
standing by the wall (by the wall)
and the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
and we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

and the shame was on the other side
oh, we can beat them forever and ever
then we could be heroes just for one day

we can be heroes
we can be heroes
we can be heroes just for one day
we can be heroes

we're nothing, and nothing will help us
maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
but we could be safer just for one day
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

in the villa of ormen, in the villa of ormen
stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah

something happened on the day he died
spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar)
how many times does an angel fall?
how many people lie instead of talking tall?
he trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar, i'm not a gangstar)
​
i can't answer why (i'm a blackstar)
just go with me (i'm not a filmstar)
i'ma take you home (i'm a blackstar)
take your passport and shoes (i'm not a popstar)
and your sedatives, boo (i'm a blackstar)
you're a flash in the pan (i'm not a marvel star)
i'm the great i am (i'm a blackstar)
​
i'm a blackstar, way up, on money, i've got game
i see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
i want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes

but i can tell you how (i'm not a flam star)
we were born upside-down (i'm a star's star)
born the wrong way 'round (i’m not a white star)

hey now, now
oh, oh, oh

didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
i leaned back on my radio
some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"lotta soul," he said
then the loud sound did seem to fade
came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
that weren't no dj, that was hazy cosmic jive

there's a starman waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he's told us not to blow it
'cause he knows it's all worthwhile
he told me
let the children lose it
let the children use it
let all the children boogie

i had to phone someone so i picked on you
hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
switch on the tv, we may pick him up on channel two
look out your window, i can see his light
if we can sparkle he may land tonight
don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

there's a starman waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he's told us not to blow it
'cause he knows it's all worthwhile

it's a god-awful small affair
to the girl with the mousy hair
but her mummy is yelling, "no!"
and her daddy has told her to go
but her friend is nowhere to be seen
now she walks through her sunken dream
to the seat with the clearest view
and she's hooked to the silver screen

but the film is a saddening bore
for she's lived it ten times or more
she could spit in the eyes of fools
as they ask her to focus on

sailors fighting in the dance hall
oh, man, look at those cavemen go
it's the freakiest show
take a look at the lawman
beating up the wrong guy
oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
he's in the best selling show
is there life on mars?

it's on america's tortured brow
that mickey mouse has grown up a cow
now the workers have struck for fame
'cause lennon's on sale again
see the mice in their million hordes
from ibiza to the norfolk broads
rule britannia is out of bounds
to my mother, my dog, and clowns

but the film is a saddening bore
because i wrote it ten times or more
it's about to be writ again
as i ask you to focus on

sailors fighting in the dance hall
oh, man, look at those cavemen go
it's the freakiest show
take a look at the lawman
beating up the wrong guy
oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
he's in the best selling show
is there life on mars?

look up here, i'm in heaven
i've got scars that can't be seen
i've got drama, can't be stolen
everybody knows me now

look up here, man, i'm in danger
i've got nothing left to lose
i'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
dropped my cell phone down below
ain't that just like me?

by the time i got to new york
i was living like a king
there i used up all my money
i was looking for your ass

this way or no way
you know i'll be free
just like that bluebird
now, ain't that just like me?
oh, i'll be free
just like that bluebird
oh, i'll be free
ain't that just like me?

oh yeah
mmm

still don't know what i was waiting for
and my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
every time i thought i'd got it made
it seemed the taste was not so sweet
so i turned myself to face me
but i've never caught a glimpse
of how the others must see the faker
i'm much too fast to take that test

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
time may change me
but i can't trace time

oh yeah

i watch the ripples change their size
but never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
so the days float through my eyes
but still the days seem the same
and these children that you spit on
as they try to change their worlds
are immune to your consultations
they're quite aware of what they're going through

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
you've left us up to our necks in it
time may change me
but you can't trace time

strange fascination, fascinating me
ah, changes are taking the pace i'm going through

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
time may change me
but i can't trace time

i said that time may change me
but i can't trace time

we passed upon the stair
we spoke of was and when
although i wasn't there
he said i was his friend
which came as some surprise
i spoke into his eyes, "i thought you died alone
a long long time ago"

oh no, not me
i never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world

i laughed and shook his hand
and made my way back home
i searched for form and land
for years and years, i roamed
i gazed a gazely stare
at all the millions here
we must have died alone
a long long time ago

who knows? not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world
who knows? not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world

do you remember a guy that's been
in such an early song?
i've heard a rumour from ground control
oh no, don't say it's true
they got a message from the action man
"i'm happy, hope you're happy too
i've loved all i've needed to love
sordid details following"
the shrieking of nothing is killing
just pictures of jap girls in synthesis
and i ain't got no money and i ain't got no hair
but i'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

ashes to ashes, funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an all-time low

time and again i tell myself
i'll stay clean tonight
but the little green wheels are following me
oh no, not again
i'm stuck with a valuable friend
"i'm happy, hope you're happy too"
one flash of light, but no smoking pistol
i've never done good things
i've never done bad things
i never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
want an axe to break the ice
wanna come down right now

ashes to ashes, funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an all-time low

now ziggy played guitar
jamming good with weird and gilly
and the spiders from mars
he played it left hand
but made it too far
became the special man
then we were ziggy's band

ziggy really sang
screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
like some cat from japan
he could kill 'em by smiling
he could leave 'em to hang
he came on so loaded, man,
well hung, snow white tan

so where were the spiders
while the fly tried to break our bones?
just the beer light to guide us
so we bitched about his fans
and should we crush his sweet hands?
oh yeah

ziggy played for time
jiving us that we were voodoo
the kids were just crass
he was the nazz
with god-given ass
he took it all too far
but boy, could he play guitar

making love with his ego
ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
like a leper messiah
when the kids had killed the man
i had to break up the band

oh yeah
ooh

ziggy played guitar

i know when to go out
and when to stay in
get things done

i catch the paper boy
but things don't really change
i'm standing in the wind
but i never wave bye-bye
but i try
i try

there's no sign of life
it's just the power to charm
i'm lying in the rain
but i never wave bye-bye
but i try
i try

never going to fall for
(modern love) walks beside me
(modern love) walks on by
(modern love) gets me to the church on time
(church on time) terrifies me
(church on time) makes me party
(church on time) puts my trust in god and man
(god and man) no confessions
(god and man) no religion
(god and man) don't believe in modern love

it's not really work
it's just the power to charm
i'm still standing in the wind
but i never wave bye bye

pushing through the market square
so many mothers sighing (sighing)
news had just come over
we had five years left to cry in (cry in)
news guy wept and told us
earth was really dying (dying)
cried so much his face was wet
then i knew he was not lying (lying)
i heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
i saw boys, toys, electric irons and tvs
my brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
i had to cram so many things to store everything in there
and all the fat, skinny people
and all the tall, short people
and all the nobody people
and all the somebody people
i never thought i'd need so many people

a girl my age went off her head
hit some tiny children
if the black hadn't have pulled her off
i think she would have killed them
a soldier with a broken arm
fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac
a cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and a queer threw up at the sight of that
i think i saw you in an ice-cream parlour
drinking milkshakes cold and long
smiling and waving and looking so fine
don't think you knew you were in this song
and it was cold and it rained, so i felt like an actor
and i thought of ma and i wanted to get back there
your face, your race
the way that you talk
i kiss you, you're beautiful
i want you to walk

‘tis a pity she was a whore
‘tis my curse, i suppose
that was patrol

i know something's very wrong
the pulse returns the prodigal sons
the blackout hearts, the flowered news
with skull designs upon my shoes

i can't give everything
i can't give everything away
i can't give everything away

seeing more and feeling less
saying no but meaning yes
this is all i ever meant
that's the message that i sent

i can't give everything

time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
you pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
the wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

you're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
and the clock waits so patiently on your song
you walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
but the day breaks instead so you hurry home
don't let the sun blast your shadow
don't let the milk float ride your mind
you're so natural - religiously unkind

oh no, love! you're not alone
you're watching yourself but you're too unfair
you got your head all tangled up
but if i could only make you care
oh no, love! you're not alone
no matter what or who you've been
no matter when or where you've seen
all the knives seem to lacerate your brain
i've had my share, i'll help you with the pain
you're not alone!

just turn on with me and you're not alone
let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)

i’m dying to
push their backs against the grain
and fool them all again and again

we bitches tear our magazines
those oligarchs with foaming mouths come

they pulled in just behind the fridge
he lays her down, he frowns
"gee, my life's a funny thing
am i still too young?"
he kissed her then and there
she took his ring, took his babies
it took him minutes, took her nowhere
heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(all night)
she wants the young american
(young american, young american)
(she wants the young american)
(all right)
she wants the young american

scanning life through the picture window
she finds the slinky vagabond
he coughs as he passes her ford mustang
but heaven forbid, she'll take anything
but the freak, and his type, all for nothing
he misses a step and cuts his hand, but
showing nothing, he swoops like a song
she cries "where have all papa's heroes gone?"

(all night)
she wants the young american
(young american, young american)
(she wants the young american)
(all right)
but she wants the young american

all the way from washington
her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"we live for just these twenty years
do we have to die for the fifty more?"

all night
he wants the young american
(young american, young american)
(he wants the young american)
(all right) all right
he wants the young american

do you remember, your president nixon?
do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
or even yesterday?
have you been the un-american?
just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout leather, leather everywhere
and not a myth left from the ghetto
well, well, well, would you carry a razor
in case, just in case of depression?
sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
blushing at all the afro-sheeners
ain't that close to love?
well, ain't that poster love?
well, it ain't that barbie doll
her heart's been broken just like you and

(all night)
all night, you want the young american
(young american) young american
(you want the young american) all right
all right
you want the young american

you ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
a pimp's got a cadi and a lady got a chrysler
black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(i heard the news today, oh boy)
i got a suite and you got defeat
ain't there a man who can say no more?
and ain't there a woman i can sock on the jaw?
and, ain't there a child i can hold without judging?
ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

all night
i want the young american
(young american) young american
(i want the young american)
all right
i want the young american, young american

(young american, young american)
(i want the young american)
(all night)
you want i, i want you
(young american, young american)
(i want the young american)
(all right)
all i want is the young american
(young american, young american)
(i want the young american)
(all night)
