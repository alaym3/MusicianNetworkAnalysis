look at this, i'm a coward too
you don't need to hide my friend for i am just like you

here in the dark i can see who you are
i see it so clearly
the beat of my heart just stops and starts
whenever you're near me
i just gotta thank you, all the love i gave ya
came and you took it all away
and now there's no pain
there's everything to gain here
now that i'm lost i think i'll stay

in hell
there's comfort in these flames and, i don't feel a thing
in hell
i'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

i know you are trouble
but i can't seem to get away
all the pleasure, all the pain
palm trees swaying in the rain
all those times we stayed in
the way the smoke would fill the room
and we'd be dancing in the clouds
like we had nothing to lose

i haven't heard from you, it's been a long time
know that i hurt you, it stays on my mind
let me make it right
we never said goodbye
what you been thinking 'bout?
know that we're worth the fight
so let me make it right
i might have had my doubts
said some things i regret
if i could take it back
i wouldn't hesitate
we never said goodbye
never said goodbye, baby
what you been thinking 'bout
you've been thinking 'bout lately?
know we're worth the fight
know we're worth the fight
so let me make it right
it's been a long time

so let
so let
so let
so let
so let
so let
so let
so let me make it right

i know you are trouble

yeah, that's right
skrillex, bare noize, foreign beggars
l.a., london, dubai
'bout to get rowdy right now

yeah. i'm an all time factor
i make the next guy look like an actor
this sort of mandem 'gwan like they matter
when i touch mic, i see the man scatter
and they wanna talk big
but when it comes to big it they bout to get splatter
so i tell them "relax yourself
go home to your mum and stop being a catta"
many guys wanna par
many guys looking to take this thing far
many guys looking to be some big stars
but soon enough them man about to get slappa
so there's no need for chatter
no need for anything cheap and that's that
anybody making a ting to get smacked up, back up
fam, and meet us 'round back

when i touch mics i see the man scatta
scatta, as if i had a clutch on a magnum

you're just another pawn in my game
and i'm the god figure pouring the rain
i'm a raw one, too much of a force to contain
when i'm forced to repay all the thoughts of the brain
by any means i ain't putting pure spits to shame
what depict and script's too much for the mandem
man, i keep calm with more shit to spray
and when i'm letting off since i had a clutch on the magnum
see you making at me in the fashion
most of these mc's are straight gassin'
yeah they getting paid on the jsa
think they're something like the guy don draper from mad men
bagging up while i'm racking hits by the minute
i'm sick with the lyrics, so you best be backin' up
chatta with a little more flex
doesn't matter cause when i ratatat bars watch a bare man scatta

when i touch mics i see the man scatta
scatta, as if i had a clutch on a magnum

i know what i think you wouldn't expect
i know what i think you wouldn't expect

no one is a musician
they're not artists because nobody can play the guitar
