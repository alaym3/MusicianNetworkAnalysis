from the cradle bars comes a beckoning voice
it sends you spinning, you have no choice
you hear a laughter cracking through the walls
it sends you spinning, you have no choice
you hear a laughter cracking through the walls
it sends you spinning, you have no choice

following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
spellbound
following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
spellbound
spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound

and don't forget when your elders forget to say their prayers
take them by the legs and throw them down the stairs
when you think your toys have gone berserk
it's an illusion you cannot shirk
you hear laughter cracking through the walls
it sends you spinning you have no choice

following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
spellbound
following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
spellbound
spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound

oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
we are entranced
following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
we are entranced
entranced, entranced
entranced, entranced
entranced, entranced

water was running, children were running
you were running out of time
under the mountain, a golden fountain
were you praying at the lares shrine?

but, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

we found you hiding, we found you lying
choking on the dirt and sand
your former glories, and all the stories
dragged and washed with eager hands

but, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
your city lies in dust

water was running, children were running
we found you hiding, we found you lying
water was running, children were running
we found you hiding, we found you lying

your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust... my friend

hot and burning in your nostrils
pouring down your gaping mouth
your molten bodies, blanket of cinders
caught in the throes, and

woah oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust... my friend

your city lies in dust, my friend

this is the happy house
we're happy here in the happy house
oh, it's such fun, fun, fun, oh
we've come to play in the happy house
and waste a day in the happy house
it never rains, never rains
we've come to scream in the happy house
we're in a dream in the happy house
we're all quite sane -ane -ane, oh
this is the happy house, we're happy here
there's room for you if you say "i do"
but don't say no or you'll have to go
we've done no wrong with our blinkers on
it's safe and calm if you sing along
sing along, sing along, oh-oh
this is the happy house
we're happy here in the happy house
to forget ourselves and pretend all's well
there is no hell, oh-oh
oh, oh, oh
ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

i'm looking through your window, ooh-ooh
i'm looking through your window, hmm-hmm

harmful elements in the air
cymbals crashing everywhere
reaps the fields of rice and reeds
while the population feeds
junk floats on polluted water
an old custom to sell your daughter
would you like number twenty-three?
leave your yens on the counter please

ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

tourists swarm to see your face
confucius has a puzzling grace
disorientated you enter in
unleashing scent of wild jasmine
slanted eyes meet a new sunrise
a race of bodies small in size
chicken chow mein and chop suey
hong kong garden takeaway

the jewel, the prize
looking into your eyes
cool pools drown your mind
what else will you find

i heard a rumour
it was just a rumour
i heard a rumour
what have you done to her?

myriad lights
they said i'd be impressed
arabian knights
at your primitive best

a tourist oasis
reflects in seedy sunshades
a monstrous oil tanker
its wound bleeding in seas

i heard a rumour
what have you done to her?
i heard a rumour
what have you done to her?

veiled behind screens
kept as your baby machine
whilst you conquer more orifices
of boys, goats and things
ripped out sheep's eyes
no forks or knives

myriad lights
they said i'd be impressed
arabian knights
at your primitive best

i heard a rumour
what have you done to her?
i heard a rumour
what have you done to her?
i heard a rumour

she tries not to shatter, kaleidoscope style
personality changes behind her red smile
every new problem brings a stranger inside
helplessly forcing one more new disguise

christine, the strawberry girl
christine, banana split lady
christine, the strawberry girl
christine, banana split lady

singing sweet savages lost in our world
this big-eyed girl sees her faces unfurl
now she's in purple, now she's a turtle
disintegrating

christine, the strawberry girl
christine, banana split lady
christine, the strawberry girl
christine sees her faces unfurl

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
now she's in purple, now she's a turtle
disintegrating
christine, christine

christine, the strawberry girl
christine, banana split lady
christine, the strawberry girl
christine sees her faces unfurl

christine, christine
christine, christine
22 faces
disintegrating
christine, christine
disintegrating

creeping up the backstairs
slinking into dark stalls
shapeless and slumped in bath chairs
furtive eyes peep out of holes
she has many guises
she'll do what you want her to
playing dead and sweet submission
cracks the whip deadpan on cue

peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo

reeking like a pigsty
peeling back and gagging free
flaccid ego in your hand
chokes on dry tears, can you understand?
she's jeering at the shadows
sneering behind a smile
lunge and thrust to pout and pucker
into the face of the beguiled

peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
golly jeepers, where'd you get those peepers?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peepshow, creepshow, where did you get those eyes?

strobe lights pump and flicker
dry lips crack out for more
"come bite on this rag doll, baby!
that's right now hit the floor"
they're sneaking out the back door
she gets up from all fours
rhinestone fools and silver dollars
curdle into bitter tears

peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
golly jeepers, where'd you get those peepers?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peepshow, creepshow, where did you get those eyes?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
golly jeepers, where'd you get those peepers?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peepshow, creepshow, where did you get those eyes?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
golly jeepers, where'd you get those peepers?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
peepshow, creepshow, where did you get those eyes?
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
where did you get those eyes?
where did you get those eyes?

on to israel
on to israel

little orphans in the snow
with nowhere to call a home
start their singing, singing
waiting through the summertime
to thaw your hearts in wintertime
that's why they're singing, singing

waiting for a sign
to turn blood into wine
the sweet taste in your mouth
turned bitter in its glass

israel, in israel
israel, in israel

shattered fragments of the past
meet in veins on the stained glass
like the lifeline in your palm
red and green reflects the scene
of a long forgotten dream
there were princes and there were kings

now hidden in disguise
cheap wrappings of lies
keep your heart alive
with a song from inside

even though we're all alone
we are never on our own
when we're singing, singing
home, home!

on to israel
on to israel
on to israel

there's a man who's looking in
and he smiles a toothless grin
because he's singing, singing
see some people shine with glee
but their song is jealousy
their hate is clanging, maddening

in israel will they sing happy noel?
in israel, in israel
israel, in israel
in israel will they sing happy noel?

on to israel
on to israel
on to israel

it glittered and it gleamed
for the arriving beauty queen
a ring and a car
now you're the prettiest by far
no party she'd not attend
no invitation she wouldn't send
transfixed by the inner sound
of your promise to be found, oh

nothing or no one
will ever make me let you down

kiss them for me, i may be delayed
kiss them for me, if i am delayed

it's divoon, oh, it's serene
in the fountain's pink champagne
someone carving their devotion
in the heart-shaped pool of fame, oh

nothing or no one
will ever make me let you down

kiss them for me, i may be delayed
kiss them for me, i may find myself delayed

ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

on the road to new orleans
a spray of stars hit the screen
as the tenth impact shimmered
the forbidden candles beamed, oh

kiss them for me, i may be delayed
kiss them for me, i may find myself delayed
kiss them for me, kiss them for me
kiss them for me, i may find myself delayed
kiss them for me, kiss them for me
kiss them for me, i may be delayed

into the line i see it fine
into the line our hearts entwine
remember when, your time again
remember when, your time again
standing in the light, always sitting on the line
never on a side, always wanting to be right
standing in the light i never wanted to be right
now i'm attracted by the light and blinded by the sight
into the light, into the light
into the light, into the light
into the light i see it fight
into the light a new horizon
bleached into white, kept out of sight
bleached into white, kept out of sight
standing in the light, always sitting on the line
never on a side, pushing out the light
standing in the light i never wanted to be right
now i'm attracted by the light and blinded by the sight
remember when, your time again
remember when, your time again
into the line, i see it fine
into the line our hearts entwine
remember when, your time again
remember when, your time again
dead ahead in the night burning in the light
and knowing that it's right, driving in the night
dead ahead in the night burning in the light
and knowing that it's right driving in the night
remember when, your time again
remember when, your time again
into the light, into the light
into the light, into the light
into the light, into the light
into the light, into the light
into the light, into the light

only at night time, i see you
in darkness, i feel you
a bride by my side
i'm inside many brides
sometimes i wonder
what goes on in your mind, always silent and kind
unlike the others
fuck the mothers kill the others
fuck the others kill the mothers
i'll put it out of my mind because
i'm out of my mind with you
in heaven and hell with you
my night shift sisters
await your nightly visitor
they don't bother me, no
no they don't bother me
the cold marble slab submits at my feet
with a neat dissection
looking so sweet to me
please come to me
with your cold flesh, my cold love
hissing, not kissing
a happy go lucky chap, always dressed in black
he'll come to you, he'll come to you
my night shift sisters
with your nightly visitor
a new vocation in life, my
my love with a knife
fuck the mothers kill the others
fuck the others kill the mothers
i'll put it out of my mind 'cause
i'm out of my mind with you
in heaven and hell with you
i'm out of my mind with you
they don't bother me, no
they don't bother me, no
night shift sisters
with your nightly visitor
night shift
waiting for the night shift
night shift
waiting for the night shift
waiting for the night shift
waiting for the night shift

monitor outside
for the people inside
a prevention of crime
a passing of time
they come and they go
it's a passing of time
they come and they go
whilst we sit in our homes
sit back and enjoy
the real mccoy
our new air of authority
our sentinel of misery
his face was full of intent
and we shook with excitement
then the victim stared up
looked strangely at the screen as if her pain was our fault
but that's entertainment
what we crave for inside
no more second rate movies
from those people outside

the stars that shine and the stars that shrink
in the face of stagnation
the water runs
before your eyes
swallowing diamonds
a cutting throat
your teeth when you grin
reflecting beams on tombstones
a jamboree of surprises
playing russian roulette or the lucky dip,
a clenched fist to your heart
coal dust on your lungs
a silver tongue for the chosen one
heavy magnum in your side or a bloody thorn
skating bullets on angel dust
in a dead sea of fluid mercury
baby piano cries
under your heavy index and thumb
pull some strings
let them sing
the stars that shine and the stars that shrink
in the face of stagnation
the water runs
before your eyes
dazzle, it's a glittering prize
dazzle, it's a glittering prize
before your eyes
it's a glittering prize
the stars that shine
and the stars that shrink
in the face of stagnation
the water runs
before your eyes

the night is still
and the frost, it bites my face
i wear my silence like a mask
and murmur like a ghost

"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet
"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet

the carefree days are distant now
i wear my memories like a shroud
i try to speak, but words collapse
echoing, echoing

"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet
"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet

i wander through your sadness
gazing at you with scorpion eyes
halloween, halloween

a sweet reminder in the ice-blue nursery
of a childish murder of hidden lustre and she cries

"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet
"trick or treat", "trick or treat"
the bitter and the sweet

i wander through your sadness
gazing at you with scorpion eyes
halloween, halloween
halloween, halloween

oh the air was shining
shining like a wedding ring
barbed like sex, i felt 10,000 volts
my chest was full of eels, pushing through my usual skin
i opened up new wounds
pouting, shouting

oh, love like liquid falling
falling in cascades
oh, lovelorn victims
laughing in cascades

the sun was rich, rich with a song of sin
my breath melted my words into strange alphabets
tormenting my tongue
pouting, shouting

oh, love like liquid falling
falling in cascades
oh, lovelorn victims
laughing in cascades

the heartbeats were echoing
echoing the revolver
emptying into my mouth
i pulled a face from my pocket
and smiled a leper's grin
i felt somebody close
oh, pouting, shouting

oh, love like liquid falling
falling in cascades
oh, lovelorn victims
laughing in cascades, ohh
oh, love like liquid falling
falling in cascades
oh, love, lovelorn victims
laughing in cascades, ohh

love like liquid falling
falling in cascades
lovelorn victims
laughing in cascades
oh, love like liquid falling down
i'm falling in cascades
oh, lovelorn victims
laughing, laughing in cascades
in cascades
in cascades,  in cascades

send me forwards, say my feelings
but all the signals send me reeling
jigsaw feeling

one day i'm feeling total
the next i'm split in two
my eyes are doing somersaults
staring at my shoe
my brain is out of my hand
there's nothing to prevent
the impulse is quite meaningless
in a cerebral nonevent

send me forwards, say my feelings
but all the signals send me reeling
jigsaw feeling

five fingers do my walking
ten toes unravel 'knots'
amorphous jigsaw pieces
falling into slots

send me forwards, say my feelings
but all the signals send me reeling
jigsaw feeling

so i just sit in reverie
getting on my nerves
the intangible bonds that keep me
sitting on the verge of a breakdown
of a reaction, of a result

can't beat me, complete me
maybe defeat me
defeat me, jigsaw feeling
defeat me

infinity stretches unlimitlessly
countless days pass by immeasurably
anniversaries gutter in the maelstrom
whirling a snowstorm of lustrous millennium
we couldn't stay together
this couldn't last forever
senses dissolve into soliloquies
flooding ascent in synchronicity
but we couldn't stay together
i knew this wouldn't last forever
forever just one more time then never
this is the last string to sever
on and on
it goes on and on
i could stay wherever
i would last forever
forever just one more time then never
this is the last string to sever
forever never forever
this is the last string to sever
i have lost you for ever and ever
