cat's foot, iron claw
neuro-surgeons scream for more
at paranoia's poison door
twenty-first century schizoid man

blood rack, barbed wire
politicians' funeral pyre
innocents raped with napalm fire
twenty-first century schizoid man


death seed, blind man's greed
poets' starving, children bleed
nothing he's got he really needs
twenty-first century schizoid man

the wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams
upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams
when every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dreams
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?

confusion will be my epitaph
as i crawl a cracked and broken path
if we make it we can all sit back and laugh
but i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes, i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes, i fear tomorrow i'll be crying

between the iron gates of fate
the seeds of time were sown
and watered by the deeds of those
who know and who are known;
knowledge is a deadly friend
if no one sets the rules
the fate of all mankind i see
is in the hands of fools


the wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams
upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams
when every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dreams
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?

confusion will be my epitaph
as i crawl a cracked and broken path
if we make it we can all sit back and laugh
but i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
crying...
crying...
yes i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
yes i fear tomorrow i'll be crying
crying...

the rusted chains of prison moons
are shattered by the sun
i walk a road, horizons change
the tournament's begun
the purple piper plays his tune
the choir softly sing
three lullabies in an ancient tongue

for the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah

the keeper of the city keys
put shutters on the dreams
i wait outside the pilgrim's door
with insufficient schemes
the black queen chants the funeral march
the cracked brass bells will ring
to summon back the fire witch

to the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah

aah, aah
aah, aah

the gardener plants an evergreen
whilst trampling on a flower
i chase the wind of a prism ship
to taste the sweet and sour
the pattern juggler lifts his hand
the orchestra begin
as slowly turns the grinding wheel

in the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah


on soft gray mornings widows cry
the wise men share a joke
i run to grasp divining signs
to satisfy the hoax
the yellow jester does not play
but gently pulls the strings
and smiles as the puppets dance

in the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah
aah, aah

said the straight man to the late man
"where have you been?"
i've been here and i've been there
and i've been in between

i talk to the wind
my words are all carried away
i talk to the wind
the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

i'm on the outside looking inside
what do i see?
much confusion, disillusion
all around me

i talk to the wind
my words are all carried away
i talk to the wind
the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

you don't possess me, don't impress me
just upset my mind
can't instruct me or conduct me
just use up my time

i talk to the wind
my words are all carried away
i talk to the wind
the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear


i talk to the wind
my words are all carried away
i talk to the wind
the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

said the straight man to the late man
"where have you been?"
i've been here and i've been there
and i've been in between

sundown dazzling day
gold through my eyes
but my eyes turned within
only see

starless and
bible black

old friend charity
cruel twisted smile
and the smile signals emptiness
for me

starless and
bible black

ice blue silver sky
fades into grey
to a grey hope that all yearns
to be

starless and
bible black

call her moonchild
dancing in the shallows of a river
lonely moonchild
dreaming in the shadows of a willow

talking to the trees of the cobweb strange
sleeping on the steps of a fountain
waving silver wands to the night-bird's song
waiting for the sun on the mountain

she's a moonchild
gathering the flowers in a garden
lovely moonchild
drifting in the echoes of the hours

sailing on the wind in a milk white gown
dropping circle stones on a sun dial
playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn
waiting for a smile from a sun child

plato's spawn cold ivied eyes
snare truth in bone and globe
harlequins coin pointless games
sneer jokes in parrot's robe
two women weep, dame scarlet screen
sheds sudden theatre rain
whilst dark in dream the midnight queen
knows every human pain

in air, fire, earth and water
world on the scales
air, fire, earth and water
balance of change
world on the scales, on the scales

bishop's kings spin judgement's blade
scratch "faith" on nameless graves
harvest hags hoard ash and sand
rack rope and chain for slaves
who fireside fear fermented words
then rear to spoil the feast
whilst in the aisle the mad man smiles
to him it matters least

heroes' hands drain stones of blood
to whet the scaling knife
magi blind with vision's light
net death in dread of life
their children kneel in jesus till
they learn the price of nails
whilst all around our mother earth
waits balanced on the scales

i do remember one thing
it took hours and hours but..
by the time i was done with it
i was so involved, i didn't know what to think
i carried it around with me for days and days..
playing little games
like not looking at it for a whole day
and then, looking at it
to see if i still liked it
i did

i repeat myself when under stress
i repeat myself when under stress
i repeat myself when under stress
i repeat myself when under stress
i repeat-
the more i look at it
the more i like it
heh, i do think it's good
the fact is...
no matter how closely i study it
no matter how i take it apart
no matter how i'll break it down
it remains consistent
i wish you were here to see it!

i like it

thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet

thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet

well, first of all
i couldn't even see his face
i couldn't see his face
he was holding a gun against me, and-
umm
i was thinking
this is a dangerous place
oh, this is a dangerous place

thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet
thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet
thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet
thela hun ginjeet, thela hun ginjeet

i said, "i'm nervous as hell from this stuff
i thought those guys were going to kill me for sure
they ganged up on me like that
i couldn't believe it
i mean, look, i'm still shakin'
it's weird
there out in the streets like that, ok
it's a dangerous place, it's a dangerous place
so, suddenly, these two guys appear in front of me
they stopped real aggressive
start at me, you know
"what's that?" "what's that on that tape?"
"yo, what do you got there?"
i said, "huh?"
they said, "what are you talking into that for?"
i said, "it's just a tape, you know"
they said "well play it for me", i said "oh, no", ha ha
i put it off as long as i could
and finally they turned it on, you know
they grabbed it from me, took it away from me, turned it on
and it said, "he held a gun in his hand. this is a dangerous place."
they said, "what dangerous place?" "what gun?" "you're a policeman!"
the deeper i talked, the worse i got into it
i talked, i told him... i said, "look man, i'm not talkin'...."
it went on forever
anyway, i finally unbuttoned my shirt, and said
"look, look... i'm in this band here, you know, i'm in this band you know
and we're makin' a recording, you know
it's just about new york city, it's about crime in the streets..."
the explanation was going nowhere, but
finally, they just kinda let me go, i don't know why
so i walk around the corner, i'm like shakin' like a leaf now
and i thought, "this is a dangerous place once again, you know."
ugh, who should appear, but two policemen
ha ha ha, ah ha ha!

tears of joy at the birth of a brother
never alone from that time
sixteen years through knife fights and danger
strangely why his life, not mine?

west-side skyline crying
fallen angel dying
risk a life to make a dime

lifetimes spent on the streets of a city
make us the people we are
switchblade stings in one tenth of a moment
better get back to the car

fallen angel
fallen angel


fallen angel
fallen angel

west-side skyline crying
fallen angel dying
life expiring in the...

snow white side streets of cold new york city
stained with his blood, it all went wrong
sick and tired, blue, wicked and wild
god only knows for how long

fallen angel
fallen angel

still by the window pane
pain like the rain that's falling

she waits in the air

they have their cross to share
three of a perfect pair

he has his contradicting views
she has her cyclothymic moods
they make a study in despair

keeps it complicated (complicated)
keeps it aggravated (aggravated)
and full of this hopelessness
what a perfect mess

health-food faggot with a bartered bride
likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride
once had a friend with a cloven foot
once he called the tune in a chequered suit

great deceiver!

in the door on the floor in a paper bag
there's a shoe-shine boy with a gin-shop slag
she raised him up and she called him son
and she canonised the ground that he walked upon

great deceiver!

cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the virgin mary
cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the virgin mary
cigarettes, ice cream
cadillacs, blue jeans

in the night he's a star in the milky way
he's a man of the world by the light of day
a golden smile and a proposition
and the breath of god smells of sweet sedition

great deceiver!

sing hymns, make love, get high, fall dead
he'll bring his perfume to your bed
he'll charm your life 'til the cold wind blows
then he'll sell your dreams to a picture show

cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the virgin mary

camel hair, brylcreem, drop a glass full of antique sherry

earth, stream and tree, encircled by sea
waves sweep the sand from my island
my sunsets fade, field and glade
wait only for rain, grain after grain
love erodes my high weathered walls
which fend off the tide
cradle the wind to my island

gaunt granite climbs where gulls wheel and glide
mournfully cry o'er my island
my dawn bride's veil damp and pale
dissolves in the sun, love's web is spun
cats prowl, mice run
wreathe snatch-hand briars where owls know my eyes
violet skies touch my island, touch me

beneath the wind turned wave
infinite peace
islands join hands
'neathe heaven's sea


beneath the wind turned wave
infinite peace
islands join hands
'neathe heaven's sea

dark harbour quays like fingers of stone
hungrily reach from my island
clutch sailor's words, pearls and gourds
are strewn on my shore
equal in love bound in circles
earth, stream and tree return to the sea
waves sweep the sand from my island, from me

beneath the wind turned wave
infinite peace
islands join hands
'neathe heaven's sea


it has a number of high spots - i enjoyed it this time
what are we going to do, do it twice more
once with the oboe, once without it
and then, we've finished for the evening
right
 nine o' clock
three
one, two, three, two, two, three

doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo

your admirers in the street
got to hoot and stamp their feet
in the heat from your physique
as you twinkle by in moccasin sneakers
and i thought my heart would break
when you doubled up the stake
with your fingers all a-shake
you could never tell a winner from a snake

easy money

with your figure and your face
strutting out at every race
throw a glass around the place
show the colour of your crimson suspenders
we could take the money home
sit around the family throne
my old dog could chew his bone
for two weeks we could appease the almighty

easy money

...d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo
doo da de dow dow, da di de dow, d-dow, doo doo doo!

your admirers in the street
got to hoot and stamp their feet
in the heat from your physique
as you twinkle by in moccasin sneakers
got no truck with the la-di-da
keep my bread in an old fruit jar
drive you out in a motor-car
getting fat on your lucky star

just making easy money
(laughter)

farewell the temple master's bells
his kiosk and his black worm seed
courtship solely of his word
with eden guaranteed
for now prince rupert's tears of glass
make saffron sabbath eyelids bleed
scar the sacred tablet wax
on which the lizards feed

wake your reason's hollow vote
wear your blizzard season coat
burn a bridge and burn a boat
stake a lizard by the throat

go polonius or kneel
the reapers name their harvest dawn
all your tarnished devil's spoons
will rust beneath our corn
now bears prince rupert's garden roam
across his rain tree shaded lawn
lizard bones become the clay
and there a swan is born

wake your reason's hollow vote
wear your blizzard season coat
burn a bridge and burn a boat
stake a lizard by the throat

gone soon piepowder's moss-weed court
round which upholstered lizards sold
visions to their leaden flock
of rainbows' ends and gold
now tales prince rupert's peacock brings
of walls and trumpets thousand fold
prophets chained for burning masks
and reels of dreams unrolled...





night enfolds her cloak of holes
around the river meadow
old moon-light stalks by broken ploughs
hides spokeless wheels in shadow
sentries lean on thorn wood spears
blow on their hands, stare eastwards

burnt with dream and taut with fear
dawn's misty shawl upon them
three hills apart great armies stir
spit oath and curse as day breaks
forming lines of horse and steel
by even yards march forward

pan american nightmare
ten thousand feet fun-fair
convinced that i don't care
safe as houses i swear
i was just sitting musing
the virtues of cruising
when altitude dropping
my ears started popping

one more red nightmare

sweat beginning to pour down
my neck as i turned round
i heard fortune shouting
get off of this outing
a farewell swan song — see
you know how turbulence can be
the stewardess made me
but the captain forbade me

one more red nightmare

reality stirred me
my angel had heard me
the prayer had been answered
a reprieve had been granted
the dream was now broken
though rudely awoken
really safe and sound
asleep on the greyhound

one more red nightmare

if i only could deceive you
forgetting the game
every time i try to leave you
you laugh just the same
'cause my wheels never touch the road
and the jumble of lies we told
just returns to my back to weigh me down

we lay cards upon the table
the backs of our hands
and i swear i like your people
the boys in the band
reminiscences gone astray
coming back to enjoy the fray
in a tangle of night and daylight sounds


all completeness in the morning
asleep on your side
i'll be waking up the crewmen
banana-boat ride
she responds like a limousine
brought alive on the silent screen
to the shuddering breath of yesterday

there's the succour of the needy
incredible scenes
i'll believe you in the future
your life and death dreams
as the cavalry of despair
takes a stand in the lady's hair
for the favour of making sweet sixteen

you make my life and times
a book of bluesy saturdays
and i have to choose
