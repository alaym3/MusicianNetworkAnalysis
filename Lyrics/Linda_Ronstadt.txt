i feel so bad i got a worried mind
i'm so lonesome all the time
since i left my baby behind
on blue bayou

saving nickels, saving dimes
working till the sun don't shine
looking forward to happier times
on blue bayou

i'm going back someday
come what may
to blue bayou
where the folks are fine
and the world is mine
on blue bayou

where those fishing boats
with their sails afloat
if i could only see
that familiar sunrise
through sleepy eyes
how happy i'd be
gonna see my baby again
gonna be with some of my friends
maybe i'll feel better again
on blue bayou

saving nickels saving dimes
working till the sun don't shine
looking forward to happier times
on blue bayou

i'm going back someday
come what may
to blue bayou
where the folks are fine
and the world is mine
on blue bayou

where those fishing boats
with their sails afloat
if i could only see
that familiar sunrise
through sleepy eyes
how happy i'd be

oh that boy of mine
by my side
the silver moon
and the evening tide
oh some sweet day
gonna take away
this hurting inside

well i'll never be blue
my dreams come true
on blue bayou 

feeling better now that we're through
feeling better cause i'm over you
i learned my lesson, it left a scar
now i see how you really are

you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good
i'm gonna say it again
you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good

i broke a heart that's gentle and true
well i broke a heart over someone like you
i'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
i wouldn't blame him if he said to me

you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good
i'm gonna say it again
you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good

i'm turning you down baby and i'm going my way
forget about you baby cause i'm leaving to stay

you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good
i'm gonna say it again
you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good

oh, oh no
you're no good
you're no good
you're no good
baby you're no good
 

look at this face
i know the years are showing
look at this life
i still don't know where it's going

i don't know much
but i know i love you
and that may be all i need to know

look at these eyes
they never seen what matters
look at these
dreams so beaten and so battered

i don't know much
but i know i love you
and that may be all i need to know

so many questions still left unanswered
so much i've never broken through
and when i feel you near me, sometimes i see so clearly
that only truth i'll never know is me and you
look at this man
so blessed with inspiration
look at this soul
still searching for salvation

i don't know much
but i know i love you
and that may be
all i need to know


i don't know much
but i know i love you
and that may be
all i need to know

i don't know much
but i know i love you
and that may be all there is to know 

people try to rape me
always think i'm crazy
make me burn the candle right down
baby i can't stay
i don't need your jewels in my frown
now all you women are low-down gamblers
cheating like i don't know how
baby i go crazy
there's fever in the funkhouse now
well this low-down bitching
got my poor feet a-itching
can't you see the deuce is still wild
baby get it straight
you got to roll me
and call me the tumbling dice
always in a hurry
never stop to worry
can't see the time passing by
honey got no money
i'm sixes and sevens and nines
well hey now baby i'm the rank outsider
you can be my partner in crime
baby get it straight
you got to roll me
call me the tumbling dice
i said my my my
i'm the lone crapshooter
playing the field every night
baby get it straight
you got to roll me
call me the tumbling dice
you got to roll me
babe you got to roll me
babe you got to roll me
oh oh oh you got to roll me
woo hoo hoo you got to roll me
woah babe you got to roll me
baby babe you got to roll me 

i been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
i'm drunk and dirty, don't you know
but i'm still willin'
out on the road late last night
i'd see my pretty alice in every headlight
alice, dallas alice
and i've been from tucson to tucumcari
tehachapi to tonopah
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the backroads so i wouldn't get weighed
and if you give me weed, whites and wine
and you show me a sign
and i'll be willin' to be movin'
and i've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
had my head stove in but i'm still on my feet
and i'm still willin'
and i smuggled some smokes and folks from mexico
baked by the sun every time i go to mexico
ah but i'm still...
and i've been from tucson to tucumcari
tehachapi to tonopah
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the backroads so i wouldn't get weighed
and if you give me weed, whites and wine
and you show me a sign
and i'll be willin' to be movin' 

somewhere out there
beneath the pale moonlight
someone's thinking of me
and loving me tonight

somewhere out there
someone's saying a prayer
that we'll find one another
in that big somewhere out there

and even though i know how very far apart we are
it helps to think we might be wishing
on the same bright star
and when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
it helps to think we're sleeping
underneath the same big sky

somewhere out there
if love can see us through
then we'll be together
somewhere out there
out where dreams come true

and even though i know how very far apart we are
it helps to think we might be wishing
on the same bright star
and when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
it helps to think we're sleeping
underneath the same big sky

somewhere out there
if love can see us through
then we'll be together
somewhere out there
out where dreams come true 

they say that love's a gentle thing
but it's only brought me pain
for the only man i ever loved
has gone on the mornin' train

i never will marry
i'll be no man's wife
i expect to live single
all the days of my life

well, the train pulled out, the whistle blew
with a long and a lonesome moan
he's gone, he's gone like the mornin' dew
and left me all alone

i never will marry
i'll be no man's wife
i expect to live single
all the days of my life

well, there's many a change in the winter wind
and a change in the cloud's design
there's many a change in a young man's heart
but never a change in mine
i never will marry
i'll be no man's wife
i expect to live single
all the days of my life 

love will abide
take things in stride
sounds like good advice
but there's no one at my side
and time washes clean
love's wounds unseen
that's what someone told me
but i don't know what it means
cause i've done everything i know
to try and make you mine
and i think i'm gonna love you
for a long, long time
caught in my fears
blinking back the tears
i can't say you hurt me
when you never let me near
and i never drew
one response from you
all the while you fell
all over girls you never knew
cause i've done everything i know
to try and make you mine
and i think it's going to hurt me
for a long, long time
wait for the day
you'll go away
knowing that you warned me
of the price i'd have to pay
and life's full of flaws
who knows the cause
living in the memory
of a love that never was
cause i've done everything i know
to try and change your mind
and i think i'm going to miss you
for a long, long time
and i've done everything i know
to try and make you mine
and i think i'm gonna love you
for a long, long time 

i've been cheated
been mistreated
when will i be loved?

i've been put down
i've been pushed 'round
when will i be loved?

when i find a new man
that i want for mine
he always breaks my heart in two
it happens every time

i've been made blue
i've been lied to
when will i be loved?


when i find a new man
that i want for mine
he always breaks my heart in two
it happens every time
oh, i've been cheated
been mistreated
when will i be loved?

when will i be loved?
tell me, when will i be loved? 

some say the heart is just like a wheel
when you bend it you can't mend it
but my love for you is like a sinking ship
and my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
when harm is done no love can be won
i know it happens frequently
what i can't understand oh please god hold my hand
why it had to happen to me
and it's only love and it's only love
that can wreck a human being and turn him inside out
some say the heart is just like a wheel
when you bend it you can't mend it
but my love for you is like a sinking ship
and my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean 

love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
only grows when it's on the vine
handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
lose your love when you say the word mine
i wanna see what's never been seen
i wanna live that age old dream
c'mon boy, let's go together
let's take the best, right now
take the best right now
love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
only grows when it's on the vine
handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
lose your love when you say the word mine
i wanna go to an old hoe-down
long ago in the western town
pick me up cause my feet are draggin
gimme a lift and i'll paint your wagon
love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
only grows when it's on the vine
handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
lose your love when you say the word mine
love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
only grows when it's on the vine
handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
lose your love when you say the word mine
mine
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose
love is a rose

oh we never know where life will take us
i know it's just a ride on the wheel
and we never know when death will shake us
and we wonder how it will feel
so goodbye my friend
i know i'll never see you again
but the time together through all the years
will take away these tears
it's okay now
goodbye my friend
i've seen a lot things that make me crazy
and i guess i held on to you
we could've run away and left well maybe
but it wasn't time and we both knew
so goodbye my friend
i know i'll never see you again
but the love you gave me through all the years
will take away these tears
i'm okay now
goodbye my friend
life's so fragile and love's so pure
we can't hold on but we try
we watch how quickly it disappears
and we never know why
but i'm okay now
goodbye my friend
you can go now
goodbye my friend

oh, i tried and i tried
but i can't say good-bye
feel so bad, baby
oh, it hurts me
when i think of how
you love and desert me
i'm the broken-hearted
toy you play with
you got me going
i need you, baby
i can't let go
and i want you, baby
i gotta have all your love
i can't let go
though i'm just one
of your lovers
and i know there are
so many others
you do something
strange to me, baby
you got me going
i need you, baby
i can't let go
and i want you, baby
i gotta have all your love
i can't let go
oh, i tried and i tried
but i can't say good-bye
i know that it's wrong
and i should be so strong
but the thought of you gone
makes me want to hold on
you got me going
i need you, baby
i can't let go
and i want you, baby
i gotta have all your love
i can't let go

i can't let go
i can't let go
i can't let go
i can't let go 

desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
you been out ridin' fences for so long now
oh, you're a hard one
but i know that you've got your reasons
these things that are pleasin' you
can hurt you somehow
don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
she'll beat you if she's able
know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
well, it seems to me, some fine things
have been laid upon your table
but you only want the things that you can't get
desperado, you know you ain't gettin' no younger
your pain and your hunger, drivin' you home
and freedom, oh freedom
well, that's just some people talkin'
your prison is walking
through this world all alone
and don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
the sky won't snow, and the sun won't shine
it's hard to tell the night-time from the day
you're losin' all your highs and lows
ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?
desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
come down from your fences, open the gate
it may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
you better let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
let somebody love you, before it's too late 

it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
people tell me love's for fools
here i go breaking all the rules
it seems so easy
yeah, so doggone easy
oh, it seems so easy
yeah, where you're concerned
my heart can learn, oh
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
look into your heart and see
what your love book has set aside for me
it seems so easy
yeah, so doggone easy
oh, it seems so easy
yeah, where you're concerned
my heart can learn, oh
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
it seems so easy
oh, so doggone easy
yeah, it seems so easy
oh, where you're concerned
my heart can learn
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love
it's so easy to fall in love 

i wonder as i wander out under the sky
how jesus the savior did come for to die
for poor on'ry people like you and like i
i wonder as i wander out under the sky

when mary birthed jesus, 'twas in a cow's stall
with wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
but high from god's heaven, a star's light did fall
and the promise of ages, it then did recall

if jesus had wanted for any wee thing
a star in the sky or a bird on the wing
or all of god's angels in heaven for to sing
he surely could have it 'cause he was the king

i wonder as i wander out under the sky
how jesus the savior did come for to die
for poor on'ry people like you and like i
i wonder as i wander out under the sky 

por un amor
me desvelo y vivo apasionada;
tengo on amor
que en mi vida dejo para siempre amargo dolor
pobre de mi
esta vida mejor que se acabe
no es para mi...
pobre de mi (ay corazon)
pobre de mi (no sufras mas)
cuanto sufre mi pecho
que late tan solo por ti
por un amor
he llorado gotitas de sangre del corazon
me has dejado con el alma herida
sin compasion 

there you go baby, and here am i
well you left me here so i could sit and cry
golly gee, what have you done to me?
well i guess it doesn't matter anymore
do you remember baby, last september
how you held me tight, each and every night?
oh baby, how you drove me crazy
but i guess it doesn't matter anymore
there is no use in me a-crying
i've done everything now, i'm sick of trying
i've thrown away my nights
wasted all my days, over you
now you go your way, baby, and i'll go mine
now and forever, till the end of time
and i'll find somebody new, and baby
we'll say we're through
and you won't matter anymore
there is no use in me a-crying
i've done everything now, i'm sick of trying
i've thrown away my nights
wasted all my days, over you
now you go your way, baby, and i'll go mine
now and forever, till the end of time
and i'll find somebody new, and baby
we'll say we're through
and you won't matter anymore
(you won't matter anymore)
no you won't matter anymore
(you won't matter anymore)
no you won't matter anymore
you won't matter anymore 

i don't want your lonely mansions
with a tear in every room
all i want's the love you promised
beneath the haloed moon
but you think i should be happy
with your money and your name
and hide myself in sorrows
while you play your cheatin' game

silver threads and golden needles
cannot mend this heart of mine
and i dare not drown my sorrows
in the warm glow of your wine
you can't buy my love with money
'cause i never was that kind
silver threads and golden needles
cannot mend this heart of mine

silver threads and golden needles
cannot mend this heart of mine
and i dare not drown my sorrows
in the warm glow of your wine
you can't buy my love with money
'cause i never was that kind
silver threads and golden needles
cannot mend this heart of mine
silver threads and golden needles
cannot mend this heart of mine
