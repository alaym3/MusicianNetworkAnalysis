last time that we had this conversation
i decided we should be friends, hey
but now we're going round in circles
tell me, will this deja vu never end? oh

now you tell me that you've fallen in love
well i never ever thought that would be, ay
this time you gotta take it easy
throwing far too much emotions at me

but any fool can see they're falling
i gotta make you understand

i'm giving you everything
all that joy can bring, this i swear
(i'll give you everything)
and all that i want from you
is a promise you will be there
(say you will be there)
ow, say you will be there
a-won't you sing it with me?

if you put two and two together
you will see what our friendship is for, oh
if you can't work this equation then
i'll guess i'll have to show you the door

there is no need to say you love me
it would be better left unsaid

i'm (i'm), giving you everything (i'll give you everything)
all that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
this i swear (yes, i swear)

it's cool but you don't even know me
you take an inch, i run a mile
can't win you're always right behind me
and we know that you could go and find some other
take or leave it or just don't even bother
caught in a craze, it's just a phase
or will this be around forever

don't you know it's going too fast
racing so hard you know it won't last
don't you know, why can't you see
slow it down, read the sign
so you know just where you're going

stop right now, thank you very much
i need somebody with a human touch
hey you, always on the run
gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

do do-do do, do do-do do
do do-do, always be together
ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba
ba da-ba, stay that way forever

and we know that you could go and find some other
take or leave it cause we've always got each other
you know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
you've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

don't you know it's going too fast
racing so hard you know it won't last

do you still remember
how we used to be
feeling together
believing whatever
my love has said to me
both of us were dreamers
young love in the sun
felt like my saviour
my spirit i gave ya
we'd only just begun

hasta mañana
always be mine

viva forever, i'll be waiting
everlasting, like the sun
live forever, for the moment
ever searching for the one

yes, i still remember
every whispered word
the touch of your skin
giving life from within
like a love song never heard
slipping through our fingers
like the sands of time
promises made
every memory saved
as reflections in my mind

hasta mañana
always be mine

viva forever, i'll be waiting
everlasting, like the sun
live forever, for the moment
ever searching for the one

back where i belong now
was it just a dream?
feelings unfold
they will never be sold
and the secret's safe with me

hasta mañana
always be mine

love is blind, as far as the eye can see
deep but meaningless words to me
easy lover, i need a friend
road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
but short term solution ain't no resolution
that ain't no release for me

too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

unwrap yourself from around my finger
hold me too tight or left to linger
something fine built to last
slipped up there, i guess we're running out of time too fast

yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
there's no complication, there's no explanation
it's just a groove in me

too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
but something's coming over me to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

what part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
i want a man not a boy who thinks he can
boy who thinks he can

too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
too much of something we're gonna be living a lie

no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no

listen, little child, there will come a day
when you will be able, able to say
never mind the pain or the aggravation
you know there's a better way for you and me to be

look for the rainbow in every storm
fly like an angel heaven sent to me

goodbye, my friend
(i know you're gone, you said you're gone
but i can still feel you here)
it's not the end
(i gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
so glad we made it
time will never change it, no, no, no
(no, no, no, no)

just a little girl, big imagination
never letting no one take it away
went into the world (into the world), what a revelation
she found there's a better way for you and me to be

look for the rainbow in every storm
find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
you'll always be someone's baby

goodbye, my friend
(i know you're gone, you said you're gone
but i can still feel you here)
it's not the end
(i gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
so glad we made it
time will never change it, no, no, no
(no, no, no, no)
you know it's time to say goodbye
(no, no, no, no)

the times when we would play about
the way we used to scream and shout
we never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

look for the rainbow in every storm
find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
you'll always be someone's baby

goodbye, my friend
(i know you're gone, you said you're gone
but i can still feel you here)
it's not the end
(i gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
so glad we made it
time will never, never ever change it
(no, no, no, no) you know it's time to say goodbye
(no, no, no, no) and don't forget you can rely
(no, no, no, no) you know it's time to say goodbye
and don't forget, on me you can rely
(no, no, no, no) i will help, help you on your way
i will be with you every day
(no, no, no, no) i will be with you every day

she used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
catching me in places that i knew i shouldn't be
every other day i crossed the line, i didn't mean to be so bad
i never thought you would become the friend i never had

back then i didn't know why
why you were misunderstood (mama)
so now i see through your eyes
all that you did was love

mama i love you, mama i care
mama i love you, mama my friend
you're my friend

i didn't want to hear it then, but i'm not ashamed to say it now
every little thing you said and did was right for me
i've had a lot of time to think about, about the way i used to be
never had a sense of my responsibility

back then i didn't know why
why you were misunderstood
so now i see through your eyes
all that you did was love

mama i love you, mama i care
mama i love you, mama my friend
you're my friend
you're my friend

but now i'm sure i know why (i know why)
why you were misunderstood
so now i see through your eyes (see through your eyes)
all that you did was love (all i can give you is love)

mama i love you, mama i care
mama i love you, mama my friend
mama i love you, mama i care
mama i love you, mama my friend
you're my friend
you're my friend

naïvety and childlike left behind
deprived of the goodness of mankind
past encounters have made her strong
strong enough to carry on and on

undress you with her eyes
uncover the truth from the lies
strip you down don't need to care
lights are low exposed and bare

naked
nothing but a smile upon her face
naked
she wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
naked
this child has fallen from grace
naked
don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
naked

she knows exactly what to do with men like you
inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
the mystery will turn you on

undress you with her eyes
uncover the truth from the lies

hello, it's me
i, i thought you'd understand
well maybe i should have kept my big mouth shut
i guess it ain't such a pretty picture
i'd rather be hated than pitied
maybe i should have left it to your imagination
i just want to be me

this angel's dirty face is soft
holding on to what she had before
not sharing secrets with any old fool
now she's gonna keep her cool
she wants to get naked
she wants to get naked

naked
nothing but a smile upon her face
naked
she wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
naked
this child has fallen from grace
