twenty-eight years have come and gone
and she's seen a lot of tears
of the ones who come in
they really seem to need her there
it's a sacrifice, working day to day
for little money, just tips for pay
but it's worth it all
just to hear them say that they care

she works hard for the money
so hard for it, honey
she works hard for the money
so you better treat her right

she already knows
she's seen her bad times
she already knows
these are the good times
she'll never sell out
she never will
not for a dollar bill
she works hard...

spring was never waiting for us, dear
it ran one step ahead
as we followed in the dance
between the parted pages, we were pressed
in love's hot fevered iron
like a striped pair of pants

macarthur's park is melting in the dark
all the sweet, green icing flowing down
someone left the cake out in the rain
i don't think that i can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
and i'll never have that recipe again, again

i recall the yellow cotton dress
foaming like a wave
on the ground beneath your knees
the birds like tender babies in your hands
and the old men playing
chinese checkers by the trees

macarthur's park is melting in the dark
all the sweet, green icing flowing down
someone left the cake out in the rain
i don't think that i can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
and i'll never have that recipe again, again


there will be another song for me
and i will sing it
there will be another dream for me
someone will bring it

i will drink the wine while it is warm
and never let you catch me looking at the sun, yeah
and after all the loves of my life
after all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

i will take my life into my hands and i will use it
i will win the worship in their eyes and i will lose it
i will have the things that i desire
and my passion flow like rivers from the sky
oh, and after all the loves of my life, yeah yeah

you'll still be the one
and i'll ask myself whyy, yeah yeah

someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
and they told the world just how you felt
it must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
they never said your name but i knew just who they meant

whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
i was so surprised and shocked, and i wondered too
if, by chance, you heard it for yourself
i never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you
but they said it really loud, they said it on the air

on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
things are not the same since we broke up last june
the only thing that i wanna hear is that you love me still
and that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when i heard him say
you couldn't find the words to say it yourself
and now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel
'cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
on the radio

if you think that love isn't found on the radio
then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'cause now i'm sitting here with the man i sent away long ago
it sounded really loud, they said it really loud

on the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

(it's over)
if the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

(over, over)

tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:
enough is enough is enough
i can't go on, i can't go on no more no
enough is enough is enough
i want him out, i want him out that door now
enough is enough
enough is enough
that's enough

i always dreamed i'd found the perfect lover
but he turned out to be like every other man
i've loved (i had no choice from the start)
i've loved (i've gotta listen to my heart)
i've loved (tearing us apart)
enough is enough is enough
i can't go on, i can't go on no more no
enough is enough is enough

you must always remember
life can be a challenge
life can seem impossible
it's never easy when so much is on the line
but you can make a difference
with courage, you can set things right
the gift to dream
and make dreams real
is yours and mine
the power of one begins with believing
it starts in the heart
then flows through the soul
and changes the world
imagine how life will be
when we stand in unity
each of us holds the key
to the power of one
each of us is chosen
there's a mission just for you
just look inside, you'll be surprised
what you can do
the power of one begins with believing
it starts in the heart
then flows through the soul
and changes the world
imagine how life will be
when we stand in unity
each of us holds the key
to the power of one
and one by one
we can make the world
a much better place
the power of one begins with believing
it starts in the heart
then flows through the soul
and changes the world
imagine how life will be
when we stand in unity
each of us holds the key
it's inside of you and me
each of us holds the key
to the power of one
the power of one

well he searched and searched for nights and days
till he found the one he loved
and he wrapped her in his arms again
and then he thanked the stars above
that he found what he'd been looking for
and he stared her in the eyes
he said "i love you"
he said "i love you"
love you, love you
she stared him right back in the eyes
with a look of disbelief
then she gazed off into somewhere else
was it real or just a dream?
and she pulled him, oh so close to her
and she whispered in his ear
she said "i love you"
she said "i love you too"
love you, love you, love you
so together they will always be
until the stars fall from the sky
they said "i love you"
yes, i really do
they said "i love you"
yes, i do
i do, i do, i do, i do
so together they will always be
until the stars fall from the sky
so if you find someone you love a lot
you must never let them go
you just hold them tight with all your might
and you say three little words
you say "i love you"
you say "i love you"
you say "i love you"
you say "i love you"

baby please (baby please)
please don't take your love from me (please don't take your love from me)
i am yours forever more (evermore)
'til eternity

think how i'm going to live without you by me side?
but, then i spend so many nights just thinking how you
did me wrong but i grew strong and i learned how to get along
and now you back from outer space
don't turn around
cause your not welcome any more
weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye
you'd think i'd crumble youd think i'd lay down and die
now go now go, walk out the door
don't turn around now cause your not welcome anymore
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
you'd think i's crumble you'd think i'd lay down and die
oh no not i
i will survive
oh as long as i know how to love i'll know i'll stay alive
i 've got all my life to live i've got all my love to give i will survive
i will survive hey hey hey

summer

stranded alone on a sea of emotion
you found me
your love was a light in the darkness
that shone so profoundly
say that youll stay
do not be afraid, afraid
you, youre my breath
the air i breathe
you are my imagination
su le finesse
song of my heart
secrets im not afraid to whisper
con te partiro
ill go where you lead me
wherever you are
forever and ever, well stay
in love together
i will go with you
ill go where you lead me
forever true
forever and ever, well stay
in love together
stranded alone on a sea of emotion
you found me
its you who first found me
come here, come here
put your arms around me, come here
its you who surrounds me
come here, come here
come here, come here
you, youre my breath
the air i breathe
you are my imagination
su le finesse
song of my heart
secrets im not afraid to whisper
i will go with you
ill go where you lead me
forever true
forever and ever well stay
in love together
con te partiro
ill go where you lead me
wherever you are
forever and ever well stay
in love together
