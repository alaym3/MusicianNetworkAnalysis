well, i hope that i don't fall in love with you
'cause falling in love just makes me blue
well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
i had a beer and now i hear you callin' out for me
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you

well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
and i wonder, should i offer you a chair?
well, if you sit down with this old clown, i'll take that frown and break it
before the evening's gone away, i think that we can make it
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you

well, the night does funny things inside a man
these old tomcat feelings you don't understand
well, i turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
i wish i had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you

i can see that you are lonesome just like me
and it being late, you'd like some company
well, i turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
the guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
and i hope that you don't fall in love with me

now, it's closing time
the music's fading out
last call for drinks, i'll have another stout
well, i turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
i search the place for your lost face—guess i'll have another round
and i think that i just fell in love with you

they hung a sign up in our town
"if you live it up, you won't live it down"
so she left monte rio, son
just like a bullet leaves a gun
with her charcoal eyes and monroe hips
she went and took that california trip
oh, the moon was gold, her hair like wind
said, 'don't look back, just come on, jim'

oh, you got to hold on, hold on
you gotta hold on
take my hand, i'm standing right here
you gotta hold on

well, he gave her a dimestore watch
and a ring made from a spoon
everyone's looking for someone to blame
when you share my bed, you share my name
well, go ahead and call the cops
you don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
she said, 'baby, i still love you'
sometimes there's nothin' left to do

oh, but you got to hold on, hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
and take my hand, i'm standing right here
you gotta hold on

well, god bless your crooked little heart
st. louis got the best of me
i miss your broken china voice
how i wish you were still here with me
oh, you build it up, you wreck it down
then you burn your mansion to the ground
oh, there's nothing left to keep you here
but when you're falling behind in this big blue world

oh, you've got to hold on, hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
take my hand, i'm standing right here
you gotta hold on

down by the riverside motel
it's 10 below and falling
by a 99-cent store
she closed her eyes and started swaying
but it's so hard to dance that way
when it's cold and there's no music
oh, your old hometown's so far away
but inside your head there's a record that's playing

a song called 'hold on', hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
take my hand, i'm standing right there
you gotta hold on

you gotta hold on, hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
take my hand, i'm standing right there
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on, hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
and take my hand, i'm standing right here
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on, hold on
babe, you gotta hold on
and take my hand, i'm standing right here
you gotta hold on

you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on, baby
you gotta hold on, girl
you gotta hold on
you gotta hold on

what's he building in there?
what the hell is he building in there?
he has subscriptions to those magazines
he never waves when he goes by
he's hiding something from the rest of us
he's all to himself, i think i know why
he took down the tire swing from the pepper tree
he has no children of his own, you see
he has no dog, he has no friends and his lawn is dying
and what about all those packages he sends?
what's he building in there?
with that hook light on the stairs
what's he building in there?
i'll tell you one thing: he's not building a playhouse for the children
what's he building in there?
now what's that sound from underneath the door?
he's pounding nails into a hardwood floor
and i swear to god i heard someone moaning low
and i keep seeing the blue light of a tv show
he has a router and a table saw
and you won't believe what mr. sticha saw!
there's poison underneath the sink, of course
but there's also enough formaldehyde to choke a horse
what's he building in there?
what the hell is he building in there?
i heard he has an ex-wife
in some place called mayor's income, tennessee
and he used to have a consulting business in indonesia
but what's he building in there?
he has no friends, but he gets a lot of mail
i'll bet he spent a little time in jail
i heard he was up on the roof last night signaling with a flashlight
and what's that tune he's always whistling?
what's he building in there?
what's he building in there?
we have a right to know!

operator, number please, it's been so many years
will she remember my old voice while i fight the tears?
hello, hello there, is this martha? this is old tom frost
and i am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
'cause it's been forty years or more, now martha please recall
meet me out for coffee where we'll talk about it all

and those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
and martha all i had was you and all you had was me
there was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
and we saved them for a rainy day

and i feel so much older now, you're much older too
how's your husband? and how's your kids?
you know that i got married too
lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
'cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature

and those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
and martha, all i had was you and all you had was me
there was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
and we saved them for a rainy day

and i was always so impulsive, i guess that i still am
and all that really mattered then was that i was a man
i guess that our being together was never meant to be
but martha, martha, i love you, can't you see?

and those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
and martha all i had was you and all you had was me
there was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
and we saved them for a rainy day

and i remember quiet evenings, trembling close to you

i had a good home but i left
i had a good home but i left, right, left
that big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
a humvee mechanic put his kevlar on wrong
i guarantee you’ll meet up with a suicide bomb
and hell broke luce
hell broke luce

big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
you pay a hundred dollars just for fillin’ in the hole
listen to the general every goddamn word
how many ways can you polish up a turd
and left, right, left, left, right

hell broke luce
hell broke luce
hell broke luce

how is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
and hell broke luce

i lost my buddy and i wept, wept
i come down from the meth
so i slept, slept
i had a good home but i left, left

pantsed at the wind for a joke
i pranced right in with the dope
glanced at her shin, she said nope

nimrod bodfish have you any wool

and my face was scorched, scorched
i miss my home i miss my porch, porch
left, right, left

my stanch was a chin full of soap
that rancid dinner with the pope
and left, right, left

kelly presutto got his thumbs blown off
sergio’s developing a real bad cough

and hell broke luce

boom went his head away
and boom went valerie, huh
what the hell was it that the president said?
give 'em all a beautiful parade instead
and left, right, left
while i was over here i never got to vote
i left my arm in my coat
my mom she died and never wrote
we sat by the fire and ate a goat
just before he died he had a toke
now i’m home and i’m blind
and i’m broke
what is next

edna milton in a drop-dead suit
dutch pink on a downtown train
two-dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
i'm in the corner on the pouring rain
sixteen men on a deadman's chest
and i've been drinking from a broken cup
two pairs of pants and a mohair vest
i'm full of bourbon, i can't stand up

hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone
hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone

schiffer broke a bottle on morgan's head
and i've been stepping on the devil's tail
across the stripes of a full moon's head
through the bars of a cuban jail
bloody fingers on a purple knife
a flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
i'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
admire the view from up on top of the mast

hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone
hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone
hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone
hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone

yellow sheets on a hong kong bed
stazybo horn and a slingerland ride
"to the carnival" is what she said
a hundred dollars makes it dark inside
edna milton in a drop-dead suit
dutch pink on a downtown train
two-dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
i'm in the corner on the pouring rain

hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone
hey little bird, fly away home
your house is on fire, your children are alone

hey charlie, i'm pregnant and living on 9th street
right above a dirty bookstore off euclid avenue
and i stopped takin' dope, and i quit drinkin' whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone and works out at the track

he says that he loves me even though it's not his baby
he says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin' every saturday night

and hey charlie, i think about you every time i pass a fillin' station
on account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair
and i still have that record of little anthony and the imperials
but someone stole my record player--now, how do you like that?

hey charlie, i almost went crazy after mario got busted
i went back to omaha to live with my folks
but everyone i used to know was either dead or in prison
so i came back to minneapolis, this time i think i'm gonna stay

hey charlie, i think i'm happy for the first time since my accident
i wish i had all the money we used to spend on dope
i'd buy me a used car lot, and i wouldn't sell any of 'em
i'd just drive a different car every day, dependin' on how i feel

hey charlie, for chrissakes, if you want to know the truth of it
i don't have a husband, he don't play the trombone
i need to borrow money to pay this lawyer, and charlie, hey
i'll be eligible for parole come valentine's day

well, my time went so quickly
i went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five
as i pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
god knows i was feeling alive

now the sun's coming up
i'm riding with lady luck
freeway cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just a-wishing i'd stayed a little longer
oh lord, let me tell you that the feeling getting stronger

and it's six in the morning
gave me no warning, i had to be on my way
well, there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights all a-flashin'
i'm on my way home from your place

and now the sun's coming up
i'm riding with lady luck
freeway cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just a-wishing i'd stayed a little longer
oh lord, let me tell you the feeling getting stronger

and my time went so quickly
i went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five
as i pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
god knows i was feeling alive

and now the sun's coming up
i'm riding with lady luck
freeway cars and trucks
freeway cars and trucks
freeway cars and trucks

outside another yellow moon
punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
i climb through the window and down to the street
i'm shining like a new dime
the downtown trains are full
with all those brooklyn girls
they try so hard to break out of their little worlds

you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
they have nothing that will ever capture your heart
they're just thorns without the rose
be careful of them in the dark
oh if i was the one you chose to be your only one
oh baby can't you hear me now?
can't you hear me now?

will i see you tonight
on a downtown train?
every night its just the same
you leave me lonely, now

i know your window and i know it's late
i know your stairs and your doorway
i walk down your street and past your gate
i stand by the light at the four-way
you watch 'em as they fall
oh baby, they all have heart attacks
they stay at the carnival
but they'll never win you back

will i see you tonight
on a downtown train?
where every night, every night is just the same
oh baby
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train?
all of my dreams just fall like rain
oh, baby, on a downtown train


will i see you tonight
on a downtown train?
where every night, every night is just the same
oh baby

on a downtown train?
all of my dreams just fall like rain

and i'm goin' out west
where they'll appreciate me

sane, sane, they're all insane
the fireman's blind, the conductor's lame
a cincinnati jacket and a sad luck dame
hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
clap hands
clap hands
clap hands

said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
moon in the window and a bird on the pole
we can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
clap hands
clap hands
clap hands
clap hands
said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
goin' up to harlem with a pistol in his jeans
a fifty dollar bill inside of paladin's hat

well you play that tarantella, all the hounds will start to roar
the boys all go to hell and then the cubans hit the floor
they drive along the pipeline, they tango till they're sore
they take apart their nightmares and they leave 'em by the door

let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
i'll tell you all my secrets, but i lie about my past
and send me off to bed forevermore

make sure they play my theme song, i guess daisies will have to do
just get me to new orleans and paint shadows on the pews
turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down
put my clarinet beneath your bed till i get back in town

let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
i'll tell you all my secrets, but i lie about my past
and send me off to bed forevermore

just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll
wave the flag on cadillac day and a skillet on the wall
cut me a switch or hold your breath till the sun goes down
write my name on the hood, send me off to another town

and just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
tell you all my secrets, but i lie about my past
will you send me off to bed forevermore?
fall out of the window with confetti in my hair

we sail tonight for singapore
we’re all as mad as hatters here
i’ve fallen for a tawny moor
took off to the land of nod
drank with all the chinamen
walked the sewers of paris
i danced along a colored wind
dangled from a rope of sand
you must say goodbye to me
we sail tonight for singapore
don’t fall asleep while you’re ashore
cross your heart and hope to die
when you hear the children cry
let marrow bone and cleaver choose
while making feet for children’s shoes
through the alley, back from hell
when you hear that steeple bell
you must say goodbye to me
wipe him down with gasoline
till his arms are hard and mean
from now on, boys, this iron boat’s your home
so heave away, boys
we sail tonight for singapore
take your blankets from the floor
wash your mouth out by the door
the whole town is made of iron ore
every witness turns to steam
they all become italian dreams
fill your pockets up with earth
get yourself a dollar’s worth
away boys, away boys, heave away
the captain is a one-armed dwarf
he’s throwing dice along the wharf
in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king
so take this ring
we sail tonight for singapore
we’re all as mad as hatters here
i’ve fallen for a tawny moor
took off to the land of nod
drank with all the chinamen
walked the sewers of paris
i danced along a colored wind
dangled from a rope of sand
you must say goodbye to me

the smart money's on harlow
and the moon is in the street
and the shadow boys
are breakin' all the laws
oh and it's east of east st. louis
and the wind is making speeches
and the rain sounds
like a round of applause
and napoleon is weeping
in a carnival saloon
his invisible fiancée
is in the mirror
and the band is goin' home
it's raining hammers
it's raining nails
it's true there's nothing
left for him down here
and it's time time time
and it is time
and it's time
and it's time time
that you love
and it's time time time
and they all pretend they're orphans
and their memory's like a train
you can see them getting
smaller as they pull away
oh and the things you can't remember
tell the things you can't forget
that history puts a saint
in every dream
oh she said she'd stick around
till the bandages came off
but these mama's boys
just don't know when to quit
and matilda asks the sailors
are those dreams or are those prayers
close your eyes son and this won't hurt a bit
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time that you love
and it's time time time
oh and things are pretty lousy
for the calendar girls
the boys just dive right off the cars
and splash into the street
oh and when she's on a roll
she pulls a razor from her boot
and a thousand pigeons
fall around her feet
so put a candle in the window
and a kiss upon my lips
as the dish outside the window
fills with rain
oh and just like a stranger
with the weeds in your heart
pay the fiddler off
till i come back again
and it's time time time
and it is time time time
and it's time time time that you love
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it is time time time
and it's time time time that you love
and it's time time time

inside a broken clock
splashing the wine
with all the rain dogs
taxi, we'd rather walk
huddle a doorway with the rain dogs
for i am a rain dog too
oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
for it was all ripe for dreaming
oh, how we danced away all of the lights
we've always been out of our minds
the rum pours strong and thin
beat out the dustman with the rain dogs
aboard a shipwreck train
give my umbrella to the rain dogs
for i am a rain dog too
oh, how we danced with the rose of tralee
her long hair black as a raven
oh, how we danced and you whispered to me
you'll never be going back home
oh, how we danced with the rose of tralee
her long hair black as a raven
oh, how we danced and you whispered to me
you'll never be going back home

well, when i'm lyin' in my bed at night
i don't wanna grow up
nothin' ever seems to turn out right
i don't wanna grow up
how do you move in a world of fog
that's always changing things?
makes me wish that i could be a dog
well, when i see the price that you pay
i don't wanna grow up
i don't ever wanna be that way
i don't wanna grow up
seems like folks turn into things
that they'd never want
the only thing to live for is today
i'm gonna put a hole in my tv set
i don't wanna grow up
open up the medicine chest
and i don't wanna grow up
i don't wanna have to shout it out
i don't want my hair to fall out
i don't wanna be filled with doubt
i don't wanna be a good boy scout
i don't wanna have to learn to count
i don't wanna have the biggest amount
i don't wanna grow up
well, when i see my parents fight
i don't wanna grow up
they all go out and drinking all night
and i don't wanna grow up
i'd rather stay here in my room
nothin' out there but sad and gloom
i don't wanna live in a big old tomb
on grand street, ooh
when i see the 5 o'clock news
i don't wanna grow up
they comb their hair and shine their shoes
i don't wanna grow up
stay around in my old hometown
i don't wanna put no money down
i don't wanna get me a big old loan
work them fingers to the bone
i don't wanna float a broom
fall in love and get married, then boom
how the hell did it get here so soon
i don't wanna grow up
