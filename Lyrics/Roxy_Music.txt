i could feel at the time
there was no way of knowing
fallen leaves in the night
who can say where they're blowing?
as free as the wind
hopefully learning
why the sea on the tide
has no way of turning

more than this
you know there's nothing
more than this
tell me one thing
more than this
ooh, there's nothing

it was fun for a while
there was no way of knowing
like a dream in the night
who can say where we're going?
no care in the world
maybe i'm learning
why the sea on the tide
has no way of turning

more than this
you know there's nothing
more than this
tell me one thing
more than this
no, there's nothing
more than this
nothing
more than this
more than this
nothing

in every dream home a heartache
and every step i take
takes me further from heaven
is there a heaven?
i'd like to think so
standards of living
they're rising daily
but home, oh sweet home
it's only a saying
from bell push to faucet
in smart town apartment
the cottage is pretty
the main house a palace
penthouse perfection
but what goes on?
what to do there?
better pray there
open plan living
bungalow, ranch style
all of it's comforts
seem so essential
i bought you mail order
my plain wrapper baby
your skin is like vinyl
the perfect companion
you float in my new pool
de luxe and delightful
inflatable doll
my role is to serve you
disposable darling
can't throw you away now
immortal and life size
my breath is inside you
i'll dress you up daily
and keep you till death sighs
inflatable doll
lover ungrateful
i blew up your body
but you blew my mind
oh those heartaches
dreamhome heartaches

now the party's over
i'm so tired
then i see you coming
out of nowhere
much communication
in a motion
without conversation
or a notion
avalon
when the samba takes you
out of nowhere
and the background's fading
out of focus
yes, the picture's changing
every moment
and your destination
you don't know it
avalon
(dancing, dancing)
(dancing, dancing)
when you bossa nova
there's no holding
would you have me dancing
out of nowhere
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon
avalon

turn the lights down (way down low)
turn up the music (hi as fi can go)
all the gang's here (everyone you know)
its a crazy scene (hey there, just look over your shoulder)
get the picture?
no, no, no, no. (yes)
walk a tightrope (your life sign line)
such a bright hope (right place, right time)
what´s your number? (never you mind)
take a powder (but hang on a minute, what´s coming round the corner?)
have you a future?
no, no, no, no. (yes)
well i've been up all night again
party time wasting
it's too much fun
then i step back thinking
of life's inner meaning
and my latest fling
it's the same old story
all love and glory
it's a pantomime
if you're looking for love
in a looking glass world
it's pretty hard to find
oh mother of pearl
i wouldn't trade you for another girl
divine intervention
always my intention
so i take my time
i've been looking for something
i've always wanted
but was never mine
but now i've seen that something
just out of reach, glowing
very holy grail
oh mother of pearl
lustrous lady of a sacred world
thus even zarathustra
another time loser
could believe in you
with every goddess a let down
every idol a bring down
it gets you down
but the search for perfection
your own predilection
goes on, and on, and on, and on
canadian club love
a place in the country
everyone's ideal
but you are my favorita
and a place in your heart, dear
makes me feel more real
oh mother of pearl
i wouldn't change you for the whole world
you're highbrow, holy
with lots of soul
melancholy, shimmering
serpentine sleekness
was always my weakness
like a simple tune
but no dilettante
filigree fancy
beats the plastic you
career girl cover
exposed and another
slips right into view
oh, looking for love
in a looking glass world
is pretty hard for you
few throwaway kisses
the boomerang misses
spin round and round
fall on featherbed quilted
faced with silk
softly stuffed, eider down
take refuge in pleasure
just give me your future
we'll forget your past
oh mother of pearl
submarine lover in a shrinking world
oh lonely dreamer
your choker provokes a picture cameo
oh mother of pearl
so so semi-precious in your detached world
oh mother of pearl
i wouldn't trade you for another girl

if there is something that i might find
look around corners
try to find peace of mind i say
where would you go if you were me
try to keep a straight course not easy
somebody special looking at me
a certain reaction we find
what should it try to be i mean
if there are many
meaning the same
be specific just a game
i would do anything for you
i would climb mountains
i would swim all the oceans blue
i would walk a thousand miles
reveal my secrets
more than enough for me to share
i would put roses round our door
sit in the garden
growing potatoes by the score
shake your hair girl with your ponytail
takes me right back (when you were young)
throw your precious gifts into the air
watch them fall down (when you were young)
lift up your feet and put them on the ground
you used to walk upon (when you were young)
lift up your feet and put them on the ground
the hills were higher (when we were young)
lift up your feet and put them on the ground
the trees were taller (when you were young)
lift up your feet and put them on the ground
the grass was greener (when you were young)
lift up your feet and put them on the ground
you used to walk upon (when you were young)

t'ain't no big thing
to wait for the bell to ring
t'ain't no big thing
the toll of the bell

aggravated
i spare for days
i troll downtown
the red light place
i jump up, bubble up
what's in store?
love is the drug
and i need to score
showing out, showing out, hit and run
boy meets girl
where the beat goes on

stitched up tight
can't shake free
love is the drug
got a hook on me

oh, catch that buzz
love is the drug
i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug for me
oh, oh
oh, oh

late that night
i parked my car
staked my place
in the singles bar
face to face
toe to toe
heart to heart
as we hit the floor

lumbered up, limbo down
the locked embrace
the stumble round
i say "go," she say "yes"
dim the lights, you can guess the rest

oh, catch that buzz
love is the drug
i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug
got a hook in me

oh, get that buzz
love is the drug
i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug for me

ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh, oh
ohh, oh, ohh
ohh, oh, ohh, oh
love is, love is
love is the drug

make me a deal and make it straight
all signed and sealed, i'll take it
to robert e. lee i'll show it
i hope and pray he don't blow it, 'cause
we've been around a long time
just try try try try tryin' to make make the big time

take me on a roller coaster
take me for an airplane ride
take me for a six day wonder
but don't you throw don't you throw my pride aside besides
what's real and make believe?
baby jane's in acapulco, we are flying down to rio

throw me a line, i'm sinking fast
clutching at straws, can't make it
havana sound we're trying
a hard edge, a hipster jiving, ohh
last picture show's down the drive-in
you're so sheer, you're so chic, teenage rebel of the week

flavours of the mountain streamline
midnight blue casino floors
dance the cha-cha through till sunrise
opens up exclusive doors, oh wow!
just like flamingoes look the same
so me and you, just we two, got to search for something new

far beyond the pale horizon
some place near the desert strand
and where my studebaker takes me
that's where i'll make my stand, but wait!
can't you see her holzer mane?
what's her name?
virginia plain

i was dreaming of the past
and my heart was beating fast
i began to lose control
i began to lose control
i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm sorry that i made you cry
i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm just a jealous guy
i was feeling insecure
you might not love me anymore
i was shivering inside
i was shivering inside
i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm sorry that i made you cry
i didn't want to hurt you
i'm just a jealous guy
i was trying to catch your eye
i thought that you was trying to hide
i was swallowing my pain
i was swallowing my pain
i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm sorry that i made you cry
i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm just a jealous guy

i tried but i could not find a way
looking back all i did was look away
 next time is the best time we all know 
but if there is no next time where to go, go?
go, go! go, go! go, go! go, go!
she's the sweetest queen i've ever seen
 (cpl593h) 
see here she comes, see what i mean?
(cpl593h)
i could talk talk talk, talk myself to death
but i believe i would only waste my breath
ooh, show me
i tried but i could not find a way
looking back all i did was look away
 next time is the best time we all know 
but if there is no next time where to go, go?
go, go! go, go! go, go! go, go!
she's the sweetest queen i've ever seen
 (cpl593h) 
see here she comes, see what i mean?
(cpl593h)
i could talk talk talk, talk myself to death
but i believe i would only waste my breath

there's a new sensation
a fabulous creation
a danceable solution
to teenage revolution

do the strand, love
when you feel love
it's the new way
that's why we say
"do the strand"

do it on the tables
quaglino's place or mabel's

slow and gentle
sentimental
all styles served here
louis seize he prefer
laissez-faire le strand

tired of the tango
fed up with fandango

dance on moonbeams
slide on rainbows
in furs or blue jeans
you know what i mean
do the strand
ooh

had your fill of quadrilles
the madison and cheap thrills
bored with the beguine
the samba isn't your scene

they're playing our tune
by the pale moon
we're incognito
down the lido
and we like the strand

arabs at oases
eskimos and chinese

if you feel blue
look through who's who
see la goulue
and nijinsky
do the strandsky

weary of the waltz
and mashed potato schmaltz

rhododendron
is a nice flower
evergreenin'
it lasts forever
but it can't beat strand power

the sphynx and mona lisa
lolita and guernica
did the strand

some expression in your eyes
overtook me by surprise
where was i?
how was i to know?
ohh oh ohh

how can we drive to a movie show
when the music is here in my car?

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio
ohh oh ohh oh ohh

and so it came to be our song
and so on through all summer long
day and night
drifting into love, ohh

driving you home from a movie show
so in tune to the sounds in my car

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh

2:24 - 2:38

it's some time since we said goodbye
and now we lead our separate lives
but where am i
where can i go?

driving alone to a movie show
so i turn to the sounds in my car

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
there's a band playing on the radio
and it's drowning the sound of my tears
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio
ohh oh ohh oh ohh

ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh
ohh oh ohh oh ohh

here as i sit
at this empty cafe
thinking of you
i remember
all those moments
lost in wonder
that we'll never
find again
though the world
is my oyster
it's only a shell
full of memories
and here by the seine
notre-dame casts
a long lonely shadow
now - only sorrow
no tomorrow
there's no today for us
nothing is there
for us to share
but yesterday
these cities may change
but there always remains
my obsession
through silken waters
my gondola glides
and the bridge - it sighs ...
i remember
all those moments
lost in wonder
that we'll never
find again
there's no more time for us
nothing is there
for us to share
but yesterdays
ecce momenta
illa mirabilia
quae captabit
in aeternum
memor
modo dolores
sunt in dies
non est reliquum
vero tantum
comminicamus
perdita
tous ces moments
perdus dans l'enchantement
qui ne reviendront
jamais
pas d'aujourd'hui pour nous
pour nous il n'y a rien
a partager
sauf le passé

you've got me girl on the run around, run around
got me all around town
you've got me girl on the run around
and it's getting me down, getting me down
lady if you want to find a lover then you look no further
for i'm gonna be your only
searching at the start of the season and my only reason
is that i'll get to you
i'll find some way of connection, hiding my intention
then i'll move up close to you
i'll use you and i'll confuse you and then i'll lose you
still you won't suspect me

oh, i was moved by your screen dream
celluloid pictures of living
your death could not kill our love for you
take two people, romantic
smoky nightclub situation
your cigarette traces a ladder
here's looking at you kid
celebrate years
here's looking at you kid
wipe away tears
long time since we're together
now i hope it's forever
ideal love flies away now
white jacket, black tie, wings too
you gave her away to the hero
words don't express my meaning
notes could not spell out the score
but finding not keeping's the lesson
here's looking at you kid
hard to forget
here's looking at you kid
at least not yet
your memory stays, it lingers ever
will fade away never

as they say, two can play
but keep that song away from me
in my time, too much love
has made me sad for so long
i was blind, can't you see
through the long, lonely night
heaven knows i believe
won't you take a chance with me
sometimes i get so blue
people say i'm just a fool
all the world, even you
should learn to love the way i do
i was blind, can't you see
through the long, lonely night
heaven knows i believe
won't you take a chance with me

well, i'm here looking through an old picture frame
just waiting for the perfect view
i hope something special will step in to my life
another fine edition of you
a pin-up done in shades of blue
cause sometimes you find a yearning for the quiet life
the country air and all its joys
but badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price
for just another night with the boys, oh yeah
and boys will be boys, will be boys
they say love's a gamble, hard to win, easy lose
and while sun shines you'd better make hay
so if life is your table and fate is the wheel
then let the chips fall where they may
in modern times, the modern way
and as i was drifting past the lorelei
i heard those slinky sirens wail - whooo
so look out, sailor, when you hear them croon
you'll never been the same again, oh no
their crazy music drives you insane - this way
so love, leave me, do what you will
who knows what tomorrow might bring?
learn from your mistakes is my only advice
and stay cool is still the main rule
don't play yourself for a fool
too much cheesecake too soon
old money's better than new
no mention in the latest tribune
and don't let this happen to you

for your pleasure in our present state
part false, part true, like anything
we present ourselves
the words we use tumble
all over your shoulder
gravel hard and loose
there all night lying
with your dark horse hiding
abhorring such extremes
you're rubbing shoulders
with the stars at night, shining so bright
getting older
but you'll wake up soon and fight
in the morning
things you worried about last night
will seem lighter
i hope things will turn out right
old man
through every step, a change
you watch me walk away

no way, no why
no care, no cry
no way, no sign
so fair, so fine
the way i see it
this relationship ain't right
the space between us
better close it up tonight
no way, no why
no care, no cry
the space between us
close it up tonight
no way, no sign
so fair, so fine

no way, no why

yesterday, when it seemed so cool
when i walked you home, kiss goodnight
i said "it's love", you said "alright"
its funny how, i could never cry
until tonight, when you pass by
hand-in-hand with another guy
you're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying...
dance away the heartache
dance away, tears
dance away the heartache
dance away, fears
dance away...
loneliness, is a crowded room
full of open hearts, turned to stone
all together, all alone
all at once, my whole world had changed
now i'm in the dark, off the wall
lit the strobe light up the wall
i close my eyes, and dance til dawn
dance away the heartache
dance away, tears
dance away the heartache
dance away, fears
dance away...
dance away...
dance away...
now i know, i must walk the line
until i find an open door
off the street or onto the floor
there was i, many times a fool
i hoped and prayed, but not too much
out of reach is out of touch
all the way is far enough
dance away the heartache
dance away, tears
dance away the heartache
dance away, fears
dance away the heartache
dance away, tears
dance away the heartache
dance away, fears
dance away the heartache
dance away, fears

valerie, please believe
it never could work out
the time to make plans
has passed
faded away
ooh, the way you look
makes my starry eyes shiver
then i look away
too much for one day
one thing we share
is an ideal of beauty
treasure so rare
that even devils might care
your swimming pool eyes
in sea breezes they flutter
the coconut tears
heavy-lidded they shed
swaying palms at your feet
you're the pride of your street
while you worship the sun
summer lover of fun
gold number with neighbors
who said that you'll go far?
maybe someday be a star
a fast-mover like you
and your dreams will all come true
all of my hope and my inspiration
i drew from you
our life's pattern's drawn in sand
but the winds could not erase
the memory of your face
deep in the night
plying very strange cargo
our soul ships pass by
solo trips to the stars
in the sky
gliding so far
that the eye cannot follow
where do they go?
we'll never know
