stay away for a day
'til the feeling went away
and the sky was falling

and the rain forgot how to bring salvation
the dogs were barking at the new moon
whistling a new tune
hoping it would come soon, so that they could die

make it look whiter than it seems
paint me over with your dreams
shove away my ethnicity
burn every notion that i
may have a flame inside to fight
and say just what is on my mind
without offending your might

’cause this life is too short to live it just for you
but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
so say what you want
say what you want

i saw her face outside today
weatherworn, lookin' all the rage
took her passion and her gaze and made a poster
now it’s moccasins we sport
we take the culture and contort
perhaps only to distort what we are hidin’

’cause this life is too short to live it just for you
but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
but say what you want
say what you want (say, say)
hey you, the one, the one outside, are you gonna get in, get in?
hey you, the one that don’t fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in?
hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your
broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo?

yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you
but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?

’cause this life is too short to live it just for you
but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
’cause this life is too short to live it just for you
but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?

say what you want (life is too short)
say what you want
say what you want (just for you)
say what you want
say what you want (feel powerless)
say what you want
say, say, say, say, yeah (gonna do)

life is too short

don't sell me no pipe dreams
i wanna live with you through everything
don't sell me no pipe dreams
i wanna live in a kaleidoscope
don't sell me no pipe dreams
wanna be the one to spin the wheel

i know that we can only give
when we have hope
but i wanna live
without any ghosts
can't protect me from nothing
can't save me from the truth
you can't even save me from
you

so don't sell me no pipe dreams
i wanna feel the good and bad in everything
even when it hurts, even when it hurts

i know that we can only give
when we got a little hope
but i don't like the burden
of living with these ghosts
yes, i will hold my head high
when i walk in your parade
but i will always check my gait
i will always watch my gait
pipe dreams
pipe dreams
pipe dreams
pipe dreams
if i can't really know you, i'd rather walk on

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
it's a very popular song

you liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
well, i hate to say, but pop ain't going solo
you liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
but now i'm just too mainstream for you, oh no
you liked me 'til you seen me on your tv
well, if you're so low below, then why you watching?
you say good things come to those who wait
i've been waiting a long time for it

remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you?
be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you?
now that i've flown away, i see you've chosen to stay behind me
and still you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

you say your quest is to bring it higher
well, i never seen change without a fire
but from your mouth, i have seen a lot of burning
but underneath, i think it's a lot of yearning
your face, the colours change from green to yellow
to the point where you can't even say hello
you tell me you'd kill me if i ever snob you out
like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what i'm about
and remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you?
and be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you?
now that i've flown away, i see you've chosen to stay behind me
and still you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

it's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
than to burn in the spotlight (open fire)
turn in the spitfire (open fire)
scream without making a sound (open fire)
be up here and without looking down (open fire)
because we're all afraid of heights (bang, bang)

and remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you?
and be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you?
now that i've flown away, i see you've chosen to stay behind me
and now you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

uh
what they say? what they say? what they say?
what they say? what they say? what they say?

you speak out, all you feel is defiance
all you need is some self-reliance
'cause this world is gonna always try us
and all you wanted was to run for cover
well here's looking to yourself and no other
we're all searching for that special something
and we keep on running

we all have the choice to take the lead or follow
i want to feel the light shine on me

you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
you're going to break so please, don't do it
you wanna spread your wings but you're not sure
don't wanna leave your comforts, wanna find a cure
we're afraid of who we see in the mirror
we wanna let go but it feels too pure
who wants to be alone in this world?
you look around and all you see is hurt
but the light, it always finds us
if we move with a little trust

we all have the choice to take the lead or follow
i want to feel the light shine on me

you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
you're going to break so please, don't do it

a diamond don't define what shine is
i don't need a rolex to know what the time is
you got yours, let me find what mines is
i'm a survivor, look how strong my mind is
i stand on my own, it's all me
regardless of whatever they call me
i'm a leader not a follower
and i'd rather be paid than popular
grind homie, get your dollars up
we're in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
it's the end of the world and we know it all
it's the end of the world
and we know it

you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
you're going to break so please, don't do it

so afraid of what people might say (that's okay)
so afraid of what people might say (that's okay)
so afraid of what people might say (that's okay)
so afraid of what people might say (that's okay)
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
you're so afraid of what people might say
but that's okay 'cause you're only human
you're so afraid of what people might say
you're going to break so please, don't do it 

tú, que pierdes el control, hablando en alta voz
hieres mi corazón
yo, tratando de escuchar, no me puedo explicar
qué extraña sensación

tú no me quieres entender
y me mandas a callar diciéndome
no me debo sorprender
porque así es la realidad de nuestro amor, y yo

no tengo armas para enfrentarte
pongo mis manos, manos al aire
solo me importa amarte en cuerpo y alma
como era ayer

tú, que perdiste el control, te dejaste llevar
por la inseguridad
yo que te he visto crecer, me puedo imaginar
que todo cambiará

hoy, aunque todo siga igual
y me mandes a callar diciéndome
que tienes que dominar o será el final
y yo no puedo así
no tengo armas para enfrentarte
pongo mis manos, manos al aire
sólo me importa amarte en cuerpo y alma
como era ayer
no tengo armas para enfrentarte
pongo mis manos, manos al aire
sólo me importa amarte en cuerpo y alma
como era ayer
no tengo armas para enfrentarte
pongo mis manos, manos al aire
sólo me importa amarte en cuerpo y alma
como era ayer
como era ayer 

i've been high i've been low
i've been fast i've been slow
i've had nowhere to go
missed the bus missed the show
i've been down on my luck
i've felt like giving up
my life locked in a trunk
when it hurt way too much
needed a reason to live
some love inside me to give
i couldn't rest i had to keep on searching

te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez

i've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat
been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings
i've been hurt by my past but i feel the future
in my dreams and it lasts i wake up i'm not sure
i wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right
i needed an answer to end all my searching
te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez

i look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer
i wanna be myself but does the world really need her
i ache for this earth, i stopped going to church
see god in the trees makes me fall to my knees
my depression keeps building like a cup overfilling
my heart so rigid i keep it in the fridge
it hurts so bad that i can't dry my eyes
'cause they keep on refillin' with the tears that i cry

te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez
te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez
te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez 

estuve bien estuve mal
tuve rabia tuve paz
y todo lo que te di
por un tubo se fue
en el cielo me senti
y en el suelo me vi
una vida así
no es posible vivir

quiero sentirme mejor
quiero sentirme mejor
cariño mío sin ti no es mejor
por eso

te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez

no podia hablar
ni tampoco comer
no queria cantar
no sabia que hacer
esa herida sangro
y mis ojos perdí
pero ahora yo soy el futuro de los dos
quiero sentirme mejor
quiero sentirme mejor
cariño mío sin ti no es mejor
por eso

te busqué debajo de las piedras y no te encontré
en la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
hasta enloquecer
pero tú llegaste a mi vida como una luz
sanando las heridas de mi corazón
haciéndome sentir vivo otra vez

you're off beat
so i'm jammin', right?
i see her in the background, i'm like
oh, snap 

i don’t have an actual bucket list
i'll panic and think of places i’d like to go…
greece or alaska for instance
but no bucket list
i can think of things i’d like to do
ride on a hot air balloon for instance
is it bad to make a ‘before i die’ list?
people want to feel like they will surely
do everything before they die that they dream of
but deep down maybe we all know it may not happen
since you can die at any minute
we know for sure it would not be desirable to die
without someone holding your hand
dying with someone holding your hand is more valuable
than going for a skydive, i think
it’s all perspective. all relative
all said and done, wanting someone and not pursuing it
is one of life’s great tortures
we are mammals after all
a first kiss with that special someone
should never be at the bottom of anyone’s bucket list
because life is simply too short
and before you know it, you run out of time

climb a mountain, swim the seven seas
get your body to look like hercules
jump out an airplane with a parachute
fly up and away on a hot air balloon
we don’t know where it all ends
some say it’s almost over, almost over
if this is it then baby why aren’t i on your shoulder?
on your shoulder...

in this lifetime
i want you to be mine
cause i took a long look at my bucket list
and i saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
whoa, i’m running out of time
whoa, i’m running out of time

get on your boots and visit the north pole
try every sport until you score a goal
follow the path of a butterfly
go to ground zero and do nothing but cry

we don't know how much time left we got left in this world
this beautiful world

in this lifetime
i want you to be mine
cause i took a long look at my bucket list
and i saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
whoa, i’m running out of time
whoa, i’m running out of time
and, this is not a dare
not some trick of a daredevil
i’d trade in my wildest dreams
for your forever

in this lifetime
i want you to be mine
cause i took a long look at my bucket list
and i saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
cause i took a long look at my bucket list
and i saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
whoa i’m running out of time
whoa i’m running out of time
whoa i’m running out of time
whoa i’m running out of time

to make you mine (to make you mine)
to make you mine (to make you mine)
to make you mine (mine)
to make you mine (to make you mine, make you mine) 

it's kind of dark in here, i can't see you, ha
it's kind of dark in here, haha, freaky, freaky, i can't see you
it's kind of dark in here, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, i can't see you, freaky

i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl

it's gettin' so lonely inside this bed
to know if i should lick my wounds or say, "woe is me" instead
there's an aching inside my head
it's telling me you're better off alone

but after midnight (ooh), morning will come
and the day will see if you will get some
they say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
well still i turn off the light, turn off the light
they say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
well still i turn off the light, turn off the light
and i say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
'til you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)

i looked above the other day (turn off the lights girl)
'cause i think i'm good and ready for a change (turn off the lights girl)
i live my life by the moon, by the moon (turn off the lights girl)
if it's high play it low if it's harvest go slow and if it's full then go

but after midnight (ooh), morning will come
and the day will see if you will get some

they say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
well still i turn off the light, turn off the light
they say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
well still i turn off the light, turn off the light
and i say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
'til you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)
i'm searching for things that i just cannot see (turn off the lights girl)
why don't you, don't you, don't you come and be with me
i pretend to be cool with me, wanna to believe
that i can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
i'm running, i'm running, catch up with me life
or is it love that i'm looking to find
it's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah

i've been through many things
i've seen a lot of faces
a lot of you bet they peep bagged up by many cases
it ain't my skin it's my will i'm a win
right a will 'til the end
i don't break fo' the bend
then again, y'all done begged bored shooters
in the streets like scooters, to my shakers and movers
exploited for the green
everything ain't what it seems
a different scene lanes leaving 'em with a va lean
it ain't no magic we living up in the real world
real deal represent for my real girls
i know it's lonely at the top and i might fall
as for now, follow the rules and turn them lights off
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl
i really, really want you to see me
so baby, don't turn off the lights, girl

turn off the light, turn off the light
turn off the light, turn off the light
turn off the light, turn off the light
turn off the light, turn off the light
