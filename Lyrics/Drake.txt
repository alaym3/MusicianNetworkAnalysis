i been taught to never loan somebody
what you need right back

clutching they chests like a muhfucka
damn that’s a motherfucker
tell the truth, i don’t listen to you
'cause i don’t like being lied to
and that ship won’t sail
and that wind won’t guide you
daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
like a motherfucking drive-thru
that was back then, man
now my niggas rich enough to do whatever i do

what's up?
been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
with them bitches, i don't get it, you're a star, love
you shouldn't have to deal with that
i'd never make you feel like that
'cause

i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you, what are you so afraid of?
darling, you
you give, but you cannot take love

yeah, i needed to hear that shit, i hate when you're submissive
passive aggressive when we're texting, i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
and influence a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
well, fuck it, we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
you a flower child, beautiful child, i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the seventies on your own
my mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
"who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"
you don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl, what qualities was i looking for before?
who you settling for? who better for you than the boy, huh?

i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you, what are you so afraid of?
darling, you
you give, but you cannot take love

uh, thinking 'bout texas, back when porscha used to work at treasures
or further back than that, before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my momma's debit
a weak attempt at flexing, i'll never forget it
'cause that night i played her three songs
then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
then she start telling me how i'll never be as big as trey songz
boy, was she wrong
that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now it's therapeutic blowing money in the galleria
or beverly center macy's where i discovered bria
landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree
i've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl, i felt like we had it all planned out
i guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how i'm living, i just hope i'm forgiven
it seem like you don't want this love anymore
i'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
but girl, what qualities was i looking for before?
who you settling for? who better for you than the boy, huh?

i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you, what are you so afraid of?
darling, you
you give, but you cannot take love

'cause me, i was tryna find out where i lost 'em at
but maybe i ain't lose 'em at all
maybe i keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
they ain't movin' at all
but when they need a favor, who do they call?
maybe i'm searchin' for the problems
askin' what was said and who was involved
too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
these days feel like i'm squeezin' in 'em
whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
i'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'cause if i run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
no pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?

good god almighty—like back in the old days
you know, years ago they had the a&r men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
but, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
we had the champagne in the studio, of course
you know, compliments of the company
and we just laid back and did it
so we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
because we had a ball
only real music is gonna last
all that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

like i should be less aggressive and pessimistic
like i should be way more nervous and less dismissive
like i should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
like i didn't study the game to the letter
and understand that i'm not doin' it the same
man, i'm doing it better
like i didn't make that clearer this year
like i should feel, i don't know, guilty for saying that
they should put a couple more mirrors in here so i can stare at myself
these are usually just some thoughts that i would share with myself
but i thought "fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
with someone else other than paris for once
i text her from time to time, she a mom now
i guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
i told her she could live with me if she need to, i got a compound
but i think she's straight
'cause she supported since hot beats
right before wayne came and got me out of the back room
where i was rapping with jas over beats that i shouldn't have
in the hopes for the glory
he walked right past in the hallway
three months later, i'm his artist
he probably wouldn't remember that story
but that shit stick with me always
couldn't believe when he called me
you never know what could happen to you
