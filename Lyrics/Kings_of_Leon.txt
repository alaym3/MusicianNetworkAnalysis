lay where you're layin'
don't make a sound
i know they're watchin'
they're watchin'
all the commotion
the kiddie like play
have people talkin'
talkin'

you!
your sex is on fire

the dark of the alley
the breakin' of day
head while i'm drivin'
i'm drivin'
soft lips are open
them knuckles are pale
feels like you're dyin'
you're dyin'

you!
your sex is on fire
consumed!
with what's just transpired
hot as a fever
rattle of bones
i could just taste it
taste it
if it's not forever
if it's just tonight
oh, we're still the greatest
the greatest, the greatest

you!
your sex is on fire
you!
your sex is on fire, ahh
consumed!
with what's to transpire
and you!
your sex is on fire
consumed!
with what's to transpire 

i've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all i see
painted faces fill the places i can't reach
you know that i could use somebody
you know that i could use somebody
someone like you and all you know and how you speak
countless lovers under cover of the street
you know that i could use somebody
you know that i could use somebody

someone like you

off in the night, while you live it up i'm off to sleep
wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
i hope it's gonna make you notice
i hope it's gonna make you notice

someone like me
someone like me
someone like me
somebody

i'm ready now
i'm ready now
i'm ready now
i'm ready now
i'm ready now
i'm ready now
i'm ready now

someone like you
somebody
someone like you
somebody
someone like you
somebody

i've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all i see 

i can't get there on my own
you can't leave me here alone
i’m just trying to do what’s right
oh a man ain't a man 'less he's fought the fight
i could never point you out
waste of space in a faceless crowd
tell me what i have to say
if you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away

when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

one by one i've seen em fall
some just don’t show up at all
i’m just here to fight the fire
oh a man ain’t a man 'less he has desire

and the walls come down
and the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down
you tore out my heart
and you threw it away
the western girl with eastern eyes
took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
now there’s nothing in the way
in the way
in the way
in the way

when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

you tore out my heart
you threw it away
the western girl with eastern eyes
took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
now there’s nothing in the way
in the way
in the way
in the way 

all the way from waco to weho with a rabbit on her chain
drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
she's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

oh, take the time to waste a moment
oh, never ask to be forgiven

tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
he's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
he’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

oh, take the time to waste a moment
oh, facing where the lines are broken
oh, name your price to all this living
oh, never ask to be forgiven


oh, take the time to waste a moment
oh, face it where the lines are broken
oh, name a price to all that's living
oh, never ask to be forgiven 

stranded in this spooky town
stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
floor is crackling cold
she took my heart, i think she took my soul
with the moon i run
far from the carnage of the fiery sun
driven by the strangle of vein
showing no mercy, i'd do it again
open up your eyes
you keep on crying, baby, i'll bleed you dry
skies are blinking at me
i see a storm bubbling up from the sea

and it's coming closer
and it's coming closer

you who shimmy shook my bone
leaving me stranded all in love on my own
do you think of me?
where am i now? baby, where do i sleep?
feels so good, but i'm old
two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll
and it's coming closer
and it's coming closer
and it's coming closer
and it's coming closer 

single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that i'm okay
if i'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

i, i won't ever be your cornerstone
i, i don't wanna be here holding on

all the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone
everything i cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

i, i won't ever be your cornerstone
i, i don't wanna be here holding on
i, i won't ever be your cornerstone
i

watch her roll, can you feel it?
watch her roll, can you feel it?
watch her roll, can you feel it?
watch her roll, can you feel it?
i, i won't ever be your cornerstone
i, i don't wanna be here holding on (watch her roll)
i (can you feel it?)
i won't ever be your cornerstone
i (watch her roll) 

cut open my heart
right at the scar
and loosen up
gonna do what i'm told
go where i'm told
and loosen up
take a shot in the rain
one for the pain
and loosen up

i tried all the way
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me

going to soften the blow
soften the blow
and give it up
i saw the surprise
the look in your eyes
i gave it up
gonna be who i am
be who i am
and give it up
i tried all the way
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me


whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me
it's all better now, it's all better now
wait for me, wait for me 

my motivation has gone too soon
good vibrations all over you
act like you mean it, you mean it
you've got a story you never tell
down in the delta i'm ringing bells
i've never seen it, seen it
back of my mind i'm on my way
i see through smiles on every face
i don't believe it, believe it

'cause i'm a supersoaker red, white
and blew 'em all away
with the kisses unclean as the words that you say

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
miss don't walk away, walk away

the flags are flying across the plains
i've got a secret picking at my brain
i wanna see you, see you
the exit sign is on my face
don't know my home, i don't know my place
i just wanna be there, be there
'cause i'm a supersoaker red, white
and blew 'em all away
with the kisses unclean as the words that you say

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
miss don't walk away, walk away

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
miss don't walk away, walk away

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
i just lay it on the line, on the line

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
miss don't walk away, walk away

i don't mind sentimental girls at times
miss don't walk away, ooh 

get back on track
pick me up some bottles of booze
fickle freshman
probably thinks she's cooler than you

a hay ride at 5
everybody's coming around
so go press your skirt
word is there's a new girl in town

i call shotgun
you can play your r&b tunes
the fellowship time
it always comes a little too soon

the land of the creeps
freshened up from baby faced shave
put your eyes on me
and i know a place that we can get away, ay

just say i want you
just exactly like i used to
'cause baby this is oooo-only bringing me down
home-boy's so proud
he finally got the video proof
the night vision shows
she was only ducking the truth

it's heavy, i know
the black cat with the gift down below
a choke and a gag
she spit up an' came back for more, oh ahh ahh

she said i want you
just exactly like i used to
and baby this is oooo-only bringing me down

she said i want you

i want you
just exactly like i used to
and baby this is ooo-only bringing me down

i said i want you
just exactly like i used to
and baby this is ooo-only bringing me down 

bite your tongue
don't make a scene, dear
everybody's been here least once before
we've been here more
your heart breaks
rolls down the window
i've seen it all go, come back around
and i've heard the sound

the tip of your tongue
the top of your lungs is doing my head in
i say, "love, don't mean nothing
unless there's something worth fighting for."
it's a beautiful war

when i hold
the warmth of your body
there is nobody that i'd rather hold
shattered and cold

the tip of your tongue
the top of your lungs is making me crazy
i say, "love, don't mean nothing
unless there's something worth fighting for."
it's a beautiful war
i say, "love, love – it don't mean nothing
unless there's something worth fighting for."
it's a beautiful war
it's a beautiful war
it's a beautiful war
i say, "love, love..."
i say, "love, don't mean nothing
unless there's something worth fighting for."
i say, "love, don't mean nothing
unless there's something worth fighting for."

it's a beautiful war
it's a beautiful war
it's a beautiful war
it's a beautiful war 

on the lam cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
crushed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
stuck on the line spending all of his time with his back to the throne
with the flash of the round everybody in town said "leave it alone"

just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
your heart will never say so
your heart will never let it go
just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
my heart will never say so
my heart will never let it go

i got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
the truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
don't you think you gotta give
give me something i want
give me something i need

just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
your heart will never say so
your heart will never let it go
just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
my heart will never say so
my heart will never let you go
just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
your heart will never say so
your heart will never let it go
just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
my heart will never say so
my heart will never let you go

just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
so my heart will never say so
and my heart will never let you go 

i see the grass beneath me
i smell the wind and sky
and think to myself
"don't pass me by"
you dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
i see you're crazy and so am i
you bled out red and blue
the boys of nyu, they saw you coming from miles away
nothing is quite as homey
we dive each sunny day
i see you kenny, you castaway

oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore
oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore

bright lights, that make the city
quaaludes on christmas eve
and all the good times, we've ever seen
the roles we play together
the slaps across my face
i face the music
you write the scene
oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore
oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore

my angel hovers over
the light comes crashing in
i know it’s how this here story ends
i'll hang around forever
until you cut me down
all pressed and ready to face the crowd

oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore
oh, don't say it's over
don't say it's over anymore 

what a night for a dance, you know i'm a dancing machine
with a fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene
i get lost in the night so high i don't want to come down
to face the loss of the good thing that i've found

in the dark of the night i could hear you calling my name
with the hardest of hearts i still feel full of pain
so i drink and i smoke and i ask you if you're ever around
even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

see the time we shared it was precious to me
but all the while i was dreaming of revelry

born to run, baby run like a stream down a mountainside
with the wind in my back i don't ever even bat an eye
just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
but the demon and me were the best of friends from the start

so the time we shared it was precious to me
all the while i was dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry
and i told myself boy away you go, it rained so hard it felt like snow
everything came tumbling down on me
in the back of the woods in the dark of the night
paleness of the old moonlight everything just felt so incomplete

dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry 

i'm on the corner, waiting for a light to come on
that's when i know that you're alone
it's cold in the desert, water never sees the ground
special unspoken without sound

told me you loved me, that i'd never die alone
hand over your heart, let's go home
everyone noticed, everyone has seen the signs
i've always been known to cross lines

i've never ever cried when i was feeling down
i've always been scared of the sound
jesus don't love me, no one ever carried my load
i'm too young to feel this old

here’s to you
here’s to me
for all of us
nobody knows
nobody sees
nobody but me 

salty leave, salty leave
tell me the one about the friend you knew
and the last good night that we toasted too
salty leave
stay for me, stay for me
we drank wine in the matinee
and the spotlight showed what it chased away
stay for me

she saw my comb over, her hourglass body
she has problems with drinking milk
and being school tardy
she'll loan you her toothbrush
she'll bar tend your party

kill me, kill me
i called and called, but i can't get through
said he's on his own, but his own is you
kill me
  

chiseled their names in stone
heavy the load you tow
and the red horse is always close
and the fire don't burn below

two hundred miles to clear
chasing a sound i hear
when the call brings them all to tears
and the hopes they all turn to fears

and they're walking around
with their heads in the cloud screaming
must catch the bandit
reckless abandon
rundown and stranded
must catch the bandit

tracks in the dirt for days
sniff out the fire ablaze
and the red door, it seems to sway
and it carries a heavy weight
and they're walking around
with their heads in the cloud screaming
must catch the bandit
reckless abandon
rundown and stranded
must catch the bandit

and they're walking around
with their heads in the cloud screaming
must catch the bandit
reckless abandon
rundown and stranded
must catch the bandit 

see you in the western sky
on the best of nights
out in the dark
you always seem to come my way
come and take your shape
out in the stars
i really wanna know your name
see your face
know who you are, who you are

how did ya find me
how did ya find me
what are you looking for, are you looking for
how did ya find me
how did ya find me
i see your shadow knocking at my door

waiting on the smoke to rise from behind your eyes
take me away
follow me into the wild
with a twisted smile
i can't escape
and now i got you by my side
all my life
day after day
turn to gray
how did ya find me
how did ya find me
what are you looking for, are you looking for
how did ya find me
how did ya find me
i feel your shadow knocking at my door

see you in the western sky
behind your eyes
i can't escape
from the gray

how did ya find me
how did ya find me
what are you looking for, are you looking for
how did ya find me
how did ya find me
i feel your shadow
what are you looking for

how did ya find me
how did ya find me 

i'll be the one to show you the way
you'll be the one to always complain
3 in the morning come a bang, bang, bang
all out of fags and i just can't wait
cancel the thing that i said i'd do
i don't feel comfortable talking to you
unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
then i'll be in the lobby drinking for two

18, balding, star
golden fallen heart

look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
everyone's gathered to idolize me
i hate the way you talk your japanese scream
it's been too long since i left the shed
you kick the bucket and i'll swing my legs
always remember the pact that we made
too young to die but old is the grave

18, balding, star
golden fallen heart
i'm a going to show the way
i'm a going to show the way
i'm a going to show the way
i'm a going to show the way
18, balding, star 

the dance floor's a temptress
can't make out what your saying
but you rub me the right way
with your child-like persuasion

i got my hands in my pockets
and i'm crossing my fingers
she'll find i'm a simple stone
washed up and so slow
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you

i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you

i feel all amiss now
i'm tossed in the scatter
and your eyes keep on shifting
to the boys that don't matter
i've got my hands in my pockets
i'm still crossing my fingers
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you

i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you

i've got my hands in my pockets
and i'm crossing my fingers
i just want to be noticed
i just want to be noticed

i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you 

rake at the moon where the river flows
cut from the cloth of the winter's cold
bound by the voice that no one hears
i've been around in a way for years
stray from the heart the more that you know
all gussied up with no place to go
tableside with one of your dreams
get what you want and not what you need

parlor games and 6 o'clock news
hands of a stranger touching you
wide awake encased in a dream
everything is not as it seems
all your time is heaven sent
days and nights all start to blend
it's not like this town to set you free
the more you look, the less you see

the table's set, the rose is out
you know what this is
miles away from places you have been
the call was made to pull the shades
the start of something new
still nothing makes me feel the way
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do
the ones they say have come here before
all gather 'round the corridor
i can't seem to place your name
know the face that i can't explain
in my mind, you're everything
lips don't move, but voices still ring
the light inside has lost its glow
the more you see, the less you know

the table's set, the rose is out
you know what this is
miles away from places you have been
the call was made to pull the shades
the start of something new
still nothing makes me feel the way
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do

the seasons change
my mind erased
the stars all fade
but one remains the same
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
must i, your grace
unveil the face
only to say
nothing takes the place?
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
you do, you do, you do, you do
