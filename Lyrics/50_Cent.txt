aha! damn, homie

uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
one time

lord forgive me, for i've sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories, filled with sin
over and over again
and again and again and again

when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
see, niggas feared prince and respected preme
for all you slow motherfuckers, i'ma break it down iller
see, preme was the business man and prince was the killer
remember, he used to push the bulletproof bm, uh huh
his hair'll get you seasick, i sat back and peeped shit
the roll with e-z wider, then they ain't get blunted
had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
as a youth, all i ever did was sell crack
i used to idolize cat
hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on pap
how he go out like that?
rumors in the hood was just was snitching
i ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first gsxr
had the 4-runner, the z, the 5 and the 3
used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
from gerald wallace to baby wise, don't be surprised
of how freely i throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
like la and wise, l got shot in the neck, then told his connect
them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
fucking dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

lord forgive me, for i've sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories, filled with sin
over and over again
and again and again and again

that first verse is just a dose of the shit that i'm on
consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's qu'ran
i know a lot of niggas that get dough like bimmy and joe
and prince and righteous from hillside with the mole on his nose
throughout my struggles in the hood, i started learning
life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
man i'ma get cheese like chaz then run through whips like cigar
gamble all the time like country-curly head prince and tah-tah
po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
go against crews like bebo and killers like pappy mason
a lot of niggas i know been corrupted since birth
enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
i know some cats that held down whole complexes like corley wall
together niggas stand and divided they fall
round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
come around here with your rollie, you can get robbed like ocean
lord knows, tommy had laurelton sold
helicopters, rolls royces with louis vuitton interior
might sound like i'm fantasizing, but son i'm dead serious
montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
had money out the ass, he politic like the asian
feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

lord forgive me, for i've sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories, filled with sin
over and over again
and again and again and again

rest in peace to rich and ron, money what they was about, yo
the twins was from queens but got crazy cream with alpo
throughout my time i heard tales of himey, frenchy
jamaican pauly, duckie corley
ronnie bumps and chick... shit
a lot of niggas flow the way i flow
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who i know
writing rhymes is the best way i express how i feel
if i ain't rich by twenty-six, i'll be dead or in jail
coming up i heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
and if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
i'm forgetting lefty and jazz, pretty tony and lance
head lou, mel son, troy and e money bags
in a conversation over shrimp and lobster
at benihana's, heard chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
shout out to clarence and clutch, bob dre, black will
if the flow don't kill you the mac will

lord forgive me, for i've sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories, filled with sin
over and over again
and again and again and again

like the fire needs the air
i won't burn unless you're there, you're there
oooh i need you
like the fire needs the air
i won't burn unless you're there, you're there
oooh i need you

yeah, i need you, i need you to hate
so i can use you for your energy
you know, it's real shit, feel this

america got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
black chukkas, black skully, leather pelle pelle
i tag spit over ramo's shit, i'm a vandal
got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
the women in my life bring confusion and shit
so like nino in "new jack," i holla "cancel that bitch!"
look at me, this is the life i chose
niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
i built an empire on the low, the narc's don't know
i'm the weatherman, i take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
o after o, you know?
homie, i'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
i fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
the penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)
nigga, you get in my way while i'm trying to get mine
and i'll buck you (buck you)
i don't care who you run with, or where you from
nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)

yeah, i don't know shit about gymnastics, i somersault bricks
and black talons start flying when a nigga flip
i cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
man my co-d's call me chef boyar-50
check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
send me them seeds, i'll grow them what they need
them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
and i'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
i sell anything i'm a hustler, i know how to grind
step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
if you analyze me, what you will find
is the dna of a crook and what goes on in my mind
is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
if rap was the block or a spot, i'd be that potent product
now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
and you can locate me wherever that dope be
getting money man

i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)
nigga, you get in my way while i'm trying to get mine
and i'll buck you (buck you)
i don't care who you run with, or where you from
nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)

it's the hustler's ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
the drama means nothing, it's part of the game
catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
i upgrade from dirty "bs" to clean vs
rocks that i copped from proceeds from the spot
i got the energy to win, i'm full of adrenaline
play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
i made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
now i can invite your ass out to my estate
them hollow tips bent me up, but i'm back in shape
pour cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
i'm like the east coast number one playboy b
hugh hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
the feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
racist, pointing at me, "look at niggaraci" - hello

i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)
nigga, you get in my way while i'm trying to get mine
and i'll buck you (buck you)
i don't care who you run with, or where you from
nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle (hustle)

they say this is a big, rich town
i just come from the poorest part
bright lights, city life, i gotta make it
this is where it goes down
i just happen to come up hard
legal or illegal, baby, i gotta make it

i never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
bumps and bruises, i live, i learn
i'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
it's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
homie, i grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
that corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
pure snow, bag it then watch it go
occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
shoot the ball or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
this my regal royal flow, my james bond bounce
that 007, that 62 on my count
i'm a undercover liar, i lie under the covers
look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, i love it''
you're my inspiration, you're my motivation
you're the reason that i'm moving it with no hesitation

they say this is a big, rich town
i just come from the poorest part
bright lights, city life, i gotta make it
this is where it goes down
i just happen to come up hard
legal or illegal, baby, i gotta make it

i gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while i make a move
manuever around the rats and wolves, i'm from the school
of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
i'm trying to stack shit then i go legit
hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
my cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
i'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
all i got is my word, balls and my instinct
i'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
we already on top, i got a bigger plan
no more controlled substances or hand to hand
white collar visions, game changing mission
big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
perfect position, watch me transition
from caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

they say this is a big, rich town
i just come from the poorest part
bright lights, city life, i gotta make it
this is where it goes down
i just happen to come up hard
legal or illegal, baby, i gotta make it

or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
