there's a shadow just behind me
shrouding every step i take
making every promise empty
pointing every finger at me
waiting like a stalking butler
who upon the finger rests
murder now the pattern, must we
just because the son has come

jesus, won't you fucking whistle
something but the past and done?
jesus, won't you fucking whistle
something but the past and done?

why can't we not be sober?
i just want to start this over
why can't we drink forever?
i just want to start this over

i am just a worthless liar
i am just an imbecile
i will only complicate you
trust in me and fall as well
i will find a center in you
i will chew it up and leave
i will work to elevate you
just enough to bring you down

mother mary, won't you whisper
something but the past and done?
mother mary, won't you whisper
something but the past and done?

why can't we not be sober?
i just want to start this over
why can't we sleep forever?
i just want to start this over

i am just a worthless liar
i am just an imbecile
i will only complicate you
trust in me and fall as well
i will find a center in you
i will chew it up and leave
trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me

why can't we not be sober?
i just want to start things over
why can't we sleep forever?
i just want to start this over

i want what i want
i want what i want
i want what i want
i want what i want

black
then
white are
all i see
in my infancy
red and yellow then came to be
reaching out to me
lets me see

as below so above and beyond i imagine
drawn beyond the lines of reason
push the envelope
watch it bend

over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
withering my intuition, missing opportunities and i must

feed my will to feel my moment
drawing way outside the lines

black
then
white are
all i see

lets me see

there is
so
much
more and
beckons me
to look through to these
infinite possibilities

as below so above and beyond i imagine
drawn outside the lines of reason
push the envelope
watch it bend

over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind

feed my will to feel this moment
urging me to cross the line
reaching out to embrace the random
reaching out to embrace whatever may come

i embrace my desire to
i embrace my desire to
feel the rhythm
to feel connected
enough to step aside and
weep like a widow
to feel inspired
to fathom the power
to witness the beauty
to bathe in the fountain
to swing on the spiral
to swing on the spiral
to swing on the spiral
of our divinity and
still be a human


with my feet upon the ground
i lose myself between the sounds
and open wide to suck it in
i feel it move across my skin
i'm reaching up and reaching out
i'm reaching for the random or
whatever will bewilder me
whatever will bewilder me
and following our will and wind
we may just go where no one's been
we'll ride the spiral to the end
and may just go where no one's been
spiral out, keep going
spiral out, keep going
spiral out, keep going
spiral out, keep going

join in my—
join in, my child, and listen
digging through
my old numb shadow

my shadow's shedding skin
i've been picking scabs again
i'm down, digging through
my old muscles, looking for a clue

i've been crawling on my belly
clearing out what could've been
i've been wallowing in my own confused
and insecure delusions
for a piece to cross me over
or a word to guide me in
i wanna feel the changes coming down
i wanna know what i've been hiding

in my shadow
my shadow
change is coming through
my shadow
my shadow
shedding skin
i've been picking
my scabs again

join in my—
join in my child
my shadow's
closer to meaning

i've been crawling on my belly
clearing out what could've been
i've been wallowing in my own chaotic
insecure delusions
i wanna feel the change consume me
feel the outside turning in
i wanna feel the metamorphosis and
cleansing i've endured in

my shadow
my shadow
change is coming
now is my time
listen to my muscle memory
contemplate what i've been clinging to
forty-six and two ahead of me

i choose to live and to grow
take and give and to move
learn and love and to cry
kill and die and to be
paranoid and to lie
hate and fear and to do
what it takes to move through
i choose to live and to lie
kill and give and to die
learn and love and to do
what it takes to step through


see my shadow changing
stretching up and over me
soften this old armor
hoping i can clear the way by
stepping through my shadow
coming out the other side
step into the shadow
forty six and two are just ahead of me

who are you to wave your finger?
you must've been out your head
eye hole deep in muddy waters
you practically raised the dead
rob the grave to snow the cradle
then burn the evidence down
soapbox house of cards and glass so
don't go tossin' your stones around
you must've been high
you must've been high
you must've been

foot in mouth and head up ass
so whatcha talkin' 'bout?
difficult to dance 'round this one
'til you pull it out, boy
you must've been so high
you must've been so high

steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye
when you pissed all over my black kettle
you must've been high, high
you must've been high, high

who are you to wave your finger? so full of it
eye balls deep in muddy waters, fuckin' hypocrite
liar, lawyer, mirror, show me what's the difference?
kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent
now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
when you pissed all over my black kettle
you must've been

so who are you to wave your finger?
who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
you must have been out your mind
weepin' shades of indigo
shed without a reason
weepin' shades of indigo

liar, lawyer, mirror for ya, what's the difference?
kangaroo be stoned, he's guilty as the government
now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
now when you pissed all over my black kettle
you must've been high, high, high, high

eyeballs deep in muddy waters
you're balls deep in muddy waters
ganja? please!
you must have been out your mind

i know the pieces fit
'cause i watched them fall away
mildewed and smoldering
fundamental differing
pure intention juxtaposed
will set two lovers' souls in motion
disintegrating as it goes
testing our communication

the light that fueled our fire then
has burned a hole between us so
we cannot seem to reach an end
crippling our communication

i know the pieces fit
'cause i watched them tumble down
no fault, none to blame
it doesn't mean i don't desire
to point the finger, blame the other
watch the temple topple over
to bring the pieces back together
rediscover communication

the poetry that comes from the squaring off between
and the circling is worth it
finding beauty in the dissonance

there was a time that the pieces fit
but i watched them fall away
mildewed and smoldering
strangled by our coveting
i've done the math enough to know
the dangers of our second guessing
doomed to crumble unless we grow
and strengthen our communication

cold silence has a tendency to
atrophy any sense of compassion
between supposed lovers
between supposed lovers

i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit

immunity, long overdue
contagion, i exhale you
naive, i opened up to you
venom and mania
now, contagion, i exhale you

the deceiver says, he says
"you belong to me
you don't wanna breathe the light of the others
fear the light, fear the breath
fear the others for eternity"
but i hear them now, inhale the clarity
hear the venom, the venom in
what you say inoculated
bless this immunity
bless this immunity
bless this immunity

exhale, expel
recast my tale
weave my allegorical elegy

enumerate all that i'm to do
calculating steps away from you
my own mitosis
growing through division from mania

exhale, expel
recast my tale
weave my allegorical elegy

forfeit all control
you poison, you spectacle
exorcise the spectacle
exorcise the malady
exorcise the disparate
poison for eternity
purge me and evacuate
the venom and the fear that binds me

your veil now, lift away
i see you runnin'
deceiver chased away
a long time comin'

we listen to the tales and romanticize
how we'd follow the path of the hero
boast about the day when the rivers overrun
how we rise to the height of our halo
listen to the tales as we all rationalize
our way into the arms of the savior
feigning all the trials and the tribulations
none of us have actually been there
not like you

ignorant siblings at the congregation
gather around spewing sympathy
spare me
none of them can even hold a candle up to you
blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
but enough about the collective judas
who could deny you were the one who
illuminated your little piece of the divine?
and this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
i'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
your way home

oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down
without you to guide them all to zion?
what are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
other than tremble incessantly?
high is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
you were the light and the way they'll only read about
i only pray heaven knows when to lift you out
ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
you're going home

you're the only one who can hold your head up high
shake your fists at the gates, saying
"i have come home now
fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
it's time now, my time now
give me my, give me my wings"

give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my wings
you are the light and way that they will only read about

set as i am in my ways and my arrogance
burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
you were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
judith marie, unconditional one

daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
difficult to see you in this light
please forgive this bold suggestion
should you see your maker's face tonight
look him in the eye, look him in the eye, and tell him
"i never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one
hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home."

something has to change
undeniable dilemma
boredom's not a burden
anyone should bear
constant over-stimulation numbs me
but i would not want you any other way

just not enough
i need more
nothing seems to satisfy
i said i don't want it
i just need it
to breathe, to feel, to know i'm alive

finger deep within the borderline
show me that you love me and that we belong together
relax, turn around and take my hand

i can help you change
tired moments into pleasure
say the word and we'll be
well upon our way
blend and balance
pain and comfort deep within you
'til you will not want me any other way

it's not enough
i need more
nothing seems to satisfy
i said i don't want it
i just need it
to breathe, to feel, to know i'm alive

knuckle deep inside the borderline
this may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
relax, slip away

chupa minha pica bicha
chupa minha pica bicha
chupa minha pica bicha

something kinda sad about
the way that things have come to be
desensitized to everything
what became of subtlety?
how can this mean anything to me
if i really don't feel anything at all?
i'll keep digging
'til i feel something

elbow deep inside the borderline
show me that you love me and that we belong together
shoulder deep within the borderline
relax, turn around and take my hand

alrighty, then
picture this if you will

10 to 2 am, x, yogi dmt, and a box of krispy kremes
in my "need to know" pose, just outside of area 51
contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
when just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
cutting right angle donuts on a dime
and stopping right at my birkenstocks
and me yelping, "holy fucking shit"
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit

then the x-file being
looking like some kind of blue-green jackie chan
with isabella rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
vanilla chig champa
did a slow-mo matrix descent
outta the butt end of the banana vessel
and hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
and my sweaty l. ron hubbard upper lip
and all i could think was
"i hope uncle martin here doesn't notice
that i pissed my fuckin' pants"

so light in his way, like an apparition, that
he had me crying out
"fuck me, it's gotta be
the deadhead chemistry
the blotter got right on top of me
got me seein' e-motherfuckin'-t"

and after calming me down
with some orange slices
and some fetal spooning
e.t. revealed to me his singular purpose
he said, "you are the chosen one
the one who will deliver the message
a message of hope for those who choose to hear it
and a warning for those who do not"
me, the chosen one
they chose me
and i didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school

you'd better
you'd better
you'd better
you'd better listen

then he looked right through me
with somniferous almond eyes
don't even know what that means
must remember to write it down
this is so real
like the time dave floated away
see, my heart is pounding
'cause this shit never happens to me

i can't breathe right now
it was so real
like i woke up in wonderland
all sorta terrifying
i don't wanna be all alone
while i tell this story
and can anyone tell me why
you all sound like peanuts parents?
will i ever be coming down?
this is so real
finally, it's my lucky day
see, my heart is racing
'cause this shit never happens to me

i can't breathe right now
you believe me, don't you?
please believe what i've just said
see the dead ain't touring
and this wasn't all in my head
see, they took me by the hand
and invited me right in
then they showed me something
i don't even know where to begin

strapped down to my bed
feet cold and eyes red
i'm out of my head
am i alive? am i dead?
can't remember what they said
god damn, shit the bed

overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
such a heavy burden now to be the one
born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
to write it down for all the world to see
but i forgot my pen
shit the bed again
typical

strapped down to my bed
feet cold and eyes red
i'm out of my head
am i alive? am i dead?
sunkist and sudafed
gyroscopes and infrared
won't help, i'm brain dead
can't remember what they said
god damn, shit the bed

i can't remember what they said to me
can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
can't remember what they said
bob help me
can't remember what they said

don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
don't know, won't know
god damn, shit the bed

we barely remember
who or what came before this precious moment
we are choosing to be here right now
hold on, stay inside

this holy reality
this holy experience
choosing to be here in

this body, this body holding me
be my reminder here that i am not alone in
this body, this body holding me
feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

alive

in this holy reality
in this holy experience
choosing to be here in

this body, this body holding me
be my reminder here that i am not alone in
this body, this body holding me
feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

twirling 'round with this familiar parable
spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
recognize this as a holy gift and
celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
a chance to be alive and breathing

this body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
embrace this moment, remember
we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion

angels on the sideline
puzzled and amused
why did father give these humans free will?
now they're all confused

don't these talking monkeys know that eden has enough to go around?
plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
where there's one you're bound to divide it
right in two

angels on the sideline
baffled and confused
father blessed them all with reason
and this is what they choose?
(this is what they choose)

monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they forge a blade
and where there's one they're bound to divide it
right in two
right in two

monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club and beat their brother down
how they've survived so misguided is a mystery
repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
to lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here

cut and divide it all right in two
cut and divide it all right in two
cut and divide it all right in two
cut and divide it all right in two


fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and
fight over life, over blood, over air and light
over love, over sun, over another
fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and

angels on the sideline again
benched along with patience and reason
angels on the sideline again
wondering where this tug of war will end

cut and divide it all right in two
cut and divide it all right in two
cut and divide it all right in two
right in two
right in two

long in tooth and soul
longing for another win
lurch into the fray
weapon out and belly in

warrior struggling to remain consequential

bellow aloud
bold and proud
of where i've been
but here i am

beating chest and drums
beating tired bones again
age-old battle, mine
weapon out and belly in

tales told of battles won
of things we've done
caligula would grin

beating tired bones
tripping through remember when
once invincible
now the armor's wearing thin
heavy shield down

warrior struggling to remain relevant
warrior struggling to remain consequential

cry aloud
bold and proud
of where i've been
but here i am
where i end

warrior struggling to remain relevant
warrior struggling to remain consequential


tears in my eyes
chasing ponce de leon's phantoms
so filled with hope
i can taste mythical fountains
false hope, perhaps
but the truth never got in my way
before now, feel the sting
feeling time bearing down


tears in my eyes

we are spirit bound to this flesh
we go 'round, one foot nailed down
but bound to reach out and beyond this flesh
become pneuma

we are will and wonder, bound to recall, remember
we are born of one breath, one word
we are all one spark, sun becoming

child, wake up
child, release the light
wake up now, child
wake up
child, release the light
wake up now, child

spirit

this guise, this mask, this dream

we are all one spark, sun becoming

pneuma
reach out and beyond
wake up, remember
we are born of one breath, one word
we are all one spark, eyes full of wonder

wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
calculate what we will or will not tolerate
desperate to control all and everything
unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

clutch it like a cornerstone
otherwise, it all comes down
justify denials and
grip 'em to the lonesome end
clutch it like a cornerstone
otherwise, it all comes down
terrified of being wrong
ultimatum prison cell

saturn ascends
choose one or ten
hang on or be
humbled again
humbled again

clutch it like a cornerstone
otherwise it all comes down
justify denials and
grip them to the lonesome end

saturn ascends
comes round again
saturn ascends
the one, the ten
ignorant to the damage done

wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
calculate what we will or will not tolerate
desperate to control all and everything
unable to forgive the scarlet lettermen

wear the grudge like a crown
desperate to control
unable to forgive and sinking deeper
defining, confining
sinking deeper
controlling, defining
and we're sinking deeper

saturn comes back around to show you everything
lets you choose what you will not see and then
drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
spits you out like a child, light and innocent

saturn comes back around
lifts you up like a child
or drags you down like a stone
to consume you 'til you
choose to let this go
choose to let this go

give away the stone
let the oceans take and transmutate
this cold and fated anchor
give away the stone
let the waters kiss and transmutate
these leaden grudges into gold

let go, let go, let go, let go
let go, let go, let go, let go
let go, let go, let go, let go
let go, let go, let go, let go

eye on the tv, 'cause tragedy thrills me
whatever flavor it happens to be like
"killed by the husband"
"drowned by the ocean"
"shot by his own son"
"she used a poison in his tea
then kissed him goodbye"
that's my kind of story
it's no fun 'til someone dies
don't look at me like i am a monster
frown out your one face, but with the other
stare like a junkie into the tv
stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
watches him die
hands to the sky cryin', "why, oh why?"

'cause i need to watch things die
from a distance
vicariously, i live while the whole world dies
you all need it too, don't lie

why can't we just admit it?
why can't we just admit it?
we won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
neither the brave nor bold
nor brightest of stories told
we won't give pause until the blood is flowin'

i need to watch things die
from a good safe distance
vicariously, i live while the whole world dies
you all feel the same, so
why can't we just admit it?

blood like rain come down
drum on grave and ground
part vampire, part warrior
carnivore and voyeur
stare at the transmittal
sing to the death rattle
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie

credulous at best, your desire to believe in
angels in the hearts of men
pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen
shouldn't have to say it all again
the universe is hostile, so impersonal
devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been

we all feed on tragedy
it's like blood to a vampire
vicariously, i live while the whole world dies
much better you than i

"see, i think drugs have done some good things for us, i really do. and if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor - go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your cds and burn 'em. 'cause you know what? the musicians who've made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs."
"today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. here's tom with the weather."
"it's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, that's what it is, okay? keep that in mind at all times, thank you."

dreaming of that face again
it's bright and blue and shimmering
grinning wide
and comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

on my back and tumbling
down that hole and back again (and back again)
rising up
and wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

in, out, in, out, in, out

a child's rhyme stuck in my head
it said that life is but a dream
i've spent so many years in question
to find i've known this all along

so good to see you
i've missed you so much
so glad it's over
i've missed you so much
came out to watch you play
why are you running away?
came out to watch you play
why are you running?

shrouding all the ground around me
is this holy crow above me
black as holes within a memory
and blue as our new second sun
i stick my hand into the shadow
to pull the pieces from the sand
which i attempt to reassemble
to see just who i might have been
i do not recognize the vessel
but the eyes seem so familiar
like phosphorescent desert buttons
singing one familiar song

so good to see you
i've missed you so much
so glad it's over
i've missed you so much
came out to watch you play
why are you running away?
came out to watch you play
why are you running away?

prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye

so good to see you once again
i thought that you were hiding
and you thought that i had run away
chasing the tail of dogma

i opened my eye, i opened my eye
i opened my eye and there we were
i opened my eye, i opened my eye
i opened my eye and there we were

so good to see you once again
i thought that you were hiding from me
and you thought that i had run away
chasing a trail of smoke and reason

prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye
prying open my third eye

i met a boy wearing vans, 501s
and a dope beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
that claimed that he was ogt
back from '92, from the first ep
and in between sips of coke
he told me that he thought we were sellin' out
layin' down, suckin' up to the man

well now, i've got some advice for you, little buddy
before you point your finger, you should know that i'm the man
i'm the man and you're the man and he's the man as well
so you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

all you know about me is what i've sold ya, dumb fuck
i sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
i sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
and then you bought one

i've got some advice for you, little buddy
before you point your finger, you should know that i'm the man
if i'm the fuckin' man, then you're the fuckin' man as well
so you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

all you know about me is what i've sold ya, dumb fuck
i sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
i sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
and then you bought one

all you read and wear or see and hear on tv
is a product begging for your fat-ass, dirty dollar
shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
and buy, buy, buy, send more money
fuck you, buddy
fuck you, buddy
fuck you, buddy
fuck you, buddy

here from the king's mountain view
here from the wild dream come true
feast like a sultan, i do
on treasures and flesh never few

but i, i would wish it all away
if i thought i'd lose you just one day

the devil and his had me down
in love with the dark side i'd found
dabblin' all the way down
up to my neck, soon to drown
but you changed that all for me
lifted me up, turned me 'round

so i, i, i, i
i would, i would, i would wish this all away

prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
begged like a hooker all night long
tempted the devil with my song
and got what i wanted all along

but i, i would
if i could, then i would
wish it away, wish it away
wish it all away
wanna wish it all away
no prize that could hold sway
or justify my giving away my center

so if i could i'd wish it all away
if i thought tomorrow would take you away
you, my peace of mind, my all, my center
just tryin' to hold on one more day
damn my eyes, damn my eyes
damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
if wants and needs divide me, then i might as well be gone


shine on forever
shine on benevolent sun
shine down upon the broken
shine until the two become one
shine on forever
shine on benevolent sun
shine down upon the severed
shine until the two become one
divided, withering away
divided, withering away
shine down upon the many
light our way, benevolent sun

breathe in union, breathe in union
breathe in union, breathe in union
breathe in union, so as one, survive
another day and season
silence, legion, save your poison
silence, legion, stay out of my way

it took so long to remember just what happened
i was so young and vestal then
you know it hurt me
but i'm breathing so i guess i'm still alive
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
got my hands bound
and my head down and my eyes closed
my throat's wide open

do unto others what has been done to me
do unto others what has been done to you

i'm treading water
i need to sleep a while
my lamb and martyr, you look so precious
won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
close enough so i can smell you
i need you to feel this
i can't stand to burn too long
release in sodomy
for one sweet moment i am whole

do unto you now what has been done to me
do unto you now what has been done

you're breathing so i guess you're still alive
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
close enough so i can smell you
i need you to feel this
i need this to make me whole
release in sodomy
have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
and only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

got your hands bound
and your head down
and your eyes closed
you look so precious now

i have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
shit, blood, and cum on my hands
i've come 'round full circle

my lamb and martyr, this will be over soon
you look so precious, you look so precious
you look so precious, you look so precious
you look so precious now
you look so precious
