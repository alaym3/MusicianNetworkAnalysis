born down in a dead man's town
the first kick i took was when i hit the ground
you end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'til you spend half your life just coverin' up

born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a
born in the u.s.a

got in a little hometown jam
so they put a rifle in my hand
sent me off to a foreign land
to go and kill the yellow man

born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a

come back home to the refinery
hiring man says, "son if it was up to me"
went down to see my v.a. man
he said, "son, don't you understand"

i had a brother at khe sanh
fighting off the viet cong
they're still there, he's all gone
he had a woman he loved in saigon
i got a picture of him in her arms now

down in the shadow of the penitentiary
out by the gas fires of the refinery
i'm ten years burning down the road
nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

born in the u.s.a
i was born in the u.s.a. now
born in the u.s.a
i'm a long gone daddy in the u.s.a. now
born in the u.s.a
born in the u.s.a
born in the u.s.a
i'm a cool rockin' daddy in the u.s.a. now

in the day, we sweat it out on the streets
of a runaway american dream
at night, we ride through mansions of glory
in suicide machines
sprung from cages out on highway 9
chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
we gotta get out while we're young
`cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
yes, girl, we were
wendy let me in, i wanna be your friend
i want to guard your dreams and visions
just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
and strap your hands across my engines
together we could break this trap
we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider
but i gotta know how it feels
i want to know if love is wild, babe
i want to know if love is real
oh, can you show me?

beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
scream down the boulevard
the girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
and the boys try to look so hard
the amusement park rises bold and stark
kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
i wanna die with you, wendy, on the streets tonight
in an everlasting kiss
(1, 2, 3, 4) the highways jammed with broken heroes
on a last chance power drive
everybody's out on the run tonight
but there's no place left to hide
together, wendy, we can live with the sadness
i'll love you with all the madness in my soul
oh, someday girl, i don't know when
we're gonna get to that place
where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
but till then, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run
oh honey, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run
come on with me, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run

i get up in the evening
and i ain't got nothing to say
i come home in the morning
i go to bed feeling the same way
i ain't nothing but tired
man, i'm just tired and bored with myself
hey there, baby
i could use just a little help

you can't start a fire
you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

messages keep getting clearer
radio's on, and i'm moving 'round my place
i check my look in the mirror
i wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
man, i ain't getting nowhere
i'm just living in a dump like this
there's something happening somewhere
baby, i just know that there is

you can't start a fire
you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

you sit around getting older
there's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
i'll shake this world off my shoulders
come on, baby, the laugh's on me

stay on the streets of this town
and they'll be carving you up all right
they say, "you gotta stay hungry"
hey, baby, i'm just about starving tonight
i'm dying for some action
i'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
i need a love reaction
come on now, baby, give me just one look

you can't start a fire
sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
you can't start a fire
worrying about your little world falling apart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

even if we're just dancing in the dark
even if we're just dancing in the dark
even if we're just dancing in the dark
hey, baby

hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
did he go away and leave you all alone?
i got a bad desire

oh, oh, oh
i'm on fire

tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
and can he do to you the things that i do?
oh no, i can take you higher

oh, oh, oh
i'm on fire

sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull
at night, i wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
and a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
only you can cool my desire

oh, oh, oh
i'm on fire
oh, oh, oh
i'm on fire
oh, oh, oh
i'm on fire

ooh-ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

the screen door slams, mary's dress sways
like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays
roy orbison singing for the lonely
hey, that's me, and i want you only
don't turn me home again
i just can't face myself alone again
don't run back inside
darling, you know just what i'm here for
so you're scared, and you're thinking
that maybe we ain't that young anymore
show a little faith, there's magic in the night
you ain't a beauty, but, hey, you're alright
oh, and that's alright with me
you can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
waste your summer praying in vain
for a saviour to rise from these streets
well now, i'm no hero, that's understood
all the redemption i can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
with a chance to make it good somehow
hey what else can we do now?
except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
well the night's busting open
these two lanes will take us anywhere
we got one last chance to make it real
to trade in these wings on some wheels
climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
oh-oh come take my hand
we're riding out tonight to case the promised land
oh-oh thunder road oh thunder road oh thunder road
lying out there like a killer in the sun
hey, i know it's late, we can make it if we run
oh, thunder road, sit tight, take hold
thunder road
well i got this guitar, and i learned how to make it talk
and my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
from your front porch to my front seat
the door's open but the ride it ain't free
and i know you're lonely for words that i ain't spoken
but tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
there were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
they haunt this dusty beach road
in the skeleton frames of burned out chevrolets
they scream your name at night in the street
your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
and in the lonely cool before dawn
you hear their engines roaring on
but when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
so mary, climb in
it's a town full of losers
and i'm pulling out of here to win

i come from down in the valley
where, mister, when you're young
they bring you up to do
like your daddy done
me and mary we met in high school
when she was just seventeen
we'd drive out of this valley
down to where the fields were green

we'd go down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh, down to the river we'd ride

then i got mary pregnant
and, man, that was all she wrote
and for my nineteenth birthday
i got a union card and a wedding coat
we went down to the courthouse
and the judge put it all to rest
no wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
no flowers, no wedding dress

that night we went down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh, down to the river we did ride
ah-yah

i got a job working construction
for the johnstown company
but lately there ain't been much work
on account of the economy
now all them things that seemed so important
well, mister, they vanished right into the air
now i just act like i don't remember
and mary acts like she don't care

but i remember us riding in my brother's car
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
at night, on them banks, i'd lie awake
and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
is a dream a lie if it don't come true?
or is it something worse?

that sends me down to the river
though i know the river is dry
that sends me down to the river tonight
ah-yah-yah
down to the river
my baby and i
oh, down to the river we ride
ah-yah-ay

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh

madman drummers bummers and indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
with a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older i tripped the
merry-go-round
with this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope
crashed to the ground

some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
and some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
and now young scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
and some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band

and she was blinded by the light
oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
she got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
he says, "dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least"
and some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
and some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

yeah, he was blinded by the light
oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
he got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me i got what it takes
she said i'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
and go-cart mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
and little early-pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if i needed a ride

oh, some hazard from harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
yes and scotland yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card
he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
well i jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground
asked him which was the way back home
he said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own

and now in zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
and some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
well i unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears i saw
a gap but figured he'd be all right

he was just blinded by the light
cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
woah, but but mama that's where the fun is

i was blinded
oh mama, oh mama
i was blinded
oh mama, oh mama
i was blinded by the light
i was blinded
i was blinded
i was blinded by the light
i was blinded
i was blinded by the light
i was blinded
i was blinded

well, they blew up the chicken man in philly last night
and they blew up his house, too
down on the boardwalk, they're getting ready for a fight
gonna see what them racket boys can do
now there's trouble busing in from out of state
and the d.a. can't get no relief
gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
and the gambling commission's hanging on by the skin of its teeth

well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
but maybe everything that dies someday comes back
put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in atlantic city

well, i got a job and tried to put my money away
but i got debts that no honest man can pay
so i drew what i had from the central trust
and i bought us two tickets on that coast city bus

well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
but maybe everything that dies someday comes back
put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in atlantic city

now, our luck may have died, and our love may be cold
but with you, forever, i'll stay
we're going out where the sand's turning to gold
so put on your stockings, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold

and everything dies, baby, that's a fact
but maybe everything that dies someday comes back

now i been looking for a job, but it's hard to find
down here, it's just winners and losers and "don't get caught on the wrong side of that line"
well, i'm tired of coming out on the losing end
so, honey, last night, i met this guy, and i'm gonna do a little favor for him

well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
but maybe everything that dies someday comes back
put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in atlantic city

got a wife and kids in baltimore, jack
i went out for a ride and i never went back
like a river that don't know where it's flowing
i took a wrong turn and i just kept going

everybody's got a hungry heart
everybody's got a hungry heart
lay down your money and you play your part
everybody's got a hungry heart

i met her in a kingstown bar
we fell in love i knew it had to end
we took what we had and we ripped it apart
now here i am down in kingstown again

everybody's got a hungry heart
everybody's got a hungry heart
lay down your money and you play your part
everybody's got a hungry heart

everybody needs a place to rest
everybody wants to have a home
don't make no difference what nobody says
ain't nobody like to be alone

everybody's got a hungry heart
everybody's got a hungry heart
lay down your money and you play your part
everybody's got a hungry heart

the rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
and the magic rat drove his sleek machine
over the jersey state line
barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
the rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
together they take a stab at romance
and disappear down flamingo lane

well the maximum lawman run down flamingo
chasing the rat and the barefoot girl
and the kids round here look just like shadows
always quiet, holding hands
from the churches to the jails
tonight all is silence in the world
as we take our stand down in jungleland

well the midnight gangs assembled
and picked a rendezvous for the night
they'll meet 'neath that giant exxon sign
that brings this fair city light
man there's an opera out on the turnpike
there's a ballet being fought out in the alley
until the local cops, cherry top, rips this holy night

the street's alive as secret debts are paid
contact's made, they vanished unseen
kids flash guitars just like switch-blades
hustling for the record machine
the hungry and the hunted
explode into rock'n'roll bands
that faced off against each other out in the street
down in jungleland

in the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the dj plays
lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
desperate as the night moves on
just one look and a whisper, and they're gone


beneath the city two hearts beat
soul engines running through a night so tender
in a bedroom locked in whispers
of soft refusal and then surrender
in the tunnels uptown the rat's own dream guns him down
as shots echo down them hallways in the night
no one watches when the ambulance pulls away
or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light

outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
between what's flesh and what's fantasy
and the poets down here
don't write nothing at all
they just stand back and let it all be
and in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
and try to make an honest stand
but they wind up wounded, not even dead
tonight in jungleland

yeah
uh
wooh
huh

i had a friend was a big baseball player
back in high school
he could throw that speedball by you
make you look like a fool, boy
saw him the other night at this roadside bar
i was walking in, he was walking out
we went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was

glory days, well they'll pass you by
glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days, glory days

well, there's a girl that lives up the block
back in school, she could turn all the boys' heads
sometimes on a friday, i'll stop by and have a few drinks
after she put her kids to bed
her and her husband, bobby, well they split up
i guess it's two years gone by now
we just sit around talking about the old times
she says when she feels like crying
she starts laughing, thinking 'bout

glory days, well they'll pass you by
glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days, glory days

my old man worked twenty years on the line
and they let him go
now everywhere he goes out looking for work
they just tell him that he's too old
i was nine-years old and he was working
at the metuchen ford plant assembly line
now he just sits on a stool down at the legion hall
but i can tell what's on his mind

glory days, yeah goin back
glory days, aw he ain't never had
glory days, glory days

i think i'm going down to the well tonight
i'm gonna drink till i get my fill
and i hope when i get old i don't sit around thinking about it
but i probably will
yeah, just sitting back, trying to recapture
a little of the glory, yeah
well time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
but boring stories of

glory days, well they'll pass you by
glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days, glory days

lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland
got a head-on collision smashin' in my guts, man
i'm caught in a crossfire that i don't understand
but there's one thing i know for sure, girl
i don't give a damn for the same old played-out scenes
baby, i don't give a damn for just the in-betweens
honey, i want the heart, i want the soul, i want control right now
you better listen to me, baby

talk about a dream, try to make it real
you wake up in the night with a fear so real
you spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come
well, don't waste your time waiting

badlands, you gotta live it everyday
let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
we'll keep pushin' till it's understood
and these badlands start treating us good

workin' in the fields till you get your back burned
workin' 'neath the wheel till you get your facts learned
baby, i got my facts learned real good right now
you better get it straight, darling
poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king
and a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything
i wanna go out tonight, i wanna find out what i got

well i believe in the love that you gave me
i believe in the faith that could save me
i believe in the hope and i pray that some day
it may raise me above these

badlands, you gotta live it everyday
let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
we'll keep pushin' till it's understood
and these badlands start treating us good


for the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside
that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
i wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
i wanna find one place, i wanna spit in the face of these

badlands, you gotta live it everyday
let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
keep movin' till it's understood
and these badlands start treating us good

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa
badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa
badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa
badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa
badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa

i was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
i'd sit on his lap in that big old buick
and steer as we drove through town
he'd tousle my hair and say "son, take a good look around
this is your hometown."
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
in '65 tension was running high at my high school
there was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white
there was nothing you could do
two cars at a light on a saturday night
in the back seat there was a gun
words were passed, then a shotgun blast
troubled times had come to my hometown
to my hometown
to my hometown
to my hometown
now main street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
they're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
foreman says "these jobs are going, boys
and they ain't coming back
to your hometown."
to your hometown
to your hometown
to your hometown
last night me and kate, we laid in bed
talking about getting out
packing up our bags maybe heading south
i'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
last night i sat him up behind the wheel, and said
"son take a good look around
this is your hometown."
songwriter:  bruce springsteen

i was bruised and battered, i couldn't tell what i felt
i was unrecognizable to myself
i saw my reflection in a window, i didn't know my own face
oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
on the streets of philadelphia

i walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
i heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
at night i could hear the blood in my veins
it was just as black and whispering as the rain
on the streets of philadelphia

ain't no angel gonna greet me
it's just you and i, my friend
my clothes don't fit me no more
i walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin

the night has fallen, i'm lyin' awake
i can feel myself fading away
so receive me brother with your faithless kiss
or will we leave each other alone like this
on the streets of philadelphia

one soft infested summer
me and terry became friends
trying in vain to breathe
the fire we was born in
catching rides to the outskirts
tying faith between our teeth
sleeping in that old abandoned beach house
getting wasted in the heat
and

hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
with a love so hard and filled with defeat
running for our lives at night on them backstreets

slow dancing in the dark
on the beach at stockton's wing
where desperate lovers park
we sat with the last of the duke street kings
huddled in our cars
waiting for the bells that ring
in the deep heart of the night
we let loose of everything
to go

running on the backstreets
running on the backstreets
terry you swore we'd live forever
taking it on them backstreets together
yeah

endless juke joints and valentino drag
where dancers scraped the tears
up off the street dressed down in rags
running into the darkness
some hurt bad some really dying
at night sometimes it seemed
you could hear the whole damn city crying
blame it on the lies that killed us
blame it on the truth that ran us down
you can blame it all on me terry
it don't matter to me now
when the breakdown hit at midnight
there was nothing left to say
but i hated him
and i hated you when you went away
wa oh, wa oh


laying here in the dark
you're like an angel on my chest
just another tramp of hearts
crying tears of faithlessness
remember all the movies, terry
we'd go see
trying to learn to walk like the heroes
we thought we had to be
well after all this time
to find we're just like all the rest
stranded in the park
and forced to confess
to

hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
where we swore forever friends
on the backstreets until the end

hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
it's all right
we'll go hiding on the backstreets tonight
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
hiding on the backstreets
oh, hey, whoa, oh-oh

men walking along the railroad tracks
going someplace, there's no going back
highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
shelter line stretching around the corner
welcome to the new world order
families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
no home, no job, no peace, no rest

well, the highway is alive tonight
but nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
i'm sitting down here in the campfire light
searching for the ghost of tom joad

he pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
in a cardboard box beneath the underpass
you got a one-way ticket to the promised land
you got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
bathing in the city's aqueduct

well the highway is alive tonight
where it's headed, everybody knows
i'm sitting down here in the campfire light
waiting on the ghost of tom joad

now tom said, "mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
look for me, mom, i'll be there
wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
or a decent job or a helping hand
wherever somebody's struggling to be free
look in their eyes, ma, and you'll see me"

well the highway is alive tonight
but nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
i'm sitting down here in the campfire light
with the ghost of old tom joad

tear drops on the city
bad scooter searching for his groove
seem like the whole world walking pretty
and you can't find the room to move
well everybody better move over, that's all
'cause i'm running on the bad side
and i got my back to the wall
tenth avenue freeze-out, tenth avenue freeze-out

i was stranded in the jungle
tryin' to take in all the heat they was giving
the night is dark but the sidewalks bright
and lined with the light of the living
from a tenement window a transistor blasts
turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
i walked into a tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out

and i'm all alone, i'm all alone
and kid you better get the picture
and i'm on my own, i'm on my own
and i can't go home

when the change was made uptown
and the big man joined the band
from the coastline to the city
all the little pretties raise their hands
i'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
when scooter and the big man bust this city in half
with a tenth avenue freeze-out, tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out

she'll let you in her house
if you come knocking late at night
she'll let you in her mouth
if the words you say are right
if you pay the price
she'll let you deep inside
but there's a secret garden she hides

she'll let you in her car
to go driving around
she'll let you into the parts of herself
that will bring you down
she'll let you in her heart
if you got a hammer and a vise
but into her secret garden, don't think twice

you've gone a million miles
how far would you get
to that place where you can't remember
and you can't forget

she'll lead you down a path
there will be tenderness in the air
she'll let you come just far enough
so you know she's really there
then she'll look at you and smile
and her eyes will say
she's got a secret garden
where everything you want
where everything you need
will always stay
a million miles away

i got a sixty-nine chevy with a three-niner-six
fuelie heads and a hurst on the floor
she’s waiting tonight down in the parking lot
outside the seven-eleven store
me and my partner sonny built her straight out of scratch
and he rides with me from town to town
we only run for the money, got no strings attached
we shut ’em up and then we shut ’em down

tonight, tonight the strip’s just right
i wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
summer’s here and the time is right
for racin’ in the street

we take all the action we can meet
and we cover all the northeast states
when the strip shuts down, we run ’em in the street
from the fire roads to the interstate
now, some guys, they just give up living
and start dying little by little, piece by piece
some guys come home from work and wash up
then go racin’ in the street

tonight, tonight the strip’s just right
i wanna blow ’em all out of their seats
we're calling out around the world
we’re going racin’ in the street

i met her on the strip three years ago
in a camaro with this dude from l.a
i blew that camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
but now there’s wrinkles around my baby’s eyes
and she cries herself to sleep at night
when i come home, the house is dark
she sighs, “baby, did you make it all right?”
she sits on the porch of her daddy’s house
but all her pretty dreams are torn
she stares off alone into the night
with the eyes of one who hates for just being born
for all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels
rumbling through this promised land
tonight my baby and me we’re gonna ride to the sea
and wash these sins off our hands

tonight tonight the highway’s bright
out of our way, mister, you best keep
'cause summer’s here and the time is right
for racin’ in the street

i saw her standing on her front lawn just twirling her baton
me and her went for a ride, sir, and ten innocent people died
from the town of lincoln, nebraska, with a sawed-off .410 on my lap
through to the badlands of wyoming i killed everything in my path
i can't say that i'm sorry for the things that we done
at least for a little while, sir, me and her we had us some fun
now, the jury brought in a guilty verdict, and the judge he sentenced me to death
midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest
sheriff, when the man pulls that switch, sir, and snaps my poor head back
you make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap
they declared me unfit to live, said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
they wanted to know why i did what i did
well, sir, i guess there's just a meanness in this world
