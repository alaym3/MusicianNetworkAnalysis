i'm drunk off your kiss
for another night in a row
this is becoming too routine for me
but i didn't mean to lead you on
and it's alright to pretend
that we still talk
it's just for show, isn't it?
it's my fault that it fell apart

just maybe you need this
and i didn't mean to
lead you on

you were everything i wanted
but i just can't finish what i've started
there's no room left here on my back
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
i'd still pick my friends over you

my friends over you

please tell me everything
that you think that i should know
about all the plans you made
when i was nowhere to be found
and it's alright to forget
that we still talk
it's just for fun, isn't it?
it's my fault that it fell apart

just maybe you need this
and i didn't mean to
lead you on

you were everything i wanted
but i just can't finish what i've started
there's no room left here on my back
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
i'd still pick my friends over you

my friends over you


just maybe you need this
you need this
and i didn't mean to
lead you on

you were everything i wanted
but i just can't finish what i've started
there's no room left here on my back
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
i'd still pick my friends over
you were everything i wanted
(everything i wanted)
but i just can't finish what i've started
there's no room left here on my back for you
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
i'd still pick my friends over you

my friends over you!

carried your burdens in my heart
sidelined your shallow ways
it just tore me apart
i used to think i was your savior
i see through you now
you indulge in this behavior

i don’t want to know you
i don’t think we should talk anymore
i want the best for you
but you’re happy being miserable
i don’t want to know you
or someone who’s so focused on themselves
i’ll save my best for someone else

we can debate our separate views
just look at all your roadblocks
logic will show you truth
i’ve hid in shadows, wrestled demons
but i won’t deny it because i know how to defeat them

i don’t want to know you
i don’t think we should talk anymore
i want the best for you
but you’re happy being miserable
i don’t want to know you
or someone who’s so focused on themselves
i’ll save my best for someone else

when you throw me under the bus
back it up and run me over
if i always catch your fall
you will never hit the surface to feel it all
you gotta feel it all

i don’t want to know you
i don’t think we should talk anymore
i want the best for you
but you’re happy being miserable
i don’t want to know you
or someone who’s so focused on themselves
i’ll save my best for someone else
i’ll save my best for someone else
(i don’t want to know you, i don’t want to know you)
i’ll save my best for someone else
(i don’t want to know you, i don’t want to know you)
i don’t want to know you
or someone who’s so focused on themselves
i’ll save my best for someone else

if you’ve ever been in love
or ever hope to be in love
here’s a story you’ll love with all your heart

couples on their backs in the park
lay on blankets bought
on a date the day before
a routine i’ve been longing for
can’t help but to glance
from the corner of my resentful eyes
guess it’s all perspective but
it’s you i never get enough
we’re always far apart

we’ve got a vicious love
we mix our tears with blood
no clock will stop for us
it ticks by
we fight as hard as we love
we’ve got a vicious love

when i go out alone
and see them sharing meals
like lady and the tramp
hate their loving eyes
wishing it was you and i
add tip to my receipt
fold it up behind a picture of us
guess it’s all perspective but
together though we rarely touch
hard not to fall apart

we’ve got a vicious love
we mix our tears with blood
no clock will stop for us
it ticks by
we fight as hard as we love
we’ve got a vicious love

i could have given up a thousand times
in the past that was so easy
when the thought came to my mind
there was no convincing me
plant my feet to face it all
side by side or a phone call
living in tension with you
still feels better
better than i’ve ever known

we’ve got a vicious love
we mix our tears with blood
no clock will stop for us
it ticks by
we fight as hard as we love
we’ve got a vicious love

you're hiding something, 'cause it's
burning through your eyes
i try to get it out, but all i
hear from you are lies

and i can tell you're going through the motions
figured you were acting out your part
once again, we're playing off emotion
which one of us will burn until the end?

catalyst, you insist to pull me down
you contradict the fact that you still want me around
and it's all downhill from here
and it's all downhill from here

your good intentions slowly
turn to bitterness (turn to bitterness)
recurring episodes with
each and every kiss (let's go!)

and i can tell you're going through the motions
figured you were acting out your part
once again, we're playing off emotion
which one of us will burn until the end?

catalyst, you insist to pull me down
you contradict the fact that you still want me around
and it's all downhill from here
and it's all downhill from here

and i can't believe you pulled it off again
or notice 'til it all sets in
you'll deny it 'til you're at your bitter end

and i can tell you're going through the motions
figured you were acting out your part
once again, we're playing off emotion
which one of us will burn until the end?

catalyst, you insist to pull me down
you contradict the fact that you still want me around
and it's all downhill from here
and it's all downhill from here

and you keep pulling me down!
(pulling me down, pulling me down)
you contradict the fact that you still want me around
and it's all downhill from here
and it's all downhill from here

i must be honest
under the surface
it grinds like a blender
the sound of two voices
my heart seems to fail me
it put me in a stranger's bed
it hurt who i love the most
i'll never trust it again

that's why i don't want what i want
'cause what i want, it just might kill me
and i won't think of my needs
'cause what i need, i know there's never enough for me

envy is endless
i used to put mistakes up on a board
compare how mine sticks
next to the rest of the worlds'
that got me nowhere but miles from changing
now i've got deep stains
and bleach won't erase them

that's why i don't want what i want
'cause what i want, it just might kill me
and i won't think of my needs
'cause what i need, i know there's never enough for me

call me on everything
'cause i can't see how it looks from your perspective
call me on everything 'cause i can't help myself
and i need your protection from me
i lose every time
i lose every time
i lose every time
you think you're inspiring
posting slogans on a photo of the sky
you're letting sleeping dogs lie
it's not so simple as
do what makes you happy
if that's the same thing
that will destroy me

that's why i don't want what i want
'cause what i want, it just might kill me
and i won't think of my needs
'cause what i need, i know there's never enough for me
i must be honest
(for me)
under the surface
it grinds like a blender
(i know there's never enough for me)
the sound of two voices
my heart seems to fail me
(for me)
it put me in a stranger's bed
it hurt who i love the most
(what i need, i know there's never enough for me)
i'll never trust it again

living for the weekend state of mind makes me sick
just thinking of the bad habits
people passing out in parking lots
that you only live once way of thinking
it’s so twisted are you living or just wasted
an escape 'cause you can’t face it
if a psycho said this is the end
i think i’d believe him

now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
back up

this self-centered generation taking pictures
of themselves then changing features
pleasing over critical creatures
everyones got a cause but how strong is the foundation?
moving like the waves of the ocean
do you care or just throw stones in?
if a billboard read this was the end
i think i’d believe it

now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
back up

i heard there’s a hot new craze of driving off a steep cliff
are you gonna do it? what will they say if you won’t
i hear there’s a brand new trend where you swallow bags of thumbtacks
are you gonna do it? what will they say if you don’t?

now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
now the whole world is full of it
building a bunker and jumping in
after everyone self-destructs
pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up
back up

(it's the end of the world as we know it)
i'm building a bunker and jumping in
are you gonna do it?
(it's the end of the world as we know it)
what will i say if you won't?
(it's the end of the world as we know it)
i'm building a bunker and jumping in
are you gonna do it?
(it's the end of the world as we know it)
what will i say if you don't?

it's a barren land, but they all throw shade
i can't make peace, post-modern age
i'm a tourist lost in translation
and there's nothing new under the sun
you see, i like it so much better when i'm safe inside
and at times your good company is hard to find
to keep a nourished mind, i need water

i'm trapped in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
call me anti-social
it's more than i could hope for

i'm not a star of stage and screen
i don't know lines, but you make a scene
i'm an alien crashed in an old west town
beam me up, get me out
you see, i like it so much better when i'm safe inside
even though i know my reputation's on the line
to keep a nourished mind, i need water

i'm trapped in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
call me anti-social
it's more than i could hope for

you see, i like it so much better when i'm safe inside
even though i know my reputation's on the line
to keep a nourished mind, i need water, water

i'm trapped in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
in another boring summer
while everyone is living it up
but it's way too hot to go outside
when i don't relate to anyone
call me anti-social
it's more than i could hope for

the needle on my record player has been wearing thin
this record has been playing since the day you've been with him

no more long rides home
no more of your station
i didn't like it anyways
remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall
remember the time we realized "thriller" was our favorite song

have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long to see you
have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long to see you

maybe it's for the best
maybe it's not for anything
it wouldn't be so bad to take this right from me

no more long rides home
no more of your station
i didn't like it anyways
remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall
remember the time we realized "thriller" was our favorite song

have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long to see you
have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long to see you

how many times i've tried
it's simple to you, so simple to lie
how many times i've tried
blatant mistakes of your design
how many times i've tried
it's simple to you, so simple to lie
how many times i've tried
blatant mistakes of your design

have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long to see you

i've had so many chances
turn my back and i ran away
i've had so many chances to see you

i'm sick of smiling
and so is my jaw
can't you see my front is crumbling down?
i'm sick of being someone i'm not
please get me out of this slump
i'm sick of clapping
when i know i can do it better for myself
i'm sick of waiting
sick of all these words that will never matter

i'll wire these nerves together
hoping for a chance to think on time
and i'm tracing over your letter
to see if your intentions are as good as mine

but you're getting worse
i swear it
it's hard to prove you're an understatement
you're getting worse and i know
that you'll be calling, calling, calling me again

i'm done with everything
that had to do with you
don't worry your pictures are already burned
i'm done with new friends
don't sell yourself short
you'll lose it in the end

i'll wire these nerves together
hoping for a chance to think on time
and i'm tracing over your letter
to see if your intentions are as good as mine

but you're getting worse
i swear it
it's hard to prove you're an understatement
you're getting worse and i know
that you'll be calling, calling, calling me again

i can't help how i feel
no i can't help how i feel

but you're getting worse
i swear it
it's hard to prove you're an understatement
you're getting worse and i know
you'll be calling, calling, calling me again
calling me again
calling me again

but you're getting worse
i swear it
it's hard to prove you're an understatement
you're getting worse and i know
that you'll be calling, calling, calling me again

i’m starting to wonder about my luck
when it’ll run out
sooner or later
i’ll be hit by a bus any day now
are your eyes blocked by cataracts
you can't see how good you have it
you’re taking a smile for granted

you’re gonna wake up twenty years from now
wishing you gave two shits about
all the lost moments you can never get back
you’d trade it for anything
look back twenty years from now
wondering why you cared about
getting all the last words
just to hear your own voice
but you weren’t saying anything

when all goes your way
your thoughts dissolve to nothing
we learn to walk from falling
so i’ll kiss the curb

you’re gonna wake up twenty years from now
wishing you gave two shits about
all the lost moments you can never get back
you’d trade it for anything
look back twenty years from now
wondering why you cared about
getting all the last words
just to hear your own voice
but you weren’t saying anything

no longer i worry about a future i can’t figure out
(this days sufficient enough for me)

you’re gonna wake up twenty years from now
wishing you gave two shits about
all the lost moments you can never get back
you’d trade it for anything
look back twenty years from now
wondering why you cared about
getting all the last words
just to hear your own voice
but you weren’t saying anything
never get back, you’d trade it for anything

i called you last night, were you asleep?
or did you let it ring avoiding me?
you said you needed time to think
and space to process what it means

so i wrote it down instead
all the things that night
i would’ve said

i drew stick figures of you and i on a hillside
stick figures of you and me, don’t you agree?
we would make the best team
better than the ’96 bulls ever were
jordan, rodman, and pippen
wouldn’t have known what had hit them

i hear my door doorbell ring and it’s you outside
with tears in your eyes from your late night drive
i know you’re scared and so am i
but i think that’s a sign we’re worth a try

and i wrote it down instead
all the things that night i couldn’t say

i drew stick figures of you and i on a hillside
stick figures of you and me, don’t you agree?
we would make the best team
better than the ’96 bulls ever were
jordan, rodman, and pippen
wouldn’t have known what had hit them

i think we are what we’ve been waiting for
i think we are what we’ve been waiting for
i think we are what we’ve been waiting for
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
i think we are what we’ve been waiting for
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
i drew sticks figures
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
of you and i on a hillside
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
stick figures of you and me
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
don't you agree?
(i think we are what we’ve been waiting for)
i drew stick figures

the needle on my record player has been wearing thin

no more long rides home
no more of your station
i didn't like it anyway
remember the time we wrote our names up on the wall
remember the time we realized "thriller" was our favorite song

have i waited too long
have i found that someone
have i waited too long, to see you

maybe it's for the best
maybe it's not for anything
it wouldn't be so bad to take this right from me



how many times i've tried
it's simple to you
so simple to lie
how many times i've tried
blatant mistakes of your design

i've had so many chances
turn my back and ran away
i've had so many chances to see you...

kiss me out of the bearded barley
nightly, beside the green, green grass
swing, swing, swing the spinning step
i'll wear those shoes and you will wear that dress

oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
silver moon's sparkling
so kiss me

kiss me down by the broken tree house
swing me upon its hanging tire
bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
we'll take the trail marked on your father's map

oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
silver moon's sparkling
so kiss me
oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
silver moon's sparkling
so kiss me

so kiss me
so kiss me
so kiss me

i'm sorry
i heard about the bad news today
a crowd of people around you
telling you it's okay
and everything happens for a reason

when you lose a part of yourself
to somebody you know
it takes a lot to let go
every breath that you remember
pictures fade away but memory is forever

an empty chair at all the tables
and i'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
but it's better where you're going anyway

i'm sorry
i heard about the bad news today
it's really hard to get through
tough times and long days
but it really just depends on the season



for now we'll say goodbye
we know it's not the last time
i've lost the best part of my day
but it's better where you're going anyway


for now we'll say goodbye
we know it's not the last time
i've lost the best part of my day
this is the last thing
i will remember
it's better where you're going anyway

your clothes and your motions, they caught my eye
it's no disguise what you want from me
your humor, the bait for a trap so contrived
it's no surprise what you want from me

got no quarters in my pocket
there's no change to play your game

your perfume scent, the lies i'll admit
just more evident what you want from me
the right recipe but the wrong target
you'll never get what you want from me

got no quarters in my pocket
there's no change to play your game

your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be

you don't need scales to tell you're a snake
in for the take, yeah, you're using me
someone in your life didn't hug you enough
i'm not your drug, no abusing me

got no quarters in my pocket
there's no change to play your game

your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
fool that i used to be

woah oh oh, oh woah oh
woah oh oh, woah oh
oh woah oh, woah oh oh
woah oh oh, woah oh

your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me
i'm not the same fool that i used to be
fool that i used to be
fool that i used to be

woah oh oh, woah oh oh
woah oh oh, woah oh
woah oh oh, woah oh oh
your jokes aren't funny anymore to me

i'm gonna make it easy
because i haven't had much time to think
and figure out clever words to sing
accurate enough for you
i'm gonna dumb this down
'cause it's not even about me
i'll shout it out even though they'll say they've heard this all before

i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
i don't deserve much of anything
i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
forgiving me and giving me as much as you do

i'm gonna take it easy
and not get too many details
some moments better kept for you and i
but i'll keep up the pace
not trying to overcompensate with savvy lines
it's as real as it can get
it's as real as it can get

i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
i don't deserve much of anything
i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
forgiving me and giving me as much as you do

i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
i don't deserve much of anything
i don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
forgiving me and giving me as much as you do
as much as you do
as much as you do
as much as you do
i don't deserve much of anything

so close to giving up
when is enough enough?
so much with at cost love
walking with eyes to the ground
can i trust my own heart now?
never thought that i could move on

'till i was shook by your shaved head
i never thought i would see your sweet face again
luck or a dream the odds you'd bump into me
two times in one week, i guess we're just meant to be

expect the unexpected, doesn't mean you'll be neglected
i've see the cup half full
call me extreme, we would've been prom king and queen
if we were both still seventeen
was throwing in the towel

'till i was ('til i was) shook by your shaved head
i never thought i would see your sweet face again
luck or a dream the odds you'd bump into me
two times in one week

yeah, i was shook by your shaved head
i never thought i would see your sweet face again
luck or a dream the odds you'd bump into me
two times in one week, i guess we're just meant to be

you've gotta take your life back
you've got so much more to give
that's what i say to myself
when i feel like giving in to shame
i feel
won't let it keep me standing still
to the shame
i feel
will let it keep me standing still

'cause i was shook by your shaved head
i never thought i would see your sweet face again
luck or a dream the odds you'd bump into me
two times in one week, i guess we're just meant to be

meant to be
meant to be
luck or a dream the odds you'd bump into me
two times in one week, i guess we're just meant to be
meant to be
meant to be

when we first met, i doubted myself
could someone love to the level you do?
or are you just excited for a fresh start?
had reservations, i was dumb to assume
but it's all that i knew
it's all that i knew
had blurred vision from all my head wounds
a victim of my own bitterness
a life i almost missed
i kick myself when i think of it

i'm giving up, love
i'm giving up, love
you're the one, love
you're the one, love

when i think back, i still get a feeling
i'm so ashamed of all the time that it took
for me to open my eyes
you brought me back when i was lost and confused
but it's all that i knew
it's all that i knew
had blurred vision from all my head wounds
a victim to my own stubbornness
a life i almost missed
i curse myself when i think of it

i'm giving up, love
i'm giving up, love
you're the one, love
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
i'm giving up, love
i'm giving up, love

there's no grass greener on the other side
i planted my roots deep
this is for life
if there comes a time where your leaves might die
i'll water them
i'll water them for you
i'll water them

i'm giving up, love
i'm giving up, love
you're the one, love
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
you're the one
you're the one
you're the one, love
i'm giving up, love
i'm giving up, love

i've been waiting for a good day
i've been holding back long enough
i've been hurting to tell you some things
it's not the falling of the temperature
that's making all our bones run cold
it's the breeze you make
the presence felt when you're around me

and it feels like i'm at an all-time low
slightly bruised and broken
from our head on collision
i've never seen this side of you
another tragic case of feeling
bruised and broken
from our head on collision
i've never seen this side of you
another tragic case

and i'm still waiting for a good day
i think i've held this long enough
i think it's safe to tell you some things
it's not just what you say to people
and it's not the way you look at me
it's the way you present yourself
for all your worst critics to see


then you were gone
all this time you just didn't know it yet 


another tragic case of feeling
bruised and broken
another tragic case and i've been
still waiting for a good day

we made blood boil
turned many eyes red
they felt the earth shake the second our lips connected
we built our own house
it got rat infested
set it on fire 'cause everything's replaceable
but you and our memories
no one can touch them

because we're barbed wire
two strands twisted to one
razor sharp
no one will ever touch us
yeah, we're barbed wire
two strands twisted to one
razor sharp
no one will ever touch us

tripped over ourselves
we slept in the gutter
we rolled around in broken glass
self-inflicted, but we had each other
