hello, i've waited here for you
everlong
tonight, i throw myself into
and out of the red
out of her head, she sang

come down, and waste away with me
down with me
slow how you wanted it to be
i'm over my head
out of her head, she sang

and i wonder
when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang

breathe out, so i can breathe you in
hold you in
and now i know you've always been
and out of your head, out of my head i sang

and i wonder
when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang


and i wonder

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when

keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend
keep you in the dark and so it all began

send in your skeletons
sing as their bones go marching in again
they need you buried deep
the secrets that you keep are at the ready
are you ready?
i'm finished making sense
done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
spinning infinity, boy
the wheel is spinning me
it's never ending, never ending
same old story

what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say that i'll never surrender?

in time or so i'm told
i'm just another soul for sale, oh well
the page is out of print
we are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary
same old story

what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?

i'm the voice inside your head
you refuse to hear
i'm the face that you have to face
mirroring your stare
i'm what's left, i'm what's right
i'm the enemy
i'm the hand that'll take you down
bring you to your knees
so who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?
keep you in the dark
you know they all pretend

what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?

what if i say i'm not like the others? (keep you in the dark)
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays? (you know they all)
you're the pretender (pretend)
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others? (keep you in the dark)
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays? (you know they all)
you're the pretender (pretend)
what if i say i will never surrender?
so who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?

too alarming now to talk about
take your pictures down and shake it out
truth or consequence, say it aloud
use that evidence, race it around

there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary

don't the best of them bleed it out
while the rest of them peter out?
truth or consequence, say it aloud
use that evidence, race it around

there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary

kudos, my hero
leaving all the mess
you know my hero
the one that's on

there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary
there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary

i've got another confession to make
i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break
holdin' you
were you born to resist
or be abused?

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
are you gone and on to someone new?

i needed somewhere to hang my head
without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have
but had no use
i was too weak to give in
too strong to lose

my heart is under arrest again
but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death
but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in
i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

ohh
ohh, ohh
ohh, ohh

has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
the life, the love you'd die to heal
the hope that starts the broken hearts
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

i've got another confession, my friend
i'm no fool
i'm getting tired of starting again
somewhere new
were you born to resist
or be abused?
i swear i'll never give in
i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

all my life i've been searching for something
something never comes, never leads to nothing
nothing satisfies, but i'm getting close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around, then it's taken away
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most
feel it come to life when i see your ghost

come down don't you resist
you've such a delicate wrist
and if i give it a twist
something to hold when i lose my grip
will i find something in there?
so give me just what i need
another reason to bleed
one by one, hidden up my sleeve
one by one, hidden up my sleeve

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down

will i find a believer?
another one who believes?
another one to deceive?
over and over, down on my knees
if i get any closer
and if you open up wide
and if you let me inside
on and on, i got nothing to hide
on and on, i got nothing to hide

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down

all my life i've been searching for something
something never comes, never leads to nothing
nothing satisfies, but i'm getting close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around, then it's taken away
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most
feel it come to life when i see your ghost
and i'm done, done, on to the next one

done, done, and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done, and i'm on to the next one
done, done, and i'm on to the next one
done, done, and i'm on to the next one
done, done, and i'm on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next—
done, done, on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next one
done, done, on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next—

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down

done, done, on to the next one
done, and i'm done, and i'm on to the next

what have we done with innocence?
it disappeared with time, it never made much sense
adolescent resident
wasting another night on planning my revenge

one in ten
one in ten
one in ten

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

all this time to make amends
what do you do when all your enemies are friends?
now and then i'll try to bend
under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

one in ten
one in ten
one in ten

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

temper
temper
temper

one last thing before i quit
i never wanted any more than i could fit
into my head
i still remember every single word you said
and all the shit that somehow came along with it
still there's one thing that comforts me
since i was always caged and now i'm free

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)

a million miles away
your signal in the distance
to whom it may concern
i think i lost my way
gettin' good at startin' over
every time that i return

i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?
where do i begin?

do you remember the days
we built these paper mountains
then sat and watched them burn?
i think i found my place
can't you feel it growin' stronger?
little conquerors

i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?

now
for the very first time
don't you pay no mind
set me free again
to keep alive a moment at a time
but still inside a whisper to a riot
to sacrifice but knowin' to survive
the first to climb another state of mind
i'm on my knees, i'm prayin' for a sign
forever, whenever, i never want to die
i never want to die, i never want to die
i'm on my knees, i never want to die
i'm dancin' on my grave, i'm runnin' through the fire
forever, whenever, i never want to die
i never want to leave, i never say goodbye
forever, whenever, forever, whenever

i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?

i, i'm a one way motorway
i'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
i, i'm a street light shining
i'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on
uh-huh

it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again

i, i'm a new day rising
i'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
but i, i'm a little divided
do i stay or run away and leave it all behind?
uh-huh

it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again


it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again

she was a friend of mine, 'lone on a dead end street
dancing through life on the front lines
she led a quiet life, ends, they don't always meet
years passed her by waiting to rise

she had arrows in her eyes
fear where her heart should be
war in her mind

arrows in her eyes, fear where her heart should be
war in her mind, shame in her cries
arrows in her eyes, tears in her arteries
war in her mind, shame as she cries
fire away

give me the flammable life
i'm cold as a match, ready to strike
so here i go
here lies a city on fire
singing along, the arsonist choir
now here i go
it started with a spark
and burned into the dark
now, here i go
there is a river i found
into the wild, under the ground
so here i go
a button on a string
and i heard everything
now, here i go, well

oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
you have no choice you have to choose
bid farewell to yesterday
say goodbye i'm on my way
but in the end we all
come from what's come before
so here i go, well
oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
you had no choice you had to choose
bid farewell to yesterday
say goodbye i'm on my way

i threw it all away because
i had to be what never was
been so hungry i could lie
you took my word, i took your wine
and held you in my bloody hands
these rattled bones and rubber bands
washed them in the muddy water
looking for a dime and found a quarter

but you can't make me change my name
you'll never make me change my name
pay no mind, now ain't that's something
fuck it all, i came from nothing

i'm something from nothing
you are my fuse
i'm something from nothing
you are my fuse
it goes oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
it goes oh, oh, oh
alright

no you can't make me change my name
you'll never make me change my name
pay no mind, now wait that's something
fuck it all, i came from nothing

i'm something from nothing
i'm something from nothing

i've been drinking dirty water
but i've been here before, after all
the witching hour is upon us
you and i can sing haunted songs
in my dreams, i'm climbing ladders
and then i tumble down, rung by rung
and i keep on falling faster
the heart is echoing, on and on, on and on

i feel an earthquake coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel the metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)
'cause i'm a natural disaster (ah, ah, ah, ah)
you're the morning after all my storms (ah, ah, ah, ah)

you're my sea of poison flowers
standing in the sun, row by row
i've been drinking dirty water
the taste of sweet revenge, best served cold, all we know

i feel an earthquake coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel the metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i'm a natural disaster (ah, ah, ah, ah)
you're the morning after all my storms (ah, ah, ah, ah)

bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky

i feel an earthquake coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel the metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)
'cause i'm a natural disaster (ah, ah, ah, ah)
dirty water in my blood (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel a moment coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
heavy metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)
'cause i'm a natural disaster (ah, ah, ah, ah)
you're the morning after all my storms (ah, ah, ah, ah)
