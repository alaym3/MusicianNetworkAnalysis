spent the day in bed
very happy i did, yes
i spent the day in bed
as the workers stay enslaved
i spent the day in bed
i'm not my type
but i love my bed
and i recommend that you

stop watching the news
because the news contrives to frighten you
to make you feel small and alone
to make you feel that your mind isn't your own

i spent the day in bed, it's a consolation
when all my dreams are perfectly legal
in sheets for which i paid, i am now laid
and i recommend to all of my friends that they

stop watching the news
because the news contrives to frighten you
to make you feel small and alone
to make you feel that your mind isn't your own
oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish, do as i wish

i spent the day in bed
you can please yourself, but
i spent the day in bed
pillows like pillars
life ends in death
so, there's nothing wrong with being good to yourself
be good to yourself for once!

and no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no emasculation, no castration
no highway, freeway, motorway
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train 

trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
armageddon - come armageddon!
come, armageddon! come!

every day is like sunday
every day is silent and grey

hide on the promenade
etch a postcard:
"how i dearly wish i was not here"
in the seaside town
that they forgot to bomb
come, come, come, nuclear bomb

every day is like sunday
every day is silent and grey

trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
and on your face...
on your face...
on your face...
on your face...
every day is like sunday
"win yourself a cheap tray"
share some greased tea with me
every day is silent and grey 

why do you come here ?
and why do you hang around ?

i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry

why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me ?
when you know, oh
why do you come ?
why do you telephone ? (hmm...)
and why send me silly notes ?

i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry

why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me ?
when you know, oh
why do you come here
you had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
"it was just to see, just to see"
(all the things you knew i'd written about you...)
oh, so many illustrations
oh, but
i'm so very sickened
oh, i am so sickened now

oh, it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh oh
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh, it was a good lay, good lay
oh
oh, it was a good lay
it was a good lay
oh, a good lay
oh, a good lay
good lay, good lay
oh
it was a good lay 

los angeles, you are too hot

you have never been in love
until you've seen the stars
reflect in the reservoirs
and you have never been in love
until you've seen the dawn rise
behind the home for the blind

we are the pretty petty thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where hector was the...

first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
oh my
hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
oh my
you have never been in love
until you've seen the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bone

we are the pretty petty thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where hector was the

first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
such a silly boy
hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the bullet in his gullet
and the first lost lad to go
under the sod

and he stole from the rich and the poor
and not very rich and the very poor
and he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
away
he stole all hearts away
away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
away 

you realize, if you're happy
jesus sends you straight to hell
israel, israel
and should you dare enjoy your body
here tolls hades' welcome bell
israel, israel
you've found a middle-course existence
we're all bones and flesh and shell
israel, israel
i can't answer for what armies do
they are not you, they are not you, they are not you
in other climes, they bitch and whine
just because you're not like them
israel, israel
the sky is dark for many others
they want it dark for you as well
israel, israel
earth is just one big asylum
and explodes a prison cell
see us squirm in our own damaged spell
you were born as guilty sinners
before you stood upright, you fell
put the fear of many gods in israel
nature gave you every impulse
who are virgin priests to tell
who, how to love, how to live?
israel
and they who reign abuse upon you
they are jealous of you as well
love yourself as you should, israel 

jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
i make this claim, now let me explain
since she lost you
jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
free in the truth of make-believe
since she lost you

she is determined to prove
how she can fill up the page
of every lost and lonely day

jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
she'll make you believe what you'll never believe
since she lost you
jacky's only jacky when she's up on the stage
living bodies that actually move
since she lost you

she is determined to prove
how she can fill up the page
of every lost and lonely day
"cue lights, i am singing to my lover at night
scene two: everyone who comes must go
scene four: blacker than ever before
scene six: this country is making me sick"

jacky cracks when she isn't on stage
see the effects of sexual neglect
no script, no crew, no auto-cue
no audience telling her what to do
exit, exit
everybody's heading for the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's heading for the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's running to the exit, exit
everybody's heading for the exit, exit
everybody's heading for the exit, exit
everybody's heading for the exit, exit, exit, exit
exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit 

i wish you lonely, if only for one day
so that you might see routine for me
since the day i was born, born
think of yourself only, of everything you demand
or you want or you need
and to hell, to hell with everybody else, everybody else

turn the key slowly
remember how i can't sleep
or if ever i do, an earthquake
an earthquake, oh, couldn't agitate, couldn't agitate

tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
of monarchy, oligarch, head of state, potentate
and now never coming back, never coming back
tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
of romance gone wrong, the same old glue
and never coming true, never coming true
tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
of heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin
and never coming back, never coming back
i wish you lonely like the last tracked humpback whale
chased by gunships from bergen, oh
but never giving in, never giving in 

irish blood, english heart, this i'm made of
there is no one on earth i'm afraid of
and no regime can buy or sell me

i've been dreaming of a time when
to be english is not to be baneful
to be standing by the flag not feeling shameful
racist or partial

irish blood, english heart, this i'm made of
there is no one on earth i'm afraid of
and i will die with both of my hands untied

i've been dreaming of a time when
the english are sick to death of labour and tories
and spit upon the name oliver cromwell
and denounce this royal line
that still salute him and will salute him forever 

dear hero imprisoned
with all the new crimes that you are perfecting
oh, i can't help quoting you

in our lifetime those who kill
the news world hands them stardom
and these are the ways
on which i was raised

on which i was, which i was raised
i never wanted to kill
i am not naturally evil
such things i do
just to make myself
more attractive to you
have i failed?

and understand
'cause life is hard enough when you belong here

a silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me - to tell you
break the news gently
break the news to him gently
"shelve your plans, shelve your plans, shelve them"
bengali, bengali
it's the touchy march of time that binds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because i am the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
that life is hard enough when you belong here

oh...
shelve your western plans

here is london, giddy of london
is it home of the free
or what?

can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
i've got faith in you
i sense the power
within the fingers
within an hour the power
could totally destroy me
(or, it could save my life)

oh, here is london
"home of the brash, outrageous and free"
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it real?
and you're always busy

really busy
busy, busy
oh, hairdresser on fire
all around sloane square
and you're just so busy
busy, busy
busy scissors, uh
oh, hairdresser on fire
(only the other day)
was a client, over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"i'm gonna sue you"
oh, i really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me?
change me, change

oh, here in london
"home of the brash, outrageous and free"
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it real?
and you're always busy

really busy
busy clippers, uh
oh, hairdresser on fire
all around sloane square
and you're just too busy
to see me
busy clippers, uh
oh, hairdresser on fire

sleep on and dream of love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

one november spawned a monster
in the shape of this child, who later cried
"but jesus made me, so jesus save me
from pity, sympathy, and people discussing me
a frame of useless limbs what can make good
all the bad that's been done?"

and if the lights were out
could you even bear to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

one november spawned a monster
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers must pause and draw the line

so sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest you will get to love

that november is a time which i must put out of my mind
oh, one fine day, let it be soon
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out and chose for herself 

pasolini is me
'accattone' you'll be
i entered nothing and nothing entered me
'til you came with the key
and you did your best but

as i live and breathe
you have killed me
you have killed me
yes i walk around somehow
but you have killed me
you have killed me
piazza cavour, what's my life for?

visconti is me
magnani you'll never be
i entered nothing and nothing entered me
'til you came with the key
and you did your best but

as i live and breathe
you have killed me
you have killed me
yes, i walk around somehow
but you have killed me
you have killed me
who am i that i come to be here...?

as i live and breathe
you have killed me
you have killed me
yes i walk around somehow
but you have killed me
you have killed me

and there is no point saying this again
there is no point saying this again
but i forgive you, i forgive you
always i do forgive you 

there's a place in the sun
for anyone who has the will to chase one
and i think i've found mine
yes, i do believe i have found mine, so

close your eyes
and think of someone
you physically admire
and let me kiss you, ohh
let me kiss you, ohh

i've zig-zagged all over america
and i cannot find a safety haven
say, would you let me cry
on your shoulder
i've heard that you'll try anything twice

close your eyes
and think of someone
you physically admire
and let me kiss you, ohh
let me kiss you, ohh
but then you open your eyes
and you see someone
that you physically despise
but my heart is open
my heart is open to you 

4 am, and once again
i am asked to leave this club in tel aviv
it's 4 am, and once again
i am asked to leave this club in tel aviv, oh

everything i know deserts me now
when you open your legs
everything i know deserts me now
when you open

i see it all, i see it all as plain as day
how people only give once they receive
soon, there will come the very final pull of earth
and until then i will scream out your word

everything i know deserts me now
when you open your legs
everything i know deserts me now
when you open

everything i know deserts me now
when you open your legs
everything i know deserts me now
when you open 

off the rails i was and
off the rails
i was happy to stay
get out of my way
on the rack i was
easy meat, and a reasonably good buy
a reasonably good buy

the piccadilly palare
was just silly slang
between me and the boys in my gang
"so bona to vada, oh you
your lovely eek and
your lovely riah"

we plied an ancient trade
where we threw all life's
instructions away
exchanging lies and digs (my way)
'cause in a belted coat
oh, i secretly knew
that i hadn't a clue
(no, no. no, no, no. you can't get there that way. follow me...)

the piccadilly palare
was just silly slang
between me and the boys in my gang
exchanging palare
you wouldn't understand
good sons like you
never do

a cold-water room
it’s not much, i know
but for now it’s where i belong
am i really doing wrong?
around the center of town
is where i belong
am i really doing wrong?”

so why do you smile
when you think about earl's court ?
but you cry when you think of all
the battles you've fought and lost
it may all end tomorrow
or it could go on forever
in which case i'm doomed
it could go on forever
in which case i'm doomed
bona drag, bona drag, bona drag, bona drag...
