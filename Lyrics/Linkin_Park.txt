(it starts with one) one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)
didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window
tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go

i kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard

i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter

one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin' me
actin' like i was part of your property
rememberin' all the times you fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end

you kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard

i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter

i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know

i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter

should've stayed, were there signs, i ignored?
can i help you, not to hurt, anymore?
we saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
there are things that we can have, but can't keep

if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do

the reminders, pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
and you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do

(i do)

who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
well i do

i don’t like my mind right now
stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
wish that i could slow things down
i wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything's about me
yeah, i drive myself crazy
'cause i can’t escape the gravity

i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?

you say that i'm paranoid
but i’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
it’s not like i make the choice
to let my mind stay so fucking messy
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same

i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?

i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything’s about me

holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?

i'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
i don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you

can't you see that you're smothering me?
holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart, right in front of you

caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take

i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you

and i know i may end up failing, too
but i know you were just like me
with someone disappointed in you

i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you

i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be

crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming, confusing
this lack of self-control i fear is never-ending
controlling, i can't seem

to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure

crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting, reacting
against my will, i stand beside my own reflection
it's haunting how i can't seem

to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure

crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing, confusing what is real

(there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming) confusing what is real
(this lack of self-control i fear is never-ending
controlling) confusing what is real

i got a long way to go
and a long memory
i been searching for an answer
always just out of reach
blood on the floor
sirens repeat
i been searching for the courage
to face my enemies
when they turn down the lights

i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake

for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony

they say that i don’t belong
say that i should retreat
that i’m marching to the rhythm
of a lonesome defeat
but the sound of your voice
puts the pain in reverse
no surrender, no illusions
and for better or worse
when they turn down the lights

i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake

if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
when they turn down the lights

i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony

memories consume like opening the wound
i'm picking me apart again
you all assume i'm safe here in my room
unless i try to start again

i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused

i don't know what's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate
and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way
i know it's not alright
so i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight

clutching my cure, i tightly lock the door
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more than anytime before
i had no options left again

i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused

i don't know what's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate
and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way
i'll never be alright
so i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight

i'll paint it on the walls
'cause i'm the one at fault
i'll never fight again
and this is how it ends

i don't know what's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream
but now i have some clarity
to show you what i mean
i don't know how i got this way
i'll never be alright
so i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight

so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)

live from the rhythm, it's
something wild, venomous
enemies trying to read me
you're all looking highly illiterate
blindly forgetting if i'm in the mix
you won't find an equivalent
i've been here killing it
longer than you've been alive, you idiot
and it makes you so mad
somebody else could be stepping in front of you
and it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
there's more than one of you
and you can't understand the fact
that it's over and done, hope you had fun
you've got a lot to discuss on the bus
headed back where you're from

so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye

(wooh!)
goodbye, good riddance
a period is after every sentence
did my time with my cellmate
maxed out so now we finished
every day was like a hail date
every night was like a hailstorm
took her back to my tinted windows
showin' out, she in rare form
wings up, now i'm airborne
king push, they got a chair for him
make way for the new queen
the old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
consequence when you ain't there for him
were you there for him?
did you care for him?
you were dead wrong

(don't you come back no more)
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)

yo
let me say goodbye to my demons
let me say goodbye to my past life
let me say goodbye to the darkness
tell 'em that i'd rather be here in the starlight
tell 'em that i'd rather be here where they love me
tell 'em that i'm yours this is our life
and i still keep raising the bar like
never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
goodbye to the stereotypes
you can't tell my kings we can't
mandem we're linking tings in parks
now i got a tune with linkin park
like goodbye to my old hoe’s
goodbye to the cold roads
i can't die for my postcode
young little mike from the gold coast
and now i'm inside with my bro bro's
gang

so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)

in this farewell
there's no blood, there's no alibi
'cause i've drawn regret
from the truth of a thousand lies
so let mercy come and wash away

what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done

put to rest what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands of uncertainty
so let mercy come and wash away

what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done

for what i've done
i start again
and whatever pain may come
today this ends
i'm forgiving

what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done

(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
forgiving what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)

tell me what i've gotta do
there's no getting through to you
the lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
you say i can't understand
but you're not giving me a chance
when you leave me, where do you go? (where do you go?)

all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you

the truth is, you turn into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself

i admit i made mistakes
but yours might cost you everything
can't you hear me calling you home?

oh, all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you

the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself

all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you

the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
talking to myself

i'm dancing with my demons
i'm hanging off the edge
storm clouds gather beneath me
waves break above my head

headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake now

you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me

stared into this illusion
for answers yet to come
i chose a false solution
but nobody proved me wrong

headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake
watch the ground giving way now

you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me

been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i've been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i wanna fall wide awake now

so tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
and only i can save me now
i'm holding up a light
chasing out the darkness inside
and i don't wanna let you down
but only i can save me
been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here

take me down to the river bend
take me down to the fighting end
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again

fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the sirens sing
warm me up in a nova's glow
and drop me down to the dream below

'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see

bring me home in a blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again

'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see

'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be

'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see, for you to see

(when this began) i had nothing to say
and i'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(i was confused) and i let it all out to find
that i'm not the only person with these things in mind
(inside of me) but all the vacancy the words revealed
is the only real thing that i've got left to feel
(nothing to lose) just stuck, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
(erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong

and i've got nothing to say
i can't believe i didn't fall right down on my face
(i was confused) looking everywhere, only to find
that it's not the way i had imagined it all in my mind
(so what am i?) what do i have but negativity?
'cause i can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(nothing to lose) nothing to gain, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
(erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong

i will never know myself until i do this on my own
and i will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
i will never be anything 'til i break away from me
i will break away, i'll find myself today

i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
(erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong

i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
somewhere i belong

i am a little bit of loneliness
a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints, but i can't help the fact
that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want
what i want you to feel
but it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you
to just believe this is real

so i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but i'll be here, 'cause you're all that i've got

i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored

i am a little bit insecure
a little unconfident
'cause you don't understand, i do what i can
but sometimes, i don't make sense
i am what you never want to say
but i've never had a doubt
it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you
for once, just to hear me out

so i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but i'll be here, 'cause you're all that i've got

i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored

no! hear me out now!
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now! hear me out now!
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now!

i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored!

i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored

i can't feel
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored

i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared
but no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear
what am i leaving when i'm done here?

so, if you're asking me, i want you to know

when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest

don't be afraid
i've taken my beating, i've shared what i made
i'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
i've never been perfect, but neither have you

so, if you're asking me, i want you to know

when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest

forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are

when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest

forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
i can't be who you are

why does it feel like night today?
something in here's not right today
why am i so uptight today?
paranoia's all i got left
i don't know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head

like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time i lie
a face that laughs every time i fall
(and watches everything)
so i know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is here in me
right underneath my skin

it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

i know i've got a face in me
points out all my mistakes to me
you've got a face on the inside, too
and your paranoia's probably worse
i don't know what set me off first
but i know what i can't stand
everybody acts like the fact of the matter
is i can't add up to what you can

but everybody has a face that they hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
(and watches everything)
so you know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is watching you, too
right inside your skin

it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin

the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me
the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me

(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (i feel the light betray me)
(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within (i feel the light betray me)
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
(it's like) it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
hand grenade pins in every line
throw 'em up and let something shine
going out of my fucking mind
filthy mouth, no excuse
find a new place to hang this noose
string me up from atop these roofs
knot it tight so i won't get loose
truth is, you can stop and stare
bled myself out and no one cares
dug the trench out, laid down there
with a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
yeah, someone pour it in
make it a dirt dance floor, again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out

go, stop the show
choppy words and a sloppy flow
shotgun opera, lock and load
cock it back and then watch it go
mama, help me, i've been cursed
death is rolling in every verse
candy paint on his brand new hearse
can't contain him, he knows he works
fuck, this hurts, i won't lie
doesn't matter how hard i try
half the words don't mean a thing
and i know that i won't be satisfied
so why try ignoring him?
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out

i've opened up these scars
i'll make you face this!
i've pulled myself so far
i'll make you face this now!

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away

i bleed it out
i bleed it out
i bleed it out

yeah, yo
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
and though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
yeah

waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
it's out of my control

flying at the speed of light
thoughts were spinning in my head
so many things were left unsaid
it's hard to let you go

i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got

sitting in an empty room
trying to forget the past
this was never meant to last
i wish it wasn't so

i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got

yeah, yeah
what was left when that fire was gone?
i thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
all caught up in the eye of the storm
and trying to figure out what it's like moving on
and i don't even know what kind of things i said
my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
so, i'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
the hardest part of ending is starting again

(all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got)
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
(i'm holding on to what i haven't got)
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
though the words sound steady
something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
(holding on to what i haven't got)
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear

the cycle repeated
as explosions broke in the sky
all that i needed
was the one thing i couldn't find

and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know

we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground

the colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
i wanted to fix this
but couldn't stop from tearing it down

and you were there at the turn
caught in the burning glow
and i was there at the turn
waiting to let you know

we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground

you told me yes, you held me high
and i believed when you told that lie
i played soldier, you played king
and struck me down when i kissed that ring
you lost that right to hold that crown
i built you up but you let me down
so when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn

and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know

we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground

when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground

i cannot take this anymore
saying everything i've said before
all these words they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
less i hear, the less you say
you'll find that out anyway

just like before

everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break
i need a little room to breathe
'cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break

i find the answers aren't so clear
wish i could find a way to disappear
all these thoughts they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
nothing seems to go away
over and over again

just like before

everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break
i need a little room to breathe
'cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break
everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break
i need a little room to breathe
'cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to
break!

shut up when i'm talking to you!
shut up!
shut up!
shut up!
shut up when i'm talking to you!
shut up!
shut up!
shut up!
shut up!
i'm about to break!

everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break
i need a little room to breathe
'cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break
everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break
i need a little room to breathe
'cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to
break!
