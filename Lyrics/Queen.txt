i'd sit alone and watch your light
my only friend through teenage nights
and everything i had to know
i heard it on my radio

you gave them all those old time stars
through wars of worlds invaded by mars
you made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
you made us feel like we could fly (radio)
so don't become some background noise
a backdrop for the girls and boys
who just don't know or just don't care
and just complain when you're not there

you had your time, you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio (radio)

all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo, radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio blah blah
radio, what's new?
radio, someone still loves you

we watch the shows, we watch the stars
on videos for hours and hours
we hardly need to use our ears
how music changes through the years
let's hope you never leave, old friend
like all good things, on you we depend
so stick around 'cause we might miss you
when we grow tired of all this visual

you had your time, you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio (radio)

all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo, radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo, radio ga ga

i've paid my dues
time after time
i've done my sentence
but committed no crime
and bad mistakes
i've made a few
i've had my share of sand kicked in my face
but i've come through
(and i need to go on and on, and on, and on)

we are the champions, my friends
and we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
'cause we are the champions
of the world

i've taken my bows
and my curtain calls
you brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
i thank you all
but it's been no bed of roses
no pleasure cruise
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race
and i ain't gonna lose
(and i need to go on and on, and on, and on)

we are the champions, my friends
and we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
we are the champions

empty spaces, what are we living for?
abandoned places, i guess we know the score, on and on
does anybody know what we are looking for?
another hero, another mindless crime
behind the curtain, in the pantomime
hold the line
does anybody want to take it anymore?

the show must go on
the show must go on, yeah
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile, still, stays on

whatever happens, i'll leave it all to chance
another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
does anybody know what we are living for?
i guess i'm learning
i must be warmer now
i'll soon be turning, round the corner now
outside the dawn is breaking
but inside in the dark i'm aching to be free

the show must go on
the show must go on
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile, still, stays on

my soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
i can fly, my friends

the show must go on
the show must go on
i'll face it with a grin
i'm never giving in
on with the show

i'll top the bill
i'll overkill
i have to find the will to carry on
on with the show
show must go on
show must go on

i gotta get me a game plan
gotta shake you to the ground
just give me what i know is mine
people, do you hear me?
just give me the sign

it ain't much i'm asking
if you want the truth
here's to the future
for the dreams of youth

i want it all, i want it all
(give it all, i want it all)
i want it all, and i want it now (hey)
i want it all, i want it all
(yes, i want it all, hey)
i want it all, and i want it now

i'm a man with a one-track mind
so much to do in one lifetime
(people, do you hear me?)
not a man for compromise
and where's and why's and living lies
so i'm living it all (yes, i'm living it all)
and i'm giving it all
(and i'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
(i want it all)


it ain't much i'm asking
if you want the truth
here's to the future
hear the cry of youth
(hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

i want it all, i want it all
i want it all, and i want it now
i want it all, i want it all
(hey, yeah, yeah)
i want it all, and i want it now
(ooh, ooh) i want it now

i want it, i want it!
oooh, huh!

it started off so well
they said we made a perfect pair
i clothed myself in your glory and your love
how i loved you, how i cried
the years of care and loyalty
were nothing but a sham, it seems
the years belie, we lived a lie
i love you 'til i die

save me, save me, save me
i can't face this life alone
save me, save me, save me
i'm naked and i'm far from home

the slate will soon be clean
iâll erase the memories
to start again with somebody new
was it all wasted, all that love?
i hang my head and i advertise
a soul for sale or rent
i have no heart, i am cold inside
i have no real intent

save me, save me, save me
i can't face this life alone
save me, save me, oh
i'm naked and i'm far from home


each night i cry
i still believe the lie
i love you 'til i die (ow!)

save me, save me, save me (oh yeah)
yeah, save me (yeah)
save me, ooh (oh, save me)
don't let me face my life alone
save me, save me, ooh (save me)
i'm naked and i'm far from home
