bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
patna wanna challenge 'cause my pockets hella fatter
but he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
put hands on a man, fuck unity
ain't nothing between us, but space and opportunity
never been a sucker, never been a lame
stay in your lane, you can't see me like a stealth plane

jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit
i remote to a location where the broom sit
here i go street sweeper monday through friday
if not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
