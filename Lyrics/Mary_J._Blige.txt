to caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel

and you can leave me at the drop of a dime
swallowed my fears, stood by your side

but somehow it seems unfair to me (so unfair)
look at the circumstances
through sickness and health, 'til death do us part
those were the words that we said from our hearts
so now when you say that you're leaving me
i don't get that part

i was your lover and your secretary
working every day of the week

must've been crazy to think that you loved me
i saw all the signs but i just couldn't say nothing
i did the time across the line for you
'cause i can't see myself with nobody else but you
tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
should've been the one to hold me when i got lonely
'cause every time i think of the lies you told to me
make it easy for me to leave

you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me

oh, i was ridin' wherever you going
at times, i wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely
can't deny the fact you were my one and only
love that i would do, only love i knew
and now i gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy
this was a real thing
and i just can't deny the fact we don't belong together
guess it ain't the real thing
you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me

gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
there's so much to learn
when we trust the love that's deep in us
then love will return (yes, it will)
boy this thing was, a love lesson

you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me
you plus me 

it's been a long ride, but i made it here with love
i made it here with love, love
said i've been and up and down and i've been through it all
took a while to know my heart
oh, yes, it has, yeah
before a love like this, you go
through the fire and valley lows
but if you just hold on
please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

truth can be the sweetest pain
it can mess up everything
it's the only way you know
i'm payin' for it, i'm changin' for it
oh, oh, and it hurts
but i'll make it work
'cause i'm no beginner
i'm a winner, paid dues, i know my purpose

thought they'd put my life on hold
but i knew somethin' they didn't know
i know myself too much to ever fold
dark clouds, i'm movin' past you
oh, you gotta love yourself
if you really wanna be with someone else
you gotta feed yourself
before you feed somebody else
you gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'cause everybody don't mean you well
you gotta love yourself
before you love somebody else

yeah, gotta love yourself
uh, you know what i'm sayin'?

i decided not to use my color as a handicap
he a designer, artist, producer, and he rap
never found virtue from patience
in a dark room just pacin'
precious time is just wastin'
you do not know what we facin'
i cannot be complacent
in my job, be courageous
another kid just got shot
they can't find the assailant
made it out of the basement
made it out of the underground
from a time where you outta town
they might gun you down, blaow
there goes another round, blaow
there goes another round
came from this chi and wow, look what the fuck they found
a young legend, comin' to shut the summer down
you need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round
oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
if you really wanna be with someone else
you gotta feed yourself
before you feed somebody else
you gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'cause everybody don't mean you well
you gotta love yourself
you gotta love yourself
before you love somebody else

i don't feel no ways tired
can't get restless in my soul
hold your heart, the world is cold
keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
yeah, it will come to pass
don't worry 'bout nothin'
god knows that you're worth it
you deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you
