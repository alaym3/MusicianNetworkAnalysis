sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
bak jak burada, diktafonuna tak
kağıt, kalem bir de ilham alınacak
tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

we started in the midwest (midwest, midwest)
now we 'bout to take it (take it, take it, take it) all over the world, baby (baby, baby)
this is the pinnacle (pinnacle, pinnacle) yeah, tech n9ne (tech n9ne)

they can never manage, we do damage with no apology

frantic, i'ma jam it, 'cause i'm an oddity

i can pop at you proper 'cause i'm partners of waka flocka
gimme the top of hip-hop
and watch him make 'em rock with a show-stopper
chakras poppin' off the (worldwide choppers)
if you anybody, you notice it
tech is the pinnacle, not a identical soul is it
loaded, cold as the polar get
wrote it quick and they quoted it
yo, it exploded the flow, behold it, 'cause when the motor spit
abdiea, bdiea, never to get free of the real
better get just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
gimme the knock and i'ma chop
but he came and he went tomorrow
but i'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
hit 'em up and get 'em up
i ain't done, i ain't did enough
trippin' when i rip it, i be the ish when i spit 'em up
sorta like i was liquored up and backin' up in the gut
everybody be knowin' i be actin' up when i bust
from missouri to canada, i be keepin' the stamina
if you never been a fan of the man, the brand is unanimous
can i cuss? fuck anybody! tech is calamitous
leave 'em in the dust ain't nobody tough when i'm standin' up
tech is hostile, he's awful
and really be wicked when he be off in a bottle
you wit' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
he sick and he give it the poe and toss in picasso
killin' everybody off is the motto
and i be the only chopper that's tossed in a brothel
you said it's pathetic, my head is off in a taco
i sped and you bled and you in a coffin when i go

i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some, you can come bring it right here (worldwide choppers)
can't clown me, don't come 'round me
bow down, i was crowned when they found me

check it, i'm ahead of 'em
chop it up with the veterans
a legend developin'
ain't gotta tell him it's evident
gotta notice an elephant
none of you niggas relevant
you're delicate, but lovin' every second of this

de vil alle tjekke, når vi ligger det
kommer ind og smækker det, beatet - jeg vækker det
i ved hva', der kommer ud af min mund
hænger med de vildeste gutter
det minder mig om, vi stikker det af
for de kalder mig alle fucking chopper

what if i ran into you with a pogo stick
hopped up on top of you rappers like a jehovah's witness
with a photo of jesus and a paper pamphlet
and i threw up more churches like i was playin' hamlet
syllable burnin', that internal damage
swing, batter, batter, but then i lay back on a hammock
under an oak tree like i was peelin' pecans
but instead i'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sand-a-wich
pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a
motherfucka from westside, a 1987 box
i'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like i had a head of locks
feel every bump like you had bad shocks
but i hopped on the fuckin' beat and i worldwide chopped
wanna fuck with tech n9ne, twist up the pine
and smoke a beat with mr. busta rhymes? well sure, why not?
really don't need to show any more of my cock
but i run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
in a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
slumerican is out of control
heat it up, beat it up, then i gotta go
but i'ma dump truck, just send another load
peter piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
with an alien probe, i'm light years—

i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some, you can come bring it right here (worldwide choppers)
can't clown me, don't come 'round me
bow down, i was crowned when they found me

twista
like i gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
and hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
and then i'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
that everybody'll wanna devour the pieces
of my enemies 'cause of cannibalism
breakin' them off into particles
they get in a predicament that be never reversible
'cause a nigga be too versatile, makin' you nervous
you could never compete with the colonel
i burn you, i'm an immortal, and that's the reason i murder you
focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
after i wreck and check ya, then your respect i better have it
'cause i'm an anomaly, then i'ma give a lobotomy
to any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
hoppin', i don't stop with the fire when the flames thrown
i'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
we wwc, if you can't keep up shoulda stayed home
my alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers'
work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
so play me and i'ma be shinin' on them haters
i'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant i'ma be
like a helicopter when the words fly
entire families all the way out to you girl die
if i catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
don't even try to stop us, 'cause we choppers and we worldwide
and i'm—

i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some, you can come bring it right here (worldwide choppers)
can't clown me, don't come 'round me
bow down, i was crowned when they found me

see, now they ask when i'ma stomp on my dude
and when i'ma cock it and pop it and what i'ma drop on my dude
inevitably is that i'ma be the most incredible dude
to ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude (worldwide choppers)
and then they ask "what in the world is you provin'
when you were already the best?" and "what the hell is he doin'?"
well, i'ma be choppin' and cuttin'
and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
and fuckin' everything up 'til i make no further mistake and
bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry jamaican
and shuttin' everything up, especially the ones who be hatin'
they lovin' everything until i got 'em stutterin' stupid
you hear 'em now? "d-d-d-d-don't do-do-do-do it!
p-p-p-please, wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
w-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest"
and now i'ma come and kill 'em
get 'em, hit 'em and finish 'em
and bang 'em in the head and diminish them
and then i'll hit 'em again at a minimum
repeat it, comin' to killin' 'em
then he be gotta be drillin' 'em
thinkin', "they gotta be feelin' him!"
spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em
and gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' him
hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
and you're witnessin' the way that i be christenin' in the mic
and gettin' in the zone, i be flattenin' and packin' in
people from the front to the back and
they got me actin' a fool, i'm black and, nigga, now i'm home!

i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some, you can come bring it right here (worldwide choppers)
can't clown me, don't come 'round me
bow down, i was crowned when they found me

my fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
i'm choppin' 'em: call me michael myers in my vicinity
the way i be killin' 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
the gilla will finish any in a predicament (worldwide choppers)
any enemies in the vicinity, i gotta mack up
they know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
the history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
check my resume, they said the gillgod's biblical (worldwide choppers)

i hit 'em with venom when i get up in 'em
i bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
diggin' up in your brain and bringin' the pain
they often wanna kill me
fillin' 'em with that fury, get up and hurry
you can feel the real me
comin' up with that shit, i'm havin' a fit
and you will never peel me
off of you when i'm on top of you, i got the drop on you
and poppin' often, hit 'em up with a bullet to the (brain)
you can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin'
you're fiendin' and dreamin' to find a demon, name insane
i'm a worldwide (chopper)

i get to bustin' like i'm a thirty ought six
when i'm rippin' the beat up, but then i heard he got pissed
when i got at the top and they made him purty hot (uh)
'cause he knowin' that tecca nina's a dirty chopper (uh)
he's handle, holmes, here's a handful
how in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
i said to seven, "richie havens'll be the man"
so we put it together thinkin' eminem was a gamble (uh)
guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
kaliko said, "what we doin'?" – i said to him, "let's chop!"
so now the people finally get three of the best locked (uh)
never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga! (uh)
you're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
yes, i got another killer makin' a tour strong
if you thinkin' of battlin'—uh, you're gone!

nobody can catch him, he the speedy gonzales
the beat is a problem
and if you got your feet in your mouth
you gon' have to beat it up out of him
it's a lot of 'em, and i mean a lot of 'em
and me and nina used to follow them
i've got to audibly body them
this is it, man, the hitman, the ip man, karate 'em
and if fans will lift hands, we'll get dancin' out of 'em
and in kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
who stands with two hands up movin' the crowd of 'em
if i ain't makin' sense
then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
it ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
i beat 'em, i burn 'em (then i let 'em melt)
they never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up (uh)
i slap the shirt off a super simpleton, make 'em be impotent
if and when i be flippin', niggas be feminine (okay)
i said the purpose to pimp a pen
and reverse the conditions i'm livin' in
and do bigger numbers than eminem
gotta be fast, or i'll smash on a nigga
with half the cash i'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(ice cold) i make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
if you half-ass deliverin' i'ma eat your dinner (yum)
better than mine, oh no, not me, i mean other guys (okay)
i jump around, so do that mean that i'm rubberized? (okay)
me and n9ne master, meaning we murderize
we'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)
speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)

sometimes (go) i feel (go)
like i'll never slow down
(worldwide choppers)
sometimes (go) i feel (go)
like i'll never slow down
(worldwide choppers)

wait! before i wreck this beat, let me just check to see
if stephanie mills left any extra refills
of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (you inspect the sink?)
i'm in the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', i dabble in vics
but i might just swallow my fuckin' ritalin tablet after tonight
i'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a dracula bite
jetpack in a backpack when i write
all this anger pent-up inside
i went up inside a bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
figured i'd try to set a big enough fire
that'll trigger the sprinkler system
and i'd escape, but the getaway driver
screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
i went through the window
and ended up being pinned to the side
of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife brenda
the flight attendant from idaho
that took an antenna in the vagina hole
'cause when i pick up a pen i'm venomous
and i'm as slick as dennis the menace
like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
you've been yellin' dementedness
i invented this, i'm the genesis
eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
fuckin' smart alec degenerate, i got ellen degeneres
tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
you will never consider this a bitter disappointment
i'll never fail to deliver this
whatever the weather in this'll be
just like a certificate of authenticity that i'm thinkin' about
just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
to make 'em picket, i pick a day to be a prick
then i'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
spit it back on a level, incredible
head full of red bull, unforgettable
better believe these beats are edible
i consider loose leaf a vegetable
and i stalk my prey
you think you got away? uh-uh, not today
murder you on a song and then i'll just say
i was with dr. dre and robert blake, eatin' lobster, steak
and coffee cake at a restaurant with drake
and tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate
i'm a lot to take, like kanye walkin' up on the stage
for beyoncé, like it's my job to say
that you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
honest abe is on his way, you will not escape
ammunition replenished, the punisher
with his gun insured, hundred words
in a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
if you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
no wonder no one don't wanna go
and jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—

speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)
speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)

sometimes (go) i feel (go)
like i'll never slow down
(worldwide choppers)
sometimes (go) i feel (go)
like i'll never slow down
(worldwide choppers)

i'm the fury, the final fight
i flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
i flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
feminine fakers fall, i'm floggin' a foe with a fife
never forget it, i severed the head of a critic
i sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
i was never the devil, i put up a fight up in the industry
peddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
we reppin', beat checkin' he that be koba
if he's the evil enemy it'll be over
running you down, in front of your town
you ever makin' fun of the clown, i'm gunnin' you down
we doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
if anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
would never be choppin' without slick rick
i got it from the record "lick the balls" and this dick
if you never listen to me, you musical misfit
nah, 'cause every time i be droppin' i get bit
i'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
but the middle west got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
if you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'cause me and my nigga twista rule it—and this it

speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)
speedom! (if you wanna go with us)
speedom! (i'ma leave 'em in the dust)
speedom! (i must be the one to bust)
speedom! (and i'm gonna hit the clutch)

sometimes (go) i feel (go)
like i'll never slow down

you said you'd never ever break... down
but here i am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
you said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
but i've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
i've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, i broke my alarm
everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

we’re fragile
(wish i’d have known)
i never thought i’d be so fragile
(you’re not alone)
if it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(we’ve been here before)
i don’t ever want to change
i’m fragile
i don’t ever want…
i don't ever...

some of the people appointed to give an opinion
never do get it
i want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
n9na be givin' the remedy and why?
critics are really the enemy and i
can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
this jam will lay scripted
deaf and impeccable
write a rhyme and i put everything in a flow
i'm the n9ne i'ma look very mean
when a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
by the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
'cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
amateur writer dissin'
he's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks i'ma despise
never do try to listen
it's real - i'm mad
clueless when you scribble on your pad
how you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
you don't really get why i'm so pissed? understand this:
i'm an artist, and i'm sensitive about my shit, yes i'm

we’re fragile
(wish i’d have known)
i never thought i’d be so fragile
(you’re not alone)
if it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(we’ve been here before)
i don’t ever want to change
i’m fragile
i don’t ever want…
i don't ever...

tell me that i'm famous
tell me that my name is
big as venus jupiter and then uranus
tell me that your anus got your head in it
i can smell the articles and know you're heinous
tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
unconditional, i'm hoping i'm your favourite
grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
that's the feelin' i get when you're concentratin'
on this pen, on this pad
tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
stop...
puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
drop...
this is more than you, and this is more than you
and your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
what i call the realest comin' from a student
told myself to use a poem as an uzi
empty magazine, i seen a magazine
you seen my trigger finger, then i started shootin'
that was nicotine, i'm bout to smoke 'em all
and journalists involved should've known my music

we’re fragile
(wish i’d have known)
i never thought i’d be so fragile
(you’re not alone)
if it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(we’ve been here before)
i don’t ever want to change
i’m fragile
i don’t ever want…
i don't ever...

rumble, they gon' take yo' face off

brush myself off, my thoughts of a goddamn boss (woo)
i am at their neck like i'm malcolm x
like i'm dr. king, like i'm cornell west
like i'm huey p., like i'm booker t
like i'm rosa parks, i'ma need my rest
niggas know what i'm 'bout i'll run up in yo' house
feet up all on your couch, sock you right in your mouth
i ain't after no clout, it could really go south
i'm prepared to go to battle whenever there is a bout (ah)
i am muhammad
ali i'm payin' the homage, policy is to be honest
i take it beyond it though
i can relate to ebonics and really i hate to be ominous
all of your hate is too obvious
i am the hustle, the muscle, i play for the audience
i am a gangster with knowledge
if you wanna enter the ring, i would hate to be opposite
jab with the right, jab with the left
jab with the right, now you got 'em all staggerin'
he gon' come back with the right, back with the left
that's when you step to the side, now dagger
you gon' be damned if you do, damned if you don't
bastard, i'm like cassius, my swagger
it really don't matter pardon, i'm hardened
lawless, the martian kickin' that jargon (ah)

rumble, they gon' take your face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off

barber cape off how i'm giving the fade
based off the description i gave
cut the game off, i'm a street fighter
beat the brakes off like the whip on the stage
hand out ass whippings
my plate haters ate off, yeah, get hitler a steak
it'll be chaos like an emerald chase
when i face off in a nicolas cage
y-y-y-yeah, i'm living in rage
punch a pussy nigga like i'm fisting his babe
i was sitting in the 'spital, going mental, doc had told me
they'll forget me but they didn't, i remember them days
and i don't wanna be batman, nigga, i'm bane
literally how the venom enters my veins
since a little one, killa really been sick in the brain
and the more i think about it, my life was twisted, wait
reminiscing on when mom and dad would wonder
why they couldn't reach me like they didn't have my number
fighting for my sanity, i never had the hunger
put a nigga underground quick, that's a bunker
sh-shock 'em like i'm master's brother
better pick your battles, busters halfway under
hit more times than acupuncture
when it comes to rumbling, i'm afro thunder
really it be funny when i kick it to you dummies
how i'm grippin' on the iron when i'm rhyming on the mic
because it really will get bloody like i'm kicking it with buddies
when i beat a nigga up like i was iron nigga mike
i tell 'em they don't wanna tussle, when i'm at 'em, they gon' drop
bet you that he stumble when i jab him then i cross
leave a nigga humble like, "damn" when kenny dropped
'cause really we can rumble like jackie in the bronx
we gon'—

rumble, they gon' take your face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
they gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off (chyeah)

it's about drive, it's about power, we stay hungry, we devour
put in the work, put in the hours and take what's ours
black and samoan in my veins, my culture bangin' with strange
i change the game so what's my motherfuckin' name? (rock)
what they gonna get though?
desecration, defamation, if you wanna bring it to the masses
face to face now we escalatin' when i have to put boots to asses
mean on ya like a dream when i'm rumblin'
you're gonna scream, "mama"
so bring drama to the king brahma (then what?)
comin' at ya' with extreme mana (ahoo, ahoo, ahoo)

thank you brother, tech n9ne
thank you, teremana
one take, that's a wrap
face-off

i see you looking at me
(psst, hahaha, over here)
looking at me, so i ask

am i a psycho?
am i a psycho?
yeah, i’m a psycho
i guess i’m a psycho

you’re crazy! i like you, but you’re crazy
my tours paid me, so i used that dough to allure ladies
to manure bathe me
never that, my mind's for sure shady
pure hades, rev x said that he couldn’t endure to save me
why do i let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
when i felt that burn, i palm the clitoris, i'ma get her wet
sorry to get carried away
i feel stupid 'cause i ain’t did her yet
maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
i get vexed so n9ne bit her neck
open! i try to contain it, but that dame thang’s soakin'
alter ego say: "why you let them gangbang folk in?"
strange lane hopin' i can maintain copin'
but ain’t nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
i like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
from up on her walls, i’m sufferin', i’m stuck in her claws
stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', i'm a dog
afterwards i like really hot scaldin' water on my balls

am i a psycho?
am i a psycho?
yeah, i’m a psycho
i guess i’m a psycho

mom? dad? i’m no longer the boy you're used to seein'
i’ve changed a lot, plus i’ve grown to hate every human bein'
my mood swings have now turned
my dreams into gruesome scenes
now i’m doin' things i don’t normally do when illusion seem
to be the only pleasures i can gain
heck, if i was sane i would've put down the mic
and said, "fuck it, i'll never rise to fame."
but with the wicked wreckage i contain
i could probably jeopardize your name
no lovey-dovey, let’s ignite the flame
if you’re lucky you'll survive the pain
sorry, that ain't very merry to say
why is this game so scary to play?
well, let me think, 'cause every day
my balls are gettin' too hairy to shave
pause a minute, i'm stressin' again
if i go to hell, then heaven's to blame
i don’t mean to come off crazy
but you mothafuckas seem to think i’m hella deranged
when i was seven years old
i fell on my head and i severed my brain
you think i’m lyin'? then ask my mama
nigga, she'll go tell you the same—
should i be ashamed? no
i’m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
before you get bent out of shape
my nigga, let me ask you this

am i a psycho?
am i a psycho?
yeah, i’m a psycho
i guess i’m a psycho

i stab you with this mic, and rap this verse i'm rappin' to you
matter of fact, i’m rappin' through you
never say my motherfuckin' name
unless you absolutely have to
i am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes
and you are not no fashion guru
can’t even see you niggas, y'all wish i was rappin' to you
matter of fact, act like i'm rappin' to you
if that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
then just jump up out of conclusion
that i'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo
y'all ain’t even the shit, no, y'all ain’t even the doodoo
i got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
so i’m slappin' you foolish with wooden paddles, you stupid
babysittin' little bastards like little afternoon children
you can call me psychotic, but it’s more like schizophrenic
and i can't sleep, can anyone tell me
just where my medicine is?
guess i gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
man, i swear i'm all about my brain like graduate students
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to hurt your feelings
i see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
but i wonder how it would look
if i were to peel it back with a skillet
then i'ma feel it crack when i hit it
then i'ma split it back when you heal it
damn it, bobby boy! what in the hell?
what in the heaven? what in the earth?
where is your mom? what are you, cursed?
where are you from? where was your birth?
where was you first? why weren’t you in church?
why is there dirt all on your shirt?

am i a psycho?
am i a psycho?
yeah, i’m a psycho
i guess i’m a psycho
am i a psycho?
am i a psycho?
yeah, i’m a psycho
i guess i’m a psycho

i'm damagin' the vagina, remind you i'm filled with vengeance
hit 'em whenever they wanna run up and they doing it 'cause i rap and shit
i really don't care, whatever it takes to get 'em up on the mattress
i could have been the one that's on the run for busting a gun

they be hollering, hope i acknowledging because i have been methodically
dropping the common knowledge that i don’t get down like that

first entry for sickology 101: dysfunctional

yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
if you don't want me to lose it
step back if you don't want me to attack
i'm a beast, better give me the deuces
i have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
me, i wanna get dollars, don't wanna holler but you makin' me
i'm a little dysfunctional
you're the problem, please don't awaken me
and i'm that way 'cause back in the day most have forsaken me
la-di-da-di, i'm at the party
on a drunk night with a punk, might
dude's tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
that he ain't gotti, like i be, 'cause he
sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
but he don't know i'm roguish, surrounded by my soldiers
and they be locked and loaded when exploded you can't hold us
and we don't got no scruples
we didn't come to fight and shoot you
but you busters better be mutual
don't get loose because we cuckoo
listen, they call me genius, i run the show
women be on my penis, it's wonderful
demons think they the meanest
but i brung the foe on the floor
little bit sick, don't you know?

i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
if you fool around and make me mad
i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
might fool around and make me mad
don't make me mad

born to hustle, i'm a product of environment
the game done changed, so i've been forced into retirement
but i make moves and i paid dues and i got common sense
since i can't lose and i can't choose, then i'll come back to spit
i got hit songs but i've been gone so long that i don't fit
kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so i need me a lick
i write these songs but don't belong i'm on some other shit
i'm huntin leads in desperate need, i hope it's comin' quick
i'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
but it's so strange, my life has changed and i am not the same
i come around but since i'm down, it feels uncomfortable
i try to hide it deep inside but i'm dysfunctional
i never learned to hold it in, i gets emotional
first, implode and then explode, i am combustible
so please don't push me, play me, pussy, on some real shit
won't be defeated if i'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
if you fool around and make me mad
i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
might fool around and make me mad
don't make me mad

i ain't no killer but don't push me
goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
could be carrying something up under my hoodie
krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
now i wanna be peaceful, but i carry desert eagles where
ever black people are, you know how black people are
i peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
emotions get the best of me, messed up
and then y'all get the rest of me
depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
i know y'all think less of me, 'cause i'm always sick
and i can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
it's gon' be the death of me, i need depakote
just to cope, while i keep throwin' them pills down my throat
dysfunctional blunts will do smokin' bombay
can give me fung shui, but i wish that it all would go away
or maybe i should pray for jesus christ to just un-pretzel me
tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
so i just take another couple doses, probably be fine
but if you get too close you'll find out that i

i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
if you fool around and make me mad
i'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
if you push me it might be bad
get a little emotional, don't you know?
might fool around and make me mad
don't make me mad

i ain’t talkin' about women, i’m talkin' about paper
d-loc and dalima enter the center
and get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill 'em
i spit like a fully and ready made, through any type of weather
with the beretta tucked right under my sweater
and we hotter than lava
the way that my gillas be keepin' it poppin'
partner you tight, but my gillas are better
we keep it choppin' like a blender, eatin' boys up for dinner
guillotines, we chop your heads off, and throw 'em out the window
we too critical, we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful
the agt we be the number one contenders
(when it come to the street we still post on the block)
40 cal. on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops
on the way to the studio to go and make another hot track
they be lovin' the way that we spit it when we drop
they call me d-locsta the vulture, the definition of a soldier
my opposition is more culture than rocha
i spit like a tommy and anybody in my way i’ma fold 'em
and me and my gilla gorillas want it 'cause we the coldest boys
be tryin' to battle 'cause they want our position
but they can never get in it because we better and bigger
and like i told you we the number one competitors dealin'
workin' their way up to the top and they won't stop til they get the millions
in a whole 'nother century the d-loc and dalima
chemistry, you can never cross with them
igganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala
iggertra eavela otherma uckerfay’s lost
you can try to read us, you can try to beat us
try to get your speed up, but it ain’t gon' matter

hollow your brain ‘cause i’m a disaster
dalima get ridiculous if i’m comin’ at you
leave ‘em in a predicament 'cause i’m a style master
and i’m not impressionable, now just so you know

whenever you wanna flex we can go, keep stressin’ your cold
and i bet i leave your neck on the floor

and we glow like when the four strike with the fire
(it ain’t nothin’ you can say though)
‘cause i’m sipin’ on henny and bustin' like a semi on enemies now
irritated with the haters that be coming around
so i’m kickin' like a relevant but an arrogant style
meaning that i’m really sure so
i’m too sick for a cure, so
ain’t a need for a doctor
my verbal word play be making your nerves shake cause i caught you
pants down when i popped you
now let’s take a trip through the valley of real gill
strange individuals with a militant ill skill
pop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill
get down for the cause, cause we flossin' big wheels, (what up with it?)
don’t be acting like you get tough with it
when the choppers come out the truck spitting
all of the strange gill killas gon' be devoted to leavin' your body smokin' when really you can’t get up with us
(and that’s game that’s proper)
‘cause whenever i’m bustin’ it’s like a full heart stopper
dalima, tecca nina, kaliko, and d-loc
rippin' ‘em up with the flow 'cause we’re midwest choppers! (choppers!)

get a spitter with a bit of bitter marketed with
scrilla then a fifth of henny liquor, start to twist it
critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas
pit of killers, gritters hit a clique of silly niggas are fictitious
on top of the game, i'm dropping the rain, godly gifted
hop in ya lane and stopping yo fame, bark is vicious
you got bars to witness, ya submissive
when i get ya brain ya thoughts is shifted
i'm incredible, highly technical, meant for triumph,  raw intricate
i need medical then more science, scars and stitches
alphabetical gems blow by him, pause a tidbit
tech n9ne a mental giant!

mentally i'm like shaq on stilts
strange music inc. is white and black owned built
for keeping rap on tilt
like drinking patrón and jack prone then yack on silk quilts
got a fat dome that'll last long if that's where i'm skilled
giant, huge, humongous, gigantic, expanded
been floating for years and i ain't landed
haters can't stand it the way that my noggin is big as kansas
but the women that listen wanna know if i'm talking 'bout my damn dick

(he's a mental giant)
tech n9ne
(he's a mental giant)

evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart!

fucking right, i'm a maniac and i'm loving it
call me anything but my motherfucking government
i can love a bit, no, a big my love'll get
but in my brain i stay insane and i'm always on some other shit!
really wanna fuck a bitch, e.b. can't get enough of this
see me take what i stuck her with then i gotta run and give it to another chick
gutter trick, suck a dick! state the texture of a brick
making them magnum rubbers split, what a prick, the brother's sick!
now back to my love, like to go there
even when it's annoying like long nose hair
i can so share my heart in the cold air
and it's no fair, the size of it is so rare
bloody murder, muddy word of wretched death rhymes
take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
call me chakra-tease or you can call me tech n9ne
but since i found my new sinister out of respect i'm

what's my name?
what's my name?
what's my name?
ebah!
what's my name?

ebah!
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart

liberate me, lord
i'm an angel and on this wicked planet nobody understands my angle is love
i was sent from above, but i've landed in blood
psycho bandit, i've become a frightful damage and scuffed
missile you mitchells are misinformed and mixed in the middle of my menace
murderous, michael myers' my mimic
mom, you made a monster, i'm making minions in minutes
money motivated mishap asmodeus monikers mended
feel like i'm on molly, heart as big as my body
when a hottie gets naughty, it's racing like a ferrari
my obese heart swelling when it beats hard, telling me
to freak, not willing, like a beast, i'm yelling
bloody murder, muddy word of wretched death rhymes
take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
call me chakra-tease or you can call me tech n9ne
but since i found my new sinister out of respect i'm

what's my name?
what's my name?
ebah!
what's my name
what's my name?
ebah!
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart

my heart, smell like, vanilla icing
if slicing my chest open, a light beam of nice things
of christ brings bright wings, placement from thy king
night seems, right around the corner in my dreams
horse﻿ shit, piss and human puke is this smell
to whom ever wondered my level, this is hell
inside my crown i kill a gangster with fecies pig tail
and i'll live a 137 years like ishmael
yeah.. nigga, it ain't misspelled
e.b.a.h, there go creepy a. yates
using women as a bait, and they face, fishscale!
just another nut, all the others suck
sweet as a buttercup and fake as a rubber duck
evil brain, angel heart, yes, i utter much
and i never cover up, why? (i'm a klusterfuk)

what's my name? ebah!
what's my name? ebah!
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart
evil brain, angel heart

and luckily 'cause of your past, you can have someone assist ya
i was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
i swore to never let a man's hands take me to my grave nigga

i know they dyin' to get it with the n9ne
that's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
so i'ma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
it's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with tech, get the rifles
totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the eiffel
if you psycho, you can do this, if he chooses to be foolish
the gun never loses, never give you the deuces
nigga, this is su'wu biz, ahh!
let me calm my nerves, i'ma simply put this on the word
if ya hella aggravated 'cause of a song ya heard from the n9na
i smoke a nigga like my ganja herb

ayy, fuck all that goin' back and forth with a nigga
got a problem, what he really wanna do?
if you know like i know, then you know, true
and niggas make songs but they really don't do
what they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
he afraid, i'll lay a nigga down right now
face to the concrete, nose to the ground
do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
and the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
but a whole body down and a hole in the ground
dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
better know i got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
and then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
ya pull that off, i'll believe you ain't soft
otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
i'll kill ya dead and i put that on my mother eyes
don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
how they got a bunch of guns? shot 'em all a bunch of times
i really do believe tech got a bunch of nines
before they gave my nigga meech a bunch of time
i really know my nigga young had a bunch of pies
for the low, all my niggas headed for the high
so you believe them niggas out there talking bout they bmf?
that's your business nigga, none of mine
i know young gotti 'bout what he rap 'bout
i really pulled meek millz out the trap house
just like i seen doe b with a oz

haahahahahaha!
man, we just killed a small village man
you know what i'm sayin'?
this hip-hop, aha! love this shit

strangeulation i

hmm... tech n9ne!
smashes the masses, but the industry's hatin' asses

strange days, when your favorite rapper's poppin'
but "is he on top?" is something you can't gauge
especially when he's toppin' the charts
and you see me, k. lamar, and macklemore sharing the same stage
i'm the nigga all these artists look up to
yet for tech, it's been the hardest to bust through
but i keep my fans fiendin' like clucks do
you don't like how we living, well... ("fuck you")
i dominate your conglomerate, want a beating? i can accommodate
it'll be a non-debate, coming up against aaron the great
so many got arms, legs and necks tatted, strange
'cause music, show, conceptually, i'm the best at it
let's have it for all of these tech addicts
any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
aimin' at 'em and it's agony
burner blew his brain in back and these
cannons came and caved in cavity, caliber connect, cap it
yo, there it go, red is in my head, it grow
headed fo', lead and deaded, yeah, the medic said it so
let it grow, shred it and get no credits, so pathetic though
dread embedded steppin' in heaven's crevice, wet and edible
give her the shivers when i deliver this
hit her then quit her 'cause she's on twitter shit
and when she compared me to eminem, i said "i'm different"
she said "how?", i said "i'm black and i can say 'nigger', bitch!"
to him, i may be just another bro with a flow
who'll probably never tour 'cause it'll be thousands of juggalos at a show
and i heard fatalities happen on each side, so that's never no let it go
so i get it, i keep what i'm makin' incredible, all of them scared of a negro
strangeulation, this occupation so scandalous
we stop the hatin', no chances
when i rock the nation, so danzig
i'm killing all these niggas, operation code kansas
strange gang plain triggered assassins
got a bunch of untamed aimed trained spitters a' blastin'
my insane brain sayin' "give up the rappin'
and go back to the gang bang thang", nigga, what's happenin'? soo-woo
