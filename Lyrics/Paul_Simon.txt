a man walks down the street
he says, "why am i soft in the middle, now?
why am i soft in the middle?
the rest of my life is so hard
i need a photo-opportunity
i want a shot at redemption
don't want to end up a cartoon
in a cartoon graveyard"
bonedigger, bonedigger
dogs in the moonlight
far away in my well-lit door
mr. beerbelly, beerbelly
get these mutts away from me
you know, i don't find this stuff amusing anymore

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can be your long lost pal
i can call you betty
and betty, when you call me, you can call me al

a man walks down the street
he says, "why am i short of attention?
got a short little span of attention
and, whoa, my nights are so long
where's my wife and family?
what if i die here?
who'll be my role model
now that my role model is gone, gone?"
he ducked back down the alley
with some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
all along, along
there were incidents and accidents
there were hints and allegations

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can be your long lost pal
i can call you betty
and betty, when you call me, you can call me al
call me al


a man walks down the street
it's a street in a strange world
maybe it's the third world
maybe it's his first time around
doesn't speak the language
he holds no currency
he is a foreign man
he is surrounded by the sound, the sound
cattle in the marketplace
scatterlings and orphanages
he looks around, around
he sees angels in the architecture
spinning in infinity
he says, "amen and hallelujah!"

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can be your long lost pal
i can call you betty
and betty, when you call me, you can call me al
call me

na na na na, na na na na
na na na na, na na na-na na-na
na na na na, na-na na-na na na
na na na na, na na na na

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can call you betty
if you'll be my bodyguard
i can call you betty
if you'll be my bodyguard

the mama pajama rolled outta bed
and she ran to the police station
when the papa found out, he began to shout
and he started the investigation

it's against the law, it was against the law
what the mama saw, it was against the law

the mama looked down and spit on the ground
every time my name gets mentioned
the papa said "oy! if i get that boy
i'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

well i'm on my way, i don't know where i'm going
i'm on my way, i'm taking my time, but i don't know where
goodbye to rosie, the queen of corona
seein' me and julio down by the schoolyard
seein' me and julio down by the schoolyard


in a couple of days, they're gonna take me away
but the press let the story leak
when the radical priest come to get me released
we was all on the cover of newsweek

well i'm on my way, i don't know where i'm going
i'm on my way, i'm taking my time, but i don't know where
goodbye to rosie, the queen of corona
seein' me and julio down by the schoolyard
seein' me and julio down by the schoolyard
seein' me and julio down by the schoolyard

"the problem is all inside your head," she said to me
"the answer is easy if you take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be fifty ways to leave your lover"
she said, "it's really not my habit to intrude
furthermore, i hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
but i'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude"
there must be fifty ways to leave your lover
fifty ways to leave your lover

"you just slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just get yourself free
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free
ooh, slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just listen to me
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free"

she said, "it grieves me so to see you in such pain
i wish there was something i could do to make you smile again"
i said "i appreciate that, and would you please explain
about the 50 ways?"
she said, "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
and i believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light"
and then she kissed me, and i realized she probably was right
there must be fifty ways to leave your lover
fifty ways to leave your lover

"you just slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just get yourself free
oh, you hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free
slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just listen to me
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free"

the mississippi delta
was shining like a national guitar
i am following the river down the highway
through the cradle of the civil war

i'm going to graceland, graceland
memphis, tennessee, i'm going to graceland
poor boys and pilgrims with families
and we are going to graceland
my traveling companion is nine years old
he is the child of my first marriage
but i've reason to believe
we both will be received in graceland

she comes back to tell me she's gone
as if i didn't know that
as if i didn't know my own bed
as if i'd never noticed
the way she brushed her hair from her forehead
and she said losing love
is like a window in your heart
everybody sees you're blown apart
everybody sees the wind blow

i'm going to graceland
memphis, tennessee, i'm going to graceland
poor boys and pilgrims with families
and we are going to graceland
and my traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets
i'm looking at ghosts and empties
but i've reason to believe
we all will be received in graceland

there is a girl in new york city
who calls herself the human trampoline
and sometimes when i'm falling, flying
or tumbling in turmoil i say
"whoa, so this is what she means"
she means we're bouncing into graceland
and i see losing love
is like a window in your heart
well, everybody sees you're blown apart
everybody feels the wind blow

ooh
in graceland, graceland
i'm going to graceland
for reasons i cannot explain
there's some part of me wants to see graceland
and i may be obliged to defend
every love, every ending
or maybe there's no obligations now
maybe i've a reason to believe
we all will be received in graceland

(ooh)

woah
in graceland, graceland, graceland
i'm going to graceland

she's a rich girl
she don't try to hide it
diamonds on the soles of her shoes
he's a poor boy
empty as a pocket
empty as a pocket with nothing to lose
sing ta na na
ta na na na
she got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
she got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
diamonds on the soles of her shoes
diamonds on the soles of her shoes
people say she's crazy
she got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
well that's one way to lose these walking blues
diamonds on the soles of her shoes
she was physically forgotten
then she slipped into my pocket
with my car keys
she said you've taken me for granted
because i please you
wearing these diamonds
and i could say oo oo oo
as if everybody knows
what i'm talking about
as if everybody here would know
exactly what i was talking about
talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes
she makes the sign of a teaspoon
he makes the sign of a wave
the poor boy changes clothes
and puts on after-shave
to compensate for his ordinary shoes
and she said honey take me dancing
but they ended up sleeping
in a doorway
by the bodegas and the lights on
upper broadway
wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes
and i could say oo oo oo
as if everybody here would know
what i was talking about
i mean everybody here would know exactly
what i was talking about
talking about diamonds
people say i'm crazy
i got diamonds on the soles of my shoes
well that's one way to lose these walking blues
diamonds on the soles of my shoes

i met my old lover on the street last night
she seemed so glad to see me, i just smiled
and we talked about some old times
and we drank ourselves some beers

still crazy after all these years
oh, still crazy after all these years

i’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
i seem to lean on old familiar ways
and i ain’t no fool for love songs
that whisper in my ears

still crazy after all these years
oh, still crazy after all these years

four in the morning
crapped out, yawning
longing my life away
i’ll never worry
why should i?
it’s all gonna fade

now i sit by my window, and i watch the cars
i fear i’ll do some damage one fine day
but i would not be convicted
by a jury of my peers

still crazy after all these years
oh, still crazy
still crazy
still crazy after all these years

it was a slow day
and the sun was beating
on the soldiers by the side of the road
there was a bright light
a shattering of shop windows
the bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio

these are the days of miracle and wonder
this is the long distance call
the way the camera follows us in slo-mo
the way we look to us all
the way we look to a distant constellation
that's dying in a corner of the sky
these are the days of miracle and wonder
and don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

it was a dry wind
and it swept across the desert
and it curled into the circle of birth
and the dead sand
falling on the children
the mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth

these are the days of miracle and wonder
this is the long distance call
the way the camera follows us in slo-mo
the way we look to us all
the way we look to a distant constellation
that's dying in a corner of the sky
these are the days of miracle and wonder
and don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

it's a turn-around jump shot
it's everybody jump start
it's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
medicine is magical and magical is art
think of the boy in the bubble
and the baby with the baboon heart
and i believe
these are the days of lasers in the jungle
lasers in the jungle somewhere
staccato signals of constant information
a loose affiliation of millionaires
and billionaires and baby

these are the days of miracle and wonder
this is the long distance call
the way the camera follows us in slo-mo
the way we look to us all
the way we look to a distant constellation
that's dying in a corner of the sky
these are the days of miracle and wonder
and don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry
oooooh...

{intro}

when i think back on all the crap i learned in high school
it’s a wonder i can think at all
and though my lack of education hasn’t hurt me none
i can read the writing on the wall

kodachrome
they give us those nice bright colors
they give us the greens of summers
makes you think all the world’s a sunny day, oh yeah
i got a nikon camera
i love to take a photograph
so mama don’t take my kodachrome away

if you took all the girls i knew when i was single
and brought them all together for one night
i know they’d never match my sweet imagination
everything looks worse in black and white

kodachrome
they give us those nice bright colors
they give us the greens of summers
makes you think all the world’s a sunny day, oh yeah
i got a nikon camera
i love to take a photograph
so mama don’t take my kodachrome away

mama don’t take my kodachrome away
mama don’t take my kodachrome away
mama don’t take my kodachrome away

mama don’t take my kodachrome
mama don’t take my kodachrome
mama don’t take my kodachrome away

mama don’t take my kodachrome
leave your boy so far from home
mama don’t take my kodachrome away

mama don’t take my kodachrome
oh-oooh-oooh-oooh
mama don’t take my kodachrome away
{outro}
okay

she looked me over
and i guess she thought i was all right
all right in a sort of a limited way
for an off-night
she said, "don't i know you
from the cinematographer's party?"
i said, "who am i
to blow against the wind?"

i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head
i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head

she said, "there's something about you
that really reminds me of money"
she is the kind of a girl
that could say things that weren't that funny
i said, "what does that mean
i really remind you of money?"
she said, "who am i
to blow against the wind?"

i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head
i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head

she moved so easily
all i could think of was sunlight
i said, "aren't you the woman
who was recently given a fulbright?"
she said, "don't i know you
from the cinematographer's party?"
i said, "who am i
to blow against the wind?"

i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head
i know what i know
i'll sing what i said
we come and we go
that's a thing that i keep in the back of my head

i know what i know
i know what i know
i know what i know
i know what i know

joseph's face was black as night
the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
his path was marked
by the stars in the southern hemisphere
and he walked his days
under african skies

this is the story of how we begin to remember
this is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
after the dream of falling and calling your name out
these are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain
in early memory
mission music
was ringing 'round my nursery door
i said take this child, lord
from tucson, arizona
give her the wings to fly through harmony
and she won't bother you no more

joseph's face was as black as the night
and the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
his path was marked
by the stars in the southern hemisphere
and he walked the length of his days
under african skies

i'm accustomed to a smooth ride
or maybe i'm a dog who's lost its bite
i don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
i don't expect to sleep through the night
some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
but i say why
why deny the obvious child?
why deny the obvious child?
and in remembering a road sign
i am remembering a girl when i was young
and we said these songs are true
these days are ours
these tears are free
and hey
the cross is in the ballpark
the cross is in the ballpark

we had a lot of fun
we had a lot of money
we had a little son and we thought we'd call him "sonny"
sonny gets married and moves away
sonny has a baby and bills to pay
sonny gets sunnier
day by day by day by day

i've been waking up at sunrise
i've been following the light across my room
i watch the night receive the room of my day
some people say the sky is just the sky
but i say:
why deny the obvious child?
why deny the obvious child?

sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself
how it's strange that some rooms are like cages
sonny's yearbook from high school
is down from the shelf
and he idly thumbs through the pages
some have died
some have fled from themselves
or struggled from here to get there
sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
runs his hand through his thinning brown hair

well i'm accustomed to a smoother ride
or maybe i'm a dog that's lost his bite
i don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
i don't expect to sleep the night
some people say a lie is just a lie
but i say the cross is in the ballpark
why deny the obvious child?

no, i would not give you false hope
on this strange and mournful day
but the mother and child reunion
is only a motion away

oh, little darling of mine
i can't for the life of me
remember a sadder day
i know they say let it be
but it just don't work out that way
and the course of a lifetime runs
over and over again

no, i would not give you false hope
on this strange and mournful day
but the mother and child reunion
is only a motion away

oh, little darling of mine
i just can't believe it's so
though it seems strange to say
i never been laid so low
in such a mysterious way
and the course of a lifetime runs
over and over again

but i would not give you false hope (no)
on this strange and mournful day
when the mother and child reunion
is only a motion away

oh, the mother and child reunion is only a motion away
oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away (oh)
oh, the mother and child reunion is only a motion away
oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away (oh)
oh, the mother and child reunion, oh, is only a motion away
oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away, way, way, way

i was having this discussion
in a taxi heading downtown
rearranging my position
on this friend of mine who had a little bit of a breakdown
i said, "hey, you know, breakdowns come and breakdowns go, so
what are you going to do about it? that's what i'd like to know"

you don't feel you could love me
but i feel you could
it was in the early morning hours
when i fell into a phone call
believing i had supernatural powers
i slammed into a brick wall
i said, "hey, is this my problem? is this my fault?
if that's the way it's going to be i'm going to call the whole thing to a halt"

you don't feel you could love me
but i feel you could
i was walking down the street
when i thought i heard this voice say
"say, ain't we walking down the same street together
on the very same day?"
i said, "hey, senorita, that's astute" i said
"why don't we get together and call ourselves an institute?"

you don't feel you could love me
but i feel you could
i was having this discussion
in a taxi heading downtown

couple in the next room bound to win a prize
they've been going at it all night long
well, i'm trying to get some sleep
but these motel walls are cheap
lincoln duncan is my name, and here's my song
here's my song

my father was a fisherman
my mama was the fisherman's friend
and i was born in the boredom and the chowder
so when i reached my prime, i left my home in the maritimes
headed down the turnpike for new england
sweet new england

holes in my confidence
holes in the knees of my jeans
i was left without a penny in my pocket
ooh-oowee, i was about destituted as a kid could be
and i wished i wore a ring so i could hock it
i'd like to hock it

a young girl in a parking lot was preaching to a crowd
singing sacred songs and reading from the bible
well, i told her i was lost
and she told me all about the pentecost
and i seen that girl as the road to my survival
i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know

just later on the very same night
when i crept to her tent with a flashlight
and my long years of innocence ended
well, she took me to the woods
saying here comes something and it feels so good
and just like a dog, i was befriended
i was befriended

oh, oh, what a night
oh what a garden of delight
even now that sweet memory lingers
i was playing my guitar lying underneath the stars
just thanking the lord for my fingers
for my fingers

i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know

when i was a little boy (when i was just a boy)
and the devil would call my name
i’d say, “now who do
who do you think you’re fooling?”
i’m a consecrated boy
singer in a sunday choir
oh, my mama loves me, she loves me
she get down on her knees and hug me
oh, she loves me like a rock
she rock me like the rock of ages
and she loves me
she love me, love me, love me, love me
when i was grown to be a man
and the devil would call my name
i’d say “now who do
who do you think you’re fooling?”
i’m a consummated man
i can snatch a little purity
my mama loves me, she loves me
she get down on her knees and hug me
oh, she loves me like a rock
she rock me like the rock of ages
and loves me
she love me, love me, love me, love me
and if i was the president
the minute the congress called my name
i’d say “now who do
who do you think you’re fooling?”
i’ve got the presidential seal
i’m up on the presidential podium
my mama loves me, she loves me
she get down on her knees and hug me
boy she loves me like a rock
she rock me like the rock of ages
and love me

she love me, love me, love me, love me, love me like a rock
she love me love me like a rock
love me, love me, love me love me like a rock, oh baby...
she love me, love me, love me, love me...

many's the time i've been mistaken
and many times confused
yes, and i've often felt forsaken
and certainly misused
oh, but i'm all right, i'm all right
i'm just weary to my bones
still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
so far away from home
so far away from home

i don't know a soul who's not been battered
i don't have a friend who feels at ease
i don't know a dream that's not been shattered
or driven to its knees
oh, but it's all right, it's all right
for we've lived so well so long
still, when i think of the road we're traveling on
i wonder what's gone wrong
i can't help it, i wonder what's gone wrong

and i dreamed i was dying
i dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
and looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly
and i dreamed i was flying
and high up above, my eyes could clearly see
the statue of liberty sailing away to sea
and i dreamed i was flying

we come on the ship they call the mayflower
we come on the ship that sailed the moon
we come in the age's most uncertain hour
and sing an american tune
but it's all right, it's all right, all right
you can't be forever blessed
still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
and i'm trying to get some rest
that's all i'm trying to get some rest

one and one-half wandering jews
free to wander wherever they choose
are traveling together in the
sangre de christo, the
blood of christ mountains of new mexico

on the last leg of a journey
they started a long time ago
the arc of a love affair
rainbows in the high desert air

mountain passes slipping into stone
hearts and bones
hearts and bones
hearts and bones

thinking back to the season before
looking back through the cracks in the door
two people were married
the act was outrageous
the bride was contagious
she burned like a bride

these events may have had some effect
on the man with the girl by his side
the arc of a love affair
his hands rolling down her hair

love like lightning shaking till it moans
hearts and bones
hearts and bones
hearts and bones

and whoa-oh-oh
she said: “why?
why don’t we drive through the night?
we’ll wake up down in mexico”
oh, i
i don’t know nothin’ about
nothin’ about no mexico
and tell me why
why won’t you love me
for who i am where i am?
he said, “cause that’s not the way the world is, baby
this is how i love you, baby
this is how i love you, baby"

one and one-half wandering jews
returned to their natural coasts
to resume old acquaintances and
step out occasionally and
speculate who had been damaged the most

easy time will determine if these consolations
will be their reward
the arc of a love affair
waiting to be restored

you take two bodies and you twirl them into one
their hearts and their bones
and they won’t come undone
hearts and bones
hearts and bones
hearts and bones

fat charlie the archangel sloped into the room

this time the joke is on me
well, i have no opinion about that
and i have no opinion about me
somebody could walk into this room
and say, "your life is on fire!
it's all over the evening news
all about the fire in your life on the evening news"

i don't want no part of this crazy love
i don't want no part of your love
i don't want no part of this crazy love
i don't want no part of your love

he says, "well this will eat up a year of my life
and then there's all that weight to be lost"
she says the joke is on me

i said, "i have no opinion about that"
well, we'll just have to wait and confer

i don't want no part of this crazy love
i don't want no part of your love
i don't want no part of this crazy love
i don't want no part of your love
i don't want no part of this crazy love

he came from my hometown
he wore his passion for his woman
like a thorny crown
he said, “delores, i live in fear
my love for you’s so overpowering
i’m afraid that i will disappear”
slip slidin’ away
slip slidin’ away
you know the nearer your destination
the more you’re slip slidin’ away
and, i know a woman
became a wife
these are the very words she uses to describe her life
she said, “a good day
ain’t got no rain”
she said, “a bad day’s when i lie in bed
and think of things that might have been”
slip slidin’ away
slip slidin’ away
you know the nearer your destination
the more you’re slip slidin’ away
and i know a father
who had a son
he longed to tell him all the reasons
for the things he’d done
he came a long way
just to explain
he kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
then he turned around and headed home again
slip slidin’ away
slip slidin’ away
you know the nearer your destination
the more you’re slip slidin’ away
god only knows
god makes his plan
the information’s unavailable
to the mortal man
we’re working our jobs
collect our pay
believe we’re gliding down the highway
when in fact we’re slip slidin’ away
slip slidin’ away
slip slidin’ away
you know the nearer your destination
the more you’re slip slidin’ away
