first things first: rest in peace uncle phil

don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

no role models and i'm here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin' through my memory, my memory, i couldn't find one
last night i was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
not trina but i swear to god, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
and tell her, "hey, what's good?
sorry, i'm never comin' home, i'ma stay for good"
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
ain't got no shame 'bout it
she think i'm spoiled and i'm rich 'cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said, "nah, i was the same without it"
but then i thought back, back to a better me
before i was a b-list celebrity
'fore i started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

one time for my l.a. sisters
one time for my l.a. hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know

don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

i want a real love, dark-skinned aunt viv love
that jada and that will love
that leave a toothbrush at your crib love
and you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
nigga, i don't want no bitch from reality shows
out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
out in hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
she deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
you think if i didn't rap she would flirt back?
takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"i'ma need my shirt back" (nigga, you know how it go)

one time for my l.a. sisters
one time for my l.a. hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know

don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

there's an old saying in tennessee—i know it's in texas, probably in tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. fool me—can't get fooled again.

fool me one time, shame on you (ayy)
fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (ayy)
fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
load the chopper, let it rain on you (bop bop bop)
fool me one time, shame on you (ayy)
fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (ayy)
fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
load the chopper, let it rain on you (bop bop bop)

paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
no heater, but a nigga made heat, may i vent?

‘cause i had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
childish shit, you know child and shit
anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
now a nigga signed to hov, took a power trip
back home, i'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
the same clubs that i used to get tossed out
life got kriss kross'd: totally crossed out
‘cause now i'm in this bitch and i'm totally bossed out
old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
but i'm still on you, i'm still on you
my drink spill on me, while i feel on you, i'm sayin'—

ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
i'm in your city and i'm wonderin' if you're home now
went and found a man, but i'm hopin' you're alone now
can't help but feeling like i dropped the ball, cliché
i used to pop up on you at the mall each day
now, typically i kick game like east bay
but you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "please play!"
for pete's sake, homie, pull it together
just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

baby, i want you to want me
would you believe me if i said i'm in love?

back when i was sleeping in my mama crib
*space bar tap*

cole
cole world
yeah
let me take y'all back, man
as i do so well
wadn't nuttin' like that
man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

first time, she was in my math class (uh-huh)
long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
the teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
it started off so innocent
she had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
i was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
but a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when i seen
them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
got me daydreamin', man, what
i'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
attractions gettin' deep and
wet dreamin', thinkin' that i'm smashin' but i'm sleepin'
i want it bad, and i ain't never been obsessed before
she wrote a note that said, "you ever had sex before?"
damn…

and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no

i wrote back and said
"of course i had sex before," knowin' i was frontin'
i said, "i'm like a pro, baby," knowin' i was stuntin'
but if i told the truth, i knew that i'd get played out, son
hadn't been in pussy since the day i came out one, but
she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"oh, you a pro, homie? well, i want you to show me
my mama gone for the weekend
so saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
that's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
baby, you done woke my lil' man up
i'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
teacher, please, don't make me stand up, i wrote back like
"yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
but i was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
talkin' shit, knowin' damn well i was a virgin
fuck…

and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no

yeah, you know that feelin' when you know
you finna bone for the first time?
i'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
i'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
and most of all i'm prayin', "god, don't let me bust quick"
i'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
i'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
with a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
that's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
and a nigga roll over on top
and then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
on me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how i practiced
but right before i put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"i wanna get somethin' off my mental
i can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"

‘cause i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no

even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round

they tell me i should fix my grill ‘cause i got money now
i ain't gon' sit around and front like i ain't thought about it
a perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
my shit is crooked—look at how far i done got without it!
i keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
we ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
i got smart, i got rich and i got bitches still
and they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
love yourself, girl, or nobody will
though you a woman i don't know how you deal
with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
i feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
you wake up, put makeup on
stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling, "why you gotta take so long?!"
what it's like to have a crooked smile

even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down (this crooked smile)
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round (yeah)

to all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
you wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
you keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
and when i tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
so all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
now is it real? eyebrows, fingernails, hair
is it real? if it's not, girl, you don't care
‘cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
that the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
and that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up, i’ll be around
and we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
i can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile

even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round

we got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round

we don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
you know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
look at the nation
that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in hell already
i ask: if my skin pale, would i then sell like eminem or adele?
but one more time for the 'ville
and fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
i got money for the bail now, and well now
if you askin' will i tell now—ayy, hell nah
i ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
if you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
how you like this crooked smile?

even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile)
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round

we got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round


la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
back round
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
back round
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
round

you good, t-minus?

niggas been countin' me out
i’m countin' my bullets, i'm loadin’ my clips
i'm writin' down names, i'm makin' a list
i'm checkin' it twice and i'm gettin’ ’em hit
the real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
the game is off balance, i’m back on my shit
the bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
but that's how i like it, you all on my dick

i'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
i do not snort powder, i might take a sip
i might hit the blunt, but i'm liable to trip
i ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
i roll with some fiends, i love 'em to death
i got a few mil' but not all of them rich
what good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
what good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
that's my next mission, that's why i can't quit
just like lebron, get my niggas more chips
just put the rollie right back on my wrist
this watch came from drizzy, he gave me a gift
back when the rap game was prayin' i'd diss
they act like two legends cannot coexist
but i'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
if i smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
it won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
it won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
it won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
it won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
everything grows, it's destined to change
i love you lil' niggas, i'm glad that you came
i hope that you scrape every dollar you can
i hope you know money won't erase the pain
to the ogs, i'm thankin' you now
was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
i copied your cadence, i mirrored your style
i studied the greats, i'm the greatest right now
fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
i ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
this year gon' be different, i set my intentions
i promise to slap all that hate out your voice

niggas been countin' me out
i'm countin' my bullets, i'm loadin' my clips
i'm writin' down names, i'm makin' a list
i'm checkin' it twice and i'm gettin' 'em hit
the real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
the game is off balance, i'm back on my shit
the bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
but that's how i like it, you all on my dick

i just poured somethin' in my cup
i've been wantin' somethin' i can feel
promise i am never lettin' up
money in your palm don't make you real
foot is on they neck, i got 'em stuck
i'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
if it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
pistol in your hand don't make you real

i'm dead in the middle of two generations
i'm little bro and big bro all at once
just left the lab with young 21 savage
i'm 'bout to go and meet jigga for lunch
had a long talk with the young nigga kodak
reminded me of young niggas from 'ville
straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
i wish that he had more guidance, for real
too many niggas in cycle of jail
spending they birthdays inside of a cell
we coming from a long bloodline of trauma
we raised by our mamas, lord, we gotta heal
we hurting our sisters, the babies as well
we killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
distorted self-image, we set up to fail
i'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

i just poured somethin' in my cup
i've been wantin' somethin' i can feel
promise i am never lettin' up
money in your palm don't make you real
foot is on they neck, i got 'em stuck
i'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
if it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
pistol in your hand don't make you real

money in your palm don't make you real
pistol in your hand don't make you real
money in your palm don't make you real

sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
whenever you around i seem to come alive for ya
i finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
although i know your man and trust me he would die for ya
these quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
i saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
i came and talked to you but homie interfered now
he introduced you as his girl and i was heartbroken
some people talk about that love at first sight shit
to keep it real i don't know whether i believe it's true
but if it is then tell me if i'm wrong or right
if i fell in love with you before i ever even knew
i catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
at times i feel as though i'm caught up in a strange dream
if eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that i'm feeling you
sometimes i swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

i'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how i want it nigga
fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
i like to write alone, be in my zone
think back to forest hills, no perfect home
but the only thing like home i've ever known
until they snatched it from my mama
and foreclosed her on the loan
i'm so sorry that i left you there to deal with that alone
i was up in new york city chasing panties, getting dome
had no clue what you was going through
how could you be so strong?
and how could i be so selfish? i know i can be so selfish
i could tell by how i treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
but she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
and though it don't always show, i love her just like i love you, and
i need to treat you better
wish you could live forever
so we could spend more time together
i love you mama

i keep my head high
i got my wings to carry me
i don't know freedom
i want my dreams to rescue me
i keep my faith strong
i ask the lord to follow me
i've been unfaithful

niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
best friends really make great for enemies
my watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
i see you, nigga, this ain't no rolex, it's an ap, nigga
i'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
aim for the stars and i shouldn't have missed
but i was riding on fumes, so i stopped by the moon
now i'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
like, "thanks for the view," waiting on thanks from a few
'cause without me you wouldn't exist
you know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
cold as your phone on zero percent
going off, now niggas showing off
niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
i'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy

i keep my head high
i got my wings to carry me
i don't know freedom
i want my dreams to rescue me
i keep my faith strong
i ask the lord to follow me
i've been unfaithful

she my number one, i don't need nothing on the side
said that i was done for good and don't want no more lies
but my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
i stare at the screen a while before i press decline
but she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
told myself i'm strong enough to shake it and i'm trying
but i'm only human, i know loving you's a crime
if i take this cookie now one day i'll do the time

slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
i got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
i get the skirt when i want (skrrt!)
i get to skrrt when i want (skrrt!)
due to the money aroma (somebody)
my girl she got a diploma (smoke)
she got wife written all over
she got wife written all over

all a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
when i'm in your town press pound hit me up
when i'm in your town press pound hit me up
only if you down and you slurp good d up
if the work good i'll be back for the re-up
hate when i creep and the phone wake me up
fake like i'm sleep knowing damn well i be up
monkey on my back and i walk a hundred miles
guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
love get confused in the mind of a child
'cause love wouldn't lie like i lie and it's wild
wanna have my cake and another cake too
even if the baker don't bake like you
even when the flavor don't taste like you
so i'm back mobbing with the late night crew
all in your mind with fears that would come true
the back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
wishing that i could blind myself from view
and only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
i got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
i get the skirt when i want (skrrt!)
i get the skirt when i want (skrrt!)
due to the money aroma (somebody)
my girl she got a diploma (smoke)
she got wife written all over
she got wife written all over

i'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
can't see myself when i look in the mirror
can't see myself when i look in the mirror

i'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
can't see myself when i look in the mirror

but she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
told myself i'm strong enough to shake it and i'm trying
but i'm only human, i know loving you's a crime

on the road i'm a mack, i'm a chooser
i'm a addict, i'm maskin' that
kevin's heart

they tell me "what's done in the dark
will find a way to shine"
i done did so much that when you see you might go blind
what's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
i done did so much that when you see you might go blind

'fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
my uzi, it weighed a ton, i need me a better gun
in fact i just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
and i got something to prove
forgive me, lord, here they come, blaoow

nigga why you actin' like a ho?

tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
when you tell me you love me, can't you see i'm tryna climb?
damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
if you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
come here baby why you always insecure?
hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

my inhibition's fighting my intuition
premature premonition, showing me the demolition
of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
even when i rhyme about the future i be reminiscing
you want the truth well come and listen
i'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
as fate passes you by, half of you try
the other half of you fried, too high to actually fly
one day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
a scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
keep it true like me, cole you might be
like the new ice cube, meets the new ice-t
meets 2 live crew, meets the new spike lee
meets bruce like wayne, meets bruce like lee
meets '02 lil wayne, in a new white tee
meets kd, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
blaooow!

nigga why you actin' like a ho?
know that i'ma ride for ya, either way it go
tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
when you tell me you love me, can't you see i'm tryna climb?
damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?

(who's the king?)
came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
what you expected from me, i came from the dirt
(who's the king?)
money my motivator, the songs that i sing
picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(who's the king?)
you tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
will i return or will i burn, never know
(who's the king?)
look in my eyes and see the future
but don't sugar coat it

listen...
history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock 'n roll
justin timberlake, eminem and then macklemore
while silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
this year i’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile
i'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
but not jermaine, my aim too sick
i bang nigga, i came to bring the pain my brain too quick
you see how i maneuver this game, i ain't stupid
i recognize that life is a dream, and i dream lucid
and break the chains and change minds
one verse at a time, and claim 2-6
and fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

we all kings
(we all kings nigga)
kings of ourselves first and foremost
(true)
while the people debate who's the king of this rap game
here comes lil' ol' jermaine
with every ounce of strength in his veins
to snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
but rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
and falls to the earth from which it came
it's done
ain't gonna be no more kings
be wary of any man that claims
because deep down he clings onto the need for power
in reality he's a coward
ultimately he's scared to die
and sometimes so am i
but when i'm in tune with the most high
i realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
today i know that we are the same, are the same, you and i
different kind of skin, different set of eyes
two different minds, but only one god
(it's only one god nigga)
it's for all the kings
'cause i know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

go, go, go
go, go, go
go, go, go
go, go, go

this is what you call a flip

how does it feel now that you on?
how much you worth? how big is your home?

i think you should? how 'bout i don't?
how 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
how 'bout you listen and never forget?
only gon' say this one time, then i'll dip
niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit

'member i got my first view of the blood
i'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
my homie got pharmaceutical plug
i smoke the drug and it run through my vein
i think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
don't give a fuck and i'm somewhat insane
don't give a fuck and i'm somewhat insane
yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much actavis
i convinced actavis that they should pay me
if practice made perfect, i'm practice's baby
if practice made perfect, i'm practice's baby
platinum wrist ridin' in back like miss daisy
platinum disc and i own masters, bitch, pay me
y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
my nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
he serve a few packs and he jack a mercedes
he shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
he don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him

power, greed
money, molly, weed
percs, xannys, lean, fame
and the strongest drug of them all
and the strongest drug of them all
love

yeah (for your eyes)
for your eyes only (for your eyes)
for your eyes only, for your eyes only
(for your eyes, for your eyes)
for your eyes only

hey, niggas be dying on the daily
it seems my dreams faded for far too long
the consequences deadly
can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
and my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
like i ain't the one who put them jays on her feet
like i ain't out in the field like that
i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back
despite the charges, back to the wall, i fight regardless
screaming, "fuck the law," my life is lawless
that's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
this is hell and i don't mean that hyperbolic
i try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
but these felonies be making life the hardest
resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
that's why i write this sonnet
if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break
play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(for your eyes) let her know my life is on it
(for your eyes) for your eyes only

for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes only

you probably grown now so this song'll hit you
if you hearing this, unfortunately means
that i'm no longer with you in the physical
not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive
he got me praying that the spiritual is real
so i can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
so i know how part of you feels
maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
i hope not, i'm tired of dope spots
and fiends that smoke rocks
i've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
i'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
now i see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
don't know if i ever had a chance
at a glance, i'm a failure
addicted to pushing paraphernalia
but daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
my pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
blood was staining the concrete
older niggas i loved talked like they was above
maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
picked up the family business by the age of 13
six years later was handed sentence
'round the same time is when you came in this world
me and your mama thinking:
"what the fuck we naming this girl?"
i told her "nina," the prettiest name that i could think of
for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, i was 19
took me two felonies to see the trap
this crooked-ass system set for me
and now i fear it's too late for me to ever be
the one that set examples that was never set for me
i'm living fast, but not fast enough
'cause karma keeps on catching up to me
and if my past becomes the death of me
i hope you understand

for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes, do you understand me?
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes only

it's several ways i could've went out, too many to count
was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'cause the cash running out?
niggas don't know how to act in a drought
see, baby girl, i realized
my definition of a real nigga was skewed
my views misshaped by new mixtapes
that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true
that real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
they just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
and if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
i was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
and the cyclical nature of doing time continues
my worst fear is one day that you come home from school
and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
and sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
but maybe there's a chance that it's not
and this album remains locked
in a hard drive like valuable jewels
and i can teach you this in person
like i'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
i love you and i hope to god i don't lose you
for your eyes only

for your eyes, for your eyes only
for your eyes, for your eyes only
for your eyes, do you understand?
for your eyes only

one day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
what he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
i tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice
and it was chilling, he said:
"jermaine, i knew you since we was children
i never asked for nothing, when times was hard
i never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
i dealt with the repercussions of my actions
i know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
but that shit was in my blood, you know my life
i know your momma, nigga, send my love
in case i never get a chance to speak again
i won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
that's the way i wished my family lived
but my granny crib was in the 'jects"
i had to interject like:
"nigga, what you talking 'bout? fuck is you getting at?"
he said, "listen, i got no time to dive into descriptions
but i been having premonitions
just call it visions from the other side
i got a feeling i won't see tomorrow
like the time i'm living on is borrowed
with that said, the only thing i'm proud to say, i was a father
write my story down, and if i pass
go play it for my daughter when she ready"
and so i'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
this perspective is a real one, another lost 'ville son
i dedicate these words to you and all the other children
affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
that sent your pops to prison when he needed education
sometimes i think that segregation would've done us better
although i know that means that i would never
be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro
with lil' zach and cole world, barely one years old
now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old
not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues
not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving o's
nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
not because he screamed, "fuck the law"
although that was true
your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
for your eyes only

she knows
she knows, ayy
bad things happen to the people you love
and you find yourself praying up to heaven above
but honestly, i've never had much sympathy
'cause those bad things, i always saw them coming for me
i'm gonna run, run away (oh, i), run run away, run away (oh, i-i-i)
run away and never come back (well, all right)
run run away, run run away (oh, i), run away (oh, i-i-i)
show 'em that your color is black (well, all right)

damned if i do, damned if i don't
you know i got a girl back home
you got a man what you want, what you want?
what these bitches want from a nigga?
on some dmx shit, huh
i know them other niggas love tricking
on some bmx shit, but not me
now i'm sure you done heard about me
a black star, mos def, kweli
good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
this is martin luther king in the club, getting dubs
with a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
in the back of his mind is coretta

and she knows, she knows
and i know she knows, and i know she knows
and deep down, she knows, she knows
and i know she knows, and i know she knows

well, all right, oh, i, oh, i-i-i
i can't be what you want from me, well, all right
oh, i, oh, i-i-i
i can't be what you want from me, well, all right

damned if i do, shit, damned if i don't
i'm passing up on bad hoes
trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
what she—what she want from a nigga?
to put a ring on it
got a bitch on my dick right now
and she just want to sing on it
got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
i be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'cause i told her i was sleep
'cause i creep with this pretty young thing that i chose
she could be doing the same thing, i suppose

and she knows, she knows
and i know she knows, and i know she knows
and deep down, she knows, she knows
and i know she knows, and i know she knows

well, all right, oh, i, oh, i-i-i
i can't be what you want from me, well, all right
oh, i, oh, i-i-i
i can't be what you want from me, well, all right

1985, i arrived
33 years, damn, i'm grateful i survived
we wasn't s'posed to get past 25
joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
all these niggas popping now is young
everybody say the music that they make is dumb
i remember i was 18
money, pussy, parties, i was on the same thing
you gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
i respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
man, they barely old enough to drive
to tell them what they should do, who the fuck am i?
i heard one of 'em dissed me, i'm surprised
i ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
see if i can paint for you the large picture
congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
i hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
i see your watch icy and your whip foreign
i got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
i'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
i hear your music and i know that rap's changed
a bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
trap drums is the shit that's hot now
see, i've been on a quest for the next wave
but never mind, that was just a segue
i must say, by your songs i'm unimpressed, hey
but i love to see a black man get paid
and plus, you havin' fun and i respect that
but have you ever thought about your impact?
these white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
they wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
they wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
and somewhere deep down, fuck it, i gotta keep it real
they wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
so when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
you hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
you gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, i don't blame you
you ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
true, you got better shit to do
you coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
i know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
but i wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
one day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
and get too old for that shit that made you blow up
now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
which unfortunately means the money slow up
now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
but you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'cause you never bought that house, but you got a benz
and a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
and a bunch of fake friends, i ain't judgin' you
i'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
it's a faster route to the bottom
i wish you good luck
i'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
but if it's really true what people sayin'
and you call yourself playin' with my name
then i really know you fucked, trust
i'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
to any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
just remember what i told you when your shit flop
in five years you gon' be on love & hip-hop, nigga

since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
look at me my nigga
fantasize about a white picket fence
with some trees my nigga
used to want a pathfinder with some tints
that's all i need my nigga
throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
but now i see my nigga
that the world's a lot bigger ever since
picked up the paper
and they say my nigga eddie caught a body, i'm convinced
anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
fuck being timid in the civic
politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
i'm tryna write a story, can i get a glimpse?
yeah, can i get a glimpse?

last night i had a bad dream
that i was trapped in this city
then i asked is that really such a bad thing?
they robbin' niggas on the daily
can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
guess not! (what's the value of a thing?)
last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
ugh, nice watch, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air
hands in the air now, hands in the air

small town nigga hollywood dreams
i know that everything that glitters ain't gold
i know the shit ain't always good as it seems
but tell me till you get it how could you know?
how could you know? how could you know?

listen up i'm about to go and get rich
fuck with me my nigga
we gon' circle round the ville and hit a lick
cop some tree my nigga
and some powder, bag it up and make it flip
you gon' see my nigga
one day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
and that's the key my nigga
listen up i'm 'bout to go and get rich
stand back and watch if you want to nigga
me i want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
tired of seein' niggas flaunt, i wanna flaunt too nigga
watch some rollers in a fuckin' crown vic
tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
even if you let em' kill your dream
it'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

last night i had a bad dream
that i was trapped in this city
then i asked is that really such a bad thing?
i look around like—
do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
guess not! (what's the value of a thing?)
last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(you know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
uh, nice watch, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
hands in the air now, hands in the air
hands in the air now, hands in the air

father forgive me for my childish ways
i look outside and all the clouds are gray
i need your hands to take me miles away
your wish is my command, my command, my command
but before you go i've got to warn you now
whatever goes up surely must come down
and you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
so why just take me man, take me man, take me man
your wish is my command, my command, my command

i guess the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
okay, the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

yeah, i don't want no picture with the president
i just wanna talk to the man
speak for the boys in the bando
and my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if i'm harpin' again
i know these things happen often
but i'm back on the scene
i was lost in a dream
as i write this, the team down in austin
i been buildin' me a house
back home in the south, ma
won't believe what it's costin'
and it's fit for a king, right?
or a nigga that could sing
and explain all the pain that it cost him
my sixteen should've came with a coffin
fuck the fame and the fortune
well, maybe not the fortune
but one thing is for sure though
the fame is exhaustin'
that's why i moved away, i needed privacy
surrounded by the trees and ivy league
students that's recruited highly
thinkin' "you do you and i do me"
crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
my niggas stand outside and pass cigars
filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
thankful that they friend's a platinum star
in the driveway there's no rapper cars
just some shit to get from back and forth
just some shit to get from back and forth
welcome to the sheltuh, this is pure
we'll help you if you've felt too insecure
to be the star you always knew you were
wait, i think police is at the door

okay, the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope
hm, i guess the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
the neighbors think i'm—neighbors think i'm—
(don't follow me, don't follow me...)
i think the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope
(don't follow me, don't follow me...)
i guess the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
well, motherfucker, i am

some things you can't escape:
death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
every nigga feel like a candidate
for a trayvon kinda fate
even when your crib sit on a lake
even when your plaques hang on a wall
even when the president jam your tape
took a little break just to annotate
how i feel, damn, it's late
i can't sleep cause i'm paranoid
black in a white man territory
cops bust in with the army guns
no evidence of the harm we done
just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

don't follow me
don't follow me
don't follow me
don't follow me

okay, the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope
hm, i guess the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
the neighbors think i'm...neighbors think i'm—
(don't follow me, don't follow me...)
i think the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope
(don't follow me, don't follow me...)
i guess the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
well motherfucker, i am

i am, i am, i am, i am
well, motherfucker, i am
i think the neighbors think i'm sellin' dope

so much for integration
don't know what i was thinkin'
i'm movin' back to south side

me and my bitch, took a little trip
down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
lil' sip, took a lil' sip
took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

ayo, i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
that's why i keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
do you believe that eve had adam in check
and if so, you gotta expect
to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
cole is the king, most definite
my little black book thicker than the old testament
niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
same bitch giving brains to the minister
the same reason they call mr. cee the finisher
forbidden fruit, watch for the adam's apple
slick with words don't hate me, son
what you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
put a price on my head won't make me run
try to kill me but it can't be done
'cause my words gon' live forever
you put two and two together cole here forever

me and my bitch, took a little trip
down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip

love come and go (don't shit last)
bitches come and go (you know that)

i know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
so she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
and that's why you all on my mind
all on my line like caller number nine
'cause a nigga poppin' like harlem in the nine-seven
way before mase was a reverend
i was a young nigga making a's at 11
or 12, trying to get a taste of the heaven
or hell, only time gon' tell
fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
how many records do a nigga gotta sell
just to get the cover of the xxl
or fader, fuck your magazine hater
when i say that i'm the greatest i ain't talking about later
i'ma drop the album same day as kanye
just to show the boyz the man now like wanyá
and i don't mean no disrespect, i praise legends
but this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
my clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
blaow

me and my bitch, took a little trip
down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip

bitches come and go (you know that)

bitches come and go (you know that)

i grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
in love with the baddest girl in the city, i wish i knew her
i wish i wasn't so shy, i wish i was a bit more fly
i wish that i could tell her how i really feel inside
that i'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
she like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear i'm not that guy
ball player, star player, i'm just watchin' from the side
on the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
i ain't grow up with my father, i ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
fast forward four years or so from now, i'll probably cry
when i realize what i missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'cause i'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
who am i? (la la la)
ayy, who am i? (la la la la la, yeah)

things change, rearrange and so do i
it ain't always for the better, dawg, i can't lie
i get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
i might bend a little bit but i don't fold
one time for my mind and two for yours
i got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
if you see my tears fall, just let me be
move along, nothing to see

i always did shit the hard way
my nigga  slangin' in the hallway
burnt cd's and trees like this was broadway
times square, kept the dimes there in the locker
some reggie miller with more brown hairs than chewbacca
whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
he tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
i peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
i hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
his mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
i told her, "hello", and sat with my nigga and laughed
and talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
i complimented how i see him out here getting his cash
and just asked, "what a nigga gotta do to get that?
put me on," he just laughed when he seen i was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
he told me, "nigga, you know how you sound right now?
if you wasn't my mans, i would think that you a clown right now
listen, you everything i wanna be, that's why i fucks with you
so how you looking up to me when i look up to you?
you 'bout to go get a degree, i'ma be stuck with two choices:
either graduate to weight or selling number two
for what? a hundred bucks or two a week?
do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
i got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
if they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
i felt ashamed to have ever complained
about my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
from trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
you made a genius and i, ain't gon' take it for granted
i ain't gon' settle for lesser, i ain't gon' take what they handed
nah, i'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that i can fly
and show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
ayy, who am i?

things change, rearrange and so do i (ayy, who am i?)
it ain't always for the better, dawg, i can't lie (who am i?)
i get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
i might bend a little bit but i don't fold
one time for my mind and two for yours
i got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
if you see my tears fall, just let me be
move along, nothing to see

i never felt better

awwwww...haha

now i was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
and my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
nigga i can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the bowflex
get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
god they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
nowadays crime pays like a part time job
and the drought got me prayin' for a carl thom vibe
summer rain come again
numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
in my mind i been cryin', know it's wrong but i'm sellin'
eyes wellin' up with tears
thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
immortalized on this shirt

real niggas don't die
forward with the plot
one-seven-forty-five
form at the plot
real niggas don't die
form on the block
real niggas don't lie

my niggas don't die

have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
nope, all i see is that c.r.e.a.m nigga, that green
i'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
and her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
i'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
if they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a swat team
and i'm goin' out like scarface in his last scene
a legend, what that mean—?

real niggas don't die

real niggas don't die

to die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'cause they only feel you after you gone, or i've been told
and now i'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
my one wish in this bitch, "make it quick if the lord take me"
i know nobody meant to live forever anyway
and so i hustle like my niggas in virgini-a
they tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to nba"
in that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
that been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
the strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...
