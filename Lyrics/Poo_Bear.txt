sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
sometimes it's hard to face reality

should've been adjusted to my life
had the opportunity to stay away for the last time
now you're standin' right in front of me
it hurts me to know that i lied
tryna protect your feelings
you read in between the lines
hope your heart has started healing, woah, oh

sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
sometimes it's hard to face reality

don't be afraid to stand alone
don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
i know it's hard away from home
and it ain't easy all alone
relationships over the phone
talkin' to your significant other all night long

sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
sometimes it's hard to face reality
sometimes it's hard to face reality

love and death are quite similar
how they come and go like cat burglars
reality is kinda hard to face
like actual facts is for flat-earthers
rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
and pain's a requirement for power to grow
it's a miracle how one can change
from one what was just hours ago
such is life though, it's just a cycle
the bigger picture and the smaller picture
are exactly the same, it's macro, micro
crack your atom and let your light glow
one day, you could be the king of pop
and the next one just be "wacko" michael
it's human nature, just like he told us
let's face reality, crack the cycle

know it hurts to see the truth in your face
circumstances bring you down to your knees
go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
enough to put your heart at ease
oh, don't lose your self-esteem
i apologize, for being a man
it's way harder than what it seems

sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but i'll be at your bedside)
sometimes it's hard to face reality
sometimes it's hard to face reality

when it's all said and done, will i see you?
when it's all said and done, will i see you?
now that my love is on
all the way on you, i won't turn it off
would you do the same?
when it's all said and done, will i see you?

i've been planting seeds in our ground
watching us grow for a while
pray the sun stays shining down on us, i hope it do
we committed our trust out loud
like gravity, we swore to hold each other down
build a circle, pray you always stay around
i do, lord knows i do

met you on the block
you ain't gotta hustle like that no more
i been on a journey
i ain't tryna look back no more
we been on a wave
tryna not make it back to shore, oh no

but when it's all said and done, will i see you?
when it's all said and done, will i see you?
now that my love is on
all the way on you, i won't turn it off
would you do the same?
when it's all said and done, will i see you?

took away my insecurities
your arms became my security
ooh, my melody became harmony
with you, and only you
sometimes reality kicks in
realizing every beginning comes to an end
can i go to sleep at night
knowing i'll wake up to my best friend?

when it's all said and done, will i see you? (will i see you?)
when it's all said and done, will i see you? (i need to know)
now that my love is on
all the way on you, i won't turn it off

we were inseparable
everything i had to do i did it next to you
and the memories we made were so incredible
then our love was interrupted by my schedule
there was nothing that i could do
cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
and i hate to know i'm responsible
and your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
you got used to

being alone, alone
you adapted, now your use to
being alone, all alone
ooo you got used too being on your own

i saw it happenin'
but i didn't accept the truth, i couldn't fathom it
there was so much going on you couldn't handle it
could have divided my time, i should have fractioned it
but there was nothing that i could do
cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
and i hate to know i'm responsible
and your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
you got used to

being alone, alone, (all alone)
you adapted (you adapted), now your use to
being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
ooo you got used too being (used to) on your own, (all on your own)

looks like you added to my light
turned me into a whole new bright
tryna wrap theâ€…thoughtâ€…around my head
inâ€…the meantime, we've been flyin' acrossâ€…the sky like delta

movin' upstream like water
full of energy like tesla
blowin' each other's minds, nirvana
feel like a hundred million dollars, two commas

who would've ever thought that you'd come and make my day?
who would've ever thought that you'd change my life that night?
is it irrelevant that you'd make me feel that way?
you won the battle without puttin' up a fight
won over my heart
two beats at a time
three nights in a row
fireworks, fourth of july
you earned all my interest
never wonder why
if i said i'd never do it all again, that'd be a lie

looks like you added to my light
turned me into a whole new bright
tryna wrap the thought around my head
in the meantime, we've been flyin' across the sky like delta

movin' upstream like water
full of energy like tesla
blowin' each other's minds, nirvana
feel like a hundred million dollars, two commas
ooh-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
ooh yeah
ooh-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
two commas
ooh-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
we're like two commas
ooh-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

our life's a video minus the cameras and drama
my favorite audio is you sayin' "go harder"
feel like the rodeo, gotta get a grip, better hold on
in the midst of the moment, better not get thrown off
and i bet your bottom dollar
that i made more sense than you was thinkin'
love is the reason
and ain't nothin like takin a staycation
both of us trippin' over the weekend
what a feelin'

looks like you added to my light (added to my light)
turned me into a whole new bright (to a whole new bright)
tryna wrap the thought around my head ('round my head)
in the meantime (woah), we've been flyin' across the sky like delta (fly)

movin' upstream like water (like a water)
full of energy like tesla (tesla)
blowin' each other's minds, nirvana (nirvana)
feel like a hundred million dollars, two commas (woah)
yeah, yeah, two commas (two commas)

i was playin' checkers all along, you was 'bout that chess
never thought a checkmate would make me lay my cape to rest
can't believe we had a baby, got another one comin' so fast
buildin' a dynasty, ain't worried 'bout nothin' less

are we not fed up with sorrow?
no hay perdÃ³n en tu corazÃ³n
are you not fearful of tomorrow?
is this the place you wanna call our home?
no pongas energÃ­a en cosas malas
why not love each other like we love our own?

took us so, so long to get here
yet we're still so far away
(oh, no, no, no)

amor, amor, no hay nada mÃ¡s importante

woah, na na na na

podemos tener todo y al mismo tiempo tener nada, oh

took us so, so long to get here
yet we're still so far away

you were my lover, my half best friend
like the sky on sight, we couldn't seem to end, oh
you were a blessing, so content
i realize now what we had way back then, oh you

something special, far from ordinary
so i proposed to you
preparing to marry you
then we got older, emotionally closer

i gave you my all, but i guess my all wasn't good enough, oh no
you were my perspective
the only objective
was to satisfy and make you feel complete, yeah
so much neglection, in need of affection
i respected what you wanted to be

we had something special

oh, waking up to you
every day's like a deja vu

spent half of my life in denial
was an ongoing trial
already sworn in, for better or worse
left in the hands of a jury
beyond the shadow of a doubt
it's a blessing and a curse

i never understood this target on me
i didn't ask to look the way that i do
did all this bullying derive from envy?
was i guilty of it too?
i wasn't dark enough to hang with those girls
but i wasn't white enough to be red and blue
ooh, stuck in-between me, myself and i, forced to face the truth

spent half of my life in denial
was an ongoing trial
already sworn in, for better or worse
left in the hands of a jury
beyond the shadow of a doubt
it's a blessing and a curse

got old enough to know my beauty
brought me to places i could only imagine
and i learnt it all don't come duty-free
never fall on entrapment
and as much as i wish it was different
i wouldn't have it any other way
'cause it taught me how to pay attention, what a price to pay

spent half of my life in denial
was an ongoing trial
already sworn in, for better or worse
left in the hands of a jury
beyond the shadow of a doubt
it's a blessing and a curse

spent half of my life in denial
it's a blessing and a curse
left in the hands of a jury
it's a blessing and a curse
