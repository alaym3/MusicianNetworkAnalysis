if you take a life do you know what you'll give?
odds are, you won't like what it is
when the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
by the merciless eyes i've deceived?

i've seen angels fall from blinding heights
but you yourself are nothing so divine
just next in line

arm yourself because no one else here will save you
the odds will betray you
and i will replace you
you can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
it longs to kill you
are you willing to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins
you know my name

if you come inside things will not be the same
when you return to the night
and if you think you've won
you never saw me change
the game that we have been playing

i've seen this diamond cut through harder men
than you yourself, but if you must pretend
you may meet your end

arm yourself because no one else here will save you
the odds will betray you
and i will replace you
you can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
it longs to kill you
are you willing to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins

try to hide your hand
forget how to feel
(forget how to feel)
life is gone with just a spin of the wheel
(spin of the wheel)

arm yourself because no one else here will save you
the odds will betray you
and i will replace you
you can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
it longs to kill you
are you willing to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins
you know my name

you know my name
you know my name
you know my name
you know my name
you know my name
you know my name

summer nights and long warm days
are stolen as the old moon falls
and the mirror shows another face
another place to hide it all
another place to hide it all

and i'm lost, behind
the words i'll never find
and i'm left behind
as seasons roll on by

sleeping with a full moon blanket
sand and feathers for my head
dreams have never been the answer
and dreams have never made my bed
dreams have never made my bed

and i'm lost, behind
and the words i'll never find
and i'm left behind
as the seasons roll on by
yeah
woo hoo

now i want to fly above the storm
but you can't grow feathers in the rain
and the naked floor is cold as hell
the naked floor reminds me
oh, the naked floor reminds me

that i'm lost, behind
the words i'll never find
and i'm left behind
as the seasons roll on by

if i should be short on words
and long on things to say
could you crawl into my world
and take me worlds away?
should i be beside myself
and not even stay
ooooooooooo

and i'm lost, behind
the words i'll never find
and i'm left behind
as the seasons roll on by
yeah

it's been seven hours and sixteen days
since you took your love away
i go out every night and sleep all day
since you took your love away
since you've been gone i can do whatever i want
i can see whoever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
but nothing, nothing can take away these blues

'cause nothing compares
nothing compares
to you

it's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
tell me
where did i go wrong?
i can throw my arms around any girl i choose
but it just reminds me of you
i went to the doctor and guess what he told me
he said, "boy, you better try to have fun
no matter what you do"
but he's a fool

'cause nothing compares
nothing compares
to you

all the flowers that you planted mama in your backyard
all died when you went away
and i know living with me is sometimes hard, but i'm willing
to give it another try

'cause nothing compares
nothing compares
to you
nothing compares
nothing compares
to you
to you
to you

every time i stare into the sun
trying to find a reason to go on
all i ever get is burned and blind
until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

when you came along, the time was right
pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
wasn't very long, you took a bite
and did me wrong, and it serves me right

and i nearly forgot my broken heart
it's taken me miles away
from the memory of how it broke apart
here we go round again gain

every little key unlocks the door
every little secret has a lie
try to take a picture of the sun
and it won't help you to see the light

every little word upon your lips
makes a little cut where blood pours out
every little drop of blood, a kiss
that i won't miss, not for anything

and i nearly forgot my broken heart
it's taken me miles away
from the memory of how it broke apart
here we go round again

every single feeling tells me this is leading
to a heart in broken little pieces
and you know i need this
like a hole in the head


every single feeling tells me this is leading
to a heart in broken little pieces
and you know i need this
like a hole...

and i nearly forgot my broken heart
it's taken me miles away
from the memory of how it broke apart
here we go round again
and i nearly forgot my broken heart
it's taken me miles away
from the memory of how it broke apart
here we go round again

here we go round again
here we go round again
here we go round again

i know you feel the way i change
but you can't change the way i feel
sometimes i'm a stranger to you
one of a kind
and i think some way you'll make it through
you don't know how to take it
sometimes you're a stranger to me
one of a kind

there were times and lots of laughter
and you felt you understood
we were carefree, open and honest
loving, easy, kind and true
and i suppose you never doubted
that we were altogether fine
you never really knew my mind
you never really knew my mind

my silence holds
secrets find
i answer but don't answer
you did not see me well enough to recognise the signs
you didn't want to know this
but know that it was over
i did not see you well enough to recognise the signs

and there were times and lots of laughter
and you felt you understood
we were carefree, open and honest
loving, easy, kind and true
and i suppose you never doubted
that we were altogether fine
then you saw the changes painfully
and you knew
you never really knew my mind


and i suppose you never doubted
that we were altogether fine
sometimes i'm a stranger to you
sometimes you're a stranger to me
sometimes, maybe all the time
you never really knew my mind
i never really knew your mind

shed a tear 'cause i'm missing you
i'm still alright to smile
girl, i think about you every day now
was a time when i wasn't sure
you set my mind at ease
there ain't no doubt you're in my heart now

said, woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
all we need is just a little patience
said, sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
all we need is just a little patience

i sit here on the stairs
i'd rather be alone
if i can't have you right now, i'll wait, dear
sometimes it gets so tense
i can't speed up the time
but you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
if you and i just use a little patience
said, sugar, take the time, 'cause the lights are shining bright
you and i got what it takes to make it

i've been walking these streets at night
just trying to get it right
hard to see with so many around
you know i don't like being stuck in a crowd
and the streets don't change, but maybe the names
you know i ain't got time for the games
'cause i need you
yeah, i need you

said, woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
all we need is just a little patience
said, sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
all we need is just a little patience

can't remember anything
is this true or just a dream?
deep down inside i feel to scream now
but a terrible silence is stopping me
now that the war is through with me
waking up, but i can't see
that there ain't much left of me
nothing is real, nothing is real, but the pain now
and in this womb it's much too real
in pumps life that i must feel
but i can't look forward to reveal now
look to the time when i can live
fed through tube that's stuck in me
just like a wartime novelty
can't live and i cannot die
cut this life off, cut this life off from me
landmine has taken my sight
and took away my speech
took away my hearing
left me with a life in hell
darkness surrounds me
all i hear and all that i see
can't live and i cannot die
i'm trapped in myself
trapped in myself
landmine has taken, taken my eyes
taken my hearing
taken my sight
a landmine has left me with a life in hell
my body my holding cell
and i cannot die
now the world is gone
just one
just one
hold my breath as i'm wishing for death
just one, please, god wake me
god help me
god take me
hold my breath as i'm wishing for death
please god
please god take me
please god wake me

standing beside an open grave
your fate decided, your life erased
your final hour has come today
lit by the fire of your temples burning

you were a child and so was i
now you're a hunter but i am a lion
and i will cut you down like i've done so many times
but sometimes bad can do some good
sometimes bad can do some good
sometimes bad can do some good

and i heard you say that flesh sells by the pound
when blood is raining down it cuts a deep river
and i'm diving

now shine a light down onto the earth
and shake this gold dust out, out of the dirt
no saints beside me and no prayers to guide me
sometimes bad can do some good
bad can do some good
sometimes bad can do some good


(rain down, heaven is falling)
i've chosen a side and i will show no pity
(rain down, heaven is falling)
and spare no lives
for those who try me
(rain down, heaven is falling)
let it be understood
sometimes bad can do some good
(rain down, heaven is falling)
sometimes bad can do some good
(rain down, heaven is falling)
sometimes bad can do some good

time ain’t nothing if it ain’t fast
taking everything that you ever had
and giving nothing in return
but a cold bed in the quiet earth

if there's a door to every cell
a pearl inside of every shell, then

how hard can it be to share your life with me?
how hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
i know that it feels like we will live forever
but i fear that time will hide the years

life ain’t nothing if it ain’t hard
it’ll show you who you truly are
knock you down when you get too tall
till you're spun around in a free fall

but somewhere out there past the storm
lies the shelter of your heart

so how hard can it be to share your life with me?
how hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
i know that it feels like we will live for ever
but i fear that time can hide the years
like we were never here
so hold on tightly, my dear

i'm not one to waste my time
searching for some silver lining
somewhere out there past the storm
lies the shelter of your heart

so how hard can it be (how hard) to share your life with me?
how hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
i know that it feels like we will live forever
but i fear that time can hide the years
like we were never here
so hold on tightly, my dear

before we disappear
before we disappear

if i had nothing to my name
but photographs of you
rescued from the flame
that is all i would ever need
as long as i can read
what's written on your face
the strength that shines behind your eyes
the hope and light that will never die

and one promise you made
one promise that always remains
no matter the price
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive
as we've always done

and you said: "the poison in a kiss is the lie upon the lips"
truer words were never shared
when i feel like lies are all i hear
i pull my memories near, the one thing they can't take

and one promise you made
one promise that always remains
no matter the price
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive
as we've always done

the books still open on the table
the bells still ringing in the air
the dreams still clinging to the pillow
the songs still singing in a prayer

now my soul is stretching through the roots
to memories of you
back through time and space
to carry home
the faces and the names
and photographs of you, rescued from the flames

one promise you made
one promise that always remains
no matter the price
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive
and dare to rise once more
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive
and fill the world with life
as we've always done

someone falls to pieces
sleeping all alone
someone kills the pain
spinning in the silence
to finally drift away
someone gets excited
in a chapel yard
and catches a bouquet
another lays a dozen
white roses on a grave
yeahhh...
and to be yourself is all that you can do
heyyyy...
to be yourself is all that you can do
someone finds salvation in everyone
another only pain
someone tries to hide himself
down inside himself he prays
someone swears his true love
until the end of time
another runs away
separate or united
healthy or insane
and to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
yeahhh...
to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
heyyyy...
be yourself is all that you can do
even when you've paid enough
been pulled apart or been held up
every single memory of the good or bad
faces of luck
don't lose any sleep tonight
i'm sure everything will end up alright
you may win or lose..
but to be yourself is all that you can do
yeahhh...
to be yourself is all that you can do
ohhhh...
to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
ohhhh...
to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
to be yourself is all that you can--
be yourself is all that you can--
be yourself is all that you can do

staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes
looking for a part of me that’s still alive
waiting for my chest to fall and rise
standing on the corner with my shirt tucked in
summer turns to autumn, winter turns to spring
and it all flies by like a speeding train

dead wishes on a broken chain
white roses in a dead man’s dream
down and out with everything to lose
if these long dead wishes never do come true

waiting for the night to come and chase away
all the flies hovering around my head
with my memory for a pillow and all my regrets for a bed
standing on the corner, now i'm past surprise
yelling out a warning to some passerby
i stand just as god made me and i lie down in disguise

dead wishes on a burning lake
white roses for my soul to keep
diving down with everything to win
if my long-since sunken ship ever does come in

round and round we all fall down
and that's how ancient mountains crumble
time keeps moving slower
like falling from the sun
come and knock me over
i'll keep getting up
throw a line down to me
keep hanging on

standing on the corner don’t apologize
you don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes
or pretend that you don’t see me

dead wishes on a broken chain
white roses in a dead man’s dream
down and out with everything to lose
if these long dead wishes
these long dead wishes never do come true

round and round we all fall down
and that's how ancient mountains crumble
round and round we all fall down
and that's how ancient mountains crumble
that's how ancient mountains crumble
that's how ancient mountains crumble

worried moon, shining bright
can i sleep here tonight right beside you?
i got a long way to go
i’ll be off in the morning i hope, but i don’t know
if she would have me back again
or only want me for a friend
and leave a stain across my heart
that never washes out
nervous moon, in the clouds
there’s a halo around your proud face
and i’m glad that we’re friends
i might see you again sooner or later i guess
yeah if it all goes wrong
and i'm a heart without a home
maybe you can talk me out
of doing myself in
worried moon
im afraid of what’s to come
worried moon
yeah tell me what you know
worried moon
you see further down the road
worried moon
there you are, looking down
ill be here on the ground if you need me
yes i dream of a ghost
of a love that has died, or maybe not
but it haunts me now
worried moon
i'm afraid of what’s to come
worried moon
yeah tell me what you know
worried moon
you see further down the road
worried moon
looking up, you are gone
i got into the city at midnight
oh these eyes, looking on
make me blind and put me down
and the noise just drives me out
worried moon
i'm afraid of what’s to come
worried moon
yeah tell me what you know
worried moon
you see further down the road
worried moon
dirty moon, on the rise
orange as fire, but bitter cold
you won’t remember me i know
cuz i have moved to another coast
with a new love to call my own
maybe one day you can bathe us
in your blue light
worried moon
worried moon

she can do anything at all
have anything she pleases
the power to change what she thinks is wrong
but what could she want with me? yeah

wait, just one minute here
i can see that she's trying to read me
suddenly i know

she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
but she can't change me
no, she can't change me

she has the daylight at her command
she gives the night its dreams, yeah
she can uncover your darkest fear
and make you forget you feel it

but wait, just one minute more
i can see that she's trying to free me
suddenly i know

she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
but she can't change me
no, she can't change me

suddenly i can see everything that's wrong with me, yeah
what can i do? i'm the only thing i really have at all

but wait, just, one minute here
i can see that she's trying to need me
suddenly i know

she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
she's going to change the world
but she can't change me
no, she can't change me

i come from far away
my boots don't know this ground
but they know it's real
it doesn't take too long
for this road to become
a battlefield
and before i let one more fire go out
understand that i won't give one inch of ground
from beneath yours and my feet
whatever the price happens to be
i may not be the keeper of the flame
but i am the keeper
beauty and truth collide
where love meets genocide
where laughter meets fear
confusion all around
as i try to feed these mouths
that have never known singing
and before i let one more tear hit the ground
i will be the one standing between you and the sound
of the rounds echoing out
out of the dark
the smoke and the spark
aimed at the heart of the flame
i am the keeper, ooh
i cannot see the light
at the end of the tunnel tonight
my eyes are weary
and before i let one more life get erased
from the ashes i will rise for you and the ghosts
of the names the faces and frames
the love and the pain for you i remain
though i'm not worthy of
being the keeper of the flame
i am the keeper, yeah
i am the keeper, ooh ooh ooh

you flew in on the wind
was a day that i won't forget
told me to let you in
and that i would not regret it
but you had a touch as cool as rain
and only once the weather changed
murderer of blue skies

i can’t wait to never be with you again
and i can’t wait to lead a life that you’re not in
and i won't break, though i may bend from time to time
i can’t wait to never be with you again

now, the truth will set you free
but all you had was lying in you
so you built a cage for me
all the while pretending to be
a living saint with a thorny crown
and me condemned to be your clown
i applaud you as you take a bow

i can’t wait to never be with you again
and i can’t wait to lead a life that you’re not in
and i won't break, though i may bend from time to time
i can’t wait to never be with you again

i always thought that i pride myself on patience
but it’s wearing thin
never thought that falling for you only meant
falling down

i can’t wait to never be with you again
and i can’t wait to lead a life that you’re not in
and i won't break, though i may bend
i can’t wait to never be with you again
and i can’t wait to lead a life that you’re not in
and i won't break, though i may bend from time to time
i can’t wait to never be with you again
i can’t wait to never be with you again

what say you now the door is opening
on your vigil and i'm in my usual way
i save my breath, knowing what you're wanting me to say
i only love you when i'm down

you say that midnight opens its arms to me
leaving you alone, and then i fly so far away
until the light blurs my vision and i have nowhere to roam
i only love you when i'm down

and i only love you when i'm down
and i'm only near you when i'm gone
but one thing for you to keep in mind, you know
that i'm down all the time, all the time

well i know you're reaching out and you need to feel my hand
you want to be understood, yeah well i understand
i know you hold precious little hope for me
and in your happiness, i'm always drowning in my grief

and i only love you when i'm down
and i'm only near you when i'm gone
but one thing for you to keep in mind, you know
that i'm down all the time, all the time

all the time
all the time

dark as roses and fine as sand
feel your healing and your sting again
i hear you laughing and my soul is saved
on forgotten graves you cry

crawl like ivy up my spine
through my nerves and into my eyes
cuts like anguish or recollections
of better days gone by

but it's all right when you're all in pain
and you feel the rain come down
it's alright when you find your way
then you see it disappear
it's alright, though your garden's grey
i know all your graces someday will flower
in the sweet sunshower
in the sweet sunshower

eyes like oceans so far away
a feather trail to a better way
worried mornings turn into days
then into worried nights

but it's all right when you're all in pain
and you feel the rain come down
it's alright when you find your way
then you see it disappear
it's alright, though your garden's grey
i know all your graces someday will flower
in the sweet sunshower
in the sweet sunshower

oh in the sweet sunshower
in the sweet sweet sweet sunshower
i know all your graces someday will flower
in the sweet sweet sunshower
it's all right
all you'll be you are today, are today
it's all right
all you'll be you are today, are today
are today
are today
are today
are today

turn around every night
so now you're always going off
doesn't matter what i done
or if i even crossed the line
you start to holler, go in for blood
girl, it doesn't have to be a fight

throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
there may come a time when i don't bother you at all
it isn't my call, it isn't my call

hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(i hear ya!  i hear ya!)

there's no need to scream baby
i'm standing right in front of your face
i know sometimes we don't get along
so chris sings the second verse to you, like this...

take a minute to tell you now
and i don't have to raise my tone
take the level and bring it down
i just want you to know
i got no trouble with what you said
i don't even think you're wrong
it's how you say it
you lose your head
girl i'm standing right in front of you

throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
there may come a time when i don't bother you at all
it isn't my call, it isn't my call

hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(i hear ya!  i hear ya!)

silence is golden
i used to think that silence was golden
silence is golden
i used to think that silence was golden
(i hear ya!  i hear ya!)

hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
i said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(i hear ya!  i hear ya!)
silence is golden
i used to think that silence was golden
silence is golden
i used to think that silence was golden
(i hear ya!  i hear ya!)
