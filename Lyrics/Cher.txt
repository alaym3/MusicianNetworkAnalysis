you keep pushing me aside
and i can't break through
there's no talking to you
it's so sad that you're leaving
it takes time to believe it

i can feel something inside me say
i really don't think you're strong enough, no
do you believe in life after love?
i can feel something inside me say
i really don't think you're strong enough, no

what am i supposed to do?
sit around and wait for you?

and there's no turning back
i need time to move on
i need love to feel strong
'cause i've had time to think it through
and maybe i'm too good for you, oh

if i could turn back time
if i could find a way
i'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

i don't know why i did the things i did
i don't know why i said the things i said
pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

i didn't really mean to hurt you
i didn't wanna see you go
i know i made you cry, but baby

if i could turn back time, if i could find a way
i'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
if i could reach the stars, i'd give 'em all to you
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
if i could turn back time

my world was shattered, i was torn apart
like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
when you walked out that door i swore that i didn't care
but i lost everything, darlin', then and there

too strong to tell you i was sorry
too proud to tell you i was wrong
i know that i was blind and darlin'

if i could turn back time, if i could find a way
i'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
if i could reach the stars, i'd give 'em all to you
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

if i could turn back time
(if i could turn back time)
if i could turn back time
(if i could turn back time)
if i could turn back time
oh, baby

i didn't really mean to hurt you
i didn't wanna see you go
i know i made you cry, but

if i could turn back time, if i could find a way
i'd take back those words that hurt you
if i could reach the stars, i'd give 'em all to you
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
if i could turn back time, if i could find a way
and maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
if i could reach the stars

i don't need your sympathy
there's nothing you can say or do for me
and i don't want a miracle
you'll never change for no one
and i hear your reasons why
where did you sleep last night?
and was she worth it, was she worth it?

'cause i'm strong enough to live without you
strong enough and i quit crying
long enough, now i'm strong enough
to know you gotta go
there's no more to say
so save your breath and walk away
no matter what i hear you say
i'm strong enough to know you gotta go

so you feel misunderstood
baby have i got news for you
on being used, i could write the book
but you don't wanna hear about it
'cause i've been losing sleep
and you've been going cheap
she ain't worth half of me, it's true
now i'm telling you, that

i'm strong enough to live without you
strong enough and i quit crying
long enough, now i'm strong enough
to know you gotta go

come hell or waters high
you'll never see me cry
this is our last goodbye, it's true
i'm telling you, now

i'm strong enough to live without you
strong enough and i quit crying
long enough, now i'm strong enough
to know you gotta go
there's no more to say
so save your breath and walk away
no matter what i hear you say
i'm strong enough to know you gotta go
now i'm strong enough to live without you
strong enough and i quit crying
long enough, now i'm strong enough
to know you gotta go
there's no more to say
so save your breath and walk away
no matter what i hear you say
i'm strong enough to know you gotta go

i was born in the wagon of a travellin' show
my mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
papa would do whatever he could
preach a little gospel
sell a couple bottles of doctor good

gypsys, tramps and thieves
we'd hear it from the people of the town
they'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
but every night all the men would come around
and lay their money down

picked up a boy just south of mobile
gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
i was sixteen, he was twenty-one
rode with us to memphis
and papa would'a shot him if he knew what he'd done

gypsys, tramps and thieves
we'd hear it from the people of the town
they'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
but every night all the men would come around
and lay their money down

i never had schoolin' but he taught me well
with his smooth southern style
three months later i'm a gal in trouble
and i haven't seen him for a while, oh
i haven't seen him for a while, oh

she was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
her mama had to dance for the money they'd throw
grandpa'd do whatever he could
preach a little gospel
sell a couple bottles of doctor good

gypsys, tramps and thieves
we'd hear it from the people of the town
they'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
but every night all the men would come around
and lay their money down

feeling broken, barely holding on
but there's just something so strong
somewhere inside me
and i am down, but i'll get up again
don't count me out just yet

i've been brought down to my knees
and i've been pushed way past the point of breaking
but i can take it
i'll be back, back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
you haven't seen the last of me

they can say that i won't stay around
but i'm gonna stand my ground
you're not gonna stop me
you don't know me, you don't know who i am
don't count me out so fast

i've been brought down to my knees
and i've been pushed way past the point of breaking
but i can take it
i'll be back, back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me

there will be no fade out, this is not the end
i'm down now, but i'll be standing tall again
times are hard, but i was built tough
i'm gonna show you all what i'm made of

i've been brought down to my knees
and i've been pushed way past the point of breaking
but i can take it
i'll be back, back on my feet
this is far from over, i am far from over
you haven't seen the last of me

no, no, i'm not going nowhere
i'm staying right here
oh, no, you won't see me beg
i'm not taking my bow, can't stop me
it's not the end

oh, no, you haven't seen the last of me
you haven't seen the last of me

bang bang, you shot me down
bang bang, i hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down

i was five and he was six
we rode on horses made of sticks
he wore black and i wore white
he would always win the fight

bang bang, you shot me down
bang bang, i hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down

seasons came and changed the time
when i grew up, i called you mine
he would always laugh and say

bang bang, you shot you down
bang bang, and i hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down

music played and people sang
just for me the church bells rang
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
now he's gone, i don't know why
and 'till this day, sometimes i cry
he didn't even say goodbye
he didn't take the time to lie

bang bang, he shot me down
bang bang, i hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down

dove sei adesso? dove sei, amore mio?

dov'è l'amore? dov'è l'amore?
i cannot tell you of my love, here is my story
i'll sing a love song, sing it for you alone
though you're a thousand miles away, the feeling so strong

come to me, baby, don't keep me waiting
another night without you here and i'll go crazy
there is no other, there is no other
no other love can take your place or match the beauty of your face
i'll keep on singing 'til the day
i carry you away with my love song, with my love song

dov'è l'amore? dov'è l'amore?
where are you now, my love? i need you here to hold me
whispered so sweetly, feel my heart beating
i need to hold you in my arms, i want you near me

the fortune queen of new orleans
was brushing her cat in her black limousine
on the back seat were scratches from
the marks of men, her fortune she had won
i couldn't see through the tinted glass;
she said, "home, james" and he hit the gas
i followed her to some darkened room
she took my money, she said, "i'll be with you soon"

dark lady laughed and danced
and lit the candles one by one;
danced to her gypsy music
'till her brew was done...
dark lady played black magic
'till the clock struck on the twelve
she told me more about me
than i knew myself...

she dealt two cards, a queen and a three
and mumbled some words that were so strange to me
and then she turned up a two-eyed jack
my eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
she said, "the man you love is secretly true
to someone else who is very close to you!
my advice is that you leave this place
never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!"

dark lady laughed and danced
and lit the candles one by one;
danced to her gypsy music
till her brew was done...
dark lady played black magic
till the clock struck on the twelve
she told me more about me
than i knew myself...

so i ran home and crawled in my bed
i couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
then i remembered her strange perfume
and how i smelled it once in my own room
so i snuck back and caught her with my man;
laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand...
the next thing i knew they were dead on the floor--
dark lady would never turn a card up anymore!

dark lady laughed and danced
and lit the candles one by one;
danced to her gypsy music
til her brew was done...
dark lady played black magic
till the clock struck on the twelve
she told me more about me
than i knew myself...

don't you know
so many things - they come and go?
like your words that once rang true
just like the love i thought i found in you

and i remember the thunder
talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
but you walked away when i needed you most
now maybe, baby, maybe, baby

i found someone
to take away the heartache
to take away the loneliness
i've been feelin' since you've been gone
since you've been gone

dry your eyes
i never could bear to see you cry
someday your love will shine through
and show you the feelings that you never really knew

but baby, don't you loose that thunder
talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
you're lookin' at me but you still don't believe
that maybe baby, maybe baby

i found someone
to take away the heartache
to take away the loneliness
i've been feelin' since you've been gone
since you've been gone

too long on the border line
wondering if your love was really mine
but you left me with open eyes
and when i realized

baby, i found someone
to take away the heartache
to take away the loneliness
i've been feelin' since you've been gone
baby, i found someone
to take away the heartache
to take away the loneliness
i've been feelin' since you've been gone
since you've been gone

my father married a pure cherokee
my mother's people were ashamed of me
the indians said i was white by law
the white man always called me "indian squaw"

half-breed, that's all i ever heard
half-breed, how i learned to hate the word
half-breed, 'she's no good' they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born

we never settled, went from town to town
when you're not welcome you don't hang around
the other children always laughed at me
"give her a feather, she's a cherokee"

half-breed, that's all i ever heard
half-breed, how i learned to hate the word
half-breed, 'she's no good' they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born

we weren't accepted and i felt ashamed
nineteen i left them
tell me, who's to blame?
my life since then has been from man to man
but i can't run away from what i am

half-breed, that's all i ever heard
half-breed, how i learned to hate the word
half-breed, 'she's no good' they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born
half-breed, that's all i ever heard
half-breed, how i learned to hate the word
half-breed, 'she's no good' they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born

well, here we are again
i guess it must be fate
we've tried it on our own
but deep inside we've known
we'd be back to set things straight
i still remember when
your kiss was so brand new
every memory repeats
every step i take retreats
every journey always brings me back to you

after all the stops and starts
we keep coming back to these two hearts
two angels who've been rescued from the fall
and after all that we've been through
it all comes down to me and you
i guess it's meant to be
forever you and me, after all

when love is truly right
(this time it's truly right)
it lives from year to year
it changes as it goes
oh, and on the way it grows
but it never disappears

after all the stops and starts
we keep comin' back to these two hearts
two angels who've been rescued from the fall
after all that we've been through
it all comes down to me and you
i guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

always just beyond my touch
though i needed you so much
after all what else is living for

after all the stops and starts
we keep coming back to these two hearts
two angels who've been rescued from the fall
and after all that we've been through
it all comes down to me and you
i guess it's meant to be
forever you and me
after all the stops and starts
we keep coming back to these two hearts
two angels who've been rescued from the fall
and after all that we've been through
it all comes down to me and you
i guess it's meant to be
forever you and me, after all

i'm dancing solo
in the dark on the club floor
i need to let it go
shake it off, stop thinking about you

i lose myself in the beat of the drum
try-try-try to forget what you've done done
but honey, this is a battle that you haven't won

torn up, busted, taken apart
i've been broken down
left with a broken heart
but i'm stronger
strong enough to rise above
this is a woman's world
this is a woman's world

tell the truth
this is a woman's world
tell the truth
this is a woman's world

strong enough to rise above
this is a woman's world

your love hurts
your lies, they cut me
but now your words don't mean a thing
and i don't give a damn if you ever loved me

'cause it don't matter, i'm movin' on
gonna lose myself in the beat of the drum
'cause honey, this is a battle that you haven't won

torn up, busted, taken apart
i've been broken down
left with a broken heart
but i'm stronger
strong enough to rise above

never thought that i would end up like this
building up the barricades, brick by brick
heaven knowing what it is to be free
just faded (just faded)

do you know everything's riding on, riding on us to save them
oh, look at this life
we built it all
i just wanna see the walls crashing down
burn to the ground
let them stand tall
'cause i remember how it felt when we led the foundations
like nothing could harm them
but i see the cracks in the floor
oh-oh, look at their lives
can we save them somehow?
'cause i just wanna see the walls crashing down

i don't wanna have to say this again
something's gotta break hard and change, my friend
everything that happened back when
just faded (just faded)

do you know everything's riding on, riding on us to save them?
oh, look at this life
we built it all
i just wanna see the walls crashing down
burn to the ground
let them stand tall
'cause i remember how it felt when we led the foundations
like nothing could harm them
but i see the cracks in the floor
oh-oh, look at their lives
can we save them somehow? (somehow)
'cause i just wanna see the walls crashing down

we can't go back in time, but we can try
try to get them back home

look at this life
we built it all
and i just wanna see the walls crashing down
burn to the ground
let them stand tall
'cause i just wanna see the walls crashing down, mmm
i just wanna see the walls crashing down
can we save them somehow?

beneath the white fire of the moon
love's wings are broken all too soon
we never learn
hurt together, hurt alone
don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?
we turn the wheel and break the chain
put steel to steel and laugh at pain
where dreamers and castles are made of sand
the road to eden's is overgrown
don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?
look at the headlines
big crowd at the crazy house
long queue for the joker's shoes
ten rounds in the ring with love
do you lose and win or win and lose?
sweet rain like mercy in the night
(lay me down, wash away the sorrow)
caress my soul and set it right
(lay me down, show me your tomorrow)
summer tears, winter and the moment's flown
don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?
mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone
get the picture: no room for the innocent
peak season in lonely town
knocked out of the ring by love
are you down and up or up and down?
i asked the river for a sign
(in my dreams we go on together)
how long is love supposed to shine?
(in my dreams diamonds are forever)
but you and i - we hurt together, hurt alone
don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?
mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone
(in a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)
don't you sometimes wish your heart made of stone?
(in a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)
mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone
(in a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)
don't you sometimes wish your heart made of stone?
(in a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)
mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone

half past twelve and i'm watching the late show
in my flat, all alone
how i hate to spend the evening on my own
autumn winds, blowing outside the window
as i look around the room
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

movie stars, find the end of the rainbow
with a fortune to win, it's so different from the world i'm living in
tired of tv, i open the window and i gaze into the night
but there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

where are those happy days? they seem so hard to find
i tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love? i wish i understood
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good

so when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? sos
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, sos
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?

you seem so far away, though you are standing near
you made me feel alive, but something died i fear
i really tried to make it out, i wish i understood
what happened to our love - it used to be so good

so when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? sos
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, sos
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?

sos (sos)
sos (sos)

so when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? sos
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, sos
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?

these clouds aren't going nowhere, darling
rain keeps coming down
i just thought i'd try to call you
for you got too far outta town
and i hope that you get this message that i'm leaving for you
'cause i'd hate that you left
without hearing the words that i needed you to

and i hope you find it
what you're looking for
i hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
and so much more
and i hope you're happy, wherever you are
i wanted you to know that
and nothing's gonna change that
i hope you find it

am i supposed to hang around and wait forever?
last words that i said
but that was nothing but a broken heart talking, darling
you know it wasn't what i meant
call me up, let me know that you got this message
that i'm leaving for you
'cause i'd hate that you left
without hearing the words that i needed you to

and i hope you find it
what you're looking for
i hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
and so much more
and i hope you're happy, wherever you are
i wanted you to know that
and nothing's gonna change that
i hope you find it

whatever it is out there that you were missing here

well, i hope you find it
what you're looking for
i hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
and so much more
and i hope you're happy wherever you are
i wanted you to know that
and nothing's gonna change that
i hope you find it

i hope you find it
oh, oh
