we would swoop down on the town
kill everyone that wasn't beautiful

and i don't want you and i don't need you
don't bother to resist, or i'll beat you
it's not your fault that you're always wrong
the weak ones are there to justify the strong
the beautiful people, the beautiful people
it's all relative to the size of your steeple
you can't see the forest for the trees
and you can't smell your own shit on your knees

there's no time to discriminate
hate every motherfucker that's in your way

hey, you, what do you see?
something beautiful or something free?
hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
if you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(ah, ah)

the worms will live in every host
it's hard to pick which one they hate the most
the horrible people, the horrible people
it's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
capitalism has made it this way
old-fashioned fascism will take it away

hey, you, what do you see?
something beautiful or something free?
hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
if you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

there's no time to discriminate
hate every motherfucker that's in your way

(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
the beautiful people, the beautiful people (ah)
the beautiful people, the beautiful people (ah)
the beautiful people, the beautiful people (ah)
the beautiful people, the beautiful people (ah)

hey, you, what do you see?
something beautiful or something free?
hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
if you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

devil's got a cut like a slit in a cattle's calf
dollar-sign snakes, i'm all in the damn
god-less, fearless of the flood
or the blood of the coming spring
something is shedding its scales
crying from the heat of the light
or the empty shell on the stage
"and cash is the poor man's money"
"and cash is the poor man's money"

you say "god" and i say "say10"
you say "god" and i say "say10"
say, say, "say10"

open your mouth, love
like a gutted church
my goat horns are napalm trees
and a crown of thorns is hard to swallow
you should pray, now
is it above or is it below?

pound me the witch drums, witch drums
pound me the witch drums
pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
better pray for hell, not hallelujah

i'm the curled up fists
dead and hardened spiders
like two mangled crowns
on the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
folks say that i
look like death
lived in the hotel of my eyes
blinds wide open like a whore
paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs

keep your halos tight
i'm your god or your guardian
keep your halo tight
one hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
because now
cupid carries a gun
now, now
cupid, cupid carries a gun

pound me the witch drums, witch drums
pound me the witch drums
pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
better pray for hell, not hallelujah

she had those crow-black eyes
starless, but she fucked like a comet
she laid as still as a bible
and it felt like revelations when i looked inside

keep your halos tight
i'm your god or your guardian
keep your halo tight
one hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
because now
cupid carries a gun
now, now
cupid, cupid carries a gun

pound me the witch drums, witch drums
pound me the witch drums
pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
better pray for hell, not hallelujah

and make us a blood pact, babe
to love and to fuck
and to only see ourselves
and remember this

your hotel room won't be so vacant
and i can tell that you ain't faking
because i take death threats

would you kill, kill, kill for me?
i love you enough to ask you again
would you kill, kill, kill for me?
you won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
kill, kill, kill for me

would you drag him to the shed
and unload six rounds in their fucking face?
this is our sacrifice

because i take death threats
like the best of them

i'm a student of hate. i know now that god is a medium

your world is an ashtray, we burn and coil like cigarettes
the more you cry, your ashes turn to mud
the nature of the leeches, the virgin's feeling cheated
you've only spent a second of your life

my world is unaffected
there is an exit here, i say it is and it's true
there is a dream inside a dream
i'm wide awake the more i sleep
you'll understand when i'm dead

i went to god just to see
and i was looking at me, yeah
saw heaven and hell were lies
when i'm god, everyone dies

scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here, and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
one shot, and the world gets smaller

let's jump upon the sharp swords, cut away our smiles
without the threat of death there's no reason to live, at all

my world is unaffected
there is an exit here, i say it is and it's true
there is a dream inside a dream
i'm wide awake the more i sleep
you'll understand when i'm dead

i went to god just to see
and i was looking at me
saw heaven and hell were lies
when i'm god, everyone dies

scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
one shot, and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here, and the world gets smaller
shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker

each thing i show you is a piece of my death
no salvation, no forgiveness
no salvation, no forgiveness
no salvation, no forgiveness
no salvation, no forgiveness
no salvation, no forgiveness (this is beyond your experience)
no salvation, no forgiveness
no salvation, no forgiveness (forgiveness)
no salvation, no forgiveness (forgiveness, forgiveness)
no salvation, no forgiveness (forgiveness, forgiveness)
no salvation, no forgiveness (forgiveness, forgiveness)
no salvation, no forgiveness (forgiveness)

i went to god just to see
and i was looking at me, yeah
saw heaven and hell were lies
when i'm god, everyone dies

scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here, and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
shoot here and the world gets smaller
scar, scar, can you feel my power?
one shot, and the world gets smaller

shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
