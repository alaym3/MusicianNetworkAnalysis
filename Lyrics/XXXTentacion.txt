it will all be over soon

and i'm always where the sun don't shine, the
tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
heart's been broke, i hate myself, but
it won't show, i constantly lose all
my remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
all you can offer, now i'm trapped in a changing maze
setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
where is this going, hey? heartless is recklessness, it's
word of a pacifist to word of a masochist, i'm
off of the map, my lord, i spoke to a baphomet, he
said he would save me if i gave him one thing he needed
"what is this thing?", i pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah

and as i spoke, my fangs were shown
taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"what you crave will soon be yours
but what i crave is already mine"
anima vestra
anima
anima vestra
anima

yeah

(luke white on the beat)

you ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
i'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
what's the justice in sayin', "fuck it," and grab the pump?
then kill a woman with many children? makes you a chump
look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, i reckon
think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
i know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
this is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
but sure, you'd rather hear me say, "fuck the black prejudice
let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
views,” and etcetera, knives thrown
damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
i won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
murder opps, killin' shit, i'd enjoy the thrill of it
bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
i could preach the peace but say, "fuck it," and preach the murder
'cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
give death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
but in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black

we see, i see, death before the children
white guys and white girls hanging from the buildings (we are the ku klux klan, we hate)

how did you get here?
i'm drunk and confused
i tried to be patient with you, yeah
high up, you're falling back down

trapped in a concept, falsely accused, misused
and misled, bitch, i'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
now the fact that i'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
and i can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
uh
cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
i'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
and if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
inside my head, i see your face, i fuckin' hate that i love you still
(yeah)
(down)

carry on, like flights, i just carry on
with this pain inside of my chest
got no choice but to carry on, uh
