feeling my way through the darkness
guided by a beating heart
i can't tell where the journey will end
but i know where to start
they tell me i'm too young to understand
they say i'm caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by if i don't open up my eyes
well that's fine by me

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know﻿ i was lost
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know ﻿i was lost


i tried carrying the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
i hope i get the chance to travel the world
but i don't have any plans
wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
life's a game﻿ made for everyone
and love is the prize

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know﻿ i was lost
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know, i didn't know, i didn't know

hey, brother
there's an endless road to rediscover
hey, sister
know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

oh, if the sky comes falling down
for you, there's nothing in this world i wouldn't do

hey, brother
do you still believe in one another?
hey, sister
do you still believe in love?
i wonder

oh, if the sky comes falling down
for you, there's nothing in this world i wouldn't do

what if i'm far from home?
oh brother, i will hear you call
what if i lose it all?
oh sister, i will help you out
oh, if the sky comes falling down
for you, there's nothing in this world i wouldn't do

where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
and every night has its day, so magical
and if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
that can't be defeated
for every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
in every lost soul the bones of a miracle
for every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
with something to believe in

monday left me broken
tuesday i was through with hopin'
wednesday my empty arms were open
thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
thank the stars it's friday
i'm burning like a fire gone wild on saturday
guess i won't be coming to church on sunday
i'll be waiting for love
waiting for love to come around


we are one of a kind, irreplaceable
how did i get so blind and so cynical?
if there's love in this life we're unstoppable
no, we can't be defeated

(hey)
once upon a younger year
when all our shadows disappeared
the animals inside came out to play (hey)
hey, went face to face with all our fears
learned our lessons through the tears
made memories we knew would never fade

one day my father he told me
son, don't let it slip away
he took me in his arms, i heard him say (hey)
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever you're afraid

he said, one day you'll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me

(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)

when thunderclouds start pouring down
light a fire they can't put out
carve your name into those shining stars
he said, go venture far beyond the shores
don't forsake this life of yours
i'll guide you home no matter where you are

one day my father he told me
son, don't let it slip away
when i was just a kid, i heard him say
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever you're afraid

he said, one day you'll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me

(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
oooh, oooh
(hey, hey)

these are the nights that never die
my father told me
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
oooh, oooh
(hey, hey)
oooh, oooh
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey)
oooh, oooh
(hey, hey)
my father told me

you said that we would always be
without you i feel lost at sea
through the darkness you'd hide with me
like the wind we'd be wild and free

you said you'd follow me anywhere
but your eyes tell me you won't be there

i've gotta learn how to love without you
i've gotta carry my cross without you
stuck in the middle and i'm just about to
figure it out without you
and i'm done sitting home without you
fuck, i'm going out without you
i'm gonna tear this city down without you
i'm goin' bonnie and clyde without you

now i'm running away, my dear
from myself and the truth i fear
my heart is beating i can't see clear
how i'm wishing that you were here

you said you'd follow me anywhere
but your eyes tell me you won't be there

i've gotta learn how to love without you
i've gotta carry my cross without you
stuck in the middle and i'm just about to
figure it out without you
and i'm done sitting home without you
fuck, i'm going out without you
i'm gonna tear this city down without you
i'm goin' bonnie and clyde without you

can you hear me? s.o.s.
help me put my mind to rest
two times clean again, i'm actin' low
a pound of weed and a bag of blow

i can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
i don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
i can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
i don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

we could be more than just part-time lovers
we could be more than just part-time lovers

i get robbed of all my sleep
as my thoughts begin to bleed
i'd let go, but i don't know how
yeah, i don't know how, but i need you now

i can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
i don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
i can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
i don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
i can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
i don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

(we could be) we could be more than just part-time lovers
(part-time lovers, yeah)
(more than, more than lovers)
we could be more than just part-time lovers

can you hear me? s.o.s.
help me put my mind to rest

it's you and your world and i'm caught in the middle
i caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know that i can't be your friend
it's my head or my heart, and i'm caught in the middle

my hands are tied, but not tight enough
you're the high that i can't give up
oh lord, here we go

i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight
at the bottom of a bottle
you're the poison in the wine
and i know
i can't change you, and i
i won't change
i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight

let's be lonely together
a little less lonely together

eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (oh)
before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined (oh)
and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know just how this ends
now i'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (oh)

i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight
at the bottom of a bottle
you're the poison in the wine
and i know
i can't change you, and i
i won't change
i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight

let's be lonely together
a little less lonely together
let's be lonely together
a little less lonely together

my hands are tied, but not tight enough
you're the high that i can't give up
oh lord, here we go

i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight
at the bottom of a bottle
you're the poison in the wine
and i know
i can't change you, and i
i won't change
i might hate myself tomorrow
but i'm on my way tonight

let's be lonely together
a little less lonely together
let's be lonely together
a little less lonely together
a little less lonely now
a little less lonely now
a little less lonely now

i don't know just how it happened; i let down my guard
swore i'd never fall in love again, but i fell hard
guess i should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
wasn't looking where i was going; i fell into your arms

you came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
before i, i knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

i'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
like a powerful drug i can't get enough of
lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
out of control, what can i do?
i'm addicted to you

midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
got me hypnotised, i'm getting high on the perfume
i couldn't live without you now, oh, i know i'd go insane
i wouldn't last one night alone, baby
i couldn't stand the pain

i'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
like a powerful drug i can't get enough of
lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
out of control, what can i do?
i'm﻿ addicted to you

you stripped your love down to the wire
fire shy and cold alone outside
you stripped it right down to the wire
but i see you behind those tired eyes

now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
you'll find the light that leads home
cause i see you for you and your beautiful scars
so take my hand, don't let go

cause it's not too late, it's not too late
i, i see the hope in your heart
and sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
broken arrows in the dark
but i, i see the hope in your heart

i've seen the darkness in the light
the kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
the only thing that's black and white
is that you don't have to walk alone this time

we have to tear down walls that live in your heart
to find someone you call home
now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
so take my hand, don't let go

cause it's not too late, it's not too late
i, i see the hope in your heart
and sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
broken arrows in the dark
but i, i see the hope in your heart

it's not too late, it's not too late
i see the hope in your heart
sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
broken arrows in the dark

paint on a caution wind
meet the bleeding sky
i called your name
there was no one there
and in the cold and snow
i saw your face

and we sang the song for the little things
magic call, but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic call from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day

straight, from the path of love
in the road of life
i tumble forward
but going on, i'mma keep it strong
i saw your face

and we sang the song for the little thing
magic call, but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic call from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day
for a better day
(for a better day)
(for a better day)
(for a better day)
(for a better day)
and we sang the song for the little thing
magic call, but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic call from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day

so bold and fine
i've known you for some time
whole life changed while
bones like yours and mine
go dance in the woods and
down we go, down, down
oh boy, you're mine
do you remember old times?

oh dear boy, i wanna follow you
you're a wild boy, i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
in a world with everything but it won't do
oh dear boy, i wanna follow you
you're a wild boy, i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy, so shallow in the blue
it's our time for everything and i call you


sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
for those who find love as a game like you and i
go dance in the waters of all the tears we have cried
oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?

oh dear boy, i wanna follow you
you're a wild boy, i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
in a world with everything but it won't do
oh dear boy, i wanna follow you
you're a wild boy, i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy, so shallow in the blue
it's our time for everything and i call you

step out into the dawn
you pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
and then you feel like you've just been born
yeah, you come to raise me up
when i'm beaten and broken up
and now i'm back in the arms i love

and i think i just died
i think i just died
yeah, i think i just died
i think i just died

and went to heaven
and went to heaven, whoa

beaten and bathed in blood
i'm hit by, i'm hit by your love and drug
and now you've c-come to raise me up

and i think i just died
i think i just died
yeah, i think i just died

and went to heaven
and went to heaven
whoa, and went to heaven

ooh, oh

it's such a night, such a beautiful night
it's such a view, such a beautiful sight
i think i just, oh, i think i just died, oh

and went to heaven
and went to heaven
oh, yeah, yeah

we're gonna be birds and fly
we're gonna set the world alight
we're gonna lose ourselves tonight, whoa
we're gonna be birds and fly
we're gonna set the world alight
we're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh
in heaven (heaven)

under the tree where the grass don't grow
we made a promise to never get old
you had a chance and you took it on me
and i made a promise that i couldn't keep

heartache, heartbreaks all over town
but something flipped like a switch when you came around
and i'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(oh whoa oh)

these are the days we've been waiting for
on days like these who could ask for more
keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
these are the days we won't regret
these are the days we won't forget
these are the days we've been waiting for
rattle the cage and slam that door
and the world is calling us but not just yet
these are the days we won't regret
these are the days we won't forget

out on the midnight the wild ones howl
the last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
we used to believe we were stars aligned
you made a wish and i fell out of

time flew, cut through all over town
you made me bleed when i look up and you're not around
but i'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(oh whoa oh)

these are the days we've been waiting for
neither of us knows what's in store
you just roll your window down and place your bets
these are the days we won't regret
these are the days we'll never forget
and these are the days (these are the days)
and these are the days (these are the days)

oh, sometimes i get a good feeling, yeah
get a feeling that i never, never, never, never had before, no no
i get a good feeling, yeah
oh, sometimes i get a good feeling, yeah
get a feeling that i never, never, never, never had before, no no

hey
do you remember we said, "hello"?
and you asked me about my levi's t-shirt
said, "you are a friend of mine"
my, oh my
you must have saved me about a thousand times
i wouldn't be the one i am today
if you hadn't been a friend of mine

i ain't misbehaving
i'm just telling you the truth
take my love for granted
yeah, i'll give it all to you
made me count for something
yeah, i feel it in my heart
god only knows what i'd have been if you hadn't been

a friend of mine

hey
hey, hey, hey, hey
i haven't seen you around since high school
how you doin', do you still remember me?
are you still a friend of mine?
guess you're still a friend of mine
guess you're still a friend of mine
now i see
i see
why i get nervous when you look at me
it's like your eyes are trying to tell me something
that you're more than just a friend of mine
that you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my

i ain't misbehaving
i'm just telling you the truth
take my love for granted
yeah, i'll give it all to you
made me count for something
yeah, i feel it in my heart
god only knows what i'd have been if you hadn't been

a friend of mine

that's me right there on the corner
listening to wu in my walkman
neon lights at the water, reflecting the city i'm lost in
that's me right there on the corner
i, one day, would be leaving
for a dream that i didn't have
that i'd one day would believe in
strange how the same place i ran from
is the same place i think of whenever the chance comes
it's inevitable, 'cause wherever i go

i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
there's a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me, that i've lost my backbone (back home)
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone (back home), somewhere in stockholm

i'm from a place where we never openly show our emotions
we drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles
and leave them to float in the ocean
i'm from a place where we never
separate people from people
some generalise, but in general i
still believe that we are treated as equals
my father, my mother, my sister, my brother
my friends and my family's there
my hope and my money, my innocence in a sense
almost lost everything here
right where i was founded
is right where i'll be found dead
the streets of my backbone, until i get back home

i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
there's a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me, that i've lost my backbone (back home)
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone (back home), somewhere in stockholm

i'm not alone, i am the fire that burns
not of the city but out of the 'burbs
a river that's just dying of thirst
i am a reverend lying in church
a crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
a promise that never was kept
one of those moments you'll never forget
i am that feeling inside
the one we all know but can't really describe
i am the blood spill, but i'm in love still
somewhere in stockholm
but i'm not alone
don't have to get by on my own
i'm finally home
hemma i stockholm
där jag hör hemma

i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
there's a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me, that i've lost my backbone (back home)
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone (back home), somewhere in stockholm

crossbows and arrows, the smoke in the shadows
you'll lose your mind standing on the battle line
starting to choke on your heart in your throat and
it feels just like you can't remember how to fight

we'll crack before we shatter
we can't fall apart (oh, oh)

we don't get to die young
trouble keeping our head sometimes
we just have to push on
we don't get to give up this life
all the breath in your lungs
is stronger than the tears in your eyes
it's do or die, but we're alive
and while we're here, we'll hold the line

we'll hold the line

don't hold your hands up, it's your final stand
put your white flag down, oh don't you surrender now
no hero's story, there's no blaze of glory
but dawn only comes at the end of the night

we'll crack before we shatter
we can't fall apart (oh, oh, oh)

we don't get to die young
trouble keeping our head sometimes
we just have to push on
we don't get to give up this life
all the breath in your lungs
is stronger than the tears in your eyes
it's do or die, but we're alive
and while we're here, we'll hold the line

hold the line
hold the line

we don't get to die young
we just have to push on
we don't get to die young
