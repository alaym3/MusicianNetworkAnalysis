in what you hear
let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear
i love you, lord
and i lift my voice
to worship you
oh, my soul rejoice!
take joy my king
in what you hear
let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear
i love you, lord... 

you are filled with compassion and mercy and grace
with your banner of love over me
i am longing to see you one day face to face
and to be with you endlessly
lord, how lovely you are to me
(chorus)
lovely lord
you are all to me
lovely lord
full of purity
worthy of honor and majesty
lord, how lovely you are to me
you are bright as the sunrise and fairest of all
unto you all the glory will be
you are god of creation and lord of my life
i will worship you faithfully
lord, how lovely you are to me
repeat chorus
we will worship the name of the holiest one
we will worship your excellency
we will give you the glory
for things you have done
and be thankfully eternally
lord, how lovely you are to me
repeat chorus
lord, how lovely you are to me 

red is the color of the blood that flowed
down the face of someone who loved us so
he's the perfect man, he's the lord's own son
he's the lamb of god, he's the only one
that can give us life, that can make us grow
that can make the love between us flow
blue is the color of a heart so cold
that will not bend when the story's told
of the love of god for a sinful race
of the blood that flowed down jesus face
that can give us life, that can make us grow
that can keep our hearts from growing cold
gold is the color of the morning sun
that shines so freely on everyone
it's the sun above that keeps us warm
it's the son of love that calms the storm
that can give us life, that can make us grow
that can turn our mornings into gold
brown is the color of the autumn leaves
when the winter comes to the barren trees
there is birth, there death, there is a plan
and there's just one god and there's just one man
that can give us life, that can make us grow
that can make our sins as white as snow
that can give us life, that can make us grow
that can turn our mornings into gold
that can give us life that can make us grow
that can keep our hearts from growing cold
that can give us life that can make us grow
that can make the love between us flow 

there's a step that we all take alone
an appointment we have with the great unknown
like a vapor this life is just waiting to pass
like the flowers that fade, like the withering grass
but life seems so long and death so complete
and the grave an impossible potion to cheat
but there's one who has been there and still lives to tell
there is one who has been through both heaven and hell
and the grave will come up empty-handed the day
jesus will come and steal us away
(chorus)
where is the sting, tell me where is the bite
when the grave robber comes like a thief in the night
where is the victory, where is the prize
when the grave robber comes
and death finally dies
many still mourn and many still weep
for those that they love who have fallen asleep
but we have this hope though our hearts may still ache
just one shout from above and they all will awake
and in the reunion of joy we will see
death will be swallowed in sweet victory
when the last enemy is done from the dust will come a song
those asleep will be awakened - not a one will be forsaken
he shall wipe away our tears - he will steal away our fears
there will be no sad tomorrow - there will be no pain and sorrow 

i will call upon the lord
who is worthy to be praised
so shall i be saved from my enemies
the lord liveth and blessed be the rock
and let the god of my salvation be exalted 

salvation belongs to our god
who sits upon the throne
and unto the lamb
praise and glory
wisdom and thanks
honor and power and strength
be to our god forever and ever
be to our god forever and ever
and we the redeemed shall be strong
in purpose and unity
declaring aloud 

romans 16:20, isaiah 14:12-15
words and music by bob hartman
son of the morning--highest of all
you had so much going till you took the fall
had a place in the glory but you wanted it all
impossible odds but you had the gall
it seemed so unlikely that you would rebel
such a worthy opponent that you knew so well
but you went down fighting when you heard the bell
took a third of all heaven when you went to hell

this means war--and the battle's still raging
war--and though both sides are waging
the victor is sure and the victory secure
but till judgement we all must endure
this means war!
then came the cross--you thought you had won
you thought you had conquered god's only son
"so much for jesus" you said in jest
then you got a visit from an unwelcome guest
now it's all over down to the wire
counting the days to your own lake of fire
but you'll go down fighting for all that you're worth
to try to abolish his image on earth 

you say you've been feeling weaker, weaker by the day
you say you can't make the joy of your salvation stay
but good things come to them that wait
not to those who hesitate
so hurry up and wait upon the lord
(chorus)
more power to ya
when you're standing on his word
when you're trusting with your whole heart in the message you have heard
more power to ya
when we're all in one accord
they that wait upon the lord, they shall renew, they shall renew their strength
jesus promised his disciples he'd give strength to them
jesus told them all to tarry in jerusalem
when they were all in one accord
the power of his spirit poured
and they began to turn the world around
so be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
put on all his armor and fight the good fight
in all of our weakness, he becomes so strong
when he gives us the power and the strength to carry on 

in heavenly armour we'll enter the land
the battle belongs to the lord
no weapon that's fashioned against us shall stand
the battle belongs to the lord
we sing glory and honor
power and strength to the lord
(repeat)
the power of darkness comes in like a flood
the battle belongs to the lord
he's raised up a standard, the power of his blood
the battle belongs to the lord
when your enemy presses in hard do not fear
the battle belongs to the lord
take courage my friend, your redemption is near
the battle belongs to the lord 

lord, i lift your name on high
lord, i love to sing your praises
i'm so glad you're in my life
i'm so glad you came to save us
you came from heaven to earth
to show the way
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay
from the cross to the grave
from the grave to the sky
lord, i lift your name on high
lord, i lift your name on high
lord, i love to sing your praises
i'm so glad you're in my life
i'm so glad you came to save us
you came from heaven to earth
to show the way
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay
from the cross to the grave
from the grave to the sky
lord, i lift your name on high
you came from heaven to earth
to show the way
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay
from the cross to the grave
from the grave to the sky
lord, i lift your name on high
lord, i lift your name on high... 

we're content to pitch our tent
when the glory's evident
seldom do we know
the glory came and went
moving can seem dangerous
in this stranger's pilgrimage
knowing that you can't stand still
you cross the bridge
(chorus)
there's a higher place to go
beyond belief, beyond belief
where we reach the next plateau
beyond belief, beyond belief
and from faith to faith we grow
towards the center of the flow
where he beckons us to go
beyond belief, beyond belief
leap of faith without a net
makes us want to hedge our bet
waters never part
until our feet get wet, whoa, whoa
there's a deeper place to go
where the road seems hard to hoe
he who has begun this work
won't let it go (let it go!)
(chorus)
and it takes so long to see the change
but we look around, and it seems so strange
we have come so far, but the journey's long
and we once were weak, but now we are strong
(chorus) 

love is patient, love is kind
no eyes of envy, true love is blind
love is humble, it knows no pride
no selfish motive hidden inside
love is gentle, makes no demands
despite all wrong, true love still stands
love is holy, love is pure
it lasts forever, it will endure
chorus
love knows when to let go
love knows when to say no
love grows in the light of the son
and love shows the world that the son of
love has come
love is loyal, believes the best
it loves the truth, love stands the test
love is god sent in his son
love forgives all we have done
(chorus)
in this world where hatred seems to grow
true love goes against the flow
and becomes so hard to show
in this world where push turns to shove
we have strength to rise above
through the power of his love
lord, we need to know the power of your love
(chorus) 

i believe in god the father, maker of heaven and earth
and in jesus christ his only son, i believe in the virgin birth
i believe in the man of sorrows, bruised for iniquities
i believe in the lamb who was crucified, and hung between two thieves
i believe in the resurrection, on the third and glorious day
i believe in the empty tomb, and the stone that the angel rolled away
he descended and set the captives free
and now he sits at god's right hand and prepares a place for me
this is my creed
the witness i have heard
the faith that has endured
this truth is assured
through the darkest ages past
though persecuted it will last
and i will hold steadfast
to this creed
i believe he sent his spirit, to comfort and to reveal
to lead us into truth and light, to baptize and to seal
i believe he will come back, the way he went away and..
receive us all unto himself but no man know that day
this is my creed
the witness i have heard
the faith that has endured
this truth is assured
through the darkest ages past
though persecuted it will last
and i will hold steadfast
to this creed
i believe he is the judge, of all things small and great
the resurrected souls of men, receive from him their fate
some to death and some to life, some to their reward
some to sing eternal praise, forever to the lord
and through the darkest ages past
though persecuted it will last
and i will hold steadfast
to this creed
...this creed... whoa... whoa...my creed... whoa

(backwards message):
what are ya looking for the devil for
when ya oughta be looking for the lord?!
i wonder how it makes you feel when the prodigal won't come home
i wonder how it makes you feel when he'd rather be on his own
i wonder what it's like for you when a lamb has gone astray
i wonder what it's like for you when your children disobey
it must be like another thorn struck in your brow
it must be like another close friend's broken vow
it must be like another nail right through your wrist
it must be just like
just like judas' kiss
i wonder how it makes you feel when no one seeks your face
i wonder how it makes you feel when they give up in the race
i wonder what it's like for you when they willingly disobey
i wonder what it's like for you when they willingly walk away 

the system, the system, the system, the system, the system
the system

caught in the undertow, being swept downstream
going against the flow seems like such a dream
trying to hold your ground when you start to slide
pressure to compromise comes from every side

wise up, rise up
wise up, rise up

you can be more than a conqueror, you will never face defeat (how?)
you can dare to win by losing all, you can face the heat
dare to beat the system, face the heat
dare to beat the system (yeah)

on the assembly line trying to break the mold
time to throw the wrench that will stop it cold
going against the odds, being the underdog
dare to wield the sword that will slice the fog
wise up, rise up
wise up, rise up

you can be more than a conqueror, you will never face defeat (how?)
you can dare to win by losing all, you can face the heat
dare to beat the system, face the heat
dare to beat the system (yeah)

you can go for it all, you can go for broke
you can turn the tide around (turn the tide around)
you can aim for the top and take the lion's share
if you dare to hold your ground
beat the system

wise up (wise up), rise up (rise up)
wise up (wise up), rise up (rise up)
wise up (wise up), rise up (rise up)
wise up (wise up), rise up (rise up)

you can be more than a conqueror, you will never face defeat (how?)
you can dare to win by losing all, you can face the heat
dare to beat the system, face the heat
dare to beat the system (yeah) 

city lights are flashing, they call you to the streets
hearts are filled with passion in everyone you meet
the boulevard is waiting, it wants to get you high
neon signs are waiting to sell you anything you want to buy
but i know your devices, it shouldn't seem so odd
you lied from the beginning, i see through your facade
(chorus)
angel of light, i see you glow in the night
but you only bring darkness to my soul
angel of light, you're telling me wrong is right
i won't let you're evil take control
they follow in your footsteps not knowing that you fell
bumper to bumper on the freeway to hell
you lead them into wrong and you make it look so right
you lead them into darkness and make them think you lead them into light
but i know where you're going, too bad you're not alone
if it wasn't for the real light i might have never known
angel of light, i see you glow in the night
but you only bring darkness to my soul
angel of light, you're telling me wrong is right
i won't let you're evil take control
you got the clergy working overtime to widen the narrow way
you've got politicians everywhere listening to what you say
you've got false apostles teaching lies perverting the only way
you've got principalities and powers waiting to obey
you've got philosophies and vain deceits lying to deceive
you've got hate, and greed, ungodly lusts in the deadly web you weave
somehow you've got so many thinking you're not even there
one look is all it takes to get them blinded by your glare
angel of light, i see you glow in the night
but you only bring darkness to my soul
angel of light, you're telling me wrong is right
i won't let you're evil take control 

words and music by bob hartman
based on psalm 95:7-8, hebrews 3:13
(chorus)
don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold
may it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old
don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure
keep it broken before jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure
may it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with god's
may it never be contrary - may it never be at odds
may it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit
may it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat
may your heart be always open - never satisfied with right
may your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might
let his love rain down upon you
breaking up your fallow ground
let it lossen all the binding
till only tenderness is found 

onward christian soldiers, marching as to war
with the cross of jesus going on before
onward then, ye people, join our happy throng
blend with ours your voices in a triumph song
christ, the royal master, leads against the foe
forward into battle, see his banners go, oh
onward christian soldiers, marching as to war
with the cross of jesus going on before
crowns and thrones may perish
kingdoms rise and wane
but the cross of jesus constant will remain
marching as to war
oh, we're marching as to war
oh, we're marching as to war
onward then, ye people, join our happy throng
blend with ours your voices in a triumph song
onward christian soldiers, marching as to war
with the cross of jesus going on before
marching as to war
oh, we're marching as to war 

kenaniah
words by bob hartman, john lawry, and danny kingen
based on 1 chronicles 15:22,27
kenaniah of the levites appointed by the king
to teach the songs of zion, to lead them as they sing
your song is not forgotten, we hear it in our souls
let it burn and burn within us
and fan the sacred coals
kenaniah, kenaniah, we will sing your ancient song
kenaniah, kenaniah, we will sing it loud and strong
gathered for the battle, kenaniah led the way
as the singers closely followed him, they all began to pray
the musicians all assembled, kenaniah gave the word
through the raging battle zone, the anthem could be heard
kenaniah, kenaniah, we will never let it die
kenaniah, kenaniah, we must lift it to the sky
sing unto jehovah of his wondrous ways
sing a song of triumph, sing a victory song
and in the cloud of witnesses, kenaniah sings along
kenaniah, kenaniah, through the ages it will ring
kenaniah, kenaniah, to jehovah we will sing
