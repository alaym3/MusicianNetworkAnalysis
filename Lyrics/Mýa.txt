i see the line up ahead me
should i just take off running, i don’t wanna come in last
i wanna win but the other me suddenly feels afraid and i start to pull back
you have to pardon me for my stupid metaphors
i don’t use them anymore, i’m in love, i’m falling in love
and i’m at ease like a summer breeze
in cutoff shorts and a shirt with no sleeves
hearts racing fast, foot on the gas
imagine i'm asking where you wanna go, let’s go
dash
i'd cross whatever if you only ask, ohhh
i wanna dash
take both hands off of the wheel and crash, ohhh
i wanna dash like a gust of wind
like a wave come rushing into your arms again
and then a flash, the laughter gets louder and louder the faster we dash
daaaaash
i see a part of me that lives in you
and i glow each time that i see your face
don’t know where i’ll end but i’ll take the chance
if i’m guilty of loving i’ll take the blame
so excuse me when i’m drifting off again
i’m so captivated, i’m in love, i’m falling in love
and i’m at ease like a summer breeze
in cutoff shorts and a shirt with no sleeves
hearts racing fast, foot on the gas
imagine i'm asking where you wanna go, let’s go
dash
i'd cross whatever if you only ask, ohhh
i wanna dash
take both hands off of the wheel and crash, yeaaah
i wanna dash like a gust of wind
like a wave come rushing into your arms again
and then a flash, the laughter gets louder and louder the faster we dash
like a waterfall i’m running, on a hurricane i’m coming
it’s unpredictable, but my heart’s beating too fast and i
i don’t wanna jump the gun and i
i’m too afraid that you may pass me by
don’t wanna fight it anymore, so i’m opening up the door
and i’m about to make a dash
daaaaaash
and i just wanna
dash (dash)
i'd cross whatever if you only ask, i'd cross whatever
i wanna dash (i wanna dash)
take both hands off of the wheel and crash, craaaash
i wanna dash like a gust of wind
like a wave come rushing into your arms again, and to your heart
and then a flash, the laughter gets louder and louder the faster we dash
dash, like a gust of wind
like a wave come rushing into your arms again
and then a flash, the laughter gets louder and louder the faster we dash
