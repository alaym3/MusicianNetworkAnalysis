she's got a smile that it seems to me
reminds me of childhood memories
where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (sky)
now and then when i see her face
she takes me away to that special place
and if i stared too long i'd probably break down and cry

woah-oh-oh! sweet child o' mine
woah, oh-oh-oh! sweet love of mine


she's got eyes of the bluest skies
as if they thought of rain
i hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
where as a child i'd hide
and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

woah-oh-oh! sweet child o' mine
ooh, oh-oh-oh! sweet love of mine


oh yeah! woah-oh-oh-oh! sweet child o' mine
ooh-oh, oh, oh! sweet love of mine
woah, oh-oh-oh! sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
ooh! sweet love of mine


where do we go?
where do we go now?
where do we go?
ooh, where do we go?
where do we go now?
oh, where do we go now?
where do we go? (sweet child...)
ooh, where do we go now?
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
where do we go now? ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow
where do we go?
oh, where do we go now?
oh, where do we go?
where do we go now?
where do we go?
ooh, where do we go now?
now, now, now, now, now, now, now
sweet child, sweet child o' mine

oh my god
jump

welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
we got everything you want, honey, we know the names
we are the people that can find whatever you may need
if you got the money, honey, we got your disease

in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees
mwah, ah, i wanna watch you bleed

welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
if you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay
and you're a very sexy girl, it's very hard to please
you can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
feel my, my, my, my serpentine
oh, ah, i wanna hear you scream

moaning

welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
you learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
if you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
you can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees
mwah, i wanna watch you bleed

and when you're high, you never
ever want to come down
so down, so down, so down, yeah


you know where you are?
you're in the jungle, baby
you're gonna die

in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees

in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
watch it bring you to your, it's going to bring you down, huh

when i look into your eyes
i can see a love restrained
but, darlin', when i hold you
don't you know i feel the same? yeah...

'cause nothing lasts forever
and we both know hearts can change
and it's hard to hold a candle
in the cold november rain

we've been through this such a long, long time
just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
but lovers always come and lovers always go
and no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
if we could take the time to lay it on the line
i could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

so, if you want to love me
then, darlin', don't refrain
or i'll just end up walkin'
in the cold november rain

do you need some time on your own?
do you need some time all alone?
ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

i know it's hard to keep an open heart
when even friends seem out to harm you
but if you could heal a broken heart
wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah


sometimes, i need some time on my own
sometimes, i need some time all alone
ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?


and when your fears subside
and shadows still remain, ooh yeah
i know that you can love me
when there's no one left to blame

so, never mind the darkness
we still can find a way
'cause nothin' lasts forever
even cold november rain

what we've got here is failure to communicate
some men, you just can't reach
so, you get what we had here, last week
which is the way he wants it
well, he gets it
*whistling*
and i don't like it any more than you men

look at your young men fighting
look at your women crying
look at your young men dying
the way they've always done before
look at the hate we're breeding
look at the fear we're feeding
look at the lives we're leading
the way we've always done before

my hands are tied
the billions shift from side to side
an' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
for the love of god and our human rights
an' all these things are swept aside
by bloody hands, time can't deny
an' are washed away by your genocide
an' history hides the lies of our civil wars


d'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
who said peace could last forever?
an' in my first memories, they shot kennedy
i went numb when i learned to see
so i never fell for vietnam
we got the wall in d.c. to remind us all
that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
when everybody's fightin' for their promised land

and i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
ain't that fresh? i don't need your civil war
ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

look at the shoes you're filling
look at the blood we're spilling
look at the world we're killing
the way we've always done before
look in the doubt we've wallowed
look at the leaders we've followed
look at the lies we've swallowed
an' i don't want to hear no more

my hands are tied
for all, i've seen has changed my mind
but still, the wars go on, as the years go by
with no love of god or human rights
an' all these dreams are swept aside
by bloody hands of the hypnotized
who carry the cross of homicide
and history bears the scars of our civil wars


we practice selective annihilation
of mayors and government officials
for example, to create a vacuum
then we fill that vacuum
as popular war advances
peace is closer

i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
ain't that fresh? i don't need your civil war
no no no no no no no no no no no no
i don't need your civil war
i don't need your civil war
your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
ain't that fresh? i don't need your civil war
no no no no no no no no no no, no, no
i don't need one more war
ooh, i don't need one more war
no no no, no woah, no woah

what's so civil 'bout war anyway?

one, two, one, two, three, four
*whistling*

shed a tear 'cause i'm missin' you, i'm still alright to smile
girl, i think about you every day now
was a time when i wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease
there is no doubt you're in my heart now

said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
all we need is just a little patience
said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
all we need is just a little patience
patience, mm yeah...

i sit here on the stairs 'cause i'd rather be alone
if i can't have you right now, i'll wait, dear
sometimes i get so tense, but i can't speed up the time
but you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
you and i'll just use a little patience
said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
you and i've got what it takes to make it
we won't fake it, aw, i'll never break it, 'cause i can't take it


(little patience, hm yeah, hm yeah)
(need a little patience, yeah)
(just a little patience, yeah)
(some more patience)
i've been walkin' the streets at night (yeah)
just tryin' to get it right (a little patience)
it's hard to see with so many around (yeah)
you know i don't like bein' stuck in the crowd (could use some patience)
an' the streets don't change, but maybe the names (yeah)
i ain't got time for the game 'cause i need you (gotta have more patience)
yeah-yeah, but i need you (yeah)
ooh, i need you (all it takes is patience)
oh, i need you (just a little patience)
ooh, this time (is all you need)

i'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line
rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta

guess i needed some time to get away
i needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
so i thumbed it down to 6th in l.a
maybe a greyhound could be my way
police and niggers, that's right, get out of my way
don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack

you're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
you're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
you know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
much too high, much too high, much too high

immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
they come to our country and think they'll do as they please
like start some mini iran or spread some fucking disease
they talk so many god damn ways, it's all greek to me
well, some say i'm lazy and others say that's just me
some say i'm crazy, i guess i'll always be
but it's been such a long time since i knew right from wrong
it's all the means to and end, i, i keep it moving along
hey, hey, hey, yeah

you're one in a million, yeah, you're a shooting star
you're one in a million, babe, you know that you are
maybe some day we'll see you before you make us cry
you know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
much too high, much too high, much too high, oh


radicals and racists, don't point your finger at me
i'm a small town white boy just trying to make ends meet
don't need your religion, don't watch that much tv
just making my living, baby, well, that's enough for me

you're one in a million, yeah, you know that you are
you're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
you know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
much too high, much too high, oh, much too high

much too high, much too high, much too high
much too high, much too high, much too high

if i say i don't need anyone, i can say these things to you
'cause i can turn on anyone just like i've turned on you
i've got a tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
and i can do you favors but then you'll do whatever i like

here i am, and you're a rocket queen
i might be a little young, but, honey, i ain't naive
here i am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
i might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

i've seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
i've had everything that's tangible, honey, you'd be surprised
i'm a sexual innuendo in this burned out paradise
if you turn me on to anything, you better turn me on tonight

here i am, and you're a rocket queen
i might be a little young, but, honey, i ain't naive
here i am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
i might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene


here i am, and you're a rocket queen
i might be a little young, but, honey, i ain't naive
here i am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
i might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

i see you standin', standin' on your own
it's such a lonely place for you, for you to be
if you need a shoulder or if you need a friend
i'll be here standing until the bitter end
no one needs the sorrow, no one needs the pain
i hate to see you walking out there out in the rain
so, don't chastise me or think i, i mean you harm
of those that take you leave you strung out much too far
baby, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, baby, yeah

all i ever wanted was for you to know that i care

loaded like a freight train
flyin' like an aeroplane
feelin' like a space brain
one more time tonight

well, i'm a west coast struttin
one bad mother(fucker)
got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
said, i'm a mean machine, been drinkin' gasoline
and, honey, you can make my motor hum
well, i got one chance left in a nine lives cat
i got a dog eat dog sly smile
i got a molotov cocktail with a match, to-go
i smoke my cigarette with style
and i can tell you, honey, you can make my money tonight
wake up late, honey, put on your clothes
an' take your credit card to the liquor store
an' that's one for you, and two for me by tonight

i'll be loaded like a freight train
flyin' like an aeroplane
feelin' like a space brain
one more time tonight

i'm on the nightrain, bottoms up
i'm on the nightrain, fill my cup
i'm on the nightrain, ready to crash and burn, i never learn
i'm on the nightrain, i love that stuff
i'm on the nightrain, an' i can never get enough
i'm on the nightrain, never to return, no


loaded like a freight train
flyin' like an aeroplane
speedin' like a space brain
one more time tonight

i'm on the nightrain, an' i'm looking for some
i'm on the nightrain, so i can leave this slum
i'm on the nightrain, an' i'm ready to crash and burn
nightrain, bottoms up
i'm on the nightrain, fill my cup
i'm on the nightrain, ah, ah, ah, whoa yeah
i'm on the nightrain, love that stuff
i'm on the nightrain, an' i can never get enough
ridin' the nightrain, i guess i, i guess, i guess, i guess, i never learn
on the nightrain, float me home
oh, i'm on the nightrain
ridin' the nightrain, never to return
nightrain

when you're talkin' to yourself and nobody's home
you can fool yourself, you came in this world alone (alone)

so nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be?
so what'll happen to you, baby? guess we'll have to wait and see
one, two

old at heart, but i'm only 28
and i'm much too young to let love break my heart
young at heart, but it's gettin' much too late
to find ourselves so far apart

i don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
an' what more could you ask from me, yay?
how could you say that i never needed you?
when you took everythin', said, you took everythin' from me
hey, yeah

young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
when no one i know can seem to help me now
old at heart, but i mustn't hesitate
if i'm to find my own way out

still, talkin' to myself and nobody's home (alone)

so nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
so what'll happen to us, baby? guess we'll have to wait and see


when i find out all the reasons
maybe i'll find another way, find another day
with all the changin' seasons
of my life, maybe i'll get it right next time
an' now that you've been broken down
got your head out of the clouds, back down on the ground
an' you don't talk so loud an' you don't walk so proud
anymore and what for?


well, i jumped into the river too many times to make it home
i'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone
if it doesn't show, give it time to read between the lines
'cause i see the storm is gettin' closer
an' the waves, they get so high
seems everythin' we've ever known's here
why must it drift away and die?


i'll never find anyone to replace you
guess i'll have to make it through this time, woah, this time
without you
i knew the storm was gettin' closer
and all my friends said i was high
but everythin' we've ever known's here
i never wanted it to die

i get up around seven
get out of bed around nine
and i don't worry about nothing, no
because worrying's a waste of my time
the show usually starts around seven
we go on stage around nine
get on the bus about eleven
sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

we've been dancing with mister brownstone
he's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
no, no, no, he won't leave me alone

i used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryna get a little better
said the little better than before
i used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryna get a little better
said the little better than before

we've been dancing with mister brownstone
he's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
no, no, no, he won't leave me alone


now, i get up around whenever
i used to get up on time
but that old man he's a real motherfucker
gonna kick him on down the line

i used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryna get a little better
said the little better than before
i used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryna get a little better
said the little better than before

we've been dancing with mister brownstone
he's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
no, no, no, he won't leave me alone
oh, leave me alone

stuck it in the middle and i shot it in the middle
and it, it drove outta my mind
i should've known better, said i wish i never met her
said i leave it all–behind
yowsa!

i'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn and i'll rip your heart in two
and i'll leave you lyin' on the bed
i'll be out the door before you wake 'em, it's nothin' new to you
'cause i think we've seen that movie, too

'cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
you get nothin' done, i said, you could be mine, aw

now, holidays come and then they go, it's nothin' new today
collect another memory
when i come home, late at night, don't ask me where i've been
just count your stars i'm home again

'cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
you get nothin' done, i said, you could be mine

you could be mine, you could be mine
you could be mine, you could be mine
you could be mine, mine, mine, mine
you've gone sketching too many times
ooh, why don't you give it a rest?
why must you find another reason to cry?


well, you're breakin' down my back and i've been rackin' out my brain
it don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
you can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
and i could sleep on it until mornin', but this nightmare never ends
don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
an' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than i can stand
'cause this couch-trip's gettin' older, tell me how long has it been?
'cause five years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

oh, you could be mine, but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
you get nothin' done, i said, you could, you should be

you could be mine
oh, you could be mine
you could be mine
aw, you could be mine
you could be mine

aw, you could be mine
aw, you could be mine
aw, you could be mine
you could be mine, yeah

i see your sister in her sunday dress
she's out to please, she pouts her best
she's out to take, no need to try
she's ready to make

it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me, baby
it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me

cars are crashing every night
i drink and drive everything's in sight
i make the fire, but i miss the firefight
i hit the bullseye every night

it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me, baby
yeah, it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me

it's so easy
but nothing seems to please me
it all fits so right
when i fade into the night
see me hit you, you fall down, huh

i see you standing there
you think you're so cool
why don't you just
fuck off


you get nothing for nothing if that's what you do
turn around, bitch, i got a use for you
besides, you ain't got nothing better to do
and i'm bored

it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me, baby
yeah, it's so easy, easy
when everybody's trying to please me

it's so easy
but nothing seems to please me
it all fits so right
when i fade into the night
so come with me
don't ask me where 'cause i don't know
i'll try to please you
i ain't got no money, but it goes to show

it's so easy, so fucking easy
it's so easy, so damn easy
it's so easy, oh, so fucking easy
it's so easy, yeah, so easy

it's so easy, so fucking easy
it's so easy, yeah!

if we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
no one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
i was the one who was washing blood off your hands

don't you cry tonight, i still love you, baby
don't you cry tonight
don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
and don't you cry tonight

i know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
with all the people talking, it's driving you mad
if i was standing by you, how would you feel
knowing your love's decided, and all love is real? yeah, baby

don't you cry tonight
don't you cry tonight
don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
and don't you cry tonight


i thought i could live in your world as years all went by
with all the voices i've heard, something has died
and when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
so many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

and don't you cry tonight
and don't you cry tonight
and don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
and don't you cry
don't you ever cry
don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday
don't you cry, don't you ever cry
don't you cry tonight

and now, i don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
but then, it seems that i had seen it in her eyes
though it might not be wise, i'd still have to try
with all the love i have inside, i can't deny
i just can't let it die, 'cause her heart's just like mine
and she holds her pain inside
so, if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
i know somewhere inside
there is a special light, still shining bright
and even on the darkest night, she can't deny

so, if she's somewhere near me, i hope to god she hears me
there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive
i hoped she'd never leave me, please god, you must believe me
i've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

no matter how i try, you say it's all a lie
so what's the use of my confessions to a crime
of passions that won't die
in my heart?

so, if she's somewhere near me, i hope to god she hears me
there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive
i hoped she'd never leave me, please god, you must believe me
i've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes


so, if she's somewhere near me, i hope to god she hears me
there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive
i hoped she'd never leave me, please god, you must believe me
i've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

so, now i don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
it just might be that i had seen it in her eyes
and now, it seems that i gave up my ghost of pride
i'll never say goodbye

your daddy works in porno, now that mommy's not around
she used to love her heroin, but now she's underground
so, you stay out late at night and you do your coke for free
drivin' your friends crazy with your life's insanity

well, well, well, you just can't tell
well, well, well, my michelle
look out

sowin all your wild oats in another's luxuries
yesterday was tuesday, maybe thursday you can sleep
but school starts much too early and this hotel wasn't free
so party 'til your connection calls, honey, i'll return the key

well, well, well, you just can't tell
well, well, well, my michelle
well, well, well, you never can tell
well, well, well, my michelle

everyone needs love
you know that it's true
someday you'll find someone that'll fall in love with you
but, oh, the time it takes
when you're all alone
someday you'll find someone that you can call your own
but 'til then ya better!


now you're clean and so discreet i won't say a word
but most of all this song is true, case you haven't heard
so c'mon and stop your cryin', 'cause we both know money burns
honey don't stop tryin' an' you'll get what you deserve

well, well, well, you just can't tell
well, well, well, my michelle
well, well, well, you never can tell
well, well, well, my michelle

my my my michelle
