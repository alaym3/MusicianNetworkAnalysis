ooh-ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
i've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
because of you, i am afraid

i lose my way
and it's not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
my heart can't possibly break
when it wasn't even whole to start with

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me, but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid

i watched you die, i heard you cry every night in your sleep
(i watched you die, in your sleep)
i was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(i was too young for you to lean on me)
you never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(you never saw me, yeah yeah)
and now i cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i try my hardest just to forget everything
because of you
i don't know how to let anyone else in
because of you
i'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
because of you
i am afraid

because of you (ah ah, ah, ah)
because of you, mmh, ooh...

and all i remember is your back
walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
i traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to

but piece by piece, he collected me
up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me
at six years old
and you know, he never walks away
he never asks for money
he takes care of me, he loves me
piece by piece, he restored my faith
that a man can be kind and a father could stay

and all of your words fall flat
i made something of myself and now you wanna come back
but your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
back then i didn’t have anything you needed, so i was worthless

but piece by piece, he collected me
up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me
at six years old
and you know, he never walks away
he never asks for money
he takes care of me, 'cause he loves me
piece by piece, he restored my faith
that a man can be kind and a father could stay

piece by piece
piece by piece
piece by piece
piece by piece
piece by piece
piece by piece

piece by piece, i fell far from the tree
i will never leave her like you left me
and she will never have to wonder her worth
because unlike you, i’m gonna put her first
and you know...
he’ll never walk away
he’ll never break her heart
he’ll take care of things, he’ll love her
piece by piece, he restored my faith
that a man can be kind and a father should be great

piece by piece
piece by piece
piece by piece

here's the thing, we started out friends
it was cool, but it was all pretend
yeah, yeah, since you been gone
you dedicated, you took the time
wasn't long till i called you mine
yeah, yeah, since you been gone

and all you'd ever hear me say
is how i pictured me with you
that's all you'd ever hear me say

but since you been gone
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you, now i get what i want
since you been gone

how can i put it? you put me on
i even fell for that stupid love song
yeah, yeah, since you been gone

how come i'd never hear you say
"i just wanna be with you" (be with you)
i guess you never felt that way

but since you been gone
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you, now i get, i get what i want
since you been gone

you had your chance, you blew it
out of sight, out of mind
shut your mouth, i just can't take it
again and again and again and again

since you been gone (since you been gone)
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you (thanks to you)
now i get, i get what i want
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you (thanks to you)
now i get (i get)
you should know (you should know)
that i get, i get what i want

since you been gone
since you been gone
since you been gone

you're here where you should be
snow is falling as the carolers sing
it just wasn't the same
alone on christmas day
presents, what a beautiful sight
don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
you're all that i need
underneath the tree

tonight, i'm gonna hold you close
make sure that you know
i was lost before you
christmas was cold and grey
another holiday
alone to celebrate

but then, one day, everything changed
you're all i need
underneath the tree

you're here where you should be
snow is falling as the carolers sing
it just wasn't the same
alone on christmas day
presents, what a beautiful sight
don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
you're all that i need
underneath the tree

i found what i was looking for
a love that's meant for me
a heart that's mine completely
knocked me right off my feet
and this year i will fall
with no worries at all

'cause you are near and everything's clear
you're all i need
underneath the tree

you're here where you should be
snow is falling as the carolers sing
it just wasn't the same
alone on christmas day
presents, what a beautiful sight
don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
you're all that i need
underneath the tree

don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (underneath the tree)
you're all that i need (underneath the tree, yeah)
underneath the tree, tonight
oh, you're all i need
underneath, underneath the tree

you know the bed feels warmer
sleepin' here alone (sleepin' here alone)
you know i dream in color
and do the things i want (do the things i want)

you think you got the best of me
think you've had the last laugh
bet you think that everything good is gone
think you left me broken down
think that i'll come running back
baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

you heard that i was starting over with someone new
they told you i was moving on and over you

you didn't think that i'd come back
i'd come back swinging
you tried to break me, but you see

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

thanks to you, i got a new thing started
thanks to you, i'm not the broken-hearted
thanks to you i'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
you know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
in the end

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone

when i'm alone

if your touch is a key
keep on twistin', keep unlockin', keep on turnin' me

i wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
if i let you in

(love so soft, so soft, yeah)

there are moments that the words don't reach
there is suffering too terrible to name
you hold your child as tight as you can
then push away the unimaginable
the moments when you're in so deep
feels easier to just swim down
and so they move uptown
and learn to live with the unimaginable
i spend hours in the garden
i walk alone to the store
and it's quiet uptown
i never liked the quiet before
i take the children to church on sunday
a sign of the cross at the door
and i pray
that never used to happen before

if you see him in the street walking by himself
talking to himself, have pity
you would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown
he is working through the unimaginable
his hair has gone grey, he passes every day
they say he walks the length of the city
you knock me out, i fall apart
can you imagine?

look at where we are
look at where we started
i know i don't deserve you
but hear me out, that would be enough
if i could spare his life
if i could trade his life for mine
he'd be standing here right now
and you would smile
and that would be enough
i don't pretend to know
the challenges we're facing
i know there's no replacing what we've lost
and you need time
but i'm not afraid
i know who i married
just let me stay here by your side
and that would be enough

if you see him in the street, walking by her side
talking by her side, have pity
do you like it uptown? it's quiet uptown
he is trying to do the unimaginable
if you see him walking in the park, long after dark
taking in the sights of the city
look around, look around, look around
they are trying to do the unimaginable

there are moments that the words don't reach
there's a grace too powerful to name
we push away what we could never understand
we push away the unimaginable
they are standing in the garden
standing there side by side
she takes his hand
it's quiet uptown
forgiveness, can you imagine?
forgiveness, can you imagine?

if you see him in the street, walking by her side
talking by her side, have pity
look around, look around
they are going through the unimaginable

da-da-da, un, da-da
da-da-da, un, da-da
da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
da-da-da, un, da-da
da-da-da, un, da-da
da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da

grew up in a small town
and when the rain would fall down
i'd just stare out my window
dreaming of what could be
and if i'd end up happy
i would pray (i would pray)

trying hard to reach out
but when i tried to speak out
felt like no one could hear me
wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here
so i prayed (i would pray), i could break away

i'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly
i'll do what it takes 'til i touch the sky
and i'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i won't forget all the ones that i love
i'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway

wanna feel the warm breeze
sleep under a palm tree
feel the rush of the ocean
get onboard a fast train
travel on a jet plane, far away (i will)
and breakaway

i'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly
i'll do what it takes 'til i touch the sky
and i'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
i won't forget all the ones that i love (i gotta)
i gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway

buildings with a hundred floors
swinging 'round revolving doors
maybe i don't know where they'll take me, but
gotta keep moving on, moving on
fly away, breakaway

i'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly (learn how to fly)
though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
i gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i won't forget of the place i come from
i gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
and breakaway

breakaway
breakaway

when you're lost in the moment
you can't see where you're goin'
i didn’t know who i could trust
so i put all my faith in us
oh, you tore me to pieces
turned my strength into weakness
i didn't want it all to fall apart
so i decided just to play the part

but honestly, i'd do it all again
puttin' up with all the bullshit
it made me strong enough to do this

it used to bother me, thought i could never leave
after all that i've been through, nothin' left to prove
no, no, no, i don't think about you
weighing down on me
i lost my sanity
and now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
no, no, no, i don't think about you

i feel freedom where i stand now
and i feel proud of who i am now
yeah, i learned a lot along the way
i love the woman that i became

i was patient, but not anymore
it's back in my hands
and you swore i'd never do it
but it's your time to face the music

it used to bother me, thought i could never leave
after all that i've been through, nothin' left to prove
no, no, no, i don't think about you
weighing down on me
i lost my own sanity
and now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
no, no, no, i don't think about you

it was hard to hold on
days and nights i thought i'd never make it at all
couldn't make it at all
now i stand tall
feeling like myself again, no worries at all
breathe
no one can stop me from livin' this moment for me
i found my heartbeat
after all that i've been through
no, i don't think about you

it used to bother me, thought i could never leave
after all that i've been through, nothin' left to prove
no, no, no, i don't think about you
weighing down on me
i found my sanity
and now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
no, no, no, i don't think about you

i don't think about you (no)
(no, no, no) no, no, no
(not anymore) not anymore
no, no, no, i don't think about you

remember all the things we wanted
now all our memories, they're haunted
we were always meant to say goodbye
even with our fists held high
it never would've worked out right, yeah
we were never meant for do or die

i didn't want us to burn out
i didn't come here to hurt you, now i can't stop

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on
so i'm already gone

looking at you makes it harder
but i know that you'll find another
that doesn't always make you wanna cry
it started with a perfect kiss then
we could feel the poison set in
"perfect" couldn't keep this love alive

you know that i love you so, i
love you enough to let you go

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on
so i'm already gone

i'm already gone, already gone
you can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
i'm already gone, already gone
there's no moving on, so i'm already gone

ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone (ooh, oh)
ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

remember all the things we wanted
now all our memories, they're haunted
we were always meant to say goodbye

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on
so i'm already gone

i'm already gone, already gone
you can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
i'm already gone, already gone
there's no moving on
so i'm already gone

bet you won't like to hear that
since we've been over, got that stress off my back
i'm livin' my life like a celebration
changed up my vision like a revelation
you gave me fever love, but too much drama
and i ain't even worried 'bout it 'cause i'm too far gone now
far gone now, oh yeah

i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
don't talk about ya
almost forgot about you
said, i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you

can't hold me down long
i'm not bothered anymore

ya can't get me high
never got me lit
never bring me up
always drag me down
i'm through with it
you ain't my medicine

i gave you plenty chances
to heal my soul, but you just caused more damage
how does it feel to know i'm better off without you playin'
games around my head a thousand times?
i almost damn near lost my mind

i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
don't talk about ya (no, no)
almost forgot about you
i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you (no, no)
i ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
don't talk about ya

miss unafraid
miss out of my way
miss don't let a man interfere, no

you, where the hell did you come from?
you're a different, different kind of fun
and i'm so used to feeling numb
now i've got pins and needles on my tongue
anticipating what's to come
like a finger on a loaded gun

i can feel it rising
temperature inside me
haven't felt it for a long time

this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
been so long, i forgot how to turn it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long
this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
turned it on, but i know you can take it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long (all night long)

i, i wasn't even gonna go out
but i never would've had a doubt
if i'd have known where i'd be now

your hands on my hips
and my kiss on your lips
oh, i could do this for a long time

this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
been so long, i forgot how to turn it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long
this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
turned it on, but i know you can take it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long, all night long

until tonight, i only dreamed about you
i can't believe i've ever breathed without you
baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
bring it one more time (one more time)

this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
been so long, i forgot how to turn it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long
this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
turned it on, but i know you can take it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long, all night long
this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
been so long, i forgot how to turn it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long
this is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
turned it on, but i know you can take it
up, up, up, up all night long
oh, up, up all night long

higher than the leaves, they fall from trees like d-o-double g's
i reside in tennessee, but texas still flows deep in me

i'm a whole lotta woman
(from the way i walk and toss my hips)
hey, i'm a whole lotta woman

(anything i see i want, i get)
i'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, hey

come on!
wait, do it again

seems like just yesterday
you were a part of me
i used to stand so tall
i used to be so strong
your arms around me tight
everything, it felt so right
unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

now i can't breathe
no, i can't sleep
i'm barely hangin' on

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

i told you everything
opened up and let you in
you made me feel alright for once in my life
now all that's left of me
is what i pretend to be
so together, but so broken up inside

'cause i can't breathe
no, i can't sleep
i'm barely hangin' on

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

swallow me then spit me out
for hating you, i blame myself
seeing you, it kills me now
no, i don't cry on the outside
anymore
anymore

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

there's a wolf that preys on a world that strays so far from the garden (oh)
and just like your own, every heart you know seems cold and hardened (oh)
you may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
you may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

i dare you to love
oh, i dare you to love
even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst
even if you think it's not enough
oh, i dare you to love

we're all full of hope, tryna stay afloat, tryna save one another
people let you drown 'cause they don't know how to stay above water
when they're too broken to know what they've put you through
do the only thing that you'd want done to you

oh, i dare you to love (dare you to love)
oh, i dare you to love (i dare you to love)
even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (oh)
even if you think it's not enough
oh, i dare you to love

i dare you to love, oh

you may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
you may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

i dare you to love, even if you can't
no, i dare you to love
oh, even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (only see the worst)
even if you think it's not enough
oh, i, i dare you

i dare you
oh, i, i dare you to love

ooh, yeah

i'm stumblin' through the darkness
there ain't no sign of a spark here
i'm used to feelin' that fire
you watered down that desire

i put my work in, day in, day out
baby, i deserve it, don't let me down
you used to make me feel like a diamond
now it don't even seem like you're tryin'
so give me one good reason i should need you

oh, come turn this around
oh, no, no, don't let us down
i need more heat from you, baby
make me feel weak for you, babe
oh, wanna feel alive
oh, like my heart's in the wild
i need more heat from you, baby
make me feel weak for you, babe

i'm slippin' out of your fingers
keep coolin' down like november
i'm used to feelin' that fever
i wanna dive in you deeper

i put that work in, day in, day out
baby, i deserve it, don't let me down, no
give me one good reason i should need you

oh, come turn this around

better than that, better than that

better than that, better than that
(so come on love) better than that, better than that
better than that (you i know i love you)
better than that

guess this means you're sorry
you're standin' at my door
guess this means you take back
all you said before
like how much you wanted
anyone but me
said you'd never come back
but here you are again

'cause we belong together now, yeah
forever united here somehow, yeah
you got a piece of me
and honestly
my life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

maybe i was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
maybe i was wrong for tryna pick a fight
i know that i've got issues
but you're pretty messed up too
either way i found out
i'm nothing without you

'cause we belong together now, yeah
forever united here somehow, yeah
you got a piece of me
and honestly
my life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

being with you is so dysfunctional
i really shouldn't miss you
but i can't let you go
oh, yeah

'cause we belong together now, yeah, yeah
forever united here somehow, yeah
you got a piece of me
and honestly
my life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you, yeah
'cause we belong together now, yeah (together now)
forever united here somehow, yeah
you got a piece of me
and honestly
my life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you
