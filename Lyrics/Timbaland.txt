this shit was all i knew, you and me only
i did it all for you, still you were lonely
we could've worked it out, uh, but i guess things change
it's funny how someone else's success brings pain
when you're no longer involved, that person has it all
and you just stuck standin' there but
i'm gon' need you to say something, baby
say-say something, baby
say something, babe, say something
i'm gon' need you to say something, baby
i'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

yeah, it really sucks, but ever since i’ve been long gone
i traded in my señorita for a microphone
i hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
if i was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
i need a paramedic girl, i’m feeling paralyzed
if i could choose, you will always be a friend to me
the more money i made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
i can’t help it if you feel ashamed
thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
how can something so familiar be so strange
closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
is it my mistake, thinking that where i am and where you at?
and my homeboy larry live is the only one that had my back
you were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
is it the money, want me to give it back?

this shit was all i knew, you and me only
i did it all for you, still you were lonely
we could've worked it out, uh, but i guess things change
it's funny how someone else's success brings pain
when you're no longer involved, that person has it all
and you just stuck standin' there but
i'm gon' need you to say something, baby
say-say something, baby
say something, babe, say something
i'm gon' need you to say something, baby

to a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
i sit and drink wine and watch californication, to life
you shoulda been here to kick it with me
we could have split this whole thing up 50/50
but now i'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
killing shit, the ever-so talented mr. ripley
how i go from being the man that you argue with
to me and dwayne carter putting out the hardest shit
i should wanna go back to the one i started with
but i'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
you could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

this shit was all i knew, you and me only
i did it all for you, still you were lonely
we could've worked it out, uh, but i guess things change
it's funny how someone else's success brings pain
when you're no longer involved, that person has it all

i'm like a drug, she's addicted to me, she can't keep me now
she always makin' plans today, come and find me tomorrow
goodbye, girl

she's too invested in the hours that pass her by
i'd pay attention if i thought it was worth the time
i'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
confusing passion for the love he never gave
fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
i'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
confusing passion for the love he never gave

i couldn't get rid of shorty if i wanted 'cause she was down
but i was tired of playin' the role like i ain't know that she get around
somethin' 'bout this girl fascinates me
she's the type that like to hang with the stars
the way she makes me feel and sedates me
who knew we would take it this far?
everywhere that i try to go, she got a "wanted" poster with my face on it
soon as i walk out the do', there it is, "wanted" poster with my face on it
can't blame myself when it's not, my fault cause nothin' is promised
at least i can say i was honest -- goodbye, girl
