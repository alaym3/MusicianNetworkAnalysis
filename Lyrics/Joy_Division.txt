when routine bites hard and ambitions are low
and resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
and we're changing our ways, taking different roads

then love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again

why is the bedroom so cold? you've turned away on your side
is my timing that flawed? our respect runs so dry
yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

but love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again


you cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
just that something so good, just can't function no more

then love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again
then love, love will tear it apart again
love, love will tear it apart again

i've been waiting for a guide
to come and take me by the hand
could these sensations make me feel
the pleasures of a normal man?
lose sensation, spare the insults
leave them for another day
i've got the spirit, lose the feeling
take the shock away

it's getting faster, moving faster now
it's getting out of hand
on the tenth floor, down the back stairs
into no man's land
lights are flashing, cars are crashing
getting frequent now
i've got the spirit, lose the feeling
let it out somehow

what means to you, what means to me
and we will meet again
i'm watching you, i'm watching her
i'll take no pity from your friends
who is right, who can tell
and who gives a damn right now?
until the spirit new sensation takes hold
then you know
until the spirit new sensation takes hold
then you know
until the spirit new sensation takes hold
then you know

i've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
i've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
feeling, feeling, feeling

a change of speed, a change of style
a change of scene, with no regrets
a chance to watch, admire the distance
still occupied, though you forget
different colours, different shades
over each mistakes were made
i took the blame
directionless so plain to see
a loaded gun won't set you free
so you say

we'll share a drink and step outside
an angry voice and one who cried
we'll give you everything and more
the strain's too much, can't take much more
oh, i've walked on water, run through fire
can't seem to feel it anymore

it was me, waiting for me
hoping for something more
me, seeing me this time
hoping for something else

to the centre of the city where all roads meet
waiting for you
to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
searching for you
i was moving through the silence without motion
waiting for you
in a room with a window in the corner
i found truth

in the shadowplay, acting out your own death
knowing no more
as the assassins all grouped in four lines
dancing on the floor
and with cold steel, odour on their bodies
made a move to connect
but i could only stare in disbelief
as the crowds all left

i did everything, everything i wanted to
i let them use you for their own ends
to the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you
to the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you

confusion in her eyes that says it all
she's lost control
and she's clinging to the nearest passer by
she's lost control
and she gave away the secrets of her past
and said, "i've lost control again"
and a voice that told her when and where to act
she said, "i've lost control again"

and she turned around and took me by the hand
and said, "i've lost control again"
and how i'll never know just why or understand
she said, "i've lost control again"
and she screamed out, kicking on her side, and said
"i've lost control again"
and seized up on the floor, i thought she'd die
she said, "i've lost control"

she's lost control again
she's lost control
she's lost control again
she's lost control


well, i had to phone her friend to state my case
and say she's lost control again
and she showed up all the errors and mistakes
and said, "i've lost control again"
but she expressed herself in many different ways
until she lost control again
and walked upon the edge of no escape
and laughed, "i've lost control"

she's lost control again
she's lost control
she's lost control again
she's lost control

in fear every day, every evening
he calls her aloud from above
carefully watched for a reason
painstaking devotion and love
surrendered to self preservation
from others who care for themselves
a blindness that touches perfection
but hurts just like anything else

isolation
isolation
isolation

mother i tried please believe me
i'm doing the best that i can
i'm ashamed of the things i've been put through
i'm ashamed of the person i am

isolation
isolation
isolation

but if you could just see the beauty
these things i could never describe
these pleasures a wayward distraction
this is my one lucky prize

isolation
isolation
isolation
isolation
isolation

this is the room, the start of it all
no portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall
i've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain
and the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained

where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?

these are your friends from childhood, through youth
who goaded you on, demanded more proof
withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in
so distorted and thin, distorted and thin

where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?


this is the car at the edge of the road
there's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed
i guess you were right when we talked in the heat
there's no room for the weak, no room for the weak

where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?

this is the room, the start of it all
through childhood, through youth, i remember it all
oh, i've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain
and the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained
the bodies obtained

where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?
where will it end?

walk in silence
don't walk away, in silence

see the danger, always danger
endless talking, life rebuilding
don't walk away

walk in silence
don't turn away, in silence

your confusion, my illusion
worn like a mask of self-hate, confronts and then dies
don't walk away

people like you find it easy
naked to see, walking on air
hunting by the rivers, through the streets, every corner
abandoned too soon, set down with due care

don't walk away, in silence
don't walk away

guess your dreams always end
they don't rise up, just descend
but i don't care anymore
i've lost the will to want more
i'm not afraid not at all
i watch them all as they fall
but i remember
when we were young

those with habits of waste
their sense of style and good taste
of making sure you were right
hey, don't you know you were right?
i'm not afraid anymore
i keep my eyes on the door
but i remember

tears of sadness for you
more upheaval for you
reflects a moment in time
a special moment in time
yeah, we wasted our time
we didn't really have time
but we remember
when we were young

and all god's angels beware
and all you judges beware
sons of chance, take good care
for all the people not there
i'm not afraid anymore
i'm not afraid anymore
i'm not afraid anymore
oh, i'm not afraid anymore

forced by the pressure
the territories marked
no longer the pleasure
oh, i've since lost the heart
corrupted from memory
no longer the power
it's creeping up slowly
the last fatal hour
oh, i don't know what made me
what gave me the right
to mess with your values
and change wrong to right

please keep your distance
the trail leads to here
there's blood on your fingers
brought on by fear
i campaigned for nothing
i worked hard for this
i tried to get to you
you treat me like this
it's just second nature
it's what we've been shown
we're living by your rules
that's all that we know

i tried to get to you
i tried to get to you
i tried to get to you
oh, i tried to get to...

radio, live transmission
radio, live transmission

listen to the silence, let it ring on
eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun
we would have a fine time living in the night
left to blind destruction, waiting for our sight

and we would go on as though nothing was wrong
and hide from these days we remained all alone
staying in the same place, just staying out the time
touching from a distance, further all the time

dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio

well i could call out when the going gets tough
the things that we've learnt are no longer enough
no language, just sound, that's all we need know
to synchronise love to the beat of the show
and we could dance

dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio

asylums with doors open wide
where people had paid to see inside
for entertainment they watch his body twist
behind his eyes he says, "i still exist"

this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside

in arenas he kills for a prize
wins a minute to add to his life
but the sickness is drowned by cries for more
pray to god, make it quick, watch him fall

this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, this is the way
this is the way, this is the way
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside

you'll see the horrors of a faraway place
meet the architects of law face to face
see mass murder on a scale you've never seen
and all the ones who try hard to succeed

this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside
this is the way, step inside

and i picked on the whims of a thousand or more
still pursuing the path that's been buried for years
all the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire
can't replace or relate, can't release or repair
take my hand and i'll show you what was and will be

instincts that can still betray us
a journey that leads to the sun
soulless and bent on destruction
a struggle between right and wrong
you take my place in the showdown
i'll observe with a pitiful eye
i'll humbly ask for forgiveness
a request well beyond you and i

heart and soul, one will burn
heart and soul, one will burn

an abyss that laughs at creation
a circus complete with all fools
foundations that lasted the ages
then ripped apart at their roots
beyond all this good is the terror
the grip of a mercenary hand
when savagery turns all good reason
there's no turning back, no last stand

heart and soul, one will burn
heart and soul, one will burn

existence, well, what does it matter?
i exist on the best terms i can
the past is now part of my future
the present is well out of hand
the present is well out of hand

heart and soul, one will burn
heart and soul, one will burn
one will burn, one will burn
heart and soul, one will burn

here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders
here are the young men, well where have they been?
we knocked on the doors of hell's darker chamber
pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in
watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying
we saw ourselves now as we never had seen
portrayal of the trauma and degeneration
the sorrows we suffered and never were free

where have they been?
where have they been?
where have they been?
where have they been?

weary inside, now our heart's lost forever
can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase
each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings
open then shut, then slammed in our face

where have they been?
where have they been?
where have they been?
where have they been?

so this is permanence, love's shattered pride
what once was innocence, turned on its side
a cloud hangs over me, marks every move
deep in the memory, of what once was love

oh how i realised how i wanted time
put into perspective, tried so hard to find
just for one moment, thought i'd found my way
destiny unfolded, i watched it slip away

excessive flash points, beyond all reach
solitary demands for all i'd like to keep
let's take a ride out, see what we can find
a valueless collection of hopes and past desires

i never realised the lengths i'd have to go
all the darkest corners of a sense i didn't know
just for one moment, i heard somebody call
looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

now that i've realised how it's all gone wrong
gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late

we were strangers
we were strangers
for way too long
for way too long
we were strangers (violent)
for way too long (violent)
we're strangers

get weak all the time
may just pass the time
me in my own world
yeah, you there beside
the gaps are enormous
we stare from each side
we were strangers
for way too long

violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair
moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon
me in my own world
the one that you knew (for way too long)

(we were strangers) we were strangers
(for way too long)
we were strangers
for way too long
for way too long

procession moves on, the shouting is over
praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
talking aloud as they sit round their tables
scattering flowers washed down by the rain
stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
watching them pass like clouds in the sky
try to cry out in the heat of the moment
possessed by a fury that burns from inside

cry like a child, though these years make me older
with children my time is so wastefully spent
a burden to keep, though their inner communion
accept like a curse an unlucky deal
played by the gate at the foot of the garden
my view stretches out from the fence to the wall
no words could explain, no actions determine
just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall

i walked through the city limits
(someone talked me in to try and do it)
attracted by some force within it
(had to close my eyes to get close to it)
around a corner where a prophet lay
(saw the place where she'd had a room to stay)
a wire fence where the children played
(saw the bed where the body lay)

and i was looking for a friend of mine
(and i had no time to waste)
yeah, looking for some friends of mine

the cars screeched, hear the sound on dust
(heard a noise just a car outside)
metallic blue turned red with rust
(pulled in close by the building's side)
in a group all forgotten youth
(had to think, collect my senses now)
are turned on to a knife-edged view
(find some places where my friends don't know)

and i was looking for a friend of mine
(and i had no time to waste)
yeah, looking for some friends of mine

down the dark streets, the houses looked the same
(getting darker now, faces look the same)
i walked round and round, they nailed me to a tree
(no stomach, torn apart, had to think again)
trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!
(trying to move away, had to move away and keep out)

four twelve windows, ten in a row
(behind a wall where a room to go)
the light shined like a neon show
(see the deep mellow warmth of the glow)
no place to stop, no place to go
(no time to lose, had to keep on going)
i guess they died some time ago
(i guess they died some time ago)

and i was looking for a friend of mine
(and i had no time to waste)
yeah, looking for some friends of mine

a legacy so far removed
one day will be improved
eternal rights we left behind
we were the better kind
two the same, set free too

i always looked to you
i always looked to you
i always looked to you

we fought for good, stood side by side
our friendship never died
on stranger waves, the lows and highs
our vision touched the sky
immortalists with points to prove

i put my trust in you
i put my trust in you
i put my trust in you

a house somewhere on foreign soil
where aging lovers call
is this your goal, your final needs
where dogs and vultures eat
committed still i turn to go

i put my trust in you
i put my trust in you
i put my trust in you
i put my trust in you
in you. in you. in you
put my trust in you, in you

this is a crisis i knew had to come
destroying the balance i'd kept
doubting, unsettling, and turning around
wondering what will come next
is this the role that you wanted to live?
i was foolish to ask for so much
without the protection and infancy's guard
it all falls apart at first touch

watching the reel as it comes to a close
brutally taking its time
people who change for no reason at all
it's happening all of the time
can i go on with this train of events?
disturbing and purging my mind
back out of my duties, when all's said and done
i know that i'll lose every time

moving along in our god-given ways
safety is sat by the fire
sanctuary from these feverish smiles
left with a mark on the door
is this the gift that i wanted to give?
forgive and forget's what they teach
or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
and watch as they drown by the beach

this is the crisis i knew had to come
destroying the balance i'd kept
turning around to the next set of lives
wondering what will come next
