all my love
baby, don't go, yeah
baby, don't go
all my, all my, all my love
i understand, just chillin'
baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
why you actin' like that?

it's such a shame, but i'm leaving (uh)
can't take the way you mistreated me (uh)
and it's crazy, but oh, baby (come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
it don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
i don't believe you wanna leave like this
i don't believe i just had my last real kiss
i do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

well, i'm bouncing and i'm out, son (what you want, baby?)
i gotta leave you alone (come on now)
'cause i'm good, holding down my spot
and i'm good reppin' the girls on the block (don't go, baby)
and i'm good, i got this thing on lock
so without me you'll be fine, right? (come on, baby)

all my pride is all i have
pride is what you had, baby girl, i'm what you have
you'll be needing me, but too bad
be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
the path you chose to run alone
i know you're independent, you can make it on your own
here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
but time is of the essence, why spend it alone? huh

the nights i waited up for you (oh, boy)
promises you made about coming through
so much time you wasted
that's why i had to replace you (uh, uh, uh)
it makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
especially me, i was creepin' all over town (creepin')
i thought my tender touch could lock you down (yeah)
i knew i had you, as cocky as it sounds
that's the way you used to giggle right before i put it down
it's better when you angry, come here, i'll prove it now (come here)
stop playing (haha, aw), you gaming
i gotta leave you alone (what you want now?)

'cause i'm good holding my spot
stop acting like that
and i'm good reppin' the girls on the block
now you know you need to stop
and i'm good, i got this thing on lock
so without me you'll be fine, right?
here we go

all my pride is all i have
pride is what you had, baby girl, i'm what you have
you'll be needing me, but too bad
be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
the path you chose to run alone
i know you're independent, you can make it on your own
here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
but time is of the essence, why spend it alone? huh

people make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (oh)
i'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
i promise i'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (come here)
ain't nothing you can say to me that
can change my mind, i got to let you go now (chill, baby)
and nothing will ever be the same, so just (yeah)
be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (baby, don't go)
and there's no more to explain to me, you know (come on, now)
i know your game and i'm not feeling what you do (come on, now)
so i'm bouncing and i'm out, son (don't bounce)
i gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

all my pride is all i have (don't bounce, baby)
pride is what you had, baby girl, i'm what you have
you'll be needing me, but too bad (don't bounce, baby)
be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (uh)
the path you chose to run alone
i know you're independent, you can make it on your own
here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
but time is of the essence, why spend it alone? huh
all my pride is all i have (don't bounce, baby)
pride is what you had, baby girl, i'm what you have (baby, don't go)
you'll be needing me, but too bad (you're everything to me)
be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (you mean everything to me, baby)
the path you chose to run alone
i know you're independent, you can make it on your own (we all make mistakes, you know what i'm sayin'?)
here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (i still love you, baby)
but time is of the essence, why spend it alone? huh (i'll always love you, baby)

i promise you
you know what i'm sayin'?

letra de "ni tú ni yo" ft. gente de zona

¡gente de zona!
lo mejor que suena ahora
jlo

como en la vida, el amor es así
nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
nunca imaginé enamorarme así
no tenías previsto sentir amor

el amor es así
inspirador, cautivador
conmovedor, provocador
y a veces tentación
el amor es así
controlador, es dictador
emocionante, apasionante
depredador

ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ay, le haremos caso a la gente
ellos no saben lo que se siente
cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
y tu corazón es testigo
dime qué fue lo que pasó
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
tenemos el control
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

nada de lo que hagamos ahora es inmoral porque cupido ya flechó
si el amor es inmortal entonces la inmortalidad nos eligió
tus labios son agua pura y mi mirada ya refleja el kamasutra
me gusta mi cama, pero prefiero la tuya

el amor es así
inspirador, cautivador
conmovedor, provocador
y a veces tentación
el amor es así
controlador, es dictador
emocionante, apasionante
depredador

ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ay, le haremos caso a la gente
ellos no saben lo que se siente
cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
y tu corazón es testigo
dime qué fue lo que pasó
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
tenemos el control
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

que sea lo que dios quiera
yo quiero vivir contigo
lo hacemos a tu manera
porque a mi me da lo mismo
que sea lo que dios quiera
yo quiero vivir contigo
lo hacemos a tu manera

ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ay, le haremos caso a la gente
ellos no saben lo que se siente
cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
y tu corazón es testigo
dime qué fue lo que pasó
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
tenemos el control
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
tenemos el control
ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

que sea lo que dios quiera (¡motif! yo te lo dije)
lo hacemos a tu manera (magnus, pero esta vez es con jlo)
que sea lo que dios quiera (lo mejor que suena ahora)
lo hacemos a tu manera (desde cuba, vamos a ver hasta que suba)

de ti

it seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
it's so ironic you're what i had pictured you to be
but there are facts in our lives we can never change
just tell me that you understand and feel the same
this perfect romance that i've created in my mind (in my mind)
i'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
but yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (ooh)
and so it seems like we'll never have the chance

ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (oh)
and you can't move on even though you try? (oh)
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
oh, i wish this could be real
ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (oh)
and you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (no)
ain't it strange how fate can play a part
in the story of your heart?

sometimes i think that a true love can never be (never be)
i just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (ooh)
life can be cruel in a way that i can't explain
and i don't think that i could face it all again
i barely know you but somehow i know what you're about (you're about)
a deeper love i've found in you, and i no longer doubt (ooh)
you've touched my heart, and it altered every plan i've made
and now i feel that i don't have to be afraid

ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (oh)
and you can't move on even though you try? (oh)
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
oh, i wish this could be real
ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (oh)
and you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (no)
ain't it strange how fate can play a part
in the story of your heart?

i locked away my heart
but you just set it free
emotions i felt
held me back from what my life should be (ooh)
i pushed you far away
and yet you stayed with me
i guess this means
that you and me were meant to be

ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (oh)
and you can't move on even though you try?
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
oh, i wish this could be real (oh, yeah)
ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (oh, yeah)
and you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (no, no)
ain't it strange how fate can play a part
in the story of your heart? (oh, yeah)
ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (funny)
and you can't move on even though you try? (even if you try)
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
baby, ain't it funny?
ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (change your life)
and you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (wrong or right)
ain't it strange how fate can play a part
baby, ain't it funny?
ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (can't deny)
and you can't move on even though you try? (even though you try)
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
baby
ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
and you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
ain't it strange how fate can play a part
ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
and you can't move on even though you try?
ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?

it's better now, feel better now

i still remember when things were broken
but put together the cracks we'll close in

hurry up, hurry up
there's no more waiting
we're still worth saving

feel the light
shining in the dark of night
remember what we forgot
i know it's a long shot
but we're bringing it all back
we're bringing it all back
feel the light
shining like the stars tonight
remember what we forgot
i know it's a long shot
but we're bringing it all back
we're bringing it all back

you and i can have it all tonight
so let's bring it back to life
now we have another chance to fly
another chance to make it right

feel the light
shining in the dark of night
remember what we forgot
i know it's a long shot
feel the light
shining like the stars tonight
remember what we forgot
i know it's a long shot
but we're bringing it all back
we're bringing it all back

here we go, here we go
feel better now, feel better now
here we go, here we go
it's better now, feel better now

los poderes

dos cuerpos entregados
un par de enamorados
flechados, cansados
sudor desenfrenado
cuando tú y yo nos juntamos
sin piedad (aquí no aguantamos)
nos damos

cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

la la la eh, el sudor en tu piel
a mí me vuelves loco
tus besos saben a miel
ahora, eh!
quiero tu desnudez
a mí si tú te vuelves lo hacemos otra vez
cuando se pone el babydoll ¡uf, arrasa!
una copa de vino y tumba la casa
no sé qué me pasa
pero cuando me abrasa
con su fuego me traspasa
y en el medio de la cama se entrega
siempre pa' alante
sabe como se breva
y se pega, se pega

cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

amor toda la noche
bañados en sudor
tenemos la fortuna
de perder el control
se oculta la luna
cuando sale el sol
se pierde mi blusa
y tu pantalón
suma la cama
resta la ropa
bésame rico
vuélveme loca
así, así, así
así, así, así
sabes a cielo
hueles a gloria
dame la vida y la victoria
así, así, así
así
yo quiero hacértelo lento
tu cuerpo
fluyendo así como el viento
sin mezclar los sentimientos

bien lento, muy lento (muy lento)
para aprovechar el tiempo, contigo bebé (¡jlo!)

cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
cuando hacemos el amor
amor, amor, amor
vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

hay emociones que no puedes controlar
y gente que te vuelve loca
