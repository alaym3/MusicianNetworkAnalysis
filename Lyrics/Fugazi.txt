out here
barely see my breath
surrounded
by jealousy and death
i can't be reached
only had one call
dragged underneath
separate from you all
you all
this time
lost my own return
in spite of
everything i've learned
i hid my tracks
spit out all my air
slipped into cracks
stripped of all my cares
my cares
i'm so tired
sheep are counting me
no more struggle
no more energy
no more patient
you can write that down
it's all too crazy
i'm not sticking 'round

i am a patient boy
i wait, i wait, i wait, i wait
my time is like water down a drain
everybody's moving, everybody's moving
everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving
please don't leave me to remain
in the waiting room

i don't want the news (i cannot use it)
i don't want the news (i won't live by it)
sitting outside of town
everybody's always down (tell me why?)
because they can't get up

(ahh, come on and get up)
(come on and get up)

but i don't sit idly by (ahh)
i'm planning a big surprise
i'm gonna fight for what i wanna be
and i won't make the same mistakes (because i know)
because i know how much time that wastes
(and function), function is the key
to the the waiting room

i don't want the news (i cannot use it)
i don't want the news (i won't live by it)
sitting outside of town
everybody's always down (tell me why?)
because they can't get up

(ahh, come on and get up)

up for the waiting room

sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
sitting in the waiting room (tell me why?)
because they can't get up

you can't be what you were

did you hear something outside?
it sounded like a gun
stay away from that window, boy
it's not anyone that we know

she does nothing to deserve it
he touches her 'cause he wants to observe it
we sit back like they taught us
we keep quiet like they taught us
he just wants, he wants to prove it
she does nothing to remove it
we don't want anyone to mind us
so we play the roles that they assigned us
she does nothing to conceal it
he touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
we blame her for being there
we are all here
but we are all...

dedications of symmetry

promises are shit
we speak the way we breathe
present air will have to do
rearrange and see it through
stupid fucking words
tangle us in our desires
free me from this give and take
free me from this great debate
there were no truer words than when spoken
let that stand as it should
there was nothing left when broken
we grab anything when we fall

languor rises reaching
to turn off the alarm
and there's never so much seething
that it can't be disarmed

you just
stop it up
pass it on
shove it to shelf it
to leave it off and
turn over

lounging against your weapons
until your muscles find lock
in the ease of that position
a residue of tremor passes
as some cherie amour suggests
maybe it was time to smash things up

but just
stop it up
pass it on
shove it to shelf it
to lead it on and
turn over

stop, turnover

yes i know this is politically correct
but it comes to you spiritually direct
an attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
that is if you believe in race
and that you were born in the right time or place
that is a thought about face your way of thinking
your way of...
your way of...
your way of...
your way of...
and the same could be said
for all the people lying dead
for them to die was a distraction
and what they found out a bit too late
got covered up with all that hate
and now
and now it's nothing but reaction
if you have to carry a gun
to keep your fragile seat at number one
this is a bullet
you can't outrun... your way of thinking
