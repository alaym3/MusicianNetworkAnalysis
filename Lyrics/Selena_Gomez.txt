you promised the world and i fell for it
i put you first and you adored it
set fires to my forest
and you let it burn
sang off-key in my chorus
'cause it wasn't yours
i saw the signs and i ignored it
rose-colored glasses all distorted
set fire to my purpose
and i let it burn
you got off on the hurtin'
when it wasn't yours, yeah

we'd always go into it blindly
i needed to lose you to find me
this dancing was killing me softly
i needed to hate you to love me, yeah

to love, love, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, yeah
i needed to lose you to love me, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, yeah
i needed to lose you to love me

i gave my all and they all know it
then you tore me down and now it's showing
in two months, you replaced us
like it was easy
made me think i deserved it
in the thick of healing, yeah

we'd always go into it blindly
i needed to lose you to find me
this dancing was killing me softly
i needed to hate you to love me, yeah

to love, love, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, yeah
i needed to lose you to love me, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, yeah
i needed to lose you to love me

you promised the world and i fell for it
i put you first and you adored it
set fires to my forest
and you let it burn
sang off-key in my chorus

to love, yeah

and now the chapter is closed and done
to love, love, yeah
to love, love, yeah
to love, yeah
and now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us

took you like a shot
thought that i could chase you with a cold evenin'
let a couple years water down how i’m feelin' about you
(feelin' about you)
and every time we talk
every single word builds up to this moment
and i gotta convince myself i don’t want it
even though i do (even though i do)

you could break my heart in two
but when it heals, it beats for you
i know it's forward, but it's true

i wanna hold you when i'm not supposed to
when i'm lyin' close to someone else
you're stuck in my head and i can't get you out of it
if i could do it all again, i know i’d go back to you

i know i’d go back to you, oh
i know i'd go back to you

we never got it right
playin’ and replayin' old conversations
overthinkin' every word and i hate it
'cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
and what's the point in hidin'?
everybody knows, we got unfinished business
and i'll regret it if i didn't say
this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

you could break my heart in two
but when it heals, it beats for you
i know it's forward, but it's true

i wanna hold you when i'm not supposed to
when i'm lyin' close to someone else
you're stuck in my head and i can't get you out of it
if i could do it all again, i know i'd go back to you

i know i'd go back to you
i know i'd go back to you
i'd go back to you
i'd go back to you
i know i said i wasn't sure
but i'd go back to you
i know i'd go back to you

you can break my heart in two
but when it heals, it beats for you
i know it's forward, but it's true
won't lie, i'd go back to you
you know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
it's just a thing you make me do
and i could fight, but what's the use?
i know i'd go back to you

i wanna hold you when i'm not supposed to
when i'm lyin' close to someone else
you're stuck in my head and i can't get you out of it
if i could do it all again, i know i'd go back to you

i'll go back to you
i'll go back to you
i know i'd go back to you
i'd go back to you, i'd go back to you
i know i'd go back to you
(go back to you, go back to you)
(go back to you, go back to you)
(go back to you, go back to you)

take it or leave it
baby take it or leave it
but i know you won't leave it
'cause i know that you need it
look in the mirror
when i look in the mirror
baby i see it clearer
why you wanna be nearer

i'm not surprised
i sympathize, ah
i can't deny
your appetite, ah

you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love

reaching your limit
say you're reaching your limit
going over your limit
but i know you can't quit it
something about me
got you hooked on my body
take you over and under and twisted up like origami

i'm not surprised
i sympathize, ah
i can't deny
your appetite, ah

you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love

it's gucci!
the way you walk, the way you talk
i blame you 'cause it's all your fault
you're playin' hard, don't turn me off
you actin' hard, but i know you soft
you my fetish, i'm so with it
all these rumors bein' spreaded
might as well go 'head and whip it
'cause they sayin' we already did it
call on gucci if you ever need me
i'll be south beach in the drop top gleamin'
water diamonds, aquafina
just need you in a blue bikini

you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love
i push you out and you come right back
don't see a point in blaming you
if i were you, i'd do me too
you got a fetish for my love

i was walking down the street the other day
tryna distract myself
but then i see your face
oh wait, that's someone else
tryna play it coy
tryna make it disappear
but just like the battle of troy
there's nothing subtle here
in my room there's a king size space
bigger than it used to be
if you want you can rent that place
call me an amenity
even if it's in my dreams

ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
ooooh every time i watch you serpentine

oh i'm tryin', i'm tryin', i'm tryin'

no, no, no, no

with my feelings on fire
guess i'm a bad liar

i see how your attention builds
it's like looking in a mirror
your touch like a happy pill
but still all we do is fear
what could possibly happen next?
can we focus on the love?
paint my kiss across your chest
if you're the art, i'll be the brush

ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
ooooh every time i watch you serpentine

oh i'm tryin', i'm tryin', i'm tryin'
i'm tryin', i'm tryin'

what the heart wants
what the heart wants
what the heart wants (wants, wants, wants)

you got me sipping on something
i can't compare to nothing i've ever known
i'm hoping that after this fever i'll survive
i know i'm acting a bit crazy
strung out, a little bit hazy
hand over heart, i'm praying
that i'm gonna make it out alive

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice, 'cause i won't hear
you might be right, but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up

but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

you got me scattered in pieces
shining like stars and screaming
lighting me up like venus
but then you disappear and make me wait
and every second's like torture
heroin drip, no more so
finding a way to let go
baby, baby, no, i can't escape

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice, 'cause i won't hear
you might be right, but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up

but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

this is a modern fairytale
no happy endings, no wind in our sails
but i can't imagine a life without
breathless moments
breaking me down, down, down, down

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice, 'cause i won't hear
you might be right, but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up

but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

the heart wants what it wants, baby
the heart wants what it wants, baby
it wants what it wants
it wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants, baby
the heart wants what it wants, baby

new york back in august, tenth floor balcony
smoke is floating over jane and greenwich street
goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watching me
shivers dance down my spine, head down to my feet

swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
egyptian blue
something i've never had without you

you're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
it's better than pills how you put me to sleep
calling your name, the only language i can speak
taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

giving me chills
chills

if i open up my heart to you, i know that you could lock it
throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
if i give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?

if my love was like a flower, would you plant it? would you grow it?
i'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

if i show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end

looking from a window above
it's like a story of love
can you hear me?
came back only yesterday
i'm moving farther away
want you near me

all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you

sometimes when i think of her name
when it's only a game
and i need you
listen to the words that you say
it's getting harder to stay
when i see you

all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
only you, only you
only you, only you

this is gonna take a long time
and i wonder what's mine
can't take no more
wonder if you'll understand
it's just the touch of your hand
behind a closed door

and all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
only you
