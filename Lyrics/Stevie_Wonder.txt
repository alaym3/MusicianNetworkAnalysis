as around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
and the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
just as hate knows love's the cure
you can rest your mind assure
that i'll be loving you always
as now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
but in passing, will grow older every day
just as all is born is new
do know what i say is true
that i'll be loving you always

until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (always)
until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)
until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (always)
until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

did you know that true love asks for nothing?
her acceptance is the way we pay
did you know that life has given love a guarantee
to last through forever and another day?
just as time knew to move on since the beginning
and the seasons know exactly when to change
just as kindness knows no shame
know through all your joy and pain
that i'll be loving you always
as today, i know i'm living, but tomorrow
could make me the past, but that, i mustn't fear
for i'll know deep in my mind
the love of me i've left behind
'cause i'll be loving you always

until the day is night and night becomes the day (always)
until the trees and seas just up and fly away (always)
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (always)
until the day that is the day that are no more (did you know you're loved by somebody?)
until the day the earth starts turning right to left (always)
until the earth just for the sun denies itself (i'll be loving you forever)
until dear mother nature says her work is through (always)
until the day that you are me and i am you (always)
until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (always)
until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)

we all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
can make you wish you were born in another time and space
but you can bet your life times that and twice its double
that god knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
so make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
you're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called hell
change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
and maybe our children's grandchildren
and their great-grandchildren will tell
i'll be loving you

until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (loving you)
until the ocean covers every mountain high (loving you)
until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (loving you)
until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (be loving you)
until the day is night and night becomes the day (loving you)
until the trees and seas just up and fly away (loving you)
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (loving you)
until the day that is the day that are no more (loving you)
until the day the earth starts turning right to left (be loving you)
until the earth just for the sun denies itself (loving you)
until dear mother nature says her work is through (loving you)
until the day that you are me and i am you (now ain't that loving you?)
until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (ain't that loving you?)
until the ocean covers every mountain high (and i've got to say always)
until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (always)
until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (always)
until the day is night and night becomes the day (always)
until the trees and seas just up and fly away (always)
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
until the day that is the day that are no more (always)
until the day the earth starts turning right to left
until the earth just for the sun denies itself (always)
until dear mother nature says her work is through
until the day that you are me and i am you
until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
until the ocean covers every mountain high
until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
until the day is night and night becomes the day
until the trees and seas just up and fly away
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
until the day that is the day that are no more
until the day the earth starts turning right to left
until the earth just for the sun denies itself
until dear mother nature says her work is through
until the day that you are me and i am you

very superstitious
writing's on the wall
very superstitious
ladder's about to fall
thirteen month old baby
broke the looking glass
seven years of bad luck
the good things in your past

when you believe in things
that you don't understand
then you suffer
superstition ain't the way

very superstitious
wash your face and hands
rid me of the problem
do all that you can
keep me in a daydream
keep me going strong
you don't want to save me
sad is my song

when you believe in things
that you don't understand
then you suffer
superstition ain't the way

very superstitious
nothing more to say
very superstitious
the devil's on his way
thirteen month old baby
broke the looking glass
seven years of bad luck
good things in your past

when you believe in things
that you don't understand
then you suffer
superstition ain't the way
no, no, no

isn't she lovely?
isn't she wonderful?
isn't she precious?
less than one minute old
i never thought through love, we'd be
making one as lovely as she
but isn't she lovely? made from love

isn't she pretty?
truly the angel's best
boy, i'm so happy
we have been heaven blessed
i can't believe what god has done
through us, he's given life to one
but isn't she lovely? made from love


isn't she lovely?
life and love are the same
life is aisha
the meaning of her name
londie, it could have not been done
without you who conceived the one
that's so very lovely, made from love

no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day
no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday, within the month of june
but what it is, is something true
made up of these three words that i must say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart
i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

of my heart
of my heart

looking back on when i was a little nappy-headed boy
then my only worry was for christmas, what would be my toy
even though we sometimes would not get a thing
we were happy with the joy the day would bring
sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
greeted at the back door with, "boy, thought i told you not to go outside"
tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go?
i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go?
'cause i love them so

brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
just don't tell and i'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
mama gives you money for sunday school
you trade yours for candy after church is through
smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
you grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
but while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go?
i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go?

music is a world within itself
with a language we all understand
with an equal opportunity
for all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
but just because a record has a groove
don't make it in the groove
but you can tell right away at letter a
when the people start to move

they can feel it all over
they can feel it all over people
they can feel it all over
they can feel it all over people, go

music knows it is and always will
be one of the things that life just won't quit
but here are some of music's pioneers
that time will not allow us to forget, no
for there's basie, miller, satchmo
and the king of all, sir duke
and with a voice like ella's ringing out
there's no way the band can lose

you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people

you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
i can feel it all, all, all-all-all over the people
can't you feel it all over?
come on, let's feel it all over people
you can feel it all over
everybody, all over people, go

a boy is born in hard time mississippi
surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
his parents give him love and affection
to keep him strong moving in the right direction
living just enough, just enough for the city

his father works some days for fourteen hours
and you can bet he barely makes a dollar
his mother goes to scrub the floors for many
and you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
living just enough, just enough for the city (yeah)

his sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
her skirt is short but lord her legs are sturdy
to walk to school she's got to get up early
her clothes are old but never are they dirty
living just enough, just enough for the city (um-hum)

her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
his patience's long but soon he won't have any
to find a job is like a haystack needle
because where he lives they don't use colored people
living just enough, just enough for the city

(living just enough for the city)
living for the city, yeah
(believing just enough for the city)
ain't nothing but a city
(believing just enough for the city)
living for the city, yeah yeah
(believing just enough for the city)
nothing but a city
(believing just enough for the city)
live for the city, yeah yeah
(believing just enough for the city)
the fucking crud is shitty
(believing just enough for the city)

(believing just enough for the city)

bus for new york city!
hey, bus driver! i'm getting on that, hold it
thanks a lot
wow, new york, just like i pictured it
skyscrapers and everything
hey hey brother, hey come here slick
hey you look, you look hip man
hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man
you look hip
run this across the street for me right quick
okay, run this across the street for me
what? huh? i didn't know! what?
gimme your hands up you punk!
i'm just going across the street
put that leg up, shut your mouth
hell no, what did i do?
okay, turn around, turn around
put your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go
a jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years
what?
come on, come on, get in that cell nigga
god, lord

his hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
he spends his life walking the streets of new york city
he's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
he tried and fought but to him there's no solution
living just enough, just enough for the city

i hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
and that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
this place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
if we don't change, the world will soon be over
living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city

you know it doesn't make much sense
there ought to be a law against
anyone who takes offense
at a day in your celebration
'cause we all know in our minds
that there ought to be a time
that we can set aside
to show just how much we love you
and i'm sure you would agree
it couldn't fit more perfectly
than to have a world party on the day you came to be

happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday

i just never understood
how a man who died for good
could not have a day that would
be set aside for his recognition
because it should never be
just because some cannot see
the dream as clear as he
that they should make it become an illusion
and we all know everything
that he stood for time will bring
for in peace our hearts will sing
thanks to martin luther king

happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday

why has there never been a holiday
where peace is celebrated
all throughout the world

the time is overdue
for people like me and you
who know the way to truth
is love and unity to all god's children
it should be a great event
and the whole day should be spent
in full remembrance
of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
so let us all begin
we know that love can win
let it out, don't hold it in
sing it loud as you can

happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday

happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
ooh yeah
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

we know the key to unity of all people
is in the dream that you had so long ago
that lives in all of the hearts of people
that believe in unity
we'll make the dream become a reality
i know we will
because our hearts tell us so
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday

over time, i've been building my castle of love
just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
i've gone much too far for you now to say
that i've got to throw my castle away
over dreams, i have picked out a perfect come true
though you never knew it was of you i've been dreaming
the sandman has come from too far away
for you to say come back some other day

and though you don't believe that they do
they do come true
for did my dreams
come true when i looked at you
and maybe too, if you would believe
you too might be
overjoyed, over loved, over me

over hearts, i have painfully turned every stone
just to find, i had found what i've searched to discover
i've come much too far for me now to find
the love that i've sought can never be mine

and though you don't believe that they do
they do come true
for did my dreams
come true when i looked at you
and maybe too, if you would believe
you too might be
overjoyed, over loved, over me

and though the odds say improbable
what do they know
for in romance
all true love needs is a chance
and maybe with a chance you will find
you too like i
overjoyed, over loved, over you
over you

oh so long for this night i prayed
that a star would guide you my way
to share with me this special day
where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
if allowed may i touch your hand
and if pleased may i once again
so that you too will understand
there's a ribbon in the sky for our love

do...do
do do do do do
hmm hmm

this is not a coincidence
and far more than a lucky chance
but what is that was always meant
is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
we can't lose with god on our side
we'll find strength in each tear we cry
from now on it will be you and i
and our ribbon in the sky
ribbon in the sky
a ribbon in the sky for our love

do...do
do do do do do
hmm hmm

there's a ribbon in the sky for our love

you made my soul a burning fire
you're getting to be my one desire
you're getting to be all that matters to me
and let me tell you girl
i hope and pray each day i live
a little more love i'll have to give
a little more love that's devoted and true
cause all i do is think about you

all i do, is think about you (thinking about you, baby)
all i do, is think about you

baby just suppose i should happen to cross your mind
and by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
well let me tell you girl
think of how exciting it would be
if you should discover you feel like me
if you should discover this dream is for two
we'll i'm gonna tell you girl
i'd light a candle every day
and pray that you'll always feel this way
and pray that our love will forever be new
cause all i do is think about you

all i do, is think about you (i think about you)
all i do, is think about you

gonna tell you girl
i'd light a candle every day
and pray that you'll always feel this way
and pray that our love will forever be new
i'm gonna tell you girl
if i cannot have you for my own
i'd rather be lonely and all alone
i'd rather keep thinking the way that i do
cause all i do is think about you

all i do, is think about you
all i do, is think about you
(think about you baby)
all i do, is think about you
(think about you baby)
all i do, is think about you
(all i do, is think about you baby)
all i do, is think about you
(think about you baby)
all i do, is think about you
(baby, baby)

i'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
i'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
i'm thinking baby, 'give it to me baby
i'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby

all i do, is think about you
all i do, is think about you
(think about you baby)

all i do, is think about you
can't you feel the fire burning?
can't you feel the birds humming? (all i do, is think about you)
can't you feel my love flowing? (all i do, is think about you)
can't you see my love growing?
all i do, is think about you

call up, ring once, hang up the phone
to let me know you made it home
don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
if she's with me, i'll blink the lights
to let you know tonight's the night
for me and you, my part-time lover

we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day, lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

if i'm with friends and we should meet
just pass me by, don't even speak
know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
but if there's some emergency
have a male friend to ask for me
so then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day, lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

(part-time lovers)

we are undercover passion on the run, yeah
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day, lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

i've got something that i must tell
last night someone rang our doorbell
and it was not you, my part-time lover
and then a man called our exchange
but didn't want to leave his name
i guess that two can play the game
of part-time lovers
you and me, part-time lovers
but, she and he, part-time lovers
