here and now i'm in the fire
in above my head
being held under the pressure
don't know what'll be left
but it's here in the ashes
i'm finding treasure

he's making diamonds, diamonds
making diamonds out of dust
he is refining in his timing
he's making diamonds out of us

i'll surrender to the power
of being crushed by love
till the beauty that was hidden
isn't covered up
oh it's not what i hoped for
it's something much better

he's making diamonds, diamonds
making diamonds out of dust
he is refining in his timing
he's making diamonds out of us

oh the joy of the lord
it will be my strength
when the pressure is on
he's making diamonds

he's making diamonds, diamonds
making us rise up from the dust
he is refining in his timing
he's making diamonds out of dust
making diamonds out of us

i won't be afraid to shine
i won't be afraid to shine
i won't be afraid to shine
cause he's making diamonds out of dust
making diamonds out of us

i ain't like no one you met before
i'm running for the front
when they're all running for the door
and i won't sit down won't back out
you can't ever shut me up
cause i'm on a mission
and i won't quit now
in a world full of followers
i'll be a leader
in a world full of doubters
i'll be a believer
i'm stepping out without a hesitation
because the battle's already been won
i'm sold out
i'm no longer living
just for myself
running after jesus
with my whole heart
and now i'm ready to show
i am sold out
i'm sold out
with every single
step that i take now
with every drop of blood
left in my veins
i'm gonna be making it count
i am sold out
this ain't just some temporary phase
you can't face this kind of grace
and leave the way you came
this is permanent with intent
and there won't be no stopping it now
i'm on a mission and it's heaven sent
in a world full of followers
i'll be a leader
in a world full of doubters
i'll be a believer
i'm stepping out without a hesitation
cause my soul is like a stadium
i'm sold out
i'm no longer living
just for myself
running after jesus
with my whole heart
and now i'm ready to show
i am sold out
i'm sold out
with every single
step that i take now
with every drop of blood
left in my veins
i'm gonna be making it count
i am sold out
no trials coming against me
could put a dent in my passion
they're just an opportunity
to put my faith into action
in a world full of followers
i'll be a leader
in a world full of doubters
i'll be a believer
i'm stepping out without a hesitation
i ain't got nothing left to be afraid
i'm sold out
i'm no longer living
just for myself
running after jesus
with my whole heart
and now i'm ready to show
i am sold out
i'm sold out
with every single
step that i take now
with every drop of blood
left in my veins
i'm gonna be making it count
i am sold out

pre-chorus 2:
(same) sex marriage in a state where they don't care

when you're at the end of the road
and it's not the one that you would have chosen
when you're at the end of your rope
and you're holding on, but feel like you're falling

with every option exhausted
you've tried everything you know
you saw a light then you lost it
but there is still hope

like the fire in the night
like the ocean parted wide
like the grave, empty inside
you will see he still does
miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles

even if you don't see it now
without a doubt, he's already moving
there is not a pain that you hold
he doesn't know, and he isn't using

with every option exhausted
you've tried everything you know
so reach for something beyond it
'cause he is our hope

like the fire in the night
like the ocean parted wide
like the grave, empty inside
you will see he still does
miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles

a broken heart can be restored
a broken soul can be reborn
and greater things are still in store
for us, for us

like the fire in the night
like the ocean parted wide
like the grave empty inside
you will see he still does
miracles, miracles
miracles, miracles
miracles, miracles
(he still does, he still does)
miracles, miracles
miracles, miracles
(more than you can dare to dream)
miracles, miracles
(more than you have ever seen)
miracles, miracles
(there's still more, there's still more)
miracles, miracles
(miracles)

(miracles, miracles)

i've been wrestling with my thoughts, i've been searching for daylight
tryin' to make sense of the mess, tryin' to feel like i'm alright
all these questions without answers
feelin' restless and abandoned

will you hear my call?
will you be there when i fall?
you say...

all of this time and i've never let you down
i carried you then, i'll carry you here and now
so don't lose heart and don't forget
my work in you ain't finished yet
hold on to me now, i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
i won't let you down
believe in me, i won't let you down
ne-ver let you down
let you down, let you down

oh, i've seen you showing up in the darkest of places
in the moments of my doubt, in the tears that i've tasted
would you take me, take me this far?
just to leave me, that's not who you are

i know you hear my call
you're always there when i fall
you say...

all of this time and i've never let you down
(i've never let you down)
i carried you then, i'll carry you here and now
(i'll carry you here and now)
so don't lose heart and don't forget
my work in you ain't finished yet
hold on to me now, i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
i won't let you down
believe in me, i won't let you down
ne-ver let you down
i'll never let you down
i won't let you down
believe in me, i won't let you down
ne-ver let you down
let you down, let you down

caught in chaos, i'm knee deep
wrestling with all of my disbelief
in this moment, i hear you speak
break through the noise and consume me!
i change with the seasons, i lose sight of faith
when my hope is gone, i know that you stay the same
your gentle whisper, a familiar sound
i know you won't let me down...

all of this time and i've never let you down
(i've never let you down)
i carried you then, i'll carry you here and now
(i'll carry you here and now)
so don't lose heart and don't forget
my work in you ain't finished yet
hold on to me now, i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
...
i won't let you down
believe in me, i won't let you down
ne-ver let you down
i'll never let you down
i won't let you down
believe in me, i won't let you down
ne-ver let you down
i'll never let you down!
i'll never let you down!
i'll never let you down!!

i want you as you are, not as you ought to be
won't you lay down your guard and come to me
the shame that grips you now is crippling
it breaks my heart to see you suffering
cause i am for you
i'm not against you
if you wanna know
how far my love can go
just how deep, just how wide
if you wanna see
how much you mean to me
look at my hands, look at my side
if you could count the times i'd say you are forgiven
it's more than the drops in the ocean
don't think you need to settle for a substitute
when i'm the only love that changes you
and i am for you
i'm not against you
i am for you
i'm not against you
if you wanna know
how far my love can go
just how deep, just how wide
if you wanna see
how much you mean to me
look at my hands, look at my side
if you could count the times i'd say you are forgiven
it's more than the drops in the ocean
open your heart
it's time that we start again
open your heart
it's time that we start again
if you wanna know
how far my love can go
just how deep, just how wide
if you wanna see
how much you mean to me
look at my hands, look at my side
if you could count the times i'd say you are forgiven
it's more than the drops in the ocean
the drops in the ocean
i am for you
i'm not against you
i am for you
i'm not against you

i walked the line
leave it all behind
i've been waiting forever
lets go back in time
when i could read your mind
so long i've been waiting
it took the seasons going by
to know its not my fault
i tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
tried to be everything that you ever wanted
i tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
tried to be everything but you
its been so long
since youve been home
i used to wait up forever
i used to say a prayer
wishing you were there
and im still waiting
you told me once
you'd show up
but i fell for that
before i fell to pieces
then i woke up
to no one
just a picture of jesus
and a house left in pieces
it took the seasons going by
to know its not my fault
i tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
tried to be everything that you ever wanted
i tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
tried to be everything but you
i wanted you
i need you
i want to believe you 
i tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
tried to be everything but you
i tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
tried to be everything that you ever wanted
i tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
tried to be everything but you

the weight of my mistakes
my regrets and all my shame
like gravity, it's pulling me
the waves keep crashing in
things i've done and who i've been
the gravity, it's pulling me

i am falling, will you catch me?
god, i need you to be my rescue
i am broken, will you fix me?
god, i need you to be my rescue
be my parachute

the fear that i'm alone
around my neck like a stone
and gravity, it's pulling me
i've heard that you are good and you are strong
and if i could i would believe
help me to believe

'cause i am falling, will you catch me?
god, i need you to be my rescue
i am broken, will you fix me?
god, i need you to be my rescue
be my parachute

i know i need you to save me
'cause no one beside you
could save me now
could save me now

'cause i am falling, will you catch me?
god, i need you to be my rescue
i am broken, will you fix me?
god, i need you to be my rescue...

be my parachute, parachute
be my parachute, parachute
be my parachute

your life dreams are shattered, now you're gone away
we've cried here for hours, and the hours turn to days
we know you regret this, leaving us here
with portraits and memories that we've held so dear
when i hear your name, it's not the same
no matter what they say, i'm not okay
and we started at zero, and went different ways
now we're all out here wasting away
and if we started at zero, then how did things change?
it seems like just yesterday we were the same
it's been 3 months since he left us
so far nothing's been the same
and my question without answer is:
am i the one to blame?
and he was such a good description of a favored future man
he spoke well of other people, and they said the same for him
when i hear your name, it's not the same
no matter what they say, i'm not okay
and we started at zero, and went different ways
now we're all out here wasting away
and if we started at zero, then how did things change?
it seems like just yesterday, we were the same
we were the same
they say they're sorry, well what are they sorry for?
how can they possibly know what i'm going through?
i feel like no one's ever had to deal with this pain that i'm dealing with right now
just 6 months ago everything was fine, or so it seemed
what turn of event caused him to go downhill?
his parents are devastated
his girlfriend's depressed
what was he thinking!?
and we started at zero, and went different ways
now we're all out here wasting away
wasting away
wasting away
wasting away
and we started at zero, and went different ways
now we're all out here wasting away
and if we started at zero, then how did things change?
it seems like just yesterday, we were the same
we were the same
we were the same

they've made me feel like a prisoner
they've made me feel set free
they've made me feel like a criminal
made me feel like a king

they've lifted my heart
to places i'd never been
and they've dragged me down
back to where i began

words can build you up

start a fire in your heart or
put it out

let my words be life

unless it points the world back to you

we are america right now
there's got to be a better way
they dissect everything we say
to try to make us feel this way
and you can take the one thing i have left
i'd give it all away for so much less
could even take the heart inside my chest
woah-woah
and you can take the one thing i have left
beat me to the ground and take my breath
but you can't take who i am
woah-woah
how can i be safe
how can i stay awake
how come i am so tired of all these charades?
how can i be alive
how can i hold the gun
how can i see if everyone else is to blame
hey! hey!
don't want to be the
hey! hey!
don't want to see the
hey! hey!
cuz we point the finger
think everyone else is to blame, blame
everyone else is to blame

every time i couldn't choke back the tears
every time i couldn't fight off my fears
you were paving the path that brought me
paving the path that brought me here
every time i couldn't just disappear
and i felt my future was so unclear
you were paving the path that brought me
you were paving the path that brought me here

i walked a windy road that led me back to you
i took a twisted path that let me straight to you
and when i look behind
i see your grace in every crooked line

even when i ran to places i thought
that your mercy simply would never go
you were paving the path that brought me
paving the path that brought me home
and even when i traded your love for my pride to protect the hurt i carry inside
you were paving the path that saved me
paving the path that saved my life

i walked a windy road that led me back to you
i took a twisted path that let me straight to you
and when i look behind
i see your grace in every crooked line

you're lifting me up where my hope is found
you're lifting me up take my feet off the ground
salvation is a song singing over me now
i know i don't deserve it
i know i couldn't earn it

i walked a windy road that led me back to you
i took a twisted path that let me straight to you
and when i look behind
i see your grace oh
i walked a windy road that led me back to you
i took a twisted path that let me straight to you
and when i look behind
i see your grace oh
when i look behind
i see your grace in every crooked line
in every crooked line
when i look behind i see your grace
in every crooked line

he was a simple boy, he just liked to have fun
he never wanted to be just like his dad was
he was a dreamer but he had never had none
who made the most of his life but never had one
he was a single boy he could never slow down
he always wanted to leave but didn't know how
he was a dreamer who seemed to never break ground
who spent most of his life in a small town
shake up my life
let's go...
back to the days when we were young and all restless
we still believed in having built up offenses
i'll tell you one things for sure
till we make the decision
we'll never take this world
unless we make a head on collision
a head on collision
and daddy told her she could never have
late night out with her man
so she sits crying by the window
every time she gets another a
she makes it another day
and it's just that simple
shake up my life
let's go...
back to the days when we were young and all restless
we still believed in having built up offenses
i'll tell you one things for sure
till we make the decision
we'll never take this world
unless we make a head on collision
a head on collision
here they come now
will you come down?
make 'em run now
on to the next town
here they come now
let's make 'em run now
no time to fake now
everything breaks down
here they come now
will you come down?
make 'em run now
on to the next town
here they come now
let's make 'em run now
no time to fake now
everything breaks down
he was a simple boy he just liked to have fun
he never wanted to be just like his dad was

on to the next town
let's go...

don't you know
there's more to this than we thought
'cause we were never listening
we heard it all before but we missed it
when all we needed was a head on collision
don't you know
there's more to this than we thought
'cause we were never listening
we heard it all before but we missed it
when all we needed was a head on collision
