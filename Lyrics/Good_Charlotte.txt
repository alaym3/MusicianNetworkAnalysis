yeah...
here we go...

it's a new day, but it all feels old
"it's a good life!" that's what i'm told
but everything, it all just feels the same
at my high school, it felt more to me
like a jail cell, a penitentiary
my time spent there, it only made me see

that i don't ever wanna be like you
i don't wanna do the things you do
i'm never gonna hear the words you say
and i don't ever wanna

i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you, don't wanna be you

"go to college or university
get a real job!" that's what they said to me
but i could never live the way they want
i'm gonna get by and just do my time
out of step while they all get in line
i'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

do you really wanna be like them?
do you really wanna be another trend?
do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'cause i don't ever wanna

i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you! don't wanna be you!

you shake it once, that's fine
you shake it twice, that's okay
you shake it three times
you're playing with yourself again


you! don't wanna be just like you!
what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
you! don't wanna be just like you (be just like you!)
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

another loser anthem (whoa-oh)
another loser anthem (whoa-oh)
another loser anthem (whoa-oh)
another loser anthem!

celebrities who want sympathy
all they do is piss and moan
inside the rolling stone
talking about how hard life can be

i'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
i don't think they would survive
if they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
i think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

lifestyles of the rich and the famous
they're always complaining, always complaining
if money is such a problem
well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

well, did you know if you were famous you could
kill your wife? and there's no such thing as 25 to life
as long as you've got the cash to pay for cochran
and did you know if you were caught and you were
smoking crack, mcdonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
you could always just run for mayor of d.c.​

she's going out to forget they were together
all that time he was taking her for granted
she wants to see, if there's more
than he gave, she's looking for

he was always giving her attention
working hard to find the things she mentioned
he was dedicated, by most suckers hated
that girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
she calls him up; she's tripping on the phone now

so come on, feeling good

as i walk through the valley of the
shadow of l.a
the footsteps that were next to me have
gone their separate ways
i've seen enough now to know that beautiful things don't
always stay that way
i've done enough now to know this beautiful place isn't
everything they say

i heard that evil comes disguised
like the city of angels, i'm walking towards the light

baptized in the river
i've seen a vision of my life and i want to be delivered
in the city, was a sinner
i've done a lot of things wrong, but i swear i'm a believer

like the prodigal son, i was out on my own
now i'm trying to find my way back home
baptized in the river
i'm delivered, i'm delivered

you're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
underneath these lights
down in hollywood on the boulevard, the
dead come back to life
to the praying mother and the worried father, let your
children go
if they come back, they'll come home stronger, and if they
don't, you'll know

they say that evil comes disguised
like the city of angels, i'm walking towards the light

baptized in the river
i've seen a vision of my life and i want to be delivered
in the city, was a sinner
i've done a lot of things wrong, but i swear i'm a believer

like the prodigal son, i was out on my own
now i'm trying to find my way back home
baptized in the river
i'm delivered, i'm delivered

baptized in the river (on my own)
baptized in the river (on my own)
i wanna be delivered
on my own
on my own
baptized in the river (on my own)
i wanna be delivered
baptized in the river (on my own)
i wanna be delivered
baptized in the river (on my own)
i wanna be delivered
i confess i'm a sinner
i've seen a vision of my life and i want to be delivered

it's tearing me apart
deep inside my heart

tell me, why i hurt this way?
should i even love you anymore?
i don't wanna find out why
i'm too scared to look behind that door
i put my trust in all my faith
in every word between us spoken
why do i believe the things you say
when my heart's already broken?

all this pain i feel
that's tearing me apart
is what makes you real
deep inside my heart

i can only count the ways
i earned these scars, but they're all tokens
every time i see your face
i know my hopes no longer showing
i don't need a reason to believe
if my faith's already broken
how could i let love lead the way
when i don't know where i'm going?

all this pain i feel
that's tearing me apart
is what makes you real
deep inside my heart

i fought so hard
still, i feel like i'm in chains
when i gave my heart
the darkness still remained

all this pain i feel
that's tearing me apart
is what makes you real
deep inside my heart

tell me, why i hurt this way?
should i even love you anymore?
i don't wanna find out why
i'm too scared to look behind that door

yeah, this song is dedicated (this is good charlotte) to every kid who ever got picked last in gym class (y'know what i'm saying, this is for you)
to every kid who never had a date to no school dance (this is for you)
to everyone who's ever been called a freak (y'all know what i'm saying)
this is for you, (what?) here we, here we go
yeah, what uh, come on
yeah, what uh, come on, come on
oh, whoa, come on
oh, whoa

like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
and the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five!)
like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (you still suck!)
like the time that girl broke up with me cause i wasn't cool enough, trick!

things, things, here we go!

the little things, little things they always hang around
the little things, little things they try to break me down
the little things, little things they just won't go away
the little things, little things made me who i am today, go!
you want to hate me now
but i won't stop now, cause i can't stop now
yeah, what? come on. what? yeah, what?
here we go

like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (i just can't take it!)
like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (can i get a ride?)
and that same year on christmas eve, dad went to the store (uh, i'll see you kids later...)
we checked his room, his things were gone, we didn't see him no more, dick!

things, things, here we go!

the little things, little things they always hang around
the little things, little things they try to break me down
the little things, little things they just won't go away
the little things, little things made me who i am today, go!
you want to hate me now
but i won't stop now, cause i can't stop now
what! what! what! here we go...
little things, little things, little things, little things
little things, little things, little things, little things
little things, little things, little things, little things
little things, little things, little things, here we go!
and it always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me break down, i'm breaking down...

bother me, tell me awful things

helps me get through this without you

bother me, tell me awful things
you know i love it when you do that

you like attention, i find it obvious
she makes it obvious for me
she feels the tension

burn me down 'til i'm nothin' but memories
i get it, girl (i get it, girl)
i get it, girl
burn me down 'til i'm nothin' but memories
i get it, girl (i get it, girl)
i'm not the one

bother me, tell me awful things

don't you turn your back on me
let your teardrops fall on me
speeding away, the city in the rear view
heart racing whenever i'm near you
gothboi jumpin' on stage
carry me away, carry me away
burn me down 'til there's nothing left

born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
where no one understands me
when i finally met an angel, i didn't know what to say
she just held my hand
and we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
when we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame

so why do we hurt each other?
we don't need the words for one another's

prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate

none of this makes sense in this reality
god just leaves the room when i turn on my tv
i see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
all these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath

why do we kill each other?
we can't feel the pain in one another's

prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate

we're so far away from one another
we keep building walls between each other's

prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate

prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today?

let the record play
let the record play
let the record play

the way that you dance, the way that you move
the way that you stare at me across the room
you carry dior bags, and you got your chanel
you wear louis vuitton, hg, and ysl
now i got bathing ape, i got dcma
i got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
i got a model 26, but she stays in her place
i got a kershaw neatly, tucked inside in my waist

and the record keeps playing the same old song
the hipster mean mugging on me all night long
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
but the record keeps playing the same old song
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

now she sweating my friends and my hurricane shoes
she likes the records i spin, my adam barton tattoos
but she can't say "what's up?" so what does she do?
she just stays posted up the other side of the room, i got amc
tattooed on my hand, i got black wall street on a black bandana

and the record keeps playing the same old song
the hipster mean mugging on me all night long
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
but the record keeps playing the same old song
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

she, she, she don't want to talk about it
he, he, he wants to fight about
me, me, i don't want to fight about it
i just want to be up out it, i'm just trying to stay up out it
step out the wagon, you know the boy starts to hate, the girl that
came with him, they like that's not the boy she dates, they get to
fighting and swearing and now the boyfriend is staring
the disco ball on the ceiling looks like the chain that i'm wearing

but the music keeps playing
i got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
i got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain

and the record keeps playing the same old song
the hipster mean mugging on me all night long
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
and the record keeps playing the same old song
the hipster mean mugging on me all night long
they say "ah ha, ah ha"
keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

you carry dior bags, and you got your chanel
you wear louis vuitton, hg, and ysl
now i got bathing ape, i got dcma
i got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
i got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain

this world
this world is cold
but you don't
you don't have to go
you're feeling sad, you're feeling lonely
and no one seems to care
your mother's gone and your father hits you
this pain you cannot bear

but we all bleed the same way as you do
and we all have the same things to go through

hold on, if you feel like letting go
hold on, it gets better than you know

your days
you say they're way too long
and your nights
you can't sleep at all, hold on
and you're not sure what you're waiting for
but you don't want to no more
and you're not sure what you're looking for
but you don't want to no more

but we all bleed the same way as you do
and we all have the same things to go through

hold on, if you feel like letting go
hold on, it gets better than you know

don't stop looking, you're one step closer
don't stop searching, it's not over, hold on...


what are you looking for?
what are you waiting for?
do you know what you're doing to me?
go ahead, what are you waiting for?

hold on, if you feel like letting go
hold on, it gets better than you know

don't stop looking, you're one step closer
don't stop searching, it's not over

hold on, if you feel like letting go
hold on, it gets better than you know, hold on...

i remember suffering with every single word they said
i could always feel them, i could always feel them
and even when i ran away, the voices in my head, they stayed
i could always hear them, i could always hear them

alone inside
i wish that i could die

all this hate will burn your life down
all the pain, you cause your own suffering
tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
all this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?

all your little shameful looks were buried in my heart like hooks
i didn't wanna be here, you told me i was evil
and when i finally ran away, just trying to escape that pain
i wanted to believe i belonged somewhere on my own

all this hate will burn your life down
all the pain, you cause your own suffering
tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
all this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?

alone inside
i wish that i could die
alone inside
i wish that i could die
alone inside
alone inside

all this hate will burn your life down
all the pain, you cause your own suffering
tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself, do you even see at all?
all this hate, you chose to throw your life away, do you even see at all?

woke up this morning with the strangest feeling
i had a nightmare, but i wasn’t dreaming
i ran outside to see it’s not 2003
turned on the radio, it’s so confusing
rappers were singing and rockers dj’ing
there’s no guitars on the songs that they’re playing
i called my shrink to see if i was healthy
i called my mom and she was taking selfies

grew up on mtv when they had eazy-e
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party
when it was gin & juice and we had dre and snoop
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce dream

now all the punk rockers are over 40
they’re coaching little league and reading stories
when did the neighborhood ever sound so good?
looked on the corner and there’s no more junkies
more girls and more grunge and bottles and more fun
needles and squatters pissed off at their fathers
i can’t believe it, man, it’s all so boring
went down to gilman, yeah, the cops were snoring

grew up on mtv when they had eazy-e
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party
when it was gin & juice and we had dre and snoop
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce dream
grew up on mtv when they had eazy-e
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party
when it was gin & juice and we had dre and snoop
in california, yeah, they still knew how to throw a party

na na na na na na, na na na na na na
yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
we still know how to throw a party
na na na na na na, na na na na na na
yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
we still know how to throw a party
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce
oh oh, last night i had a 40 ounce dream

oh, my love, please don't cry
i'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life

i ripped out his throat
and called you on the telephone
to take off my disguise
just in time to hear you cry when you

you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
the night he died
you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
one last time, singing

oh, my love, please don't cry
i'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
i don't know much at all, i don't know wrong from right
all i know is that i love you tonight

there was police and flashing lights
the rain came down so hard that night
and the headlines read, "a lover died..."
no tell-tale heart was left to find when you

you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
the night he died
you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
one last time, singing

oh, my love, please don't cry
i'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
i don't know much at all, i don't know wrong from right
all i know is that i love you tonight

tonight...

he dropped you off, i followed him home
then i stood outside his bedroom window
standing over him, he begged me not to do
what i knew i had to do, because i'm so in love with you

oh, my love, please don't cry
i'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
i don't know much at all, i don't know wrong from right
all i know is that i love you tonight...

tonight!

hard days made me, hard nights shaped me
i don't know, they somehow saved me
and i know i'm making something
out of this life they called nothing

i take what i want, take what i need
they say it's wrong, but it's right for me
i won't look down, won't say i'm sorry
i know that only god can judge me

and if i make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
am i just running in place?
and if i stumble and i fall, should i get up and carry on?
will it all just be the same?

because i'm young, and i'm hopeless, i'm lost, and i know this
i'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
i'm troublesome, i'm fallen, i'm angry at my father
it's me against this world, and i don't care

i don't care...

and no one in this industry understands the life i lead
when i sing about my past, it's not a gimmick, not an act
these critics and these trust fund kids try to tell me what punk is
but when i see them on the streets, they got nothing to say

and if i make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
am i just running in place?
and if i stumble and i fall, should i get up and carry on?
will it all just be the same?

because i'm young, and i'm hopeless, i'm lost, and i know this
i'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
i'm troublesome, i'm fallen, i'm angry at my father
it's me against this world, and i don't care

i don't care, i don't care, no, i don't care...
ooh, ooh...


i'm young, and i'm hopeless, i'm lost, and i know this
i'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
i'm troublesome, i'm fallen, i'm angry at my father
it's me against this world, and i don't care

i don't care, i don't care, i don't care...

all i have right now is right here
and right now
all i have right now is right here

i want what i want, i always have
when no one cared about me, dreams were all i had
but nightmares grow when no one's listening
and idle thoughts will do their thing
i still feel so much pain here from the past

and it cuts like a knife
it feels like a fight to take back your life

searching for the meaning, i'm living in these feelings
i'm ready for a reason to believe
now i'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
with anyone's here, it's never what it seems

all i have right now is right here

i felt too bad about myself
i never thought i was good enough for anybody else
i couldn't look love in the eye, i was too broken to try
life was a cold song that taught me not to cry

and it cuts like a knife
it feels like a fight to take back your life

searching for the meaning, i'm living in these feelings
i'm ready for a reason to believe
now i'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
with anyone's here it's never what it seems

how long i waited
feeling lost, frustrated
locked out and i'm on my own
cornered and ain't got no place to go
how long should i stay here all alone?

searching for the meaning, i'm living in these feelings
i'm ready for a reason to believe
now i'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
with anyone's here it's never what it seems

all i have right now is right here

one day, i woke up, i woke up knowing
today is the day i will die
ca$hdogg was barking, went to the park
and enjoyed it one last time
i called my mother, told her i loved her
and i begged her not to cry
i wrote a letter, i said i'd miss her
and i signed that goodbye

you know, the happiest day of my life
i swear, the happiest day of my life is the day that i die

can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that i die...)
it sets in, but it's alright (the day that i die...)
darkness falls, i'm letting go (the day that i die...)
all alone, but i feel fine (the day that i die...)

we took a drive and we drove through dc
to see the places we lived
long conversations, we talked of old friends
and all the things that we did

the summer nights, drunken fights
mistakes we made, did we live it right?
you know, the happiest day of my life
i swear, the happiest day of my life is the day that i die

can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that i die...)
it sets in, but it's alright (the day that i die...)
darkness falls, i'm letting go (the day that i die...)
all alone, but i feel just fine...

good boy...

hey, dad, i'm writing to you
not to tell you that i still hate you
just to ask you how you feel
and how we fell apart, how this fell apart

are you happy out there in this great wide world?
do you think about your sons? do you miss your little girl?
when you lay your head down, how do you sleep at night?
do you even wonder if we're alright?

if we're alright
we're alright

it's been a long hard road without you by my side
why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
you broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life
it's not okay, but we're alright
i remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
but those are just a long lost memory of mine
i spent so many years learning how to survive
now i'm writing just to let you know i'm still alive

the days i spent so cold, so hungry
were full of hate, i was so angry
the scars run deep inside this tattooed body
there's things i'll take to my grave

but i'm okay
i'm okay

it's been a long hard road without you by my side
why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
you broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life
it's not okay, but we're alright
i remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
but those are just a long lost memory of mine
i spent so many years learning how to survive
now i'm writing just to let you know i'm still alive

yeah, i'm still alive...

sometimes i forgive, yeah, and this time, i'll admit
that i miss you, said, "i miss you..."

you come in cold, you're covered in blood
they're all so happy you've arrived
the doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your mom
she sets you free into this life

and where do you go with no destination
no map to guide you?
wouldn't you know, that it doesn't matter
we all end up the same... (the same...)

these are the chronicles of
life and death and everything between
these are the stories of our lives
as fictional as they may seem

you come in this world, and you go out just the same
today could be the best day of your life!

and money talks in this world
that's what idiots will say
but you'll find out that this world
is just an idiot's parade

before you go, you've got some questions
and you want answers
but now you’re old, cold, covered in blood
right back to where you started from... (from...)

these are the chronicles of
life and death and everything between
these are the stories of our lives
as fictional as they may seem

you come in this world, and you go out just the same
today could be the worst day of your life...

it's your life, your life...
