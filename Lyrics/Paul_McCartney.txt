piss off, cake

too many people going underground
too many reaching for a piece of cake
too many people pulled and pushed around
too many waiting for that lucky break

that was your first mistake
you took your lucky break and broke it in two

you broke it in two

too many people sharing party lines
too many people never sleep-in late
too many people paying parking fines
too many hungry people losing weight

that was your first mistake
you took your lucky break and broke it in two
now what can be done for you?
you broke it in two

too many people preaching practices
don't let them tell you what you wanna be
too many people holding back

to spend some special time without an interruption

one lucky day

uncle albert

we're so sorry, uncle albert
we're so sorry if we caused you any pain
we're so sorry, uncle albert
but there's no one left at home, and i believe i'm gonna rain

we're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
we're so sorry, uncle albert
but if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring

we're so sorry, uncle albert
but we haven't done a bloody thing all day
we're so sorry, uncle albert
but the kettle's on the boil and we're so easily called away

"buy! buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"why? why?" says the junk in the yard

da, da, ya, da, da, da

candlesticks, building bricks
something old and new
memories for you and me

"buy! buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"why? why?" says the junk in the yard 

baby, i'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
and maybe i'm afraid of the way i love you
maybe i'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
you hung me on a line
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you

baby, i'm a man, maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand
baby, i'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
who could ever help me
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ah

baby, i'm a man, and maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand
baby, i'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
who could ever help me
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ah

maybe i'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
and maybe i'm afraid of the way i leave you
maybe i'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
you right me when i'm wrong
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you
oh, oh, oh
hey-ey-hey!
oh, oh
oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
yeah, yeah, yeah

what if it rained?
we didn't care
she said that someday soon, the sun was gonna shine
and she was right
this love of mine
my valentine

as days and nights
would pass me by
i tell myself that i was waiting for a sign
then she appeared
a love so fine
my valentine

and i will love her for life
and i will never let a day go by
without remembering the reasons why
she makes me certain that i can fly

and so i do
without a care
i know that someday soon, the sun is gonna shine
and she'll be there
this love of mine
my valentine
what if it rained?
we didn't care
she said that someday soon, the sun was gonna shine
and she was right
this love of mine
my valentine 

and if i said i really knew you well
what would your answer be
if you were here today?
ooh ooh ooh, here today

well, knowing you
you'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
if you were here today
ooh, ooh, ooh, here today

but as for me, i still remember how it was before
and i am holding back the tears no more
ooh, ooh, ooh
i love you
ooh, ooh

what about the time we met? (what about the time we met?)
well, i suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
what about the night we cried? (what about the night we cried?)
because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile
and if i say i really loved you and was glad you came along
then you were here today
ooh, ooh, ooh
for you were in my song
ooh ooh ooh, here today 

so i sat in the attic, a piano up my nose
and the wind played a dreadful cantata (cantata, cantata)
sore was i from the crack of an enemy's hose
and the horrible sound of tomato (tomato, tomato)

ketchup (ketchup)
soup and puree (soup and puree)
don't get left behind (get left behind)
ketchup (ketchup)
soup and puree (soup and puree)
don't get left behind
(get left behind, get left behind, get left behind)

when a rattle of rats had awoken
the sinews, the nerves, and the veins
my piano is boldly outspoken
and attempts to repeat his refrain
so i stood with a knot in my stomach
and i gazed at that terrible sight
of two youngsters concealed in a barrel
sucking monkberry moon delight

monkberry moon delight
monkberry moon delight
monkberry moon delight
monkberry moon delight
well, i know my banana is older than the rest
and my hair is a tangled beretta (beretta, beretta)
and when i leave my pyjamas to billy budapest
and i don't get the gist of your letter (your letter, your letter)

catch up! (catch up)
cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
don't get left behind (get left behind)
catch up! (catch up)
cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
don't get left behind (get left behind
get left behind

every day, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
it's just another day
slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
it's just another day

at the office where the papers grow, she takes a break
drinks another coffee, and she finds it hard to stay awake
it's just another day

du du du du du du, it's just another day
du du du du du du, it's just another day

so sad, so sad
sometimes she feels so sad
alone in apartment, she'd dwell
till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
ah, stay, don't stand her up
and he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
so sad
sometimes she feels so sad
as she posts another letter to the sound of five
people gather around her, and she finds it hard to stay alive
it's just another day

du du du du du du, it's just another day
du du du du du du, it's just another day

so sad, so sad
sometimes she feels so sad
alone in apartment, she'd dwell
till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
ah, stay, don't stand her up
and he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
so sad
sometimes she feels so sad

every day, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
it's just another day
slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
it's just another day
du du du du du du, it's just another day
du du du du du du, it's just another day

the kiss of venus has got me on the go
she scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
early mornin' glow

packed with illusions, our world is turned around
this golden circle has a most harmonic sound
harmonic sound

and in the sunshine, when we stand alone
we came together with our secrets blown
our secrets blown

now moving slowly, we circle through the square
two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
sweet summer air

and in the sunshine, when we stand alone
we came together with our secrets blown
our secrets blown

reflected mountains in a lake
is this too much to take?
asleep or wide awake?
and if the world begins to shake
will something have to break?
we have to stay awake
packed with illusions, our world is turned around
this golden circle has a most harmonic sound
harmonic sound

and in the sunshine, when we stand alone
we came together with our secrets blown
our secrets blown


the kiss of venus has got me on the go
she scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
early mornin' glow

i lied to my doctor
but these days, i don't
'cause i'm happy with you
i got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

rushing down the mountain
hear a newborn baby lamb
calling for its mother
watching reunited friends
loving one another

i liked to get stoned
i used to get wasted
but these days, i don't
'cause i'm happy with you
