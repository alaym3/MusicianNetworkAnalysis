yo, i had to reinvent, i put the v in vent
i put the heat in vents, man, i been competin' since
i look beyond what people sayin' and i see intent
then i just sit back and decipher what they really meant
cherish these nights, cherish these people
life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
and i'm good with that, as long as i'm peaceful
as long as seven years from now, i'm takin' my daughter to preschool
cherish these days, man, do they go quick
just yesterday, i swear it was '06
ten years ago, that's when you proposed
i looked down, "yes, i suppose"

all things go, all things go
all things go, all things go

i feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
while we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
so can't nobody ever tell me that i'm wrong
'cause i'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
and we keep goin', we go (we go, we go)
we wake back up and do it all again (and we know, we know)
said, "fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
when all is said and done, look what we've become (oh, we go)
i just want you to know that i did it for you
i lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
his sister said he wanted to stay with me, but i didn't invite him
why didn't he ask? or am i just buggin'?
'cause since i got fame, they don't act the same
even though they know that i love 'em
family ties broken before me
niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
and that's the reflection of me
yes, i get it, i get it was all me
i'll pop a pill and remember
the look in his eyes the last day he saw me

all things go, all things go
all things go, all things go

i feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
while we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
so can't nobody ever tell me that i'm wrong
'cause i'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
and we keep goin', we go (we go, we go)
we wake back up and do it all again (and we know, we know)
said, "fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
when all is said and done, look what we've become (oh, we go)
i just want you to know that i did it for you
lemme make this clear: i'm not difficult, i'm just 'bout my business
i'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
even the ones that hurt me the most, i still show forgiveness
i love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
i'd give it all if somehow i could just rekindle that
she never understands why i'm so overprotective
the more i work, the more i feel like somehow they're neglected
i want 'caiah to go to college just to say, "we did it"
my child with aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
so in some ways, i feel like 'caiah is the both of them
it's like he's 'caiah's little angel lookin' over him
and i know jelani will always love me and i'll always love him
and i'm just his little sister, not nicki minaj when i'm around him
gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
just finished writin', this is the pinkprint

all things go, all things go
all things go, all things go 

i am not jasmine, i am aladdin

twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
an eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
you don't like it, then peel off, bitch
every last woman on earth i'll kill off
and i still wouldn't fuck you, slut
so wipe the smile on your grill off
i swear to god i'll piss a happy meal off
get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
quit hollering, "why, god?"
he ain't got shit to do with it
bygones'll never be bygones
the world ain't finished swallowing my wad
i ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
i swear to god life is a dumb blonde white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
so finally i broke down and bought her an ipod
and caught her stealing my music
so i tied her arms and legs to the bed
set up the camera and pissed twice on her
look, two pees and a tripod
the moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
kick it back in its face, my god
it's shady and nicki minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
but don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
the world-world is my punching bag and
if i'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
show me the target so i can lunge and attack it
like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
you fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
you must've went off the back, i'm 'bout to go off the deep end
told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
is this the thanks that i get for puttin' you bitches on?
is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
now i'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
word, that bitch mad 'cause i took the spot?
well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
got some niggas out in brooklyn that'll off your top
i hear the mumblin', i hear the cacklin'
i got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
overseas, church, vatican
you at a standstill, mannequin
you wanna sleep on me? overnight?
i'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
and when i pull up, vroom, motorbike
now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
i see them dusty-ass filas, levis
raggedy anns, holes in your knee-highs
i call the play, now do you see why?
these bitches callin' me manning, eli
manning, eli, these bitches callin' me manning, eli

all you lil' faggots can suck it
no homo, but i'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
and i'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
you have the same passion i have, yeah, right
still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
and 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'fore i shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
you know what time it is, so why ask?
when shady and nicki's worlds clash
it's high class meets white trash
rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
roman, roman, stop it, stop it
