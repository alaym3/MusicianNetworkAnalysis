but are you mine?

i wanna make you happy
i wanna make you feel alive

but are you mine?
i wanna make you happy

in their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
that you love it here, you've got to stay
on this rock, not a rock, an island
on which you found a lover, then you twitch
you felt that itch in your petticoat
your pretty, pretty petticoat
then you smiled, he got wild
you didn't understand that there's money to be made
beauty is a card that must get played
by organisations

well, ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
and ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
and ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
and ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out

the world can be a very big place
so be yourself, don't feel out of place
love your man and love him twice
go to hollywood and pay the price
oh, go to hollywood
and don't be a star, it's such a drag
take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
it's a hard life to live, so live it well
i'll be your friend and not to pretend i know you, girl
in all situations
and ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
well, ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
and ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
and ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out

pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

you don't know who you are
the road's gonna take you, make you walk too far
you're a liar, you're a thief, you're a star
but you don't know who you are

you are just a kid with a sentimental heart
afraid of what would happen before you ever start
and you don't need the baggage and you don't need the stuff
and you don't need nobody to fill your empty cup

ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
(be who you are)
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
(baby you're a star)
ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
never give up, coltrane
never be a slave to your own name
you're a poet, you're a fake, you're a star
but you don't know who you are

we could shine a light here inside the dark
and get a little closer, lonely spark
when there's nothing left to win and you could only lose
what's keeping you from doing what you always wanna do

ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
(be who you are)
ta, ta, ta-da-da-da
(be who you are)
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-da-da

(be who you are)

lately i've been feeling
like the stars are rolling out for me
stars are rolling out
lately i've been feeling
but the stars are rolling out for me
stars are rolling out
but maybe they're misleading
is it just a light reflecting off the street?
and you are just a kid with a sentimental heart
and do it for yourself and do it for the art
you don't need the baggage, you don't need the stuff
you don't need nobody to fill your empty cup

ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-da-da

why don't you stay here? i wanna spend some time
why don't you lay here? make the full moon cry
why don't you love me the way i want you to?
you cut up the best dress i ever bought for you

but you don't have to doubt or figure me out
let me show you the way it's gonna be
you don't have to doubt what it's all about
see the light that leads you here, we can find a way

i want you to be here all the time
i want you to be here when i die
i want you, you, just don't ask why
i want you, you, all the time
i want you

your scent brings me flowers, your heart, it brings me wine
all of these hours, i wanna do that time
your love is such hardship, but work i'm pleased to do
and my back is breaking, fire i'll walk through

you don't have to doubt or figure it out
see the light that leads you here, we can find a way
i want you to be here all the time
i want you to be here when i die
i want you, you, just don't ask why
i want you, you, all the time
i want you

we don't need the seas to separate
no regret
see the storm in you against your own
cigarette

and you don't have to doubt what it's all about
darkness coming down, night is all around

i want you to be here all the time
i want you to be here when i die
i want you, you, just don't ask why
i want you, you, all the time
i want you to be here all the time
i want you to be here when i die
i want you, you, just don't ask why
i want you, you, all the time
i want you 

fell in love with the summer
but i'm just blowing in the wind
fell in love with the darkness
but the truth is hanging in the night
hanging in the night, oh-oh

we're just having a good time, honey
no need to apply
no pressure
we're just having a good time

darling, you give me shelter
from the noise that drowns out the love
and i want to discover
all the things that make you come alive
all the things that make you come alive, oh-oh

we're just having a good time, honey
no need to apply
no pressure
we're just having a good time, honey
no need to apply

sitting in a mess still undressed
as the kettle whistle blows
paperback novelette still open
and the door is closed

you got a real sick mind
you write a column for the times
for all the lovers gone blind
who are looking for a sign

and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
all you've got is your four leaf clover
you keep inside your coat
and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
you feel the world is getting colder
you got no one to hold

six pages down and she's lighting up
her trainwreck soul
she was abandoned by her lover
left by the road
so apalling, scrawling those bullshit words
it's thirsty work
she'll stumble down to the boozer
just to have a flirt
you got a real sick mind
you write a column for the times
for all the lovers gone blind
who are looking for a sign

and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
all you've got is your four leaf clover
you keep inside your coat
and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
you feel the world is getting colder
you got no one to hold
you got no one to hold

you got a real sick mind
you got a real sick mind

and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
all you've got is a four leaf clover
you keep inside your coat
and when the night is over
and the drugs are gone
you feel the world is getting colder
you got no one to hold
you got no one to hold
you got no one to hold
you got no one to hold 

well, city freeze for i just realised i don't like you
me and my girl are going out for some air
and i will do my best just to get under her dress
and catch you out if i can on the other side of my sofa

won't you come on over the other side of my sofa?
oh, won't you come on over?

the city heated up
it got blurry cause i'd had enough
and he tried to take your soul
but didn't realise you keep it in a different hole

won't you come on over the other side of my sofa?
oh, won't you come on over?

so here he comes, a man with a loaded gun
i don't know if he wants my soul or my cash flow
i suppose i don't know
so here he comes, a man with a loaded gun
i don't know if he wants my girl's heart or her pearls, oh
i suppose i don't know
i suppose i don't know
i suppose i don't know
i suppose i don't know
i suppose i don't know
i suppose i don't know 

you can get yourself into a fight
if that's the way you wanna live your life
you can get yourself connected
to the world that we are thrown to, yeah

but all i need is somewhere to lay
somewhere to lay my hat up
i need someone to love in the middle of the day
i want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
i need someone to love when the chips are down

love me when the chips are down
will you love me when the chips are down?
love me when the chips are down
and could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

you can try and be someone you're not
if that's the river that you want to cross
you can choose the life of a bohemian
or you can choose the material world

but all i need is somewhere to lay
somewhere to lay my hat up
i need someone to love in the middle of the day
i want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
i need someone to love when the chips are down, oh yeah
love me when the chips are down
will you love me when the chips are down?
love me when the chips are down
and could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

will you love me when the chips are down?
and could you love me when the world is crashing all around? 

i was living on the westside
when you brought me south
at first you didn't like the look of me
your borders were closed
although you said i'm bad company
we stayed in touch
you made it hard work for me
working for your love
but now

well, we can settle down
we'll start a family
'cause you're my best friend
and you're so good to me
well, we can settle down
we'll start a family
'cause you're my best friend
and this is love song number 23

you were living in the city
you had the world at your feet
yeah, you had a part-time job
pleased to be living free
you made it hard work for me
i had to work for your love
and now
well, we can settle down
we'll start a family
'cause you're my best friend
and you're so good to me
well, we can settle down
we'll start a family
'cause you're my best friend
and this is love song number 23
