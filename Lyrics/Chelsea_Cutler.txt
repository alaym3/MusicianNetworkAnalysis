this time it don’t feel like you want it all
did i do something wrong to make you go?
said i would know when it's all good to fall
now i just need you here to hold me close

cause i don't want another heart to fill the holes
that you left under my covers for me to grow cold
i don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
but the city feels so lonely when you leave

my room, where i want you
tangled ease in my sheets
in your shirt that i got you
half asleep, holding onto me
my bed where you left me
tangled up, now it's noon
in your shirt that you gave me
half asleep, wishing i still had you

half asleep, wishing i still had you

this time you said, you’re playing games again
what are we becoming of it now?
it's fine, i said, if you're the one in my head
'cause i just don't know how to put you out
'cause i don't want another heart to fill the holes
that you left under my covers for me to grow cold
i don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
but the city feels so lonely when you leave

my room, where i want you
tangled ease in my sheets
in your shirt that i got you
half asleep, holding onto me
my bed where you left me
tangled up, now it's noon
in your shirt that you gave me
half asleep, wishing i still had you

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
i'm half asleep, wishing i still had you 

i wear my heart upon my sleeves, i understand
i'm hot and cold and then i'm losing who i am
i lost myself along the way, i understand
if you want someone else's hand to take your hand

when i'm out and you're sleeping
and i need you on my phone
'cause you know that i mean it
when i wish that i was home to hold you
but i have to love you through a call
and i'm thinking you're not missing me at all, no

baby, the nights that we spent just go hazy
i'm sorry that i asked you to stay
under the stars in the sand
but baby, these conversations will break me
i'm sorry i wear you like crazy
giving you all that i am
i'm doing the best that i can

i wear my heart upon my sleeves, i never can
figure out what you want me to do instead
you said you felt something inside, i understand
if i've been moving you in ways that you won't bend
when i'm out and you're sleeping
and i need you on my phone
'cause you know that i mean it
when i wish that i was home to hold you
but i have to love you through a call
and i'm thinking you're not missing me at all, no

baby, the nights that we spent just go hazy
i'm sorry that i asked you to stay
under the stars in the sand
but baby, these conversations will break me
i'm sorry i wear you like crazy
giving you all that i am
i'm doing the best that i can 

tell me your secrets, i won't repeat them
this tug in my chest makes it hard to get rest
and i think that i’m better off dead
tell me you mean it, give me your pieces
this hole in my heart makes it hard to restart
and i think that i'm falling apart

god only knows why
it comes and it goes
and gets lost on me
i'm scared that it shows
and i, i’m scared to believe

'cause i love you, but sometimes, i'd rather die
than have to feel this way inside

tell me it's over, at least i'm closer
this weight on my neck makes it hard to connect
and i'm staring at my feet again
i don't think they know it, how bad i'm broken
the colors you see have become lost on me
and i can’t find the root of the bleed
god only knows why
it comes and it goes
and gets lost on me
i’m scared that it shows
and i, i'm scared to believe

’cause i love you, but sometimes, i'd rather die
than have to feel this way inside

god only knows why
it comes and it goes
and gets lost on me
i'm scared that it shows
and i, i'm scared to believe

’cause i love you, but sometimes, i'd rather die
than have to feel this way inside 

waking up back home in new york city
and i know i miss you, and i hope you miss me too, yeah
the days away leave me feeling so empty
but i can't wait 'til i can take you with me, ooh yeah

say, you're gonna stay with me
don't you let me go, no
you're the kinda love for me
you already know
come back home late
and fall right into your bed (oh, oh, oh)
every time i feel it over again

you're throwing fuel into my fire
racing, making me bleed

the way you did at sixteen?
didn't know i was alive
until you made my heart beat
thought my youth was going quickly
but you give me sixteen

i'm tryna find my way through lax
and i'm so lost, don't know what to expect to ya

i know i'm a mess, i didn't choose it (i didn't choose it)
i know you're scared i'm gonna lose it (i'm gonna lose it)
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that i'm doing fine
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind
('cause you won't fuck off of my mind)

i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason
you are the reason
you are the reason

i know i'm lost, i couldn't fake it (i couldn't fake it)
it's all too much for you to take, yeah (for you to take, yeah)
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that we'll be alright
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind
i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason

and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that i'm doing fine
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind
('cause you won't fuck off of my mind)

i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason 

everybody knows that it don't feel right
i was waiting up in your darkest nights
why's it always hurt when you need it most?
never wanted love, i just fake my part
never got enough when i wanted your heart
why do i just sink when i'm trying to float?

but you know i'm done pretending i'm wrong when it's not my fault
and baby, i'm done pretending it's love, when it's not your all
tell the next girl all the things that you told me
all you let slip, 'cause you were hurt and you were lonely
i've found that giving up ground ain't what i want

both our names carved in my bedroom door
nightmares of you and i we can't ignore
how was i sold on the idea of us in the first place?
for sale signs on whatever once was ours
hate saying you're the reason i have these scars
but you left me thinking that i was out of line
to need space

but you know i'm done pretending i'm wrong when it's not my fault
and baby, i'm done pretending it's love, when it's not your all
tell the next guy all the things that you told me
all you let slip, 'cause you were hurt and you were lonely
i've found that giving up ground ain't what i want 

winter came and went but my love don't seem to go, no, oh
you said we could be friends but that's not enough to hold, no, oh
yeah you call and you ask me how i am
and i don't think i can take it (and i don't think i can take it)
and then we talk and i wait 'til you hang up
and you wonder why i'm breaking (and you wonder why i'm breaking)

there's so much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you'd rather we just sink than swim
there's too much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you don't think you can live with it

so i change my point of view
'cause i want to be with you

winter came and went but the cold lasted for so long
and i wanna kiss your neck but i'm biting on my own tongue
then you call and you say that something's wrong
suddenly you're coming over (suddenly you're coming over)
and i know that you just came here to talk
but i'm losing my composure (but i'm losing my composure)
there's so much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you'd rather we just sink than swim
there's too much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you don't think you can live with it

and you call and you say that something's wrong
suddenly you're coming over
and i know that you just came here to talk
but you're fucking with my closure

there's so much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you'd rather we just sink than swim
there's too much water on the bridge
you're telling me that you don't think you can live with it

so i change my point of view
'cause i want to be with you 

i've been trying not to think about it, i can't help it
i know you don't wanna hear from me, but i am selfish
it kills me inside you can drink on friday nights
not even pick up the phone
it amazes me you move on so easily
from someone that you once called home

i wish you had enough discipline for the both of us
just because i don't know how to turn off the way i feel
i know you always fell out love so damn easily, but honestly
i don't think you ever had something real

until you met me
drinks in new york city
ooh, you looked so pretty
think i fell in love before i even knew your birthday
kissed you on our first date
somehow, i knew someday
this would hurt 'cause i could never let you go
oh, i'll spend my whole life
missing a part of me, part of me
oh, i'll spend my whole life
hoping your heart is free, heart is free
i don't think that this is fair, but i'm still gonna ask it
what if we're still meant to be? crazier things have happened
it tears me apart, you can have love in your heart
and not have to act on it, ah
it erases me and everything i thought we'd be
back when we gave our promise

i wish you had enough discipline for the both of us
just because i don't know how to turn off the way i feel
i know you always fell out love so damn easily, but honestly
i don't think you ever had something real

until you met me
drinks in new york city
ooh, you looked so pretty
think i fell in love before i even knew your birthday
kissed you on our first date
somehow, i knew someday
this would hurt 'cause i could never let you go

do you not dream of me?
'cause i have visions in my sleep
i can't ever find my peace now
do you wake up alone
and feel an aching in your bones?
or are you happy without me now?
the first time that you told me
you thought that you loved me
that bar in the city
i thought you were drunk
but i knew deep down that you meant it
wish that i had said it
i was scared to let it happen
but it happened and now i cannot forget it
oh, i'll spend my whole life
missing a part of me, part of me
oh, i'll spend my whole life
hoping your heart is free, heart is free 

i hate the way you smoke cigarettes when you're drunk
but you always remember to call me
and i hate the way you say that you're right when you're wrong
but you always come back home to love me

and now you're going out of focus
and i'm losing you i know
cause i don't know how to forget
all the ways i hurt you so

and it's my fault if we go down
but i'm taking you with me
yeah i'm taking you with me
and it's my fault if we go down
but i'm taking you with me
yeah i'm taking you with me

i hate the way you speak from your heart when you're drunk
but you can't talk when you're sober
and i hate the way i'm standing you up when you want
when you want me to come over
and now you're going out of focus
and i'm losing you i know
cause i don't know how to forget
all the ways i hurt you so

and it's my fault if we go down
but i'm taking you with me
yeah i'm taking you with me
and it's my fault if we go down
but i'm taking you with me
yeah i'm taking you with me

and now you're going out of focus
and i'm losing you i know
cause i don't know how to forget
all the ways i hurt you so

i dreamt you loved me still
why  did it feel so real?
i  can't forget it
i can't forget it
i dreamt you said my name
you  looked at me the same
i  was in heaven
i was in heaven

you  don't see what you saw in me
when you said you would never leave
and i swore that i couldn't breathe
when you walked away from me
i'm  so scared to watch you grow
without my hand for you to hold
'cause i swore i would be your soul
never let you walk alone

even when you're hurting me
i'll still be your person, baby

i dreamt you took me home
your voice felt way too close
i could still hear it
i could still hear it
i dreamt you touched my hand
my stomach dropped again
i could still feel it
i can still feel it
you don't see what you saw in me
when you said you would never leave
and i swore that i couldn't breathe
when you walked away from me
i'm so scared to watch you grow
without my hand for you to hold
'cause i swore i would be your soul
never let you walk alone

even when you're hurting me
i'll still be your person‚ baby

every time i pray
i swear i hear the voices say
you'll come back‚ you'll come back home
i'm so scared to leave the bed
where you were next to me
i can't let‚ i can't let go

you don't see what you saw in me
when you said you would never leave
and i swore that i couldn't breathe
when you walked away from me
i'm so scared to watch you grow
without my hand for you to hold
'cause i swore i would be your soul
never let you walk alone
even when you're hurting me
i'll still be your person, baby 

i don't know where you start or where i end
i don't know when enough's enough
i don't know how to sleep in a cold bed
i'm trying not to think so much

maybe i want your love forever, is that so bad to say?
maybe we're meant to be together if god had his way
and if you ask why i've stayed and i'll stay for all i know
it's 'cause the stars said so
it's 'cause the stars said so

i like the way that i look in your sweatshirt
and being told i am enough
and i know if it's right, then it won't hurt
i'm trying not to think so much, oh

maybe i want your love forever, is that so bad to say?
maybe we're meant to be together if god had his way
and if you ask why i've stayed and i'll stay for all i know
it's 'cause the stars said so
it's 'cause the stars said so
mmm
it's 'cause the stars said so
('cause the stars said so)
('cause the stars said so) 

if i could take back what i said, i wouldn't
'cause this doesn't feel like love as i understood it
and i can't afford to throw you a line when i shouldn't
'cause you are losing me

and i wish that i could change my point of view
so i could see you the way i want to
and i hope you realize what you put me through
you are losing me

you're gonna wish that i wasn't loving someone new
you're gonna wish that i was sleeping next to you
you're gonna wish that you never broke my heart in two
and you weren't losing me when i have already lost you

you're gonna wake up all alone in the morning
and you're gonna wish you could go back to before this
you're gonna tell all of your friends that you're broken
'cause you are losing me ('cause you are losing me)

and i wish that i could change my point of view
so i could see you the way i want to
and i hope you realize what you put me through
you are losing me
you're gonna wish that i wasn't loving someone new
you're gonna wish that i was sleeping next to you
you're gonna wish that you never broke my heart in two
and you weren't losing me when i have already lost you

you're gonna wish that you never broke my heart in two
and you weren't losing me when i have already lost you 

i don't wanna stay and put the weight on you
’cause maybe in the mornin'
you'll remember that before it
got so hard it hurts, you used to want me too
and i never had to question
what i said before i sent it

there’s a line that you drew and i said it's all right
but i don't wait inside it

there's so much left for us to say
why you just pushin' me away?
i never meant for us to change
no, i don't wanna waste no time when i still want you

just the same as nights we laid out on pavement
drinkin' 'til we got wasted

my friends tell me i'm good
why  can’t i feel it too?
when  the drink hits lips
i, all i taste is you
make the most of my days
i  tell myself that you're gone
i  don't wanna be right
if missing you is so wrong

it  hits me like a tsunami
oh, i feel you over my body
oh yeah, i hate being so damn honest
you have my heart, but you don’t even want it, no
you  don't even want it

i'll let my friends take me out on another night
to some bar i know you never liked
kiss somebody who's not my type
and it won't feel right

can't believe what you did, no
and i don’t really want to

and they feel so loud
could pretend that i’m fine
but i don't really know how

it hits me like a tsunami (it hits me like, you know, it hits me like, you know)

and it won’t feel right
