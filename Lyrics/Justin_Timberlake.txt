aren't you somethin' to admire?
'cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
and i can't help but notice
you reflect in this heart of mine
if you ever feel alone and
the glare makes me hard to find
just know that i'm always
parallel on the other side

'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the glass
i'll be there to pull you through
you just gotta be strong

'cause i don't wanna lose you now
i'm lookin' right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
comin' back here to you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror (oh)
my mirror staring back at me  (oh)
i couldn't get any bigger (oh)
with anyone else beside me (oh)
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making
two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror (oh)
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

aren't you somethin', an original?
'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
and i can't help but stare, 'cause
i see truth somewhere in your eyes
i can't ever change without you
you reflect me, i love that about you
and if i could, i
would look at us all the time

'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the past
i'm here tryna pull you through
you just gotta be strong

'cause i don't wanna lose you now
i'm lookin' right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
comin' back here to you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror (oh)
my mirror staring back at me (oh)
i couldn't get any bigger (oh)
with anyone else beside me (oh)
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making
two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror (oh)
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

yesterday is history, oh
tomorrow's a mystery, oh
i can see you lookin' back at me
keep your eyes on me
baby, keep your eyes on me

'cause i don't wanna lose you now
i'm lookin' right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now (you show me, baby)
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
comin' back here to you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror (oh)
my mirror staring back at me (oh)
i couldn't get any bigger (oh)

well, baby, i've been around the world
but i ain't seen myself another girl (like you)

my love (so don't give away)
my love (so don't give away)
ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
love, girl, my love, my love

now if i wrote you a love note
and made you smile at every word i wrote (what would you do?)
would that make you wanna change your scene
and wanna be the one on my team? (tell me, would you?)
see, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'cause girl, i've never been more sure (that, baby, it's you)
this ring here represents my heart
and everything that you been waitin' for (just say it, "i do")

hey, listen, baby, i don't wanna ruin your plan (nah)
but if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
when they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
you don't really wanna let the chance go by
'cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
and, babe, with friends so fly, i can go fly
private, 'cause i handle my b.i
they call me candle guy (why?)
simply 'cause i am on fire (haha)
i hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
i'm patient, but i ain't gon' try (nah)
you don't come, i ain't gon' die
hold up, what you mean? you can't go? why? (why?)
me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (uh-uh)
you say you wanna kick it when i ain't so high (man...)

i'm in love, yes, i'm in love with that girl
i don't care what people say, people say
cause i'm in love with that girl

frequencies so low
heart on a string
a string that only plays solos
rain made of echoes
tidal wave rushing on and on

under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
but i hear it loud and you fall in the deep and i'll always find you

if my red eyes don't see you anymore
and i can't hear you through the white noise
just send your heartbeat i'll go to the blue ocean floor
where they find us no more
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor

shell made out of gold
found on a beach picked up and you held so close
rain washed out its glow
heartbeat steadily leads me down below

under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
but i hear it loud and you fall in the deep and i'll always find you

if my red eyes don't see you anymore
and i can't hear you through the white noise
just send your heartbeat i'll go to the blue ocean floor
where they find us no more
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor

20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
heartbeat set at steady pace, i’ll let the rhythm show me the way
no one can find us here, fade out and disappear

if my red eyes don't see you anymore
and i can't hear you through the white noise
just send your heartbeat i'll go to the blue ocean floor
where they find us no more
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor
on that blue ocean floor

hey pretty lady

then something strawberry filled up the sky
and everything on you intoxicates

and i could tell it’s pure just by the taste
and you kiss me

don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
don't ever change your flavor 'cause i love the taste
and if you ask me where i wanna go, i say all the way

'cause she's just like nothing

because your flavor's so original
and it all started when she said
hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
you really got me when you said
hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
this goes out to you, this goes out to you

so tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
acting unprofessional but it works out
'cause you don’t wanna work here anyway

and every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
i heard you found out that he's doin' to you
what you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
when you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
so it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
just a classic case, a scenario
tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

and now you want somebody (hey)
to cure the lonely nights (hey)
you wish you had somebody (hey)
that could come and make it right (hey)
but girl, i ain't somebody (hey)
with a lot of sympathy (hey)
you'll see, see

when someone cuts your heart open with a knife
now you're bleeding
but i could be that guy to heal it over time
and i won’t stop until you believe it
'cause baby, you’re worth it

so don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me

so don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
it’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me

and every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
and every morning i just wanna see you staring back at me (staring back at me)
'cause i know that’s a good place to start

i know people make promises all the time
then they turn right around and break them
when someone cuts your heart open with a knife
now you're bleeding
(don't you know) but i could be that guy to heal it over time
and i won’t stop until you believe it
'cause baby, you’re worth it
