long ago in a distant land, i, aku, the shape shifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil!  but a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me
before the final blow was struck, i tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the future where my evil is law.  now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is aku!

* all of barack obama's lyrics are sampled from a campaign speech in the 2008 nh primary
* barack obama and will.i.am's vocals frequently and purposefully overlap throughout

it was a creed, written into the founding documents
that declared the destiny, of a nation - yes we can
it was whispered by slaves and abolitionists
as they blazed a trail toward freedom - yes we can, yes we can
it was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores
and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness
oh, yes we can, it was the call of workers who organized
women who reached for the ballots
a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop
and pointed the way to the promised land, yes we can to justice, and equality

yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
yes we can - ohhhh! we can... (yes we can!)
yes we can - ohhhh! we can...

yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
yes we can heal this nation (heal this nation!)
yes we can repair this world (repair this world!)
yes we can

yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
yes we can - ohhhh! we can... (yes we can!)
yes we can - ohhhh! we can...
sí, se puede!

we know, the battle ahead will be long
but always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way
nothing can stand
in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change
(we want change! we want change! we want change! we want change!)
(we want change! we want change! we want change! we want change!)
we want change...we want change...
we want change... i want change...
we have been told we cannot do this
by a chorus of cynics; they will only grow louder and more dissonant
we've been asked to pause for a reality check
we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope
but in the unlikely story that is america, there has never been anything false about hope
(we want change! we want change! we want change! we want change!)
(we want change! we want change! we want change! we want change!)
i want change... it's all gonna change
i want change... i want change... i wanna change

now the hopes, of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in dillon
are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of l.a
we will remember that there is something happening in america
that we are not as divided as our politics suggests
that we are one people; we are one nation
and together, we will begin the next great chapter, in the american story
with three words that will ring from coast to coast
from sea to shining sea -- yes, we can

yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can
yes, we can

yes we can, mhmm.. oh, yes we can, yes we can
ooh, yes we can

love will be the armor
protect us from the pain
end our life, end our life
even when the storm comes
we’ll stand out in the rain
watch it slide, leave this life.

here we stand against the world

you and i we rock the lullaby
make me feel alive, cause the love will never die
me put you long one
shot me down and we’re gone
ain’t no need to worry, don’t call 911
bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang
shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain
kill it, kill it baby with your loving, bang bang
baby, do it again

so shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
so shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet

even if you’re mad at me
and fighting all the time
it’s alright, it’s alright
i would risk my sanity
i would lose my mind
for one night, for one night

here we stand against the world

you and i we rock the lullaby
make me feel alive, cause the love will never die

shot me down and we’re gone

so shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
so shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet

cause where i live we have nothing
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

little kids growing up without no education
mom's on drugs, cause that's her only medication
nobody's home, but they ain't on a vacation
but they left the kids alone watching the tv station
what's wrong with the picture, please, someone give me the answers
they be wondering why the girls grow up to be dancers
then we wonder why the boys grow up to be dealers
and they be angry at the whole world ready to kill us
how do we start to resolve the whole problem
how we let our little children just turn into goblins
why we got them all killing and stealing and robbing
we need to plan a little seed to prevent the mobbing
why don't we teach them that science to reach for the stars?
cause they can beat the fire with the future worst than odds
don't want them looking in the past and covering scars
they need a path out the ghetto, ghetto, hello!

it is easy as 1, 2, 3
i wanna be what's on tv
and if that's wrong, please don't blame me
cause where i live we have nothing
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

little boy had a dream of being a ball player
cause little homie wanna grow to be a rhyme slayer
little missy wanna grow to be a model
while the momma at home just drinking out the bottle
how come they don't want to grow to be a councilman?
senator, a governor, a major politician man
probably cause the politicians nearly keep on tricking 'em
promise that they fixing it but they ain't really fixing it
that's why they want to be like me
like jigga, like b and nicky and ree
every day in the ghetto is an emergency
but the power that be don't emerge in see
that's why you see killing, that's why you see crimes
that's why you see homies in the prison doing time
that's why you see crack, that's why you see blackstrap
but no access out the ghetto, ghetto

it is easy as 1, 2, 3
i wanna be what's on tv
and if that's wrong, please don't blame me
cause where i live we have nothing
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

ghetto, ghetto

good morning, welcome to the thing called life
good morning, don't you let it pass you by
we laugh, we cry and then we dry our eyes
we fall, we rise, ready for another try
when life gets tough, remember we were never born to die
when times get tough remember we were born to be alive
good morning, wake up and live the life
and don't forget to dream the dreams, the dreams
and don't forget to live the dreams and dream
and don't forget to dream the wonderful things
