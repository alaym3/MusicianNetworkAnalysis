what would i do without your smart mouth?
drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
you've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
i can't pin you down
what's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
i'm on your magical mystery ride
and i'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
but i'll be alright

my head's under water, but i'm breathing fine
you're crazy and i'm out of my mind

'cause all of me
loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginnin'
even when i lose, i'm winnin'

'cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you, oh-oh

how many times do i have to tell you?
even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
the world is beating you down, i'm around
through every mood
you're my downfall, you're my muse
my worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
i can't stop singing, it's ringing
in my head for you

my head's under water, but i'm breathin' fine
you're crazy and i'm out of my mind

'cause all of me
loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginnin'
even when i lose, i'm winnin'

'cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you, oh-oh

give me all of you, oh
cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
risking it all, though it's hard

'cause all of me
loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginnin'
even when i lose, i'm winnin'

'cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you

i give you all of me
and you give me all of you, oh-oh

i... yeah

you fix your make-up, just so
guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
try on every dress that you own
you were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

and if your mirror won't make it any clearer
i'll be the one to let you know

out of all the girls
you're my one and only girl
ain't nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
ain't nobody in the world but you and i
you and i
ain't nobody in the world but you

you stop the room when we walk in
spotlights on, everybody's staring
tell all of these boys, they're wasting their time
stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

and this evening i won't let the feeling die
i never wanna leave your side

out of all the girls
you’re my one and only girl
ain't nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
ain't nobody in the world but you and i
you and i
ain't nobody in the world

you keep wondering if you're what i'm wanting
you don't even have to try
ooh, you don't have to try
don't try
don't try
you don't have to try

ooh, out of all the girls
you’re my one and only girl
ain't nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
ain't nobody in the world but you and i
you and i
you and i
nobody in the world tonight
ain't nobody in the world but you and i

oh, oh, oh, oh

girl, i'm in love with you
but this ain't the honeymoon
we're passed the infatuation phase
we're right in the thick of love
at times we get sick of love
it seems like we argue every day
i know i misbehaved
and you've made your mistakes
and we've both still got room left to grow
and though love sometimes hurts
i still put you first
and we'll make this thing work
but i think we should take it slow

we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way to go
'cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

this ain't a movie, no
no fairytale conclusion, y'all
it gets more confusing every day, oh
sometimes it's heaven sent
then we head back to hell again
we kiss, then we make up on the way
i hang up, you call
we rise and we fall
and we feel like just walking away
as our love advances
we take second chances
though it's not a fantasy
i still want you to stay

we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way to go
'cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
take it slow

maybe we'll live and learn
maybe we'll crash and burn
maybe you'll stay
maybe you'll leave
maybe you'll return
maybe another fight
maybe we won't survive
maybe we'll grow
we'll never know
baby, you and i

we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way to go, yeah
'cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
take it slow, slow
this time we'll take it slow
take it slow, oh
this time we'll take it slow

pulling me further, further than i've been before
making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
oh, i don't know what's in the stars
never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
but i know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine i'll be torn apart

i don't know who's gonna kiss you when i'm gone
so i'm gonna love you now, like it's all i have
i know it'll kill me when it's over
i don't wanna think about it, i want you to love me now
i don't know who's gonna kiss you when i'm gone
so i'm gonna love you now, like it's all i have
i know it'll kill me when it's over
i don't wanna think about it, i want you to love me now

love me now, love me now
oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
love me now, love me now
oh, i want you to love me now

something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
yeah, girl, i don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
when we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

and who's gonna kiss you when i'm gone?
oh i'm gonna love you now, like it's all i have
and i know it'll kill me when it's over
i don't wanna think about it, i want you to love me now

love me now, love me now
oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
love me now
love me now, love me now
love me now

oh i don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
let's make the most of every moment tonight

i don't know who's gonna kiss you when i'm gone
so i'm gonna love you now, like it's all i have
i know it'll kill me when it's over
i don't wanna think about it, i want you to love me now
i don't know who's gonna kiss you when i'm gone
so i'm gonna love you now, like it's all i have
i know it'll kill me when it's over
i don't wanna think about it, i just wanna love you now

who do we think we are?
baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

we made a lot of magic
it’s the only way we know
let’s trip the night fantastic
light it up, tell me more, explore
we love, we love, we love the stars
we could fall so hard
the drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
why’d we ball so hard?

yeah, i’m not afraid to fly
here we are, in the air, barely breathing
and we’re not afraid to die
who do we think we are?
baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
who do we think we are?
baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

we’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
we walk around here like we own this place

see my jewels dripping on my timberlands
stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
pink champagne, black rolls royce
eggplant double breasted suit from tom ford
bon voyage, left haters in the fog
look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
look into my eyes as i fantasize for us
still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
money comin’ fast, i’m never in a rush, no
plus another twenty in the tuck
semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like i pitch
dodging robin givens, balling like i’m roger clemens
still in the game, uniform all linen
she get chanel, ski trips to vail
only the highest grade, like trees that i inhale

yeah, i’m not afraid to fly
here we are, in the air, barely breathing
and we’re not afraid to die
who do we think we are?
baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
who do we think we are?
baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

who do we think we are?
i don’t know about y’all, but i feel good tonight
there’s something in the air tonight
you know, everyone needs someone to look up to
why shouldn't it be us?
who do we think we are?
tell me, who do we think we are?
who do we think we are?
tell me, who do we think we are?

and we fall through the hole in the light
make this our kingdom
somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

cause i may not know a lot of things but
i feel it in my chest
know i won't let the blue flame die
we can't lose hope just yet
'cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
and we're scared to love but it's alright
i may not know a lot of things but
i know that we're surefire, yeah
know that we're surefire, yeah

can't keep this bed warm on the left side
when something is cold as a goodbye
why don't you turn around?
ignore all that shit from the outside
the world is a nightmare
wake up and stay here
let me be on your side
we'll make this our kingdom
somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

i really can't stay (baby, it's cold outside)
i've got to go away (but, i can call you a ride)
this evening has been (i'm so glad that you dropped in)
so very nice (time spent with you is paradise)
my momma will start to worry (i'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
my daddy will be pacing the floor (wait, what are you still livin' home for?)
so, really, i'd better scurry (your driver, his name is murray)
but maybe just a half a drink more (oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?)
what will my friends think? (i think they should rejoice)
if i have one more drink? (it's your body and your choice)
ooh, you really know how (your eyes are like starlight now)
to cast a spell (one look at you and then i fell)
i ought to say, "no, no, no, sir" (then you really ought to go, go, go)
at least i'm gonna say that i tried (well, murray, he just pulled up outside)

oh, i really can't stay
(i understand, baby)
baby, it's cold outside

i simply should go (text me when you get home)
oh, i'm supposed to say no (mm, i guess that's respectable)
this welcome has been (i've been lucky that you dropped in)
so nice and warm (but you better go before it storms)
my sister will be suspicious (well, gosh your lips look delicious)
my brother will be there at the door (oh, he loves my music, baby, i'm sure)
my gossipy neighbor is vicious (i'm a genie, tell me what your wish is)
but maybe just a cigarette more (oh, that's somethin' we should probably explore)
i've got to get home (oh, baby, i'm well aware)
say, lend me a coat (oh, keep it girl, i don't care)
you've really been grand (i feel it when you touch my hands)
but don't you see? (i want you to stay, it's not up to me)
there's bound to be talk tomorrow (well, they can talk, but what do they know?)
at least there will be plenty implied (oh, let them mind their business and go-)
uh, ma'am, i really can't stay
murray just go on

it's cold, baby
it's cold, baby
but, ooh, i don't wanna go
it's cold outside

yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'fore everybody knew our name
we became their favorite secret
love for love and not for fame
oh when i was your user your facetime abuser
dose after dose 'til we crashed
now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
it's too good but we never could last

but oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
but oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
and now we know, life on overload, love, love...
don't we always make a show of love , love, love, love, yeah...

let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
let them talk about us, let them talk too much
while we rule the whole world from our bed

'cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
and now we know, life on overload
don't we always make a show of love
life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

oh yeah, yeah

'cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
and now we know, life on overload

i hunt him down until the bitter end
if you see me coming man, who're you gonna call?

you better call the doctor, call the lawyer

who did that to you

i see you in the lonely place
how can you be so blind
you still regretting the love you left, left behind

sitting alone each night

girl you never find a love that's right
darling open your eyes

girl you think you're so wise, you're so wise

there are times when you need someone
i will be by your side
i'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by
oh darling, there is a light that shines
special for you and me
you need to look at the other side, you'll agree

darling open your eyes

girl you never find a love that's right
darling open your eyes

darling open your eyes

girl you think you're so wise
you may never find a love that's right

all this trouble in this here town
all this shit going down
when will they focus, on this?
streets ride up with the tv crews
look ma, we on the news
but they didn't notice, before this
they float above the city lights
forget the truth, inhale the lies
just enjoy the show
they see us reaching for the sky
just ignore that you survive

maybe we should go
go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
penthouse floor

all that bubbly, all that wine
oh man, look at the times
didn't they notice, notice?
only future i can see, ain't what it used to be
and i didn't know this, i didn't know this
once you're above the city lights
won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
the whole world on display for us
the altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)
penthouse floor

i heard this old joke once, it was like, uh
knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?
just us, who dis? just playin'
just me, new phone, new hair, new era
i'm in the penthouse, baby
handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
held back, i had to grab crab legs
and then there were only but a few
conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
what a dress, what a song
what a beautiful time
my folks downstairs still waitin' in line
they never been in these rooms
never stayed with these folks
never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
so as i fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
forcin' a new smile, he tells me another
he said "what happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"
then he pushed me off the top and said "jump, nigga, jump!"

oh don’t bring me down i need a room up in the clouds
i wanna get there babe, i wanna elevate
oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss
in the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
we'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
those penthouse doors
we'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
baby, i'm in the penthouse floor
baby, let's ride the elevator
til we can rise some more
go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)

i always believed that love was surrender
and i wouldn't go down without a fight
i always left room for other contenders
'cause i might change my mind

damn, i used to be so cold
would never ever get too close
didn't ever wanna lose control
but from the moment that i tasted
i knew that i would have to chase it
you said hold up, i want you to be

a one woman man
a one woman man, oh
want you all to myself
don't want nobody else
all your loving
all or nothing
won't you be
a one woman man (one woman)
a one woman man, oh (one woman)

you made me believe that love was forever
and love could sustain us through every fight
i let go of all of the other pretenders
they were wasting my time

i never thought that i would say this
but i can see us having babies
i could see it from the start
that i might give you my heart
from the moment that i met you
knew that i would never let you
slip away, it's okay
you can make me

a one woman man
a one woman man, oh
i want you all to myself
don't want nobody else
all my loving
all or nothing
i can be
a one woman man (one woman)
a one woman man, uh (one woman)

i could never say i loved you
i kept up my guard
but you broke in my house
you've stolen my heart
now i've given you the key
got all of you for all of me
but baby, i promise to be

a one - woman man, oh
i want you all to myself
don't want nobody else
all my loving
all or nothing
i can be
a one woman man (one woman)
a one woman man, uh (one woman)

say that you'll stay a little
dont say bye-bye tonight
say you'll be mine
just a little bit of love
is worth a moment of your time
knockin' on your door just a little
it's so cold outside tonight
let's get a fire burning
oh, i know i'll keep it burning bright
if you stay, won't you save, save

save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love
save a little, save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me? (oh)

this just might hurt a little
but, love hurts sometimes when you do it right
dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
pleasure is on the other side
let down your guard just a little
i'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
hold on to me, pretty baby
you will see, i can be all you need
if you stay, won't you save, save

save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love
save a little, save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me? (oh)

oh, come on
make time to live a little
don't let this moment slip by tonight
you'll never know what you're missing 'til you try
i'll keep you satisfied if you stay
won't you save, save
 x2
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love
save a little, save a little for me
