we all came out to montreux
on the lake geneva shoreline
to make records with a mobile
we didn't have much time
but frank zappa and the mothers
were at the best place around
but some stupid with a flare gun
burned the place to the ground

smoke on the water
(and fire in the sky)
smoke on the water

they burned down the gambling house
it died with an awful sound
funky claude was running in and out
pulling kids out the ground
when it all was over
we had to find another place
but swiss time was running out
it seemed that we would lose the race

smoke on the water
(and fire in the sky)
smoke on the water


we ended up at the grand hotel
it was empty cold and bare
but with the rolling-truck-stones-thing just outside
making our music there
with a few red lights, a few old beds
we made a place to sweat
no matter what we get out of this
i know, i know we'll never forget

smoke on the water
(and fire in the sky)
smoke on the water

i have often told you stories
about the way
i lived the life of a drifter
waiting for the day
when i'd take your hand
and sing you songs
then maybe you would say
come lay with me and love me
and i would surely stay

but i feel i'm growing older
and the songs that i have sung
echo in the distance
like the sound
of a windmill going around
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune

many times i've been a traveler
i looked for something new
in days of old
when nights were cold
i wandered without you
but those days i thought my eyes
had seen you standing near
though blindness is confusing
it shows that you're not here

now i feel i'm growing older
and the songs that i have sung
echo in the distance
like the sound
of a windmill going around
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune

yes, i can hear the sound
of a windmill going around
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune

sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
the line that's drawn between good and bad
see the blind man shooting at the world
bullets flying taking toll
if you've been bad, oh lord, i bet you have
and you've not been hit by flying lead
you'd better close your eyes (ooohhhh)
you'd better bow your head
wait for the ricochet

can you remember, remember my name?
as i flow through your life
a thousand oceans i have flown
oh-oh-oh
and cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah
all my life
i am the echo of your past

i am returning the echo of a point in time
and distant faces shine
a thousand warriors i have known
oh, oh-oh-oh
and laughing as the spirits appear
all your life
shadows of another day

and if you hear me talking on the wind
you've got to understand
we must remain perfect strangers

ah, ah, ah, no
i know i must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

a strand of silver hanging through the sky
touching more than you see
the voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh
is aching with the dead of the night
oh-uh-oh, precious life
your tears are lost in falling rain

and if you hear me talking on the wind
you've got to understand
we must remain perfect strangers

oh, oh-oh
oh, yeah

the sky is red, i don't understand
past midnight i still see the land
people are saying the woman is damned
she makes you burn with a wave of her hand
the city's ablaze, the town's on fire
the woman's flames are reaching higher
we were fools, we called her a liar
all i hear is
"burn!"

i didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
she said, "curse you all, you'll never learn"
"when i leave there's no return"
the people laughed till she said, "burn!"
warning came, no one cared
earth was shaking, we stood and stared
when it came no one was spared
still i hear
"burn!"

you know we had no time
we could not even try
you know we had no time


you know we had no time
we could not even try
you know we had no time


the sky is red, i don't understand
past midnight i still see the land
people are saying the woman is damned
she makes you burn with a wave of her hand
warning came, no one cared
earth was shaking, we stood and stared
when it came no one was spared
still i hear
"burn!"

if you're leaving, close the door
i'm not expecting people, anymore
hear me grieving, lying on the floor
whether i'm drunk or dead
i really ain't too sure

i'm a blind man
i'm a blind man
and my world is pale
when a blind man cries
lord, you know
there ain't a sadder tale


had a friend once, in a room
had a good time
but it ended much too soon
in a cold month, in that room
we found a reason
for the things we had to do

i'm a blind man
i'm a blind man
now my room is cold
when a blind man cries
lord, you know
he feels it from his soul

there once was a woman
a strange kind of woman
the kind that gets written down in history
her name was nancy
her face was nothing fancy
she left a trail of happiness and misery
i loved her
everybody loved her
she loved everyone and gave them good return
i tried to take her
i even tried to break her
she said, "i ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?"

i want you, i need you, i got to be near you
i spent my money as i took my turn
i want you, i need you, i got to be near you
ooh, i got a strange kind of woman

she looked like a raver
but i could never please her
on wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
i couldn't get her
but things got better, she said
"saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star"
i want you, i need you, i got to be near you
i spent my money as i took my turn
i want you, i need you, i got to be near you
ooh, i got a strange kind of woman
ooh my soul, i love you


she finally said she loved me
i wed her in a hurry
no more callers and i glowed with pride
i'm dreaming
i feel like screaming
i won my woman just before she died


who do you think you are?
superstar
who do you think you are?
superstar
superstar
who do we think we are?
oh my soul, i love you baby

sweet lucy was a dancer
but none of us would chance her
because she was a samurai
she made electric shadows
beyond our fingertips
and none of us could reach that high
she came on like a teaser
i had to touch and please her
enjoy a little paradise
the log was in my pocket
when lucy met the rocket
she never knew the reason why
i can't deny it
with that smile on her face
oh, it's not the kill
it's the thrill of the chase
feel it coming
it's knocking at the door
you know it's no good running
it's not against the law
the point of no return
now you know the score
and now you're learning
ah-ha, what's knockin' at your back door
sweet nancy was so fancy
to get into her pants
we had to be the aristocracy
the members that she toyed with
at her city club
were something in diplomacy
so we put her on the hit list
of a common cunning linguist
a master of many tongues
now she eases gently
from her austin to her bentley
suddenly she feels so young
i can't deny it
with that smile on her face
oh, it's not the kill
it's the thrill of the chase
feel it coming
it's knocking at the door
you know it's no good running
no, it's not against the law
the point of no return
now you know the score
and now you're learning
ah-ha, what's knockin' at your back door
sweet lucy was a dancer
but none of us would chance her
because she was a samurai
she made electric shadows
beyond our fingertips
and one of us could reach that high
i can't deny it
with that smile on my face, oh-oh-oh
it's not the kill
it's the thrill of the chase
feel it coming
knocking at your door
you know it's no good running
now it's knocking at your door
ah-ha, knocking at your back door

oh yeah, i see the way you roll your eyes
the way your purse your lips
throw your stuff into a suitcase
put your hands upon your hips
i'm unmoved by your evil glare
the way you toss your head
you make stupid accusations
by which time i've lost the thread
sometimes i wonder how it is you get
to piss me off this much
i may be heavy-handed
and i lack the tender touch
you moan and groan about me staying out
and drinking with the guys
how 'bout i bring them home?
try that one on for size
there's something awfully wrong with this deal, babe
any fool could see it's true
can't you understand how i feel, babe?
you've got me
but all i got is you
i guess i just don't have it in me
to keep you satisfied
to be honest with you, babe
i'm only in it for the ride
and you may never bring yourself
to take me as i am
but in case you haven't noticed
i don't give a fucking damn!

you're lazy, you just stay in bed

you don't want no money, you don't want no bread
if you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw
if you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw

black night is not right
i don't feel so bright
i don't care to sit tight

maybe i'll find on the way down the line
that i'm free, free to be me
black night is a long way from home

i don't need a dark tree
i don't want a rough sea
i can't feel, i can't see

maybe i'll find on the way down the line
that i'm free, free to be me
black night is a long way from home

black night, black night
i don't need black night
i can't see dark light

maybe i'll find on the way down the line
that i'm free, free to be me
black night is a long way from home

good golly said little miss molly
when she was rocking in the house of blue light
tutti frutti was oh so rooty
when she was rocking to the east and west

lucille was oh so real
when she didn't do her daddy's will
come on baby drive me crazy do it do it

i'm a speed king
you got to hear me sing
i'm a speed king

going to fool about isn't going to save
some people going to rock some people gonna roll
going to have a party to save my soul
hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
they been causing trouble since it all began
take a little rice take a little beans
going to rock and roll down to new orleans




some people going to rock some people going to roll
going to have a party to save my soul
come on baby drive me crazy do it do it

coming out of nowhere
driving like rain
stormbringer dance
on the thunder again
dark cloud gathering
breaking the day
no point running
because it's coming your way

ride the rainbow
crack the sky
stormbringer coming
time to die
got to keep running
stormbringer coming
he's got nothing you need
he's going to make you bleed
and you know he's gonna get you

rainbow shaker
on a stallion twister
bareback rider
on the eye of the sky
stormbringer coming down
meaning to stay
thunder and lightning
heading your way

ride the rainbow
crack the sky
stormbringer coming
time to die
got to keep running
stormbringer coming
he's got nothing you need
he's going to make you bleed

coming out of nowhere
driving like rain
stormbringer dance
on the thunder again
dark cloud gathering
breaking the day
no point running
because it's coming your way

'cause it's coming your way
'cause it's coming your way
'cause it's coming your way
'cause it's coming your way
'cause it's coming your way

the golden light above you shows me where you're from
the magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
you stand up on your hill they bebop all around you
they wonder where you're from, oh yeah
they wonder where i found you

oh, my love, it's a long way
where you're from it's a long way

i tried to understand you, tried to love you right
the way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight
your lips are like a fire burning through my soul
and people ask me where you're from
they really wanna know

oh, my soul, it's a long way
where you're from it's a long way

magic woman wrecking up my soul
things you tell me have never been told
magic woman i don't know
electric before me i love you so i love you so
you're racing like a fireball dancing like a ghost
you're gemini and i don't know which one i like the most
my head is getting broken and
my mind is getting bust
but now i'm coming with you down the road of golden dust

oh, my love, it's a long way
where you're from it's a long way

the golden light above you shows me where you're from
the magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
you stand up on your hill they bebop all around you
they wonder where you're from, oh yeah
they wonder where i found you

oh, my love, it's a long way
where you're from it's a long way

creeping round my door, i got a big surprise
couldn't see a thing but open skies

they've taken her away
where is she now?

wish that she was here, i wish she'd hold my hand
maybe she would laugh, maybe understand

why was i so cruel?
where is she now?

{organ solo}

acting like a fool, i had to make her cry
maybe i'm a leo but i ain't a lion

i'm hurtin' for her so bad
i want her now

somebody's shouting
up at a mountain
only my own words return
nobody's up there
it's a deception
when will i ever learn?

i'm alone here
with emptiness, eagles and snow
unfriendliness chilling my body
and whispering pictures of home

wondering blindly
how can they find me?
maybe they don't even know
my body is shaking
anticipating
the call of the black-hooded crow

i'm alone here
with emptiness, eagles and snow
unfriendliness chilling my body
and taunting with pictures of home


here in this prison
of my own making
year after day, i have grown
into a hero
but there's no worship
where have they hidden my throne?

i'm alone here
with emptiness, eagles and snow
unfriendliness chilling my body
and screaming out pictures of home

it wasn't quite the curse of tutankhamen
or the kiss of death from judas in the night
and it felt so far beyond the blue horizon
tempting me with transports of delight
and then the devil took my hand and said
come along with me
oh, there i was, wide awake and dreaming
reaching out for something in the sky
but i could not control that trembling feeling
everything i want is slipping by
oh, and the devil took my hand and said
something you should see (come along with me)
(come along with me)
i never knew what happened to my nightmare
everything went dark that august day
and the eclipse was on the other side of somewhere
but i was on the upside of afraid
and then an angel took my hand and said
come along with me (come along with me)
