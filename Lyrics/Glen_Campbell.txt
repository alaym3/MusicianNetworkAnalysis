i am a lineman for the county
and i drive the main road
searchin' in the sun for another overload

i hear you singing in the wire
i can hear you through the whine
and the wichita lineman
is still on the line


i know i need a small vacation
but it don't look like rain
and if it snows that stretch down south
won't ever stand the strain

and i need you more than want you
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman
is still on the line


and i need you more than want you
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman
is still on the line

it's knowing that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowing i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that are dried upon some line
that keeps you in the backroads
by the rivers of my memory
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind
it's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that bind me
or something that somebody said
because they thought we fit together walking
it's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're moving on the backroads
by the rivers of my memory
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind
though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junkyards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me 'til i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
cracklin' caldron in some train yard
my beard a-rustlin', coal pile
and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands 'round the tin can
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're waiting from the backroads
by the rivers of my memories
ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind

southern nights
have you ever felt a southern night?
free as a breeze
not to mention the trees
whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

southern nights
just as good even when closed your eyes
i apologize
to anyone who can truly say
that he has found a better way

southern skies
have you ever noticed southern skies? (in southern sky)
its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
it goes runnin' through your soul
like the stories told of old

old man
he and his dog, they walk the old land
every flower touched his cold hand
as he slowly walked by
weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

feels so good
feels so good, it's frightening
wish i could
stop this world from fighting
la-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

mystery
like this and many others in the trees
blow in the night
in the southern skies

southern nights
they feel so good, it's a frightening
wish i could (southern nights)
stop this world from the fighting
da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

southern skies
have you ever noticed?

i'm still here, but yet i'm gone
i don't play guitar or sing my songs
they never defined who i am
the man that loves you 'til the end
you're the last person i will love
you're the last face i will recall
and best of all, i'm not gonna miss you
not gonna miss you
i'm never gonna hold you like i did
or say i love you to the kids
you're never gonna see it in my eyes
it's not gonna hurt me when you cry
i'm never gonna know what you go through
all the things i say or do
all the hurt and all the pain
one thing selfishly remains
i'm not gonna miss you
i'm not gonna miss you

i've been walkin' these streets so long
singin' the same old song
i know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of broadway
where hustle's the name of the game
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
there's been a load of compromisin'
on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
well, i really don't mind the rain
and a smile can hide all the pain
but you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
and i dream of the things i'll do
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
there'll be a load of compromisin'
on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
rhinestone cowboy
gettin' cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

like a rhinestone cowboy
gettin' card and letters from people i don't even know

by the time i get to phoenix
she'll be rising
she'll find the note i left hangin'
on her door
she'll laugh when she reads the part
that says i'm leavin'
'cause i've left that girl so many times before
by the time i make albuquerque
she'll be working
she'll prob'ly stop at lunch
and give me a call
but she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
off the wall
that's all
by the time i make oklahoma
she'll be sleepin'
she'll turn softly
and call my name out low
and she'll cry just to think i'd really leave her
though time and time i've tried to tell her so
she just didn't know
i would really go

galveston, oh galveston
i still hear your sea winds blowin'
i still see her dark eyes glowin'
she was twenty-one
when i left galveston

galveston, oh galveston
i still hear your sea waves crashing
while i watch the cannons flashing
i clean my gun
and dream of galveston

i still see her standing by the water
standing there lookin' out to sea
and is she waiting there for me?
on the beach where we used to run

galveston, oh galveston
i am so afraid of dying
before i dry the tears she's crying
before i watch
your sea birds flying in the sun

at galveston
at galveston

if you miss the train i'm on
you will know that i am gone
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
lord i'm one, lord i'm two, lord i'm three, lord i'm four
i'm 500 miles away from home
not a shirt on my back
not a penny to my name
lord i can't go back this a'way
this a'way, this a'way, this a'way, this a'way
lord i can't go back this a'way
well, i'm walking these ties
with tears in my eyes
trying to read a letter from my home
from my home, from my home, from my home, from my home
trying to read a letter from my home
if this train's running right
i'll be home by saturday night
i'm 500 miles away from home
away from home, away from home, away from home, away from home
i'm 500 miles away from home

take my hand for a while
explain it to me once again
just for the sake
of my-why broken heart
look into my eyes
and maybe i will understand
how love i counted on
was never there
you see, i-i thought
that you might love me
so you caught me, it seems
off balance with a heart so full
of love and pretty dreams
that two should share
and so, i-i know
but please before you go
take my hand for a while
explain it to me once again
just for the sake
of my-why broken heart

he got here red and wrinkled scared and cryin'
then she took him up and held him to her breast
and he sure was glad to get what mama offered
then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest
it didn't seem to matter what he needed
he could always count on mama to supply
and regardless of the sleep she might be losin'
he always found a twinkle in her eye
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
she taught him all the attributes of greatness
that she knew he couldn't learn away from home
and by the time she wore the cover off her bible
her hair was gray and her little man was gone
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
yes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world

well, it'll just get you down
if you let life get to you
cause everybody's saying something
none of it's true
well, i just don't care
when them times get hard
cause i got everything i need
right out in my yard

i love my truck
she's right outside
i ain't got much luck
but i sure got a ride
it don't matter who lived
it don't matter who lied
i got my truck right by my side

you got sally and you got sue
and i got a chevrolet
she takes me home after work
don't ever miss a day
she don't care what i am
she don't care what i ain't
but she ain't no cheap pickup
'cause she just needs a couple coats of paint

i love my truck
it's right outside
i ain't got much luck
but i sure got a ride
it don't matter who lived
it don't matter who lied
i've got my truck right by my side
yeah

she don't care
if i don't work a lick
she'll start every time
if the choke don't stick
i know that she will never
never doubt me
cause she never leaves home without me

you see, i love my truck
it's right outside
i ain't got much luck
but i sure got a ride
it don't matter who lived
it don't matter who lied
i've got my truck right by my side
i got my truck right by my side, yeah
i've got my truck right by my side

yesterday, when i was young
the taste of life was sweet
like rain upon my tongue
i teased at life as if
it were a foolish game
the way an evening breeze
may tease a candle flame
the thousand dreams i dreamed
the splendid things i planned
i always built to last
on weak and shifting sand
i lived by night and shunned
the naked light of day
and only now i see
how the years have ran away
chorus...
yesterday, when i was young
there were so many songs
that waited to be sung
so many wild pleasures
lay in store for me
and so much pain
my dazzled eyes refused to see
i ran so fast that time
and youth at last ran out
i never stopped to think
what life was all about
and every conversation
that i can now recall
concerns itself with me
and nothing else at all
yesterday, the moon was blue
and every crazy day
brought something new to do
and i used my magic age
as if it were a wand
and never saw the waste
and emptiness beyond
the game of love i played
with arrogance and pride
and every flame i lit
so quickly, quickly died
the friends i made all seemed
somehow to drift away
and only i am left
on stage to end the play
repeat ..
there are so many songs in me
that won't be sung
i feel the bitter taste
of tears upon my tongue
and the time has come for me
to pay for yesterday
when i was young

let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
to the faults of those about me let me praise a little more
let me be when i am weary just a little bit more cheery
think a little more of others and a little less of me mhmm mhmm
let me be a little braver when temptation bits me waver
let me strive a little harder to be all that i should be
let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
let me think more of my neighbor and a little less of me mhmm mhmm
let me be when i am weary just a little bit more cheery
let me serve a little better those that i am striving for
let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
think a little more of others and a little less of me mhmm mhmm

every year when this day rolls around
i think of the night we first tore up the town
and i wonder if you're laughing with your eyes glowing
making pretty conversation with the wines flowing
i'm runnin' your place just like always
just like always
everyday at least one time
i look at your face in the back of my mind
when you're smiling at the ocean and your eyes shining
when your hair's a red river and it's all mine
for a thousand days just like always
maybe someday i really will forget
i'll really learn to live again, i'll live without regret
but funny, isn't it? this man ain't laughing yet
does love really last forever?
does the ocean love the sunset every time?
oh, i pass your street, i look both ways, so incomplete
and i think that i might see you but of course, i don't
and i wish that you would call me but i know you won't
and i love you anyway just like always
just like always
just like always
just like, just like, just like always

feeling low feeling blue
all the troubles come my way
but i just won't worry
i'll be lucky someday
my money's gone, ain't got no friends
more debts than i can face
but i just won't worry
i'll be lucky someday
let it rain, oh, let it pour
'cause it just can't get worst no way
and i know maybe soon
my luck will change someday
the gal i love done said goodbye
she went on her marryin' way
but i just won't worry
i'll be lucky someday
i'll be lucky someday
maybe i'll get lucky someday...

ran away from home when i was seventeen
to be with you on the california coast
drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
out on the california coast
don't think that i'm ungrateful
and don't look so morose
adios, adios
we never really made it baby
but we came pretty close
adios, adios
going up north where the hills are winter green
i got to leave you on the california coast
going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
than the california coast
our dreams of endless summers
were just too grandiose
adios, adios
and i'll miss the blood red sunset
but i'll miss you the most
adios, adios
adios, adios
adios, adios

if you see your brother standing by the road
with a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
and if you see your sister falling by the way
just stop and say you're goin' the wrong way
you've got to try a little kindness yes show a little kindness
yes shine your light for everyone to see
and if you'll try a little kindness and you'll overlook the blindness
of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets
don't walk around the down and out lend a helping hand instead of doubt
and the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way
you've got to try a little kindness...
you've got to try a little kindness...

have i lost your love or have i lost my mind?
am i seeing things or am i going blind?
do i hear you crying softly in your sleep?
am i all alone or is it only me?
is it my imagination every time?
is it jealousy that rules this heart of mine
has it come to pass or has it come to be?
am i all alone or is it only me?
or is it just a crazy phase that we're going through?
is it cold in here or is it you?
do i hear you crying softly in your sleep?
am i all alone or is it only me?
or is it just a crazy phase that we're going through?
is it cold in here or is it you?
do i hear you crying softly in your sleep?
am i all alone or is it only me?
am i all alone or is it only me?

i've tried and i've failed lord
i've won and i have lost
i've lived and i've loved, oh
such times, at such a cost
one thing i know
the world is good to me
a better place awaits you, you see
some days i'm so confused, lord
my past gets in my way
i need the ones that i love most
to hold me more each day
oooh, a better place

i see you just like the movies
i see your face
across a crowded room
and i have learned through
simple trial and error
not to speak too soon
your eyes just like a magnet
they're drawing my eyes around
and i can't hear one
word of conversation
i can't hear a sound
i see you looking at me
you see me looking at you

i don't wanna know your name
and i don't wanna play this game
where two lovers meet
and one lover parts in pain
i feel this urge to meet you
i feel this urge to run
repairing hearts so easily shattered
is never any fun
i see you looking at me
you see me looking at you

i don't wanna know your name
i don't wanna play this game
i don't wanna know your name
i don't wanna play this game
