we sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
we smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
we go through episodes too, like attack of the clones
work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
we commute to computers
spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
we're survivalists turned to consumers
just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
ask him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
i paint a picture with the pen like norman mailer
mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
i think about her struggle and i find the strength in myself
these words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the south
before my nigga cor' bailed me out
to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
we do or die like bed-stuy
through the red sky with the window of the red eye
let the lead fly, some g. rap shit, living to let die

this morning, i woke up
feelin' brand new, i jumped up
feelin' my highs and my lows
in my soul and my goals
just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
i've been thinkin' i've got my reasons
just to get by, just to get by
just to get by, just to get by
by, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
just to get by, just to get by
just to get by, just to get by
by, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
just to get by, just to get by
just to get by, hey, hey

we keepin' it gangster, say "fo' shizzle", "fo' sheezy", and stayin' crunk
it's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
yo, our activism, attackin' the system, the blacks and latins in prison
numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
i let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
your position is pivotal, i ain't bullshittin' you
now, why would i lie? just to get by?
just to get by, we get fly, the tv got us reachin' for stars
not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
saturday sinners, sunday morning at the feet of the father
they need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
all types of drug, when all you really need is love
to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
our parents sing like john lennon: imagine all the people watch
we rock like paul mccartney from now until the last beatle drop

this morning, i woke up
feelin' brand new, i jumped up
feelin' my highs and my lows
in my soul and my goals
just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
and i've been thinkin' i've got my reasons
just to get by, just to get by
just to get by, just to get by

yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
some people cry, and some people try
just to get by, for a piece of the pie
you love to eat and get high
we deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
when the people decide to keep a disguise
can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
but there's people you find
strong or feeble in mind, i stay readin' the signs
y-y-y-yo, yo, yo
some people cry, and some people try
just to get by, for a piece of the pie
you love to eat and get high
we deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
when the people decide to keep a disguise
can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
but there's people you find
strong or feeble in mind, i stay readin' the signs
y-y-y-yo, yo
(someone's feelin' it that's what's up.)

i rise as day breaks
clouds hide the sun’s rays
quick sand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it’s darkest before light
i’m gonna push through

turbo-charged bars
slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
touring with 7d coverage
live bands, two buses, my own cash
no budget, no major label fundings, jets baby
we went from crawling to walking to running
you can’t say nothing, you under gag order
hopping out of audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, i’m the transporter
think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
i’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'til they really see you tryna do something, i ain’t bluffing
kush puffing on you jive turkeys
stuffing stockings with these gifts
audible applaudables homie take a wiff

i rise as day breaks
clouds hide the sun’s rays
quick sand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it’s darkest before light
i’m gonna push through

when you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
my flow is tom-foolery
i smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
i beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
it’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
only way that you hang is attached to a tree
the moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
she makes it rain
when i’m on fire, she always try to douse me
only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
i see you from a mile away when it get overcast
old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like i broke the glass
and let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in tunisia
spread through sudan and egypt, this the music for the movement
the score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
it’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

i rise as day breaks
clouds hide the sun’s rays
quick sand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it’s darkest before light
i’m gonna push through

like kindergarteners
my vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
the starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
impede on your pockets then pee on ya
dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
spending, established, with women dining and laughing
but this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
your seatbelts twice, when i rolled them dice, i crapped
so many times i can build casinos from scratch
too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
that’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
i’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
i'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
i made a covenant that i was changing but my luck has been
quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
left him face down like he was planking
in a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
you can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
i'm focused

i rise as day breaks
clouds hide the sun’s rays
quick sand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it’s darkest before light
i’m gonna push through

another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
ms. hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

i wish i could talk to lauryn
i mean excuse me, ms. hill
and let her know how much we love her is real
the industry was beating her up
then those demons started eating her up
she need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
we used to kick it in the salad days
when she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
i nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
her songs still better than anything out than "hot" or "power" play
remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
then she went to rome to sing and tell the pope about herself
just after she left the fugees, started rolling with the marleys
got back with her crew at dave chapelle's block party
she made songs about zion and trying to be faithful
took black star on tour in europe, i was so grateful
speaking for myself but i'm sure i could speak for dante
i got to watch a show with nina simone and harry belafonte
we used to chill at nkiru, her moms was a customer
she used to love to buy the books by octavia butler
parable of the sower, the main character's name was lauren
what the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
i got concerned when she got sick on the road
she ain't healthy, i'm a brother
and i wish that i could pick up the load, but no

another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
ms. hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

got your assistant on the the phone, "i need to talk to lauryn"
and i wanna walk through the storm, and i could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
this relationship is strictly music like d'angelo
i know you hate babylon, and wanna see it fall
but they won't let you read your poem at the bet awards
you give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
they don't like what you got to say
but still they beg you to come, whoa
now that's powerful sis, it's black power
we get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
and no i ain't saying you christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
but you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
the raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
the devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
we used to read francis crest or anything
by third world press impressed
but what the power of the word suggest
hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
you gave birth to a new sound like donda west, yes
should i be saying all of this while the mic is on?
i might as well let it out because one day i might be gone
i write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
and you play it, cause i really ain't got the words to say it
but yo

another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
another night, slips away
in other words, i should say
there are no words, you should say
there are no words
ms. hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

i don't wanna waste your time baby
i just wanna make you come to me
comfortable baby, so come here darling
and come for me baby
i don't wanna waste a second, no girl
i just wanna make you come dance with me
come talk to me, come here darling
come here for me baby

why you so far away? you need to feel this
i've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
i've done dirt in the past, i know that love hurts
i'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
i can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
you get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
you on a higher vibration, that's why i fuck with you
left me provide for you, comfortable as a huxtable
your whole style is colder than minnesota
i love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
at the crib, i'm hopin' you come over
we can do it like common and mary and come closer
we can do it like barack and michelle, give me a fist bump
black magical, act radical with the fist up
do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
promise you i'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

i don't wanna waste your time baby
i just wanna make you come to me
comfortable baby, so come here darling
and come for me baby
i don't wanna waste a second, no girl
i just wanna make you come dance with me
come talk to me, come here darling
come here for me baby

like a spike lee movie, i'm movin' across the floor
feelin' love in the music, i'm using it like a lure
i love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure"
she rockefeller center like diego in the lobby
as valuable as the scream or a salvador dali
she popular with the thieves and wanna be thomas crown
some try to steal her attention as soon as i'm not around
this last bird probably flew the coop
blastin' outkast, last words: "ooh-dee-whoo"
i don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
je ne sais quoi... how you say, "voulez vous?"
pardon my french, with the tongue kissin' i'll make her come hither
'til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
i'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
but fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

i don't wanna waste your time baby
i just wanna make you come to me
comfortable baby, so come here darling
and come for me baby
i don't wanna waste a second, no girl
i just wanna make you come dance with me
come talk to me, come here darling
come here for me baby

hey you, hey you, hey you
yeah, i'm talkin' to you
hey you, hey you, hey you
yeah, i'm talkin' to you
simmer down for me
simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

black madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
while i manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
the promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
you the earth, that's emphatically "yes"
but i still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
naturally blessed, lady chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
i ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes"

i don't wanna waste your time baby
i just wanna make you come to me
comfortable baby, so come here darling
and come for me baby
i don't wanna waste a second, no girl
i just wanna make you come dance with me
come talk to me, come here darling
come here for me baby

i know there's a first time for everything
first time i let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
that we weathering together and
this the first time that i've ever considered wedding rings
but first things first yo
i met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like i followed the star
there she is shorty bi coastal
thick like bifocals, stacked like 2pac vocals her body so loco
jewel of the nile so i'm romancing the stone
the rhythm is to the words and i watched her dance to my poems
the way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
i pictured it like paris hilton when she answered the phone, yo
dancing alone because she extra fly
but i got good look so i catch her eye
gave the rest a try now give the best a try
leave your nest and i'll fly make you testify
damn baby i know we got some haters and

i don't care what people say
as long as you and me okay
because i never been in love before
see i used to be a player and
all of this is new to me
and this ain't what i'm used to seeing
because i never been in love before

you running back to the kid like this was home base
or a marathon i let you set your own pace
your own space and the beautiful struggle
now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that i love you
when i'm gone you be missing me too
it let me know that my prayers is the music god be listening to
don't get it confused i'm trying to get religious with you
i never thought i feel like this its like a miracle you
you you stole my heart like a crook in love
crossing the bridge to the brooklyn love
when i took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
your love is drugs and i'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
we go to the spot and you still get it low
i get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
till the walls come tumbling down like jericho
and you hear the sound is stereo
here we go

i don't care what people say
as long as you and me okay
because i never been in love before
see i used to be a player and
all of this is new to me
and this ain't what i'm used to seeing
because i never been in love before

you looked good when i tried you on
so i had to write a song
use to be the guy that always made her cry when i'm gone
always kept a stable and i never spent a night alone
no cable or no hard line phone why
i'm never home scared of commitment
ready to forever roam
we at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
from now to r.i.p. proceeds my name up on the headstone
leave her be for five minutes
dudes try to dive in it first
they want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
i tell them do you i don't care who she speaking with
because i already know she made it clear who she leaving with
and it feels so beautiful
put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
plus you ain't no groupie ho
sitting in the studio
before we do this though there something that you should know

i know we got some haters and
i don't care what people say
as long as you and me okay
because i never been in love before
see i used to be a player and
all of this is new to me
and this ain't what i'm used to seeing
because i never been in love before
i know we got some haters and
i don't care what people say
as long as you and me okay
because i never been in love before

because i never been in love before
i know we got some haters and
i don't care what people say
as long as you and me okay
because i never been in love before
see i used to be a player and
all of this is new to me
and this ain't what i'm used to seeing
because i never been in love before

(we must love and support each other!)
we have nothing to lose but our chains
(we have nothing to lose but our chains!)
now you say that shit so loud, them motherfuckers outside hear you
it is our duty to fight for our freedom!
(it is our duty to fight for our freedom!)
it is our duty to win (it is our duty to win!)
we must love and support each other
(we must love and support each other!)
we have nothing to lose (we have nothing to lose!)
we have nothing to lose (we have nothing to lose!)
we have nothing to lose (we have nothing to lose!)
but our chains (but our chains!)

send this one out to
to the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
to the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
we send this one out to
to the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
to the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
this is happening to all of us

yeah, if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
my name is prominent for entertainment that's laced with consciousness
but really it's just common sense like lonnie lynn
you don't need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like it's an oculus
the common myth that we're savages with no history or accomplishments
or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us
considering the prediction of economists, machines will do our jobs for us
the future for the working class is ominous
they got us indoctrinated through a bitch's brew, a religion mixed in with abuse
emotional we sit in pews, it's physical, we get the noose
and hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves, refuse to change ourselves
when i talk about our past it doesn't ring a bell
they make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
they'll take you from your family, your kids will never respect ya
attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
we start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor, yes
every problem can't be solved at the ballot box
we unifying africa like gaddafi, that's what got malcolm shot
they out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
on the balcony like martin luther king, i been to the mountaintop
the blue wall of silence, it's really the blue wall of violence
the good cops who retire and get fired
they screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
'til the cops roll up in their swat gear

i tarried through the turbulent month of ramadan
sweating all through the night just like the holy prophet
then reappeared on the stage in bk with the ummah
shoulder to shoulder with j. cole and kweli
just before jehovah the god crowned me the king with his goldie locket
alhamdulillah, we've come really far, ain't it?
the little engine who could, could power any car can't it?
the mothers in chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
the cries of the despised was heard flying out of ferguson
the last days and times, the holy quran and bible
we on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying
outside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind
or so it seems, years after noah was told he would row upstream
the heavens bursted and the rains came
retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
i hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
in a worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
no intervention
policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
the police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
officer friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
shit was all bad just a week ago
the view was just as sad just a peep ago
the cries of the asiatic ancient-semitic peoples
that propel jay elec from the pedestal to the steeple

to the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
to the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
we send this one out to
to the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
to the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
this is happening to all of us
to the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
to the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
we send this one out to
to the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
to the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
all of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
this is happening to all of us

we've got to live
live to the end (we gotta do, we do)
we've got to live (for our grandmothers)
live to the end (and granddaddies too)
we've got to live (live for the babies)
live to the end (my brothers out there going crazy)

you left me
yes! welcome to the wonderful sounds of talib kweli
left me in a low
ladies...

i got you in the mood (yeah), for a interlude
raw like in the nude, i hope this ain't considered rude
but let's stop talking, 'cause it's feelin like an interview
i know you're into me, so, let me get into you
i'm always in the mood for laughing and loving
and rapping and fucking
and passing the dutch and relaxing and puffing
and hitting and ducking the ripping production
these kittens ain't muffins just because we stuff 'em in the oven
my words is dripping off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
ill the way i lay down the rap, they can't handle it
cats all sappy like romantic flicks
dude, get a clue, like colonel mustard in the study with a candlestick
they holding hands with these dudes like they going steady, but
one glimpse, and i know they ready—you already know
slipped her a note like, "you ready to go?"
we make a getaway plan, and we head for the door, let's go

i wear the night like a cloak cause i move with the stars (c'mon)
navigate through the truly bizarre
who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
and if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
i wear the night like a cloak 'cause i move with the stars (y-y-yeah, yeah)

the only producer that feel like, "fuck rappers!"
only backpacker with a chip like hackers
only michael richardson, only much blacker
so if he say nigga, then i'ma say...
is this a ritz? carlton? dress like, fresh, like
just like, i'm the shit (in the mood)
ugh! you ain't figured out what i'm about yet
always rockin that "this-ain't-out-yet"
but this ain't 'bout that
from a city where niggas plug like outlets
far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets
so, when i go out, niggas always out to get me in the studio
and i ain't in the mood to flow
i'm with my girl, and i'm tryin to hit the movies, yo
and they tryna act stupid—oh!
in the club with silicon suzie
what happened to real girls, like rudy?
with real titties like tootie
this girl got a silicon booty!
and got the nerve to act moody!
now, i ain't tryna judge like judy
but bitch, you a man, you can't fool me!
act like 50—throw her in a pool, g!

i wear the night like a cloak 'cause i move with the stars (yeah)
navigate through the truly bizarre (uh-uh uh, uh)
who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
and if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
i wear the night like a cloak cause i move with the stars
navigate through the truly bizarre
who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
and if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

d-d-d-d-d-d-nn-wha!
d-d-d-d-d-d-nn-wha!

bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
'cause see, they wanna breed cursing for the things that don't come
the speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
christmastime choice for what? no, we keepin our guns
smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
you ain't got shit to do like friday when the weekend begun
completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
i spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
i'm in the mood like donte and main flow
never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
it's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
that's a facade like i'm somewhere over the rainbow
really these cats sweeter than mangoes, mr bojangles-ass dudes
dancin around the club, doin the tango
go hard like iverson playin with hurt ankles
plus, wrestle the topic from a different kurt angle!

i wear the night like a cloak cause i move with the stars
navigate through the truly bizarre
who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
and if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
i wear the night like a cloak cause i move with the stars
navigate through the truly bizarre
who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
and if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

wow, that's a nice track!

ayo, fed—whassup, bro?
whassup with me? you know what's up with me, man
i'm trying to get paid in full
check this out, right
since javotti is the label
and i'm talking over this def beat right here
i think we should turn it up
we got my man (tr-tr-trend on the beat)

thinking of the master plan
where there’s nothing but cash inside my hand
wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
i dig deeper, you know i represent, represent
yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
my bandz will make you dance, i'm forever like a wedding ring
far above the hate and, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
trying to get away from the 85ers like evelyn
ride with me, i got ‘em leaking like nene
got ‘em leaking like wiki, these monkeys biting like hickeys
cause they’re seeing what i’m doing, filling them with confusion
cutting just like a truant, i’m fluent just like a student
of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
my meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
the crib’s outrageous like really it's no joke
the girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud

turn it up loud, turn it up loud
turn it up loud, turn it up loud
drop it, stop it
with all the soap operas and the soap boxes
turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

you can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
run it down like a zebra, i move with the speed of cheetahs
i’m from brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
i ain’t asking for no followers, i'm looking for new leaders
is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
been hard since i started reading, alliteration is literally littered
through my dna swimming all through my semen
so every time i bust, babies begin being born
talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked get
drawn like a picture, picture a perfect painting
police profiling people peacefully praying
lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
on my grind getting guap, guess green is the new black
meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
hopped out the car, you know who blew that loud


ayo we drink good, smoke good
these cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
i come in looking quite clean in the loafers
so hood might scheme up to no good
you no crook, gosling in the notebook
i got the birds on the wire like i know i wood
i still rep p.o.c.s like i'm supposed to
coming live from death row like i know suge
my rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
i’m in the ring, so lean i need a foam cup
i ain't lying, bare teeth so ferocious
maybe i’m lying bare feet in the ocean
on the beach fall asleep and i'm floating
to the beat so unique like a potion
i love music, i’m complete in my devotion
(word, say it again)
i’m complete in my devotion

my mama said life would be this hard
growing up days as a black girl scarred
in every way, still, you've come so far
they just know the name, they don't know the pain
so please hold your heads up high
don't be ashamed of yourself, know i
will carry it forth till the day i die
they just know the name they don't know the pain, black girl

i do it for the people, i do it for the love
i do it for the poet, i do it for the thug
this is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
i do it for my mother, i do it for my daughter
promise i'll always love ya, i love to kiss and hug ya
you and your brother should be looking out for one another
i'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason i got up
somebody put his hands on you i'm getting locked up
i'm not playing, that's the prayer i'm saying for diani
and if i die then she'll be protected by amani
that's her bigger brother and i love the way he love her
she a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
but she a gemini, so stay on her friendly side
she'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
my pretty black princess smell sweet like that incense
that you buy at the bookstore supporting black business
teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
she four reading cornrows by camille yarborough
i keep her hair braided, bought her a black barbie
i keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
this is for aisha, this is for kashera
this is for khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
i see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
she got a black girl name, she living black girl pain
this is for makeba, and for my mamacita
what's really good ma, i'll be your promise-keeper
i see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
she got a black girl name, she live in black girl pain

mama said life would be this hard
growing up days as a black girl scarred
in every way, still, we've come so far
they just know the name they don't know the pain
so please hold your heads up high
don't be ashamed of yourself, know i
will carry it forth till the day i die
'cause they just know the name they don't know the pain, black girl

this is for beatrice bertha benjamin who gave birth to tsidi azeeda
for lavender hill, for khayelitsha
athlone mitchell's plain, swazi girls i'm repping for thee
manenberg, gugulethu; where you'd just be blessed to get through
for beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
from the top of the cable car at table mountain; i am you
girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
for cape coloured for realizing we're african
for all my cousins back home, the strength of mommy's backbone
the length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
the pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
for rubber pellet scars on auntie elna's back, i march
fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory
for mauritius, st. helena; my blood is a million stories
winnie for joan and for eadie, for norma, leslie, ndidi
for auntie betty, for melanie; all the same family
fiona, jo burg, complex of mixed girls
for surviving through every lie they put into us now
this world's yours, and i swear i will stand focused
black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

mama said life would be this hard
growing up days as a black girl scarred
in every way, still, we've come so far
they just know the name they don't know the pain
so please hold your heads up high
don't be ashamed of yourself, know i
will carry it forth till the day i die
'cause they just know the name they don't know the pain, black girl
momma said they'll be days like this...

this is a tear jerker

the revolution's here
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh
no one can change your ways
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh

yo, i heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
but in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
otherwise it just expires and spoils
and these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
cause the fire boils inside
you go to church to find you some religion
and all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
you try to vote and participate in the government
and the muh'fuckin' democrats is actin' like republicans
you join a organization that know black history
but ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
the revolution's here, the revolution is personal
they call me the political rapper
even after i tell 'em i don't fuck with politics
i don't even follow it
i'm on some krs, ice cube, chris wallace shit
main source, de la soul, bumpin' "2pacalypse now"

the revolution's here
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh
no one can change your ways
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh

yo, i speak at schools a lot cause they say i'm intelligent
no, it's cause i'm dope, if i was whack i'd be irrelevant
i'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
you leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
but the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like donny hathaway
you have to pray, on top of that, act today
cause opportunity shrivel away like tom hanks in "cast away"
everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (you'll try to change the world)
you fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
in the gutter, mothers cry 'til the lord be livin' by the sword and
all that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
the same reason reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
the same reason i always rock dog chains on my babies
the struggle is beautiful, i'm too strong for your slavery

the revolution's here
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh
no one can change your ways
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh
the revolution's here
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh
no one can change your ways
no one can lead you off your path
you'll try to change the world
so please excuse me while i laugh

it's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
right now g
yo, i'm rockin' with my man hi-tek on the track right now
we fightin' the good fight
the beautiful struggle
yeah, let's go
(so please excuse me while i laugh)

from the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
from the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
in a state of grace
where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
so the selling never safe
at the same time snitching to the jake
is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
but the problem we face seems so great
that we can't escape so we accept our fate
so the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
if an artist is a part of a community
and got an opportunity to get that cake
would never come back to the hood, no immunity
usually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake
nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
if you ain't using all the talents god provided you with
for the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
look into the face of a young girl
raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
got game listening to her mother's pearls
and she love beyonce cause she run the world
her mama used to run this city
way back before the nigga puff was diddy
when it came to the music then she got real picky
from new york, but preferred 2pac over biggie
no disrespect to ms. wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
and she felt that pac was more lyrical
plus she never went to college
but she called herself 'earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
she god in the physical
and it's only natural to pray for a little you
musical so she played the umbilical chords
so her daughter was born it was a miracle
music is the light when it's dark
and the way that you spit your dart is a big part
she grew up loving hip hop
now all her daughter got is "love & hip hop"
nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
getting in the fights at reunions
she used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
no desire for the lying and the violence
that's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
her body is politics
lost count of how many whores she was called today
she won't do it no more, lost all her faith
they say she exaggerate when she hollerate
but it's only so much she can tolerate

help me find my way to a state of grace
stir my heart, touch my soul
feed me freedom sounds you made
help me find my way to a state of grace
lift me up with your weight
pull me to the grace

she wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
her entire graduation was a dire situation
did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
but no longer felt a part of the conversation
used to be i'm a ''ride or die'' chick
b.i.g. with the ''me and my bitch''
no objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit
she ain't never been a bitch or a ho
but she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
she used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
but she felt like she really ain't belong
when she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
she erased all her songs from the phone
you are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
you can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
she tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
and the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
and this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
i know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
but she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
she on d'angelo pandora station playing that voodoo, who knew?


in the face of hate
she'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
i see lyrics as colors and shapes
put it on tape, let her know i could relate
when you wish you could switch the way that you look
and your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
when you got no faith
when you hate yourself, when you hate your race
let's get to the core
our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
she a bitch, she a whore
and you rich and you shit on the poor
in all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
why should i support music that constantly disrespects me?
and make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
with the charge of repping it correctly
when it's free online or in a cloud
ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
you wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
and it's clear that your sales going down
down by law then you found the raw
on a message board and you sounding off
these niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
no wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
rhyming is a memory
the assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
running through you like fast food -  big mac's
you don't want no problems, fix that
all the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
now you ain't never gon' get back


she don't love it, no
she don't love it no more

yeah
yeah! that's what i'm talkin about!
let's do it... kanye west, c'mon turn me up and
black thought, c'mon turn me up and
pharoahe monch, c'mon turn me up and

nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
and ya crew, give me dap like true dat

yo, i hit these emcees with the grip of death like i was a vulcan
ain't a lot of "ifs" an "ands", it's just straight talkin'
it's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
bitin' off more than you can chew, create orphans
emcee species endangered like dolphins
rappers is spittin' nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
hear come the dundee moves rocket-launchin' (yeah)
black thought, quit playin' him close and back up off him

kweli -- spruce to the tree, bruce to the lee
the real emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
one by one i knock 'em out like schoolly d - my rhymes is eulogy
a flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin' me
i black and blue emcees - actin' new to me, get smacked stupidly
they lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
still my rhymes hurt like ali to fraiz'
step off the stage to shouts of "kweli boomayyay!!"

see these four emcees came to get down
rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
nigga you, got ta, understand the plot ta
movin' and groovin' and always improvin' alot-ta
i'll outfox the average porsche boxster talk
break the bank on some old frank sinatra (new york...)
slash chi-town, slash philly
check the blast from geneva, you can get slapped silly

guerrilla monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
and ya crew, give me dap like true dat
we come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
and ya crew, give me dap like true dat

okay... my sound drenches, each of the five senses
and hold the shock value of electrified fences
it's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
i'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
got a crib with a grammy and a gat on the shelf
nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
and me and kweli on a mission, gettin' pharoahe for help

from natives walkin' the trail of tears to players sippin' belvedere
we always comin' well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin' fear
plus, even my niggas from the bay, they say you hella scared
truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
your style - under-developed there, hell if i care
what hardship you claim to see, but i can tell by your stare
nigga you fugazi, sayin' ya crew blazin'
like sayin' miss cleo is a true jamaican, we makin'

guerrilla monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
when i attack your city, y'all gon' think dr. doom did it
spit it like white trash in seed-spittin' contests
with a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to congress
i'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
words of the thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
unless, you wanna be leg and armless
that's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats

guerrilla monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
and ya crew, give me dap like true dat
we come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
and ya crew, give me dap like true dat

ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
we tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
precious metals round our necks and arms
we tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
we tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
precious metals round our necks and arms
we tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods

whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
my hood is the ghetto
even when you look it's never what you see
my hood is the ghetto
i've been down before up is just a reach
cause my hood is the ghetto
catch a second wind then begin again
my hood is the ghetto

black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
what's real is the estate of mind that we're in
the situation feels great
my man peels weight, so he can fill plates
you might get love but you still feel hate
with gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
chicago to brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

if lyrics sold, then truth be told
i'd probably be just as rich and famous as jay-z
truthfully i wanna rhyme like common sense
next best thing i do a record with common sense
cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
soul, rock and roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
it's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
we got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor
i know you know what i'm talking about
from new york to the south, take off your shoes when you walk in the house

whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
my hood is the ghetto
even when you look it's never what you see
my hood is the ghetto
i've been down before up is just a reach
cause my hood is the ghetto
catch a second wind then begin again
my hood is the ghetto

yo, i grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
and sell paintings of aaliyah, b.i.g. and pac up in the barbershop
buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
but rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
i feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
and always keep my ears to the block till i dearly depart
hip-hop is really the art
we have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
it ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
they want them dead presidents like stic.man and mutulu
with a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
kicks is a hundred or more

a man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
i told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
niggas is thirsty i heard it's a drought
up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
either get by or get god, but you try to get by
it's like the block keep blockin'
you try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
these shorties in the court, need cochran yea
i tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
no time for feet watchin', me and kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
my hood is the ghetto
even when you look it's never what you see
my hood is the ghetto
i've been down before up is just a reach
cause my hood is the ghetto
catch a second wind then begin again
my hood is the ghetto
whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
my hood is the ghetto
even when you look it's never what you see
my hood is the ghetto
i've been down before up is just a reach
cause my hood is the ghetto
catch a second wind then begin again
my hood is the ghetto

i exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
it’s sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
when there's no power it go sour
i seen 'em crossing a bridge by the masses,
covered in the ashes of both towers
native new yorker the way that we talk
make him an offer that you can't refuse
come back later on after you thought it over
look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
to pop ya, daughters paying for the sins of the god father
popular music got ‘em confusing killers and artists
i kill it the hardest. competition dearly departed
they feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage
i'm making 'em throw it up. you just making the people vomit
when it comes to this rhymin' i’m a legend like tutankhamun,
or the chupacabra, the way i weave it together and tie the knot up
made a macramé of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of
the amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
throw it back, cognac, i'm the best, you know that
you can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
on track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
viciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder
some symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,
getting better. drop a pearl every jam like eddie vedder
very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
who never see their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
they got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
they take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up
i raise the bar and the waiters up
all this hate is just confused unadulterated love
the eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
advocate for artists, regardless cause i got faith in us
for the workers who don’t get paid enough
take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
as far as they’re concerned food on the table's the only way to love
it takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up
raise it up, raise it up,raise it up, take it up, take it up

yeah
yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
this nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects

the clique that i oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
you're the place you're supposed to be
you ain't ain't comin' close to me
it ain't that you underrated
it's more that you're under dated
and mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
for all your guest appearances
you couldn't get the clearances
for them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
look at what ya lyrics is, murder, death, kill
but you never shot nothin', never have, never will
better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

in the beginnin', god created man in his own image
i'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
na'mean - you all can get it, i'm conisdered the nicest
the way i spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
all day talkin' that shit like, "you hold a gat, right?"
the trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
you got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
you ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
you ballas need to quit rhymin' like allen ive
start speakin' nuwaubian and followin' malachi
or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
all these thug niggas wanna rap
and all these rap niggas wanna thug
and all ya'll fuckin' the game up
it's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
askin' if i'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
i'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya saviour
you wack nigga, you about to get shot

"niggas is tellin' me about this illuminati shit while i'm in jail - that's another way to keep your self-esteem low, that's another way to keep you unconfident. and i'm putting the 'k' cause i'm killing that illuminati shit. trust me. these motherfuckers wanted to kill you, why the fuck they gonna tell farrakhan, why they gonna tell the nation of islam, why they gonna tell this nigga in jail about the plan? how did he know? how'd it leak to him? who told him? who told him, the pope? who? cause they like, 'the pope' and 'the money', aw c'mon man, get the fuck outta here."

scared of a motherfuckin' secret, society
and only bein' with people you agree with, you scared of a
chalice, scared of death, only thing worse is your silence
illuminati's enlightened, the owl see in the darkness
masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
egyptologist and scholars, symbologists at the college
will all acknowledge that ancient kemet is where it started
way farther back than the knights or the rite of the scottish
you need to wake up, no new bugatti (yes)
my enemy tryna stop me
but i don't stand a chance if i can't identify 'em properly
illuminati as we know it started in bavaria
years before it landed on the shores of america
the mission: abolishment of government and religion
they were enemys of the state, and they was hated by the christians
they was poets, they was scholars, early illuminati was
sorta like the students in victor hugo's les miserables
the modern day politicians would diss 'em, turning them into martyrs
this in turn inspired the founding fathers
the vast majority masons who were the subject of the illuminati
found this fascination the order was insipiration (keep it goin')
and ain't no disrespect to the masons
but you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
only those in league with satan need to hide infomation
that's how you catch a ride to your final destination
where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
when the facts are intact, ain't no need for a fable
good versus evil is primitive
real life's more complex, what's your context?
they put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
they honouring columbia the children of the colonists
you can trace it back to the root trace it back again
it's really just another case of stealin' from the african
racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
you property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
population control is real (word), you know the deal but still
perpetuate the cycle of violence, we known to hold the steel
no, i don't need no fuckin' chorus
used to read so many books, thought i was a hoarder down at borders
like behold the pale horse or the new world order
but you really don't know what you reading if you really don't know the author
a lot of satan worship is just government propaganda
unsubstantiated lies with no proof: a bunch of slander
of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
the truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
the devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
what they doing so sinister, worse than any blood sacrifice
you can imagine, iller than any cinema
the federal reserve, the world bank and the imf
helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
they want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
obey thy consumer make a product out of man
where's the conspiracy? it's always been the plan
y'all niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
taxes, it ain't the illuminati that worry me
lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
i'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
same reason that they called bradley manning a turncoat

(man, we supposed to be brothas!)
oh what you tryna get smart?
nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
take that shit off
(beeping)
oh you got a pager too huh?
you a balla huh? you a balla huh?
gimme that muthafuckin' shit
better me than the muthafuckin cops nigga

yeah
new talib kweli
you know what it is
c'mon

i try, i try
i try, you know i try
i try, i try
i try (k. west, kweli), you know i try

get searched on the plane, arabic first name
disturbed by the fame just like kurt cobain
breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
you flirt 'til she came
nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
something to take in vain like the lord's name
put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

i try, i try
i try, you know i try
i try, i try
i try, you know i try (yo)

it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
more metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
i try to navigate the treacherous waters of
america's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
but there's more of us (yeah)
although we speak in different languages
we all pretty familiar with what anger is
young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
get up on some gangsta shit
guns to bang ya wit'
and we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
our growing pains get way deeper than mike seaver's
our uniforms is white sneakers and white t-shirts
on top of wife beaters
we like to light reefers
the 'hood need us, but rappers just ain't the right leaders
i put a lot into it
this is my product and i gotta move it
stop the industry, but you can't stop the music

an upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
so many sufferin' 'cause deep inside they're scared (so scared)
fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
where would they be if you and i don't care?

i try
i try, you know i try
i try, i try
i try, you know i try (yo)

the things i'm seein' on the news is insane
a stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front the train
a mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
two years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
tryin' to bring your struggle to life
the label want a song about a bubbly life
i have trouble tryin' to write some shit to bang in the club through the night
when people suffer tonight
lord knows i try

i try, i try
i try, you know i try
i try, i try
i try, you know i try

life is a beautiful struggle
people search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle
come on, say it now
life is a beautiful struggle
people search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
some people put it all together, yeah

i try
i try, you know i try

every day, i, i—
la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
upside down kingdom

se voce quiser, pode chegar, pode dancar
ohhhhhhhh

last night i had a dream that was so real
i woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
i stared into the face of an angel
tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
walkin by, i thought i was sly
offered to try, at first i thought she was shy
'til i saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
she ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... her body flyer than a jet pilot
what a smile and the eyes like wet violets
they flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
keep it tight, eva mendes in the other guys
got me in another zone - they call her sunshine like
"put your mother on the phone, i ain't comin home"
put a deposit on a place in her heart
all along she a place from the start
my favela love, man i fell in love, man i fell in love
man i fell in love, man i fell in love
man i, man i fell in love
man i, man i, uh

ehhhh, a gente é desse jeito mesmo é diferente
ehhhh, é brasileiro é swingueiro, é coração
ehhhh, a gente é que bota fé na vida pode cre
tamo ai para viver para encarar
(ehhh) a vida pro que der e vier
é nois que tá na fita agora pode crê
brasil crescendo a gente tá ai para aparecer
se voce quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
a gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
objectividade na vontade de crescer

a feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
my freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
my adversaries speak i'll of my name, i'm so sick
attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
everything fall into place, it's gravitational
profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
healthy relationship make your other ones better
i'm lee scratch perry, they call me the upsetter
for the cheddar get the bread up
mr. international call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
i wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
you're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
from a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
how you tired, i stay wired like i was offered a line


uh, uh
i don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
you're listenin to voodoo, i call it the black magic
you jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
it might blow up but it won't go pop
"pow!" that's the sound like onomatopoeia
got me floatin when you (rockin my boat) like you aaliyah
got them african features like people out in bahia
mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a european
when i leave i'm gonna miss you, (official) like kardinal
trust i'll come back and i'll visit for carni-val
when i come back around, take me out on the town
and you can show me how you put it down

june 11, 2001. timothy mcveigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. goodness prevails over evil, it seems. somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. little do we know

today the paper say timothy mcveigh's in hell
so everything's okay and all must be well
i remember oklahoma when they put out the blaze
and put islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
it's like saying only gays get aids, propaganda
like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
wrong! it's just the beginning, the first inning
battle for america's soul, the devil's winning
the president is bush, the vice president's a dick
so a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
they don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
that's why we don't be fucking with politics
they bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
it's all good except for that, we still poor
money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride

august 4, 2001. a drunken police officer mows down an entire family in brooklyn. the judge lets him go with no bail. it reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. i struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
they make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
target the gangs and graffiti with the prop 21
i already know the deal, but what the fuck do i tell my son?
i want him living right, living good, respect the rules
he's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
how do i break the news that when he gets some size
he'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
it's in they job description to terminate the threat
so 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
the precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
i know i'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (damn!)
fuck the pigs! i think the pigs killed big and 'pac too
if they didn't they know who did, they got to!
who they serve and protect, nigga not you
cops shot off of ten g's, but they got glocks too
let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
they be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
kurt loder asked me what i say to a dead cop's wife
cops kill my people everyday, that's life

we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride

september 11, 2001. terrorists attack the pentagon and the world trade center kills thousands and permanently scars america's false sense of security. we see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. as firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. the world will never be the same again

my heart go out to everybody at ground zero
red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
it's more complicated than black and white
to give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
but it's hard for me to walk down the block
seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
people broken down from years of oppression
become patriots when they way of life is threatened
it's a hard conversation to have
we lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
damn, when did shit get this bad?
america kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
damn! welcome to the world, we here
we've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
we got to face what lies ahead
fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
we survive, it's more than pride
we stay alive, ready to ride
