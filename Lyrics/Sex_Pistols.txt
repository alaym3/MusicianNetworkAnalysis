it was on the good ship venus
by christ, you should have seen us
the figurehead was a whore in bed
and the mast, a mammoth penis
the captain of this lugger
he was a dirty bugger
he wasn't fit to shovel shit
from one place to another

frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do

captain's name was morgan
by christ, he was a gorgon
ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
with his fucking organ
the first mate's name was cooper
by christ, he was a trooper
he jerked and jerked until he worked
himself into a stupor

frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do

the second mate was andy
by christ, he had a dandy
till they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
for cumming in the brandy
the cabin boy was flipper
he was a fucking nipper
he stuffed his ass with broken glass
and circumcised the skipper

frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do

the captain's wife was mabel
to fuck, she wasn't able
so the dirty shits, they nailed her tits
across the barroom table
the captain had a daughter
who fell in deep sea water
and by her squeals we knew the eels
had found her sexual quarters

frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
frigging in the rigging
there was fuck all else to do

people said we couldn't play
they called us foul-mouthed yobs
but the only notes that really count
are the ones that come in wads
they all drowned when the air turned blue
cause we didn't give a toss
filthy lucre, isn't nothing new
but we all get cash from the chaos

the time is right to do it now
the greatest rock and roll swindle
the time is right to do it now

e.m.i. said you are out of hand
and they gave us the boot
but they couldn't sack us, just like that
without giving us the loot
thank you kindly a & m
they said we were out of bounds
but that isn't bad for two weeks work
and 75,000 pounds
 

i just want to play with my band
are you good enough for me
hiya boys i'm the chosen one
can't you fucking see
i'm a jealous god and i want everything
and i love you with a knife
i'll take you, if you're ready for me
and i'll give you my life


the time is right for nickey's special
the greatest rock and roll star
the time is right for me now
i kill
elvis presley died in 1959
chuck berry you're a big ugly fucker
ian dury cockney fraud
mick jagger white nigga
bob dylan got a parking ticket stuck to his arsehole
david bowie you are a bloody cunt
malcolm mc
rod stewart‘s got a luggage label tied to his tonsils
elton john hair transplant
sid vicious rock and roll cliché
paul cook bare bones
johnny rotten-ah his days are even numbered
rock and roll swindle
swindle
it's a swindle!

and now, the end is near
and so i face the final curtain
you cunt, i'm not a queer
i'll state my case of which i'm certain
i've lived a life that's full
and each and every highway
and that, much more than this
i did it my way
regrets i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
i saw it through without exemption
i've planned each charted course
each careful step along the highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way
there were times
i'm sure you knew
when there was fuck, fuck
fuck all else to do
but through it all
when there was doubt
i shot it up or kicked it out
i faced 'em all and the world
and did it my way
i've loved and been a snide
i've had my fill, uh
my share of losing
and now the tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think, i killed a cat
and might i say
not in the die way
oh no, oh no, not me
i did it my way
for what is a brat
what has he got
when he wears hats
and he cannot
say the things he truly feels
but only the words
of one who kneels
the record shows
i fucked no bloke
and did it my way

right
here we go now

a bit of neurology
a bit of fuck-ology
