she may be the face i can't forget
a trace of pleasure or regret
may be my treasure or the price i have to pay
she may be the song that summer sings
may be the chill that autumn brings
may be a hundred different things
within the measure of a day

she may be the beauty or the beast
may be the famine or the feast
may turn each day into a heaven or a hell
she may be the mirror of my dreams
a smile reflected in a stream
she may not be what she may seem
inside her shell


she who always seems so happy in a crowd
whose eyes can be so private and so proud
no one's allowed to see them when they cry
she may be the love that cannot hope to last
may come to me from shadows of the past
that i'll remember till the day i die
she may be the reason i survive
the why and wherefore i'm alive
the one i'll care for through the rough and ready years
me, i'll take her laughter and her tears
and make them all my souvenirs
for where she goes i've got to be
the meaning of my life is she

she
oh, she 

oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl
and with the way you look, i understand that you are not impressed
but i heard you let that little friend of mine
take off your party dress
i'm not going to get too sentimental
like those other sticky valentines
'cause i don't know if you were loving somebody
i only know it isn't mine

alison, i know this world is killing you
oh, alison, my aim is true

well, i see you've got a husband now
did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?
you used to hold him right in your hand
i'll bet he took all he could take
sometimes, i wish that i could stop you from talking
when i hear the silly things that you say
i think somebody better put out the big light
'cause i can't stand to see you this way

alison, i know this world is killing you
oh, alison, my aim is true
my aim is true 

i've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks
listening to the muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
she said that's that, i don't wanna chitter-chat
turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat

pump it up when you don't really need it
pump it up until you can feel it

down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent
listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
there's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand

pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you don't really need it
hey!

she's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
you wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her
all the things you bought for her, could not get a temperature
pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you don't really need it

out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
you put your passion out under the pressure pin
fall into submission, hit-and-run transmission
no use wishing now for any other sin

pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you don't really need it
pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you don't really need it
pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you don't really need it
don't really need it
don't really need it
don't really need it 

oh, my baby, baby
i love you more than i can tell
i don't think i can live without you
and i know that i never will
oh, my baby, baby
i want you so it scares me to death
i can't say anymore than "i love you"
everything else is a waste of breath

i want you
you've had your fun, you don't get well no more
i want you
your fingernails go dragging down the wall
be careful, darling, you might fall

i want you
i woke up, and one of us was crying
i want you
you said, "young man, i do believe you're dying"
i want you
if you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
i want you
you can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
i want you
did you mean to tell me but seem to forget?
i want you
since when were you so generous and inarticulate?
i want you
it's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
it's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
i want you
it's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
it's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing

i want you
he tossed some tatty compliment your way
i want you
and you were fool enough to love it when he said
"i want you"

i want you
the truth can't hurt you, it's just like the dark
it scares you witless, but in time you see things clear and stark
i want you
go on and hurt me, then we'll let it drop
i want you
i'm afraid i won't know where to stop
i want you
i'm not ashamed to say i cried for you
i want you
i want to know the things you did that we do too
i want you
i want to hear he pleases you more than i do
i want you
i might as well be useless for all it means to you
i want you
did you call his name out as he held you down?
i want you
oh no, my darling, not with that clown
i want you
i want you
you've had your fun, you don't get well no more
i want you
no-one who wants you could want you more

i want you
i want you
i want you
every night when i go off to bed and when i wake up
i want you
i'm going to say it once again till i instill it
i know i'm going, going, to feel this way until you kill it
i want you
i want you
i want you 

nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
ooh, he's so cute
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

long shot at that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close-up of the sign that says, 'we never close'
he snatched at you and you match his cigarette
she pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
ooh, he's so cute
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
you think you're alone until you realize you're in it
now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window; i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst
about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute, it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

watching the detectives
watching the detectives
 

i was tuning in the shine on the light night dial
doing anything my radio advised
with every one of those late night stations
playing songs bringing tears to my eyes
i was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver
when the switch broke 'cause it's old
they're saying things that i can hardly believe
they really think we're getting out of control

radio is a sound salvation
radio is cleaning up the nation
they say you better listen to the voice of reason
but they don't give you any choice
'cause they think that it's treason
so you had better do as you are told
you better listen to the radio

i wanna bite the hand that feeds me
i wanna bite that hand so badly
i want to make them wish they'd never seen me

some of my friends sit around every evening
and they worry about the times ahead
but everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
and the promise of an early bed
you either shut up or get cut up
they don't wanna hear about it
it's only inches on the reel-to-reel
and the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools
tryin' to anaesthetize the way that you feel
radio is a sound salvation
radio is cleaning up the nation
they say you better listen to the voice of reason
but they don't give you any choice
'cause they think that it's treason
so you had better do as you are told
you better listen to the radio

wonderful radio
marvelous radio
wonderful radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio
radio, radio 

calling mister oswald with the swastika tattoo
there is a vacancy waiting in the english voodoo
carving 'v' for vandal on the guilty boy's head
when he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed
to teach him he's alive 'fore he wishes he was dead

turn up the tv, no one listening will suspect
even your mother won't detect it
so your father won't know
they think that i've got no respect
but everything means less than zero

hey, red
hey, red

oswald and his sister are doing it again
they've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen
they've got a thousand variations: every service with a smile
they're going to take a little break, and they'll be back after a while
well, i hear that south america is coming into style

turn up the tv, no one listening will suspect
even your mother won't detect it
so your father won't know
they think that i've got no respect
but everything means less than zero
hey, red
hey, red

a pistol was still smoking; a man lay on the floor
mister oswald said he had an understanding with the law
he said he heard about a couple living in the usa
he said they traded in their baby for a chevrolet
let's talk about the future now, we've put the past away

turn up the tv, no one listening will suspect
even your mother won't detect it
so your father won't know
they think that i've got no respect, but
everything means less than zero

hey, red
hey, red
hey, red

as i walk through this wicked world
searching for light in the darkness of insanity
i ask myself, is all hope lost?
is there only pain and hatred and misery?

and each time i feel like this inside
there's one thing i wanna know
what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?

and as i walked on through troubled times
my spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
so where are the strong?
and who are the trusted?
and where is the harmony?
sweet harmony

'cause each time i feel it slipping away
just makes me want to cry
what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?

so where are the strong?
and who are the trusted?
and where is the harmony?
sweet harmony

'cause each time i feel it slipping away
just makes me want to cry
what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding? 

history repeats the old conceits
the glib replies, the same defeats
keep your finger on important issues
with crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues
i'm just an oily slick
and i travel the world on a nervous tick
in a very fashionable hovel
i hang around, dying to be tortured
you'll never be alone in the bone orchard
this battle with the bottle is nothing so novel
so in this almost-empty gin palace
through a two-way looking glass, you see your alice
you know she has no sense for all your jealousy
in a sense, she still smiles very sweetly
charged with insults and flattery
her body moves with malice
do you have to be so cruel to be callous?
and now, you find you fit this identikit completely
you say you have no secrets, then leave discreetly

i might make it california's fault
be locked in geneva's deepest vault
just like the canals of mars and the great barrier reef
i come to you beyond belief
my hands were clammy and cunning
she's been suitably stunning
but i know there's not a hope in hades
all the ladies catcall and wolf-whistle
so-called gentlemen and ladies dogfight like rose and thistle

i've got a feeling
i'm going to get a lot of grief
once, this seemed so appealing
now i am beyond belief
i've got a feeling
i'm going to get a lot of grief
once, this seemed so appealing
now i am beyond belief
i've got a feeling
i'm going to get a lot of grief
once, this seemed so appealing
now i am beyond belief
i've got a feeling
i'm going to get a lot of grief... 

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
yeah
ooh ooh

don't tell me you don't know what love is
when you're old enough to know better
when you find strange hands in your sweater
when your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote
i'm a man with a mission in two or three editions

and i'm giving you a longing look
everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book

chapter one: we didn't really get along
chapter two: i think i fell in love with you
you said you'd stand by me in the middle of chapter three
but you were up to your old tricks in chapters four, five and six

and i'm giving you a longing look
everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book
the way you walk, the way you talk and try to kiss me
and laugh in four or five paragraphs
all your compliments and your cutting remarks
are captured here in my quotation marks (ooh-hoo)

i'm giving you a longing look
everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book
everyday i write the book

don't tell me you don't know the difference
between a lover and a fighter
with my pen and my electric typewriter
even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
i'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

and i'm giving you a longing look
everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book
everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book
everyday (everyday), everyday
everyday i write the book, ooh
yeah
(everyday, everyday, everyday)
(everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
i'm giving you a longing look (everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book)
everyday, everyday, everyday (everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday (everyday i write the book)
everyday, everyday (i'm giving you a longing look)
(everyday, everyday)
everyday, everyday i write the book (everyday i write the book) 

see her picture in a thousand places
'cause she's this year's girl
you think you all own little pieces
of this year's girl
forget your fancy manners
forget your english grammar
'cause you don't really give a damn about this year's girl

still, you're hoping that she's well spoken
'cause she's this year's girl
you want her broken with her mouth wide open
'cause she's this year's girl
never knowing it's a real attraction
all these promises of satisfaction
while she's being bored to distraction
being this year's girl

time's running out
she's not happy with the cost
there'd be no doubt
only she's forgotten much more than she's lost

a bright spark might corner the market
in this year's girl
you see yourself rolling on the carpet
with this year's girl
those disco synthesizers
those daily tranquilizers
those body building prizes
those bedroom alibis
all this, but no surprises for this year's girl
all this, but no surprises for this year's girl
all this, but no surprises for this year's girl 

photographs of fancy tricks
to get your kicks at sixty-six
he thinks of all the lips that he licks
and all the girls that he's going to fix
she gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
but there's no place here for the miniskirt waddle
capital punishment, she's last year's model
they call her natasha when she looks like elsie
i don't want to go to chelsea

oh no, it does not move me
even though i've seen the movie
i don't want to check your pulse
i don't want nobody else
i don't want to go to chelsea

everybody's got new orders
be a nice girl and kiss the warders
now the teacher is away
all the kids begin to play
men come screaming, dressed in white coats
shake you very gently by the throat
one's named gus, one's named alfie
i don't want to go to chelsea
oh no, it does not move me
even though i've seen the movie
i don't want to check your pulse
i don't want nobody else
i don't want to go to chelsea

photographs of fancy tricks
to get your kicks at sixty-six
he thinks of all the lips that he licks
and all the girls that he's a-going to fix
she gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
but there's no place here for the miniskirt waddle
capital punishment, she's last year's model
they call her natasha when she looks like elsie
i don't want to go to chelsea

oh no, it does not move me
even though i've seen the movie
i don't want to check your pulse
i don't want nobody else
i don't want to go to chelsea 

oh, i just don't know where to begin
though he says he'll wait forever, it's now or never
but she keeps him hanging on, the silly champion
she says she can't go home without a chaperone

accidents will happen, we only hit and run
he used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
accidents will happen, we only hit and run
i don't wanna hear it 'cause i know what i've done

there's so many fish in the sea
that only rise up in the sweat and smoke like mercury
but they keep you hanging on, they say you're so young
your mind is made up, but your mouth is undone

accidents will happen, we only hit and run
he used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
accidents will happen, we only hit and run
i don't wanna hear it 'cause i know what i've done

and it's the damage that we do and never know
it's the words that we don't say that scare me so
there's so many people to see
so many people you can check up on and add to your collection
but they keep you hanging on until you're well hung
your mouth is made up, but your mind is undone

accidents will happen, we only hit and run
he used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
accidents will happen, we only hit and run
i don't wanna hear it 'cause i know what i've
i know what i've, i know what i've done

i know, i know...
 

almost blue
almost doing things we used to do
there's a girl here and she's almost you
almost
all the things that your eyes once promised
i see in hers too
now your eyes are red from crying
almost blue

flirting with this disaster became me
it named me as the fool who only aimed to be

almost blue
it's almost touching it will almost do
there is part of me that's always true
always
not all good things come to an end
now it is only a chosen few
i've seen such an unhappy couple

almost me
almost you
almost blue 

now that your picture's in the paper being rhythmically admired
and you can have anyone that you have ever desired
all you got to tell me now is why, why, why, why?

welcome to the working week
oh, i know it don't thrill you; i hope it don't kill you
welcome to the working week
you got to do it till you're through it and so you better get to it

all of your family had to kill to survive
and they're still waiting for their big day to arrive
but if they knew how i felt, they'd bury me alive

welcome to the working week
oh, i know it don't thrill you; i hope it don't kill you
welcome to the working week
you got to do it till you're through it so you better get to it

i hear you saying, "hey, the city's alright."
when you only read about it in books
spend all your money getting so convinced
that you never even bother to look
sometimes, i wonder if we're living in the same land
why'd you want to be my friend
when i feel like a juggler running out of hands?

welcome to the working week
oh, ah, welcome to the working week 

oh, i used to be disgusted
and now, i try to be amused
but since their wings have got rusted
you know, the angels want to wear my red shoes
but when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
that's when i knew that i could not refuse
and i won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes

oh, oh, i was watching while you're dancing away
our love got fractured in the echo and sway
how come everybody wants to be your friend?
you know that it still hurts me just to say it

oh, i know that she's disgusted (oh, why's that?)
because she's feeling so abused (oh, that's too bad)
she gets tired of the lust (oh, i'm so sad)
but it's so hard to refuse
can you say that i'm too old
when the angels have stolen my red shoes?

oh, i said, "i'm so happy i could die."
she said, "drop dead," then left with another guy
that's what you get if you go chasing after vengeance
ever since you got me punctured, this has been my sentence
oh, i used to be disgusted
well now, i try to be amused
but since their wings have got rusted
you know, the angels want to wear my red shoes
but when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
that's when i knew that i could not refuse
and i won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes
oh, i won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes

red shoes, the angels want to wear my red shoes
red shoes, the angels want to wear my red shoes... 

so this is where he came to hide
when he ran from you
in a private detective's overcoat
and dirty dead man's shoes
the pretty things of knightsbridge
lying for a minister of state
is a far cry from the nod and wink
here at traitor's gate

because the high heel he used to be has been ground down
and he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around

to murder my love is a crime
but will you still love a man out of time?

there's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
looking for a fourpenny one
with a tight grip on the short hairs
of the public imagination
but for his private wife and kids somehow
real life becomes a rumor
days of dutch courage
just three french letters and a german sense of humor
he's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
he stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege

to murder my love is a crime
but will you still love a man out of time?

the biggest wheels of industry
retire sharp and short
and the after dinner overtures
are nothing but an after thought
somebody's creeping in the kitchen
there's a reputation to be made
whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
who's up late polishing the blade

love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
you drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning

to murder my love is a crime
but will you still love a man out of time?
will you still love a man out of time?
will you still love a man out of time? 

we're all going on a summer holiday
vigilantes coming out to follow me
heard somebody say they're out to collar me
anybody want to swallow me?

it takes two to tumble, it takes two to tango
speak up, don't mumble if you're in the combo

on the beat (on the beat)
on the beat (on the beat)
'til the man comes along and says
"have you been a good boy
never played with your toy?
though you never enjoy
such a pleasure to employ"
see your friends in the state they're in
see your friends getting under their skin
see your friends getting taken in

well, if you only knew the things you do to me
i'd do anything to confuse the enemy
there's only one thing wrong with you befriendin' me
take it easy, i think you're bendin' me
i've been a bad boy with the standard leader
my neighbor's revving up his vauxhall viva

on the beat (on the beat)
on the upbeat (on the beat)
'til the man comes along and he says
"have you been a good boy
never played with your toy?
though you never enjoy
such a pleasure to imply"
see your friends walking down the street
see your friends never quite complete
see your friends getting under their feet

oh, i don't want to disease you
but i'm no good with machinery
oh, i don't want to freeze you
stop looking at the scenery
i keep thinking about your mother
oh, i don't want to lick them
i don't want to be a lover
i just want to be your victim
i don't go out much at night
i don't go out much at all
did you think you were the only one
who was waiting for a call?
on the beat (on the beat)
on the beat (on the beat)
on the upbeat (on the beat)
'til the man comes along and he says
"have you been a good boy
never played with your toy?
though you never enjoy
such a pleasure to employ."
see your friends treat me like a stranger
see your friends despite all the arrangements
see your friends, nothing here has changed

just the beat (just the beat)
just the beat (just the beat)
just the beat (just the beat)
just the beat 

there's a smart young woman on a light blue screen
who comes into my house every night
she takes all the red, yellow, orange and green
and she turns them into black and white

but you tease, and you flirt
and you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
you can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it

better cut off all identifying labels
before they put you on the torture table

'cause somewhere in the "quisling clinic"
there's a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes
she's listening in to the venus line
she's picking out names
i hope none of them are mine

but you tease, and you flirt
and you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
you can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it
never said i was a stool pigeon
i never said i was a diplomat
everybody is under suspicion
but you don't wanna hear about that

'cause you tease and you flirt
and you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
you can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it

better send a begging letter to the big investigation
who put these fingerprints on my imagination?

you tease, and you flirt
and you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
you can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it

you can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
you can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it 

i don't wanna kiss you, i don't wanna touch
i don't wanna see you 'cause i don't miss you that much
i'm not a telephone junkie
i told you that we were just good friends
but when i hold you like i hold that bakelite in my hands

there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
every time i phone you, i just wanna put you down

he's got the keys to the car
they are the keys to the kingdom
he's got everything you need
it's a shame that he didn't bring them
i'm not a telephone junkie
if i'm inserting my coin, i'm doing just fine
then the things in my head start hurting my mind
and i think about the way things used to be
knowing you're with him is driving me crazy
sometimes, i phone you when i know you're not lonely
but i always disconnect it in time
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
every time i phone you, i just wanna put you
every time i phone you, i just wanna put you
every time i phone you, i just wanna put you down
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
there's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
every time i phone you, i just wanna put you down
