you and me
we used to be together
every day together, always
i really feel
that i'm losing my best friend
i can't believe this could be the end

it looks as though
you're letting go
and if it's real, well, i don't want to know

don't speak
i know just what you're saying
so please stop explaining
don't tell me 'cause it hurts
don't speak
i know what you're thinkin'
i don't need your reasons
don't tell me 'cause it hurts

our memories
they can be inviting
but some are altogether mighty frightening

as we die
both you and i
with my head in my hands, i sit and cry

don't speak
i know just what you're saying
so please stop explaining
don't tell me 'cause it hurts, no, no, no
don't speak
i know what you're thinkin'
and i don't need your reasons
don't tell me 'cause it hurts

it's all ending
i gotta stop pretending
who we are


you and me
i can see us dying
are we?

don't speak
i know just what you're saying
so please stop explaining
don't tell me 'cause it hurts
no, no, don't speak
i know what you're thinkin'
and i don't need your reasons
don't tell me 'cause it hurts
don't tell me 'cause it hurts

i know what you're saying
so please stop explaining
don't speak, don't speak
don't speak, no
i know what you're thinkin'
and i don't need your reasons
i know you're good
i know you're good
i know you're real good, oh

la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la
don't, don't, ooh, ooh
hush, hush, darlin'

hush, hush, darlin'
hush, hush, darlin'
hush, hush, don't tell me 'cause it hurts
oh, hush, hush, darlin'
hush, hush, darlin'

take this pink ribbon off my eyes
i'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
don't you think i know exactly where i stand?
this world is forcing me to hold your hand

'cause i'm just a girl, oh, little old me
well, don't let me out of your sight
oh, i'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
so don't let me have any rights

oh, i've had it up to here

the moment that i step outside
so many reasons for me to run and hide
i can't do the little things i hold so dear
'cause it's all those little things that i fear

'cause i'm just a girl, i'd rather not be
'cause they won't let me drive late at night
oh, i'm just a girl, guess i'm some kind of freak
'cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
oh, i'm just a girl, take a good look at me
just your typical prototype

oh, i've had it up to here
oh, am i making myself clear?

i'm just a girl
i'm just a girl in the world
that's all that you'll let me be

oh, i'm just a girl, living in captivity
your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
oh, i'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
what i've succumbed to is making me numb
oh, i'm just a girl, my apologies
what i've become is so burdensome
oh, i'm just a girl, lucky me
twiddle-dum, there's no comparison

oh, i've had it up to
oh, i've had it up to
oh, i've had it up to here

you think that we connect
that the chemistry's correct
your words walk right through my ears
presuming i like what i hear

and now i'm stuck in the
the web you're spinning
you got me for your prey

sorry i'm not home right now
i'm walking into spiderwebs
so leave a message and i'll call you back
a likely story, but
leave a message and i'll call you back

you're intruding on what's mine
and you're taking up my time
don't have the courage inside me
to tell you, "please let me be"

communication
a telephonic invasion
i'm planning my escape

sorry i'm not home right now
i'm walking into spiderwebs
so leave a message and i'll call you back
a likely story, but
leave a message and i'll call you back

and it's all your fault
i screen my phone calls
no matter who calls
i gotta screen my phone calls

now it's gone too deep (now it's gone too deep)
you wake me in my sleep (wake me in my sleep)
my dreams become nightmares (dreams become nightmares)
'cause you're ringing in my ears

sorry i'm not home right now
i'm walking into spiderwebs
so leave a message and i'll call you back
a likely story, but
leave a message and i'll call you back

and it's all your fault
i screen my phone calls
no matter, matter, matter, matter who calls
i gotta screen my phone calls

ooh, spiderwebs
leave a message and i'll call you back
i'm walking into spiderwebs
so leave a message and i'll call you back

it's all your fault
i screen my phone calls
no matter, matter, matter who calls
i gotta screen my phone calls
it's all your fault
it's all your fault
no matter who calls
no matter who calls

ooh, i'm walking into spiderwebs
so leave a message and i'll call you back, ha-ha
i'm walking into spiderwebs
leave a message and i'll call you back

oh, it's all your fault (i'm walking into spiderwebs)
no matter who calls (leave a message and i'll call you back)
i gotta screen my phone calls (i'm walking into spiderwebs)
it's all your fault (leave a message and i'll call you back)
no matter, matter, matter who calls (i'm walking into spiderwebs)
i screen my phone calls (leave a message and i'll call you back)
i'm walking into spiderwebs
leave a message and i'll call you back

there's times when i want something more
someone more like me
there's times when this dress rehearsal
seems incomplete
but you see the colors in me
like no one else
and behind your dark glasses
you're something else

you're really lovely
underneath it all
you want to love me
underneath it all
i'm really lucky
underneath it all
you're really lovely

you know some real bad tricks
and you need some discipline
but lately you've been trying real hard
and giving me your best
and you give me the most gorgeous sleep
that i've ever had
and when it's really bad
i guess it's not that bad

you're really lovely
underneath it all
you want to love me
underneath it all
i'm really lucky
underneath it all
you're really lovely

so many moons that we have seen
stumbling back next to me
i've seen right through and underneath
and you make me better
i've seen right through and underneath
and you make me better, better, better

for real!
'cause underneat' it all, you are my real prince charmin'
like the heat from the fire, you were always burnin'
anytime you’re around, my body keeps callin'
for your touch, your kisses and your sweet romancin'
there’s another side of you, weh this a woman yah adore
aside from your temper, everything else secure
you’re good for me, baby, for that, i’m sure
'cause over and over again, me want more

you've used up all your coupons
and all you got left is me
and somehow i'm full of forgiveness
i guess it's meant to be…

you're really lovely
underneath it all
you want to love me
underneath it all
i'm really lucky
underneath it all
you're really lovely

it's funny how i find myself
in love with you
if i could buy my reasoning
i'd pay to lose
one half won't do

i've asked myself
how much do you
commit yourself?

it's my life
don't you forget
it's my life
it never ends (it never ends)

funny how i blind myself
i never knew
if i was sometimes played upon
afraid to lose

oh, i'd tell myself
what good do you do
convince myself

it's my life
don't you forget
it's my life
it never ends (it never ends)


and i've asked myself
how much do you
commit yourself?

oh, it's my life
don't you forget
caught in the crowd
it never ends (it never ends)

oh, it's my life
don't you forget
caught in the crowd
it never ends (it never ends)

oh, it's my life (oh it's my life)
don't you forget (don't you forget)
caught in the crowd (caught in the crowd)
it never ends (it never ends)

one, two, three, four

sappy pathetic little me
that was the girl i used to be
you had me on my knees

i'd trade you places any day
i'd never thought you could be that way
but you looked like me on sunday

well, you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning

i thought i knew you (woh-oh)
i thought i knew you (woh-oh)
i thought i knew you well
so well

you're trying my shoes on for a change
they look so good but fit so strange
out of fashion, so i can complain

well, you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning

i thought i knew you (woh-oh)
i thought i knew you (woh-oh)
i thought i knew you well
so well

i know who i am, but who are you?
you're not looking like you used to
you're on the other side of the mirror
so nothing's looking quite as clear
thank you, for turning on the light
thank you, now you're the parasite
i didn't think you had it in you
and now, you're looking like i used to

you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning

and you want me badly
because you cannot have me
i thought i knew you (woh-oh)
now i've got a new view (woh-oh)
i thought i knew you well
oh well

ooh, on sunday morning
without a warning
on sunday morning
i thought i knew you (sunday morning)
ohh, you want me badly
you cannot have me
sunday morning

for a long time i was in love
not only in love, i was obsessed
with a friendship that no one else could touch
it didn't work out, i'm covered in shells

and all i wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life
and all i needed was a simple man
so i could be a wife

i'm so ashamed, i've been so mean
i don't know how it got to this point
i always was the one with all the love
you came along, i'm hunting you down

like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
and all i wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life

if we met tomorrow for the very first time
would it start all over again?
would i try to make you mine?

i always thought i'd be a mom
sometimes i wish for a mistake
the longer that i wait the more selfish that i get
you seem like you'd be a good dad

now all those simple things
are simply too complicated for my life
how'd i get so faithful to my freedom?
a selfish kind of life
when all i ever wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life

i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend

i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
and you know it makes me sick to be on that list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
you say you’re gonna burn before you mellow
i will be the one to burn you
why’d you have to go and pick me?
when you knew that we were different, completely

i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend

i’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
your wildness scares me
so does your freedom
you say you can’t stand the restrictions
i find myself trying to change you
if you were meant to be my lover i wouldn’t have to
and i feel so mean, i feel in between
‘cause i’m about to give you away

i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
(for someone else to take)
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
(am i making a mistake?)
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
(all the time that we spent)
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend

i’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
i’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed

i know i messed up
i’m about to give you away for someone else to take
i’m about to give you away for someone else to take

we keep repeating mistakes for souvenirs
and we’ve been in between the days for years
and i know that when i see you i’m going to die
i know i’m going to want you and you know why
it’s going to kill me to see you with the next girl
‘cause i’m the most gorgeously jealous kind of ex-girl
but i should have thought of that before we kissed

i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
(all the time that we spent)
i kinda always knew i’d end up your ex-girlfriend

and now i’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
now i’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed

you and your museum of lovers
the precious collection you've housed in your covers
my simpleness threatened by my own admission
and the bags are much too heavy
in my insecure condition
my pregnant mind is fat full with envy again

but i still love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldn't love another
i can't help it, you're my kind of man

wanted and adored by attractive women
bountiful selection at your discretion
i know i'm diving into my own destruction
so why do we choose the boys that are naughty?
i don't fit in, so why do you want me?
and i know i can't tame you, but i just keep trying

'cause i love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldn't love another
i'm on your list with all your other women
but i still love to wash in your old bathwater
you make me feel like i couldn't love another
i can't help it, you're my kind of man, yeah

mmm, mmm
why do the good girls always want the bad boys?

so i pacify problems with kisses and cuddles
diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble
then i find myself choking on all my contradictions

'cause i still love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldn't love another
share a toothbrush, you're my kind of man
i still love to wash in your old bathwater
make me feel like i couldn't love another
i can't help it, you're my kind of man

yeah
do-do-do
do-do-do
do-do-do
no, i can't help myself
i can't help myself
i still love to wash in your old bathwater
ooh

the waves keep on crashin' on me for some reason
but your love keeps on comin' like a thunderbolt
well come here, a little closer
'cause i wanna see you, baby, real close up
(get over here, get over here)

you got me feelin' hella good
so let's just keep on dancin'
you hold me like you should
so i'm gonna keep on dancin' (keep on dancin')

a performance deserving of standing ovations
and who would've thought it'd be the two of us?
(i didn't really think it could ever happen, haha)
so don't wake me if i'm dreamin'
'cause i'm in the mood, come on and give it up
(oh, oh, oh)

you got me feelin' hella good
so let's just keep on dancin'
you hold me like you should
so i'm gonna keep on dancin' (keep on dancin')
you got me feelin' hella good
so let's just keep on dancin'
you hold me like you should
so i'm gonna keep on dancin' (keep on dancin')

ooh, yeah, yeah
ooh, yeah, yeah
(i never thought that but i've been trapped by what happened)

you got me feelin' hella good
so let's just keep on dancin'
you hold me like you should
so i'm gonna keep on dancin' (keep on dancin')
you got me feelin' hella good
so let's just keep on dancin'
you hold me like you should
so i'm gonna keep on dancin' (keep on dancin')

(uh, uh, uh)
(uh, uh, uh)
(uh, uh, uh)
(keep on dancin')
(keep on dancin')

"remain seated, please. permanecer sentados, por favor"

once was a magical place
over time, it was lost
price increased the cost
now the fortune of the kingdom
is locked up in its dungeon vaults
the castle floor lies in traps
with coiled wires set back
decoyed by old cheese
now the drawbridge has been lifted
as the millions, they drop to their knees

they pay homage to a king
whose dreams are buried in their minds
his tears are frozen stiff
icicles drip from his eyes

the cold wind blows as it snows
on those who fight to get in
on heads that are small
disillusioned (disillusioned) as they enter (as they enter)
they're unaware what's behind castle walls
but now it's written in stone
the king has been overthrown by jesterly fools
and the power (and the power) of the people (of the people)
shall come to believe they do rule

they pay homage to a king
whose dreams are buried in their minds
his tears are frozen stiff
icicles drip from his eyes

welcome to the tragic kingdom
cornfields of popcorn have yet to spring open

have they lost their heads
or are they just all blind mice?
we've heard all their stories
one too many times
hypnotized by fireflies that glow in the dark
and midgets that disguise themselves as tiny little dwarfs
the parade that's electrical
it serves no real purpose
just takes up a lot of juice
just to impress us


they pay homage to a king
whose dreams are buried in their minds
his tears are frozen stiff
icicles drip from his eyes
ooh, they drip from his eyes into the night (tragic kingdom)
they drip from his eyes (tragic kingdom)
they're paying homage to a king (tragic)
a king who's buried, buried in their minds (kingdom)
they drip from his eyes (tragic kingdom)

welcome to the tragic kingdom
cornfields of popcorn
have yet to spring open

welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom
welcome to the tragic kingdom

the future…

running, running, as fast as we can
do you think we’ll make it?
we’re running, keep holding my hand
so we don’t get separated

running as fast as we can
i really hope we make it
we’re running, running, keep holding my hand
so we don’t get separated

haji was a punk just like any other boy
and he never had no trouble till he started up his oi band
safe in the garage or singing in the tub
until haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub
it was a cold christmas eve when trevor and the skins
popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps
trevor liked the music but not the unity
he unwound haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees

if god came down on christmas day
i know exactly what he'd say
he'd say "oi to the punks and oi to the skins-
but oi to the world and everybody wins!"

haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd
he said "we'll meet again we are bloody but not unbowed"
trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
christmas day on the roof down at 20 oxford street


on the roof with the nun chucks trevor broke a lot of bones
but haji had a sword like that guy in indiana jones
police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man
haji was alone and abandoned by his band
trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
when the skins left him there and went down the fire escape
oi! oi!
but then haji saw the north star shining more then ever
so he made a tourniquet from his turban saving trevor
they repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
and went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon

if god came down on christmas day
i know exactly what he'd say
he'd say "oi to the punks and oi to the skins
but oi to the world and everybody wins!
if god came down on christmas day
i know exactly what he'd say
he'd say "oi to the punks and oi to the skins
but oi to the world and everybody wins!
oi! oi!

well things can be broken down in this world of ours
you don't have to be a famous person just to make your mark
a mother can be an inspiration to her little son
and change his thoughts, his mind, his life
just with her gentle hum, hum
so different, yet so the same
two sisters only have their parents to blame
it's rare that two can get along
but when they do, they're inseparable
such a blessing comes to few, few

the sky is full of clouds
and my world's full of people

you got the different kinds
with different ways
it would take a lifetime to explain
not one's the same (eee)

he and she, two different people with two separate lives
then you put the two together, you get a spectacular surprise
'cause one can teach the other one what she doesn't know
while still the other fills a place inside
he never knew had room to grow, grow, grow
grow, grow

the sky is full of clouds
and my world's full of people

you got the different kinds
with different ways
it would take a lifetime to explain
not one's the same, hey

oh, yeah, once in a while, i sit back
and think about the planet
and most of the time, i trip on it
to kick back and think about how massive it all is
and how many others are on it, yeah


i often think about the world in which i live today
of animals and plants and nature's gifts set on display
but the most amazing thing that i've seen in my time
are all the different people
and all their different minds, minds, minds, minds

and different ways
it would take a lifetime to explain
not one's exactly the same
so many different people
so many different kinds
so many, many, many different people
so many different—

look at me, i'm a person
look at me, i'm my own person
so many different people
so many different kinds
for better or for worse, different people

don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
and i can’t believe i’ve had this chance now
don’t let it go away, yeah

new, you’re so new
you, you’re new
and i never had this taste in the past
new, you’re so new

my normal hesitation is gone
and i really gravitate to your will
are you here to fetch me out?
‘cause i’ve never had this taste in my mouth
oh, you’re not old
and you’re not familiar
recently discovered and i’m learning about you

new, you’re so new
you, you’re new
and you’re consuming me violently
and your reverence shamelessly tempting me
who sent this maniac?
‘cause i never had this taste in the past

oh, you’re different
you’re different from the former
like a fresh battery, i’m energized by you

don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
and i can’t believe i’ve had this chance now
don’t let it go away

why am i so curious?
this territory is dangerous
i’ll probably end up at the start
i’ll be back in line with my broken heart

new, you’re so new
you, you’re new
and i never had this taste in the past

don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
and i can’t believe i’ve had this chance now
don’t let it go away

and i can’t believe it (don’t let it go away)
can’t believe it
can’t believe it (don’t let it go away)
can’t believe it

don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
don’t let it go away
new, you're so new
new, you're so new
new, you're so new
new...

what's your twenty?

checking in to check you out
concerned about your whereabouts
copy that, you're acting strange
so tell me what is going on
so heavy i bet

i'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)
i'm hella positive for real, i'm all good no
i'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)
it's gotten complicated that's for sure

but you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
i'm trying to get a hold on this
and i really mean it this time
and you know it's such a trip
don't get me started
i'm trying to get a hold on this
get get get in line, and settle down
get in line, and settle down

no big deal (i can handle it)
it'll bounce off me (i can handle it)
been around the block before
doesn't matter anymore

are you insane? (are you kidding me?)
underneath the avalanche
so heavy again

i'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)

you had the best, but you gave her up
'cause dependency might interrupt
idealistic will, so hard to please
put your indecisive mind at ease

you broke the set
now there's, there's only singles
there's no looking back
and this time i mean it

are you happy now?
oh, tell me how you're happy now
are you happy?

the uncertainty you had of me
brought clouded, shady company
the tenderness habitual
a seldom-fading ritual

you killed the pair
now only one is breathing
there's no looking back
this time i mean it

are you happy now?
oh, tell me how you're happy now
are you happy?
are you happy now?
how is it now? are you happy now?
are you happy?

no more leaning on your shoulder
i won't be there, no more bother
if you feel you just might want me
that's too bad, i'm not that easy

the contemplator all those years
now you must adhere to your new career
of liberation, you've been cast
all by yourself, you're free at last

you broke the set
now there's, there's only singles
there's no looking back
this time i mean it

are you happy now?
tell me how you're happy now
are you happy?
are you happy now?
how is it now? are you happy now?
are you happy?

oh, you're by yourself
all by yourself
you got no one else
you're by yourself
all by yourself, all by yourself
all by yourself, all by yourself
no one else, no one else
by yourself, by yourself
