i just had a slight lack of common sense
i was the good guy
she was the bad girl
i'm thinking one girl
she thinking me, earl james and jimmy
yep, she had plenty
but love for me, she didn't have any

i was inviting, her into my heart
but she was out riding in some other man's car
she was my night time, thought i was her star
guess i was wrong, but see i'm strong
won't take long for me to move on

please don't worry bout me i'm fine
(please don't worry bout me i'm fine)

i realized that
she don't know how to act
tried to settle down and look what i get
thought it was my time, but i guess not yet
she at the bar getting drinks from many men
i'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends
just not knowing, truly not knowing
i look back now like, "man, i was open"

i was inviting, her into my heart
but she was out riding in some other man's car
she was my night time, thought i was her star
guess i was wrong, but see i'm strong
won't take long for me to move on

please don't worry bout me i'm fine
(please don't worry bout me i'm fine)
only gonna play the fool one time
(only gonna play the fool one time)
trust me when i say
that i'll be okay
go on girl
(go on girl)
go on girl
(go on girl)

the mistake i made is clear
(we never should've been together)
that's the reason you're not here

not a feeling in my chest

can't cry, feel guilt over spilt milk
i'm too fly, i'm too cool, word to versace silk
and my watch be filled with mad diamonds
i got good watches, just bad timing
the chick i met at the club was cute
still feel like i'm getting brain from the substitute
cause this ain't you and i ain't me
claim you happy then why you so mad at me?
can't hold on to what you had, just what you got
you should be here, but you're not

what i told myself i would not do, oh
it's 4:15 am
i'm sitting here drinking, reminiscing on you, oh
and how i used to let you smoke even though i don't

in the back of my mind, one millionth time
i tell myself it should be you, should be you
should be you with me, right now
said it should be you (should be you)
should be you (should be you)
should be you with me, right now, uh
as i watch her sleep, all that i can think
she's beautiful (beautiful), but she's not you
love for just a night, then out of my life (out of my life)
damn, why can't i do this right when you told me you wanted to leave? (wanted to leave)
i pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)
but as i lay here, i can hardly breathe
laying next to she, when in reality, it should be...

my life, lights cameras fame and action
feeling drained from all this private planes i'm catchin'
willing to trade all the flashy chains i'm flashin for a night
back for us, exchangin' pain in passion
romances, kinda like the phantom doors we used to ride
cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide (suicide)
god teaches lessons every day
you was all i need in life, meth and mary j (come on)
the sun don't shine forever
anytime that we fall, it just means we climb together (together)
