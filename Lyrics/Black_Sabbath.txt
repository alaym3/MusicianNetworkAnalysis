finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think i'm insane because i am frowning all the time
all day long, i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
think i'll lose my mind if i don't find something to pacify

can you help me occupy my brain?
whoa, yeah

i need someone to show me the things in life that i can't find
i can't see the things that make true happiness, i must be blind


make a joke and i will sigh and you will laugh and i will cry
happiness, i cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
and so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
i tell you to enjoy life, i wish i could, but it's too late

i am iron man

has he lost his mind?
can he see or is he blind?
can he walk at all
or, if he moves, will he fall?
is he alive or dead?
has he thoughts within his head?
we'll just pass him there
why should we even care?
he was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
when he traveled time
for the future of mankind

nobody wants him
he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfurl

now the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved

nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now he has his revenge


heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
running as fast as they can
iron man lives again

generals gathered in their masses
just like witches at black masses
evil minds that plot destruction
sorcerers of death's construction
in the fields, the bodies burning
as the war machine keeps turning
death and hatred to mankind
poisoning their brainwashed minds
oh, lord, yeah

politicians hide themselves away
they only started the war
why should they go out to fight?
they leave that all to the poor, yeah
time will tell on their power minds
making war just for fun
treating people just like pawns in chess
wait till their judgment day comes, yeah


now, in darkness, world stops turning
ashes where their bodies burning
no more war pigs have the power
hand of god has struck the hour
day of judgment, god is calling
on their knees, the war pigs crawling
begging mercies for their sins
satan, laughing, spreads his wings
oh, lord, yeah

oh yeah
some people say my love cannot be true
please believe me, my love, and i'll show you
i will give you those things you thought unreal
the sun, the moon, the stars, all bear my seal

oh yeah
follow me now and you will not regret
leaving the life you led before we met
you are the first to have this love of mine
forever with me till the end of time

your love for me has just got to be real
before you know the way i'm going to feel
i'm going to feel
i'm going to feel

oh yeah
now, i have you with me under my power
our love grows stronger now with every hour
look into my eyes, you'll see who i am
my name is lucifer, please take my hand


oh yeah
follow me now and you will not regret
leaving the life you led before we met
you are the first to have this love of mine
forever with me till the end of time

your love for me has just got to be real
before you know the way i'm going to feel
i'm going to feel
i'm going to feel

oh yeah
now, i have you with me under my power
our love grows stronger now with every hour
look into my eyes, you'll see who i am
my name is lucifer, please take my hand

sing me a song, you're a singer
do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
the devil is never a maker
the less that you give, you're a taker

so, it's on and on and on
it's heaven and hell, oh well, yeah

the lover of life's not a sinner
the ending is just a beginner
the closer you get to the meaning
the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

so, it's on and on and on
oh, it's on and on and on
it goes on and on and on
heaven and hell, i can tell
fool, fool

oh-oh, oh
ooh-ooh, ooh
yeah-yeah, yeah

well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
for every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
love can be seen as the answer
but nobody bleeds for the dancer

and it's on and on, on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on


they say that life's a carousel
spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
the world is full of kings and queens
who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
it's heaven and hell, oh well
and they'll tell you black is really white
the moon is just the sun at night
and when you walk in golden halls
you get to keep the gold that falls
it's heaven and hell, oh no!
fool, fool!
you've got to bleed for the dancer!
fool, fool!
look for the answer!
fool, fool, fool!

what is this that stands before me?
figure in black which points at me
turn 'round quick and start to run
find out i'm the chosen one
oh, no

big black shape with eyes of fire
telling people their desire
satan's sitting there, he's smiling
watches those flames get higher and higher
oh, no, no, please, god, help me

is it the end, my friend?
satan's coming 'round the bend
people running 'cause they're scared
the people better go and beware
no, no, please, no

we sail through endless skies
stars shine like eyes, the black night sighs
the moon in silver dreams
pours down in beams, light of the night
the earth, a purple blaze
of sapphire haze in orbit always

while down below the trees
bathed in cool breeze, silver starlight
breaks dawn from night
and so, we pass on by
the crimson eye of great god mars
as we travel the universe

i feel unhappy, i feel so sad
i've lost the best friend that i ever had
she was my woman, i loved her so
but it's too late now, i've let her go

i'm going through changes
i'm going through changes

we shared the years, we shared each day
in love, together, we found the way
but soon, the world had its evil way
my heart was blinded, love went astray

i'm going through changes
i'm going through changes

it took so long to realise
and i can still hear her last goodbyes
now, all my days are filled with tears
wish i could go back and change these years

i'm going through changes
i'm going through changes

you've seen right through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
the execution of your mind, you really had to turn
the race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
the truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

nobody will ever let you know
when you ask the reasons why
they just tell you that you're on your own
fill your head all full of lies

the people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
the gates of life have closed on you, and there's just no return
you're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
and you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

nobody will ever let you know
when you ask the reasons why
they just tell you that you're on your own
fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!


where can you run to? what more can you do?
no more tomorrow, life is killing you
dreams turn to nightmares, heaven turns to hell
burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
everything around you, what's it coming to?
god knows as your dog nose, bog, blast all of you
sabbath bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

alright now
won't you listen?
when i first met you, didn't realize
i can't forget you or your surprise
you introduced me to my mind
and left me wanting you and your kind
oh, yeah!

i love you
oh, you know it
my life was empty, forever on a down
until you took me, showed me around
my life is free now, my life is clear
i love you, sweet leaf
though you can't hear
oh, yeah!

come on now
try it out
straight people don't know
what you're about
they put you down and shut you out
you gave to me a new belief
and soon the world
will love you, sweet leaf
oh, yeah, baby!

come on now! oh, yeah!
try me out, baby! alright!
oh, yeah-ah
i want you part of this sweet leaf
oh, yeah! alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh-oh, try me out
i love you, sweet leaf, oh

revolution in their minds
the children start to march
against the world
in which they have to live
and all the hate that's in their hearts
they're tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
they'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through
yeah!

children of tomorrow live
in the tears that fall today
will the sunrise of tomorrow
bring in peace in any way?
must the world live in the shadow
of atomic fear?
can they win the fight for peace
or will they disappear? yeah!

so you children of the world
listen to what i say
if you want a better place to live in
spread the word today
show the world that love is still alive
you must be brave
or you children of today
are children of the grave, yeah!

children of the grave
children of the grave
children of the grave

goin' home late last night
suddenly, i got a fright
yeah, i looked through a window and surprised what i saw
fairy with boots are dancin' with a dwarf, alright, now

yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah, i saw it, i saw it, i tell you no lies
yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
i saw it, i saw it with my own two eyes, alright, now


yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah, i saw it, i saw it, i tell you no lies
yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
i saw it, i saw it with my own two eyes, alright, now

so, i went to the doctor, see what he could give me
he said, "son, son, you've gone too far
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do," yeah

reflex in the sky
warn you you're gonna die
storm coming, you better hide
from the atomic tide
flashes in the sky
turns houses into sties
turns people into clay
radiation, minds decay

robot minds of robot slaves
lead them to atomic graves
plastic flowers, melting sun
fading moon falls upon
dying world of radiation
victims of mad frustration
burning globe of obscene fire
like electric funeral pyre

buildings crashing down
to earth's cracking ground
rivers turn to wood
ice melt into blood
earth lies in deathbed
clouds cry for the dead
terrifying rain
is a burning pain
(electric funeral)
(electric funeral)
(electric funeral)
(electric funeral)

and so, in the sky
shines the electric eye
supernatural king
takes earth under his wing
heaven's golden chorus sings
hell's angels flap their wings
evil souls fall to hell
ever trapped in burning cells

lost in the darkness, i fade from the light
faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior
help me make it through the night
blood on my conscience
and murder in mind
out of the gloom i rise up from my tomb
into impending doom
now my body is my shrine

the blood runs free
the rain turns red
give me the wine, you keep the bread
the voices echo in my head
is god alive or is god dead?
is god dead?

rivers of evil, run through dying land
swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
there is no tomorrow
for the sinners will be damned
ashes to ashes
you cannot exhume a soul
who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
leaves you empty and unwhole?

when will this nightmare be over?
tell me
when can i empty my head?
will someone tell me the answer?
is god really dead?
is god really dead?

to safeguard my philosophy
until my dying breath
i transfer from reality
into a living death
i empathize with enemies
until the timing’s right
with god and satan at my side
from darkness will come light

i watch the rain as it turns red
give me more wine
i don’t need bread
these riddles that live in my head
i don’t believe that god is dead
god is dead

nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
wondering if we will meet again on the other side
do you believe a word what the good book said?
or is it just a holy fairytale and god is dead?
god is dead, god is dead
god is dead, god is dead, right?


but still the voices in my head
are telling me that god is dead
the blood pours down, the rain turns red
i don’t believe that god is dead
god is dead, god is dead
god is dead, god is dead

what you gonna do?
time's caught up with you
now, you wait your turn
you know there's no return
take your routine roles
you join the other fools
turn to something new
now, it's killing you

first, it was the bomb
vietnam napalm
disillusioning
you push the needle in
from life, you escape
reality's black drape
colours in your mind
satisfy your time

oh, you, you know you must be blind
to do such things like this
to take the sweet that you don't know
you're giving death a kiss
poor little fool now
your mind is full of pleasure
your body's looking ill
to you, it's shallow leisure
so drop the acid pill
don't stop to think now

you're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
you need someone to help you, stick the needle in, yeah

now, you know the scene
your skin starts turning green
your eyes no longer see
life's reality
push the needle in
face death's sickly grin
holes are in your skin
caused by deadly pin

head starts spinning 'round
you fall down to the ground
feel your body heave
death's hand starts to weave
it's too late to turn
you don't wanna learn
price of life is high
now, you're gonna die

what you get and what you see
things that don’t come easily
feeling happy in my pain
icicles within my brain (cocaine)

something blowing in my head
winds of ice that soon will spread
down to freeze my very soul
makes me happy, makes me cold

my eyes are blind, but i can see
the snowflakes glisten on the trees
the sun no longer sets me free
i feel the snowflakes freezing me


let the winter sun shine on
let me feel the frost of dawn
build my dreams on flakes of snow
soon i’ll feel the chilling glow

right!
don’t you think i know what i’m doing
don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
you’re the one that’s really the loser
this is where i feel i belong
right!

crystal world with winter flowers
turn my days to frozen hours
lying snowblind in the sun
will my ice age ever come?

my name it means nothing, my fortune is less
my future is shrouded in dark wilderness
sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
everything i possessed, now, they are gone
they are gone, they are gone...

oh, where can i go to and what can i do?
nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you
you just laughed when i begged you to stay
i've not stopped crying since you went away
you went away, you went away...

the world is a lonely place, you're on your own
guess i will go home, sit down and moan
crying and thinking is all that i do
memories i have remind me of you
of you, of you...

rocket engines burning fuel so fast
up into the night sky they blast
through the universe the engines whine
could it be the end of man and time?
back on earth the flame of life burns low
everywhere is misery and woe
pollution kills the air, the land and sea
man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

rocket engines burning fuel so fast
up into the black sky so vast
burning metal through the atmosphere
earth remains in worry, hate and fear
with the hateful battles raging on
rockets flying to the glowing sun
through the empires of eternal void
freedom from the final suicide

freedom fighters sent out to the sun
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
leave the earth to all its sin and hate
find another world where freedom waits, yeah

past the stars in fields of ancient void
through the shields of darkness where they find
love upon a land a world unknown
where the sons of freedom make their home
leave the earth to satan and his slaves
leave them to their future in their grave
make a home where love is there to stay
peace and happiness in every day

misty morning, clouds in the sky
without warning, a wizard walks by
casting his shadow, weaving his spell
long grey cloak, tinkling bell

never talking
just keeps walking
spreading his magic

evil power disappears
demons worry when the wizard is near
he turns tears into joy
everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

never talking
just keeps walking
spreading his magic

sun is shining, clouds have gone by
all the people give a happy sigh
he has passed by, giving his sign
left all the people feeling so fine

never talking
just keeps walking
spreading his magic

now, the first day that i met ya
i was looking in the sky
when the sun turned all a blur
and the thunderclouds rolled by
the sea began to shiver
and the wind began to moan
it must've been a sign for me
to leave you well alone

i was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong

you never said you love me
and i don't believe you can
'cause i saw you in a dream
and you were with another man
you looked so cool and casual
and i tried to look the same
but now i've got to love ya
tell me who have i to blame?

i was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong


now, the whole wide world is movin'
'cause there's iron in my heart
i just can't keep from cryin'
'cause you say we've got to part
sorrow grips my voice
as i stand here all alone
and watch you slowly take away
a love i've never known

i was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong
just a little bit too strong


now, the whole wide world is movin'
'cause there's iron in my heart
i just can't keep from cryin'
'cause you say we've got to part
sorrow grips my voice
as i stand here all alone
and watch you slowly take away
a love i've never known

i was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong
just a little bit too strong
