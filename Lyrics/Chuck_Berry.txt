deep down in louisiana close to new orleans
way back up in the woods among the evergreens
there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
where lived a country boy named johnny b. goode
who never ever learned to read or write so well
but he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
johnny b. goode

he used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
people passing by they would stop and say
oh my, but that little country boy could play

go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
go johnny go, go
johnny b. goode

his mother told him "someday you will be a man
and you will be the leader of a big old band
many people coming from miles around
to hear you play your music when the sun go down
maybe someday your name will be in lights
saying 'johnny b. goode tonight'"

go, go
go johnny go
go go go, johnny go
oh go go, johnny go
oh go go, johnny go
go, johnny b. goode

it was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well
you could see that pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
and now the young monsieur and madame
have rung the chapel bell
"c'est la vie", say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell

they furnished off an apartment with
a two room roebuck sale
the coolerator was crammed with tv dinners and ginger ale
but when pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
"c'est la vie", say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell

they had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell
"c'est la vie", say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell

they bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
and drove it down to orleans to celebrate their anniversary
it was there where pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
"c'est la vie", say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell

when i was a little bitty boy
my grandmother bought me a cute little toy
silver bells hangin' on a string
she told me it was my ding a ling ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i wanna play with my ding a ling

when mamma took me to sunday school
they tried to teach me the golden rule
every time the choir would sing
i'd sit there and play with my ding a ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i wanna play with my ding a ling

when pa started me to grammar school
i found a place in the vestibule
and every time the bell would ring
they'd catch me playin' with my ding a ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling

once i was climbing the garden wall
oh and i had an awful fall
i fell so hard i heard bells ring
but i never let go of my ding a ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling

i remember the girl next door
we used to play house on the kitchen floor
she'd be the queen, i'd be the king
together we'd play with my ding a ling a ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling

this here song, it is so sad
to those of you who never had
silver bells hanging on a string
so you could play with your own ding a ling

my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
all come on now, everybody sing
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling
my ding a ling, my ding a ling
i want to play with my ding a ling (one more time)

the cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
a hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
the cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
and i caught maybellene at the top of the hill

maybellene, why can't you be true?
oh, maybellene, why can't you be true?
you done started back doing the things you used to do

nadine, honey is that you?
oh, nadine, honey is that you?
seems like every time i see you

i saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
and started walkin' toward a coffee colored cadillac
i was pushin' through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
and i was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

nadine, honey is that you?
oh, nadine, honey where are you?
seems like every time i catch you
but you're up to something new

to take away these blues
"she don't love me"
hear them singing in the sun
payday's coming when my work is all done

later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
all day i been waiting for the whistle to blow
sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
we've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out

everybody's scrambling n' 'jumping around
picking up their money
tearing the teepee down
foreman wants to panic
'bout to go insane
trying to get the workers out the way of the train
engineer blows the whistle long and long
can't stop the train
you have to let it roll on

i bought a brand-new air-mobile
it was custom-made, 'twas a flight de ville
with a powerful motor and some hideaway wings
push in on the button and you will hear her sing

now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close
you know i'm gone like a cool breeze

new jersey turnpike in the wee, wee hours
i was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzling showers
here come a flat-top, he was moving up with me
then come waving goodbye in a little old souped-up jitney
i put my foot in my tank and i began to roll
moaning siren, 'twas a state patrol
so i let out my wings and then i blew my horn
bye-bye new jersey, i've become airborne

now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close
you know i'm gone like a cool breeze

flying with my baby last saturday night
wasn't a gray cloud floatin' in sight
big full moon shining up above
cuddle up honey, be my love
sweetest little thing i ever seen
i'm going to name you maybellene
flying on the beam, set on flight control
radio tuned to rock and roll
two, three hours done passed us by
altitude dropped to five-oh-five
fuel consumption way too fast
let's get on home before we run out of gas

now you can't catch me, no baby you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close
you know i'm gone like a cool breeze

arrested on charges of unemployment
he was sittin' in the witness stand
the judge's wife called up the district attorney
she said "free that brown-eyed man
if you want your job you'd better free that brown eyed man"

flyin' across the desert in a twa
i saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand
she been walkin' 30 miles en route to bombay
to meet a brown-eyed handsome man
her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man

way back in history, 3000 years
in fact, ever since the world began
there's been a whole lotta good women sheddin' tears
over a brown-eyed handsome man
it's a lot of trouble for the brown-eyed handsome man


beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
between a doctor and a lawyer man
her mother told her, "darling, go out and find
yourself a brown-eyed handsome man
just like your daddy, he's a brown-eyed handsome man"

marlo venus was a beautiful lass
she had the world in the palm of her hand
she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
to meet a brown-eyed handsome man
she fought and won herself a brown-eyed handsome man

he hit a high fly into the stand
roundin' third, he was headed for home
it was a brown-eyed handsome man
that won the game, it was a brown-eyed handsome man

i left my home in norfolk, virginia
california on my mind
i straddled that greyhound and rode him into raleigh
and on across caroline
we stopped in charlotte and bypassed rock hill
we never was a minute late
we was ninety miles out of atlanta by sundown
rolling outta the georgia state
we had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
halfway across alabam'
and that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
in downtown birmingham

right away, i bought me a through train ticket
riding across mississippi clean
and i was on that midnight flier out of birmingham
smoking into new orleans
somebody help me get out of louisiana
just help me get to houston town
there's people there who care a little about me
and they won't let the poor boy down
sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
put luggage in my hands
and i woke up high over albuquerque
on a jet to the promised land

working on a t-bone steak a la carte
flying over to the golden state
oh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes
he would set us at the terminal gate
swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
taxi to the terminal zone
cut your engines and cool your wings
and let me make it to the telephone
los angeles, give me norfolk, virginia
tidewater four ten o nine
tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
and the poor boy's on the line

up in the mornin' and out to school
the teacher is teachin' the golden rule
american history and practical math
you study 'em hard and hopin' to pass
workin' your fingers right down to the bone
and the guy behind you won't leave you alone

ring, ring goes the bell
the cook in the lunchroom's ready to sell
you're lucky if you can find a seat
you're fortunate if you have time to eat
back in the classroom, open your books
gee but the teacher don't know how mean she looks

soon as three o'clock rolls around
you finally lay your burden down
close up your books, get out of your seat
down the halls and into the street
up to the corner and 'round the bend
right to the juke joint you go in

drop the coin right into the slot
you gotta hear something that's really hot
with the one you love you're makin' romance
all day long, you been wanting to dance
feelin' the music from head to toe
'round and 'round and 'round you go


drop the coin right into the slot
you gotta hear something that's really hot
with the one you love you're makin' romance
all day long, you been wanting to dance
feelin' the music from head to toe
'round and 'round and 'round you go

hail, hail rock'n'roll
deliver me from the days of old
long live rock'n'roll
the beat of the drum is loud and bold
rock rock rock'n'roll
the feelin' is there body and soul

i got lumps in my throat
when i saw her comin' down the aisle
i got the wiggles in my knees
when she looked at me and sweetly smiled
there she is again
standing over by the record machine
lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

meanwhile i was thinking...
well if she's in the mood
no need to break it
i got the chance, and i oughta take it
if she'll dance, then we can make it
come on queenie, let's shake it

go, go, go, little queenie
go, go, go, little queenie
go, go, go, little queenie

tell me, who's the queen
standing over by the record machine
lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

meanwhile, i was still thinkin ...
if it's a slow song, we'll omit it
if it's a rocker, that'll get it
and if it's good, she'll admit it
c'mon queenie, let's get with it

go, go, go, little queenie
go, go, go, little queenie
go, go, go, little queenie

any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

i have no kick against modern jazz
unless they try to play it too darn fast
and change the beauty of the melody
until they sound just like a symphony

that's why i go for that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

i took my loved one over across the tracks
so she can hear my man a-wail a sax
i must admit they have a rockin' band
man they were blowing like a hurricane

any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

way down south they gave a jubilee
the jokey folks they had a jamboree
they're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
the folks dancing got all shook up

and started playing that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

don't care to hear 'em play a tango
ain't in the mood to take a mambo
it's way too early for the congo
so keep a rockin' that piano

so i can hear some of that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

oh well, oh well, i feel so good today
we just touched ground on an international runway
jet propelled back home, from over seas to the u.s.a
new york, los angeles, oh how i yearned for you
detroit, chicago, chattanooga, baton rouge
let alone just to be at my home back in old st. lou
did i miss the skyscrapers, did i miss the long freeway?
from the coast of california to the shores of the delaware bay
you can bet your life i did, till i got back in the u.s.a
looking hard for a drive-in, searching for a corner cafe
where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
yeah, and a jukebox jumping the records like in the u.s.a
well, i'm so glad i'm livin' in the u.s.a
yes i'm so glad i'm livin' in the u.s.a
anything you want, we got it right here in the u.s.a
