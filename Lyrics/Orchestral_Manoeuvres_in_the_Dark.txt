enola gay, you should have stayed at home yesterday
ah-ha, words can't describe the feeling and the way you lied
these games you play, they're gonna end it more than tears someday
ah-ha, enola gay, it shouldn't ever have to end this way

it's 8:15, and that's the time that it's always been
we got your message on the radio, conditions normal and you're coming home


enola gay, is mother proud of little boy today?
ah-ha, this kiss you give, it's never ever gonna fade away


enola gay, it shouldn't ever have to end this way
ah-ha, enola gay, it shouldn't fade in our dreams away

it's 8:15, and that's the time that it's always been
we got your message on the radio, conditions normal and you're coming home
enola gay, is mother proud of little boy today?
ah-ha, this kiss you give, it's never ever gonna fade away 

it's my direction, it's my proposal
it's so hard it's leading me astray
my obsession, it's my creation
you'll understand it's not important now

all i need is co-ordination
i can't imagine my destination
my intention ask my opinion
but no excuse, my feelings still remain

my feelings still remain 

if you leave, don't leave now
please don't take my heart away
promise me, just one more night
then we'll go our separate ways
we've always had time on our side
now it's fading fast
every second, every moment
we've gotta make it last

i touch you once, i touch you twice
i won't let go at any price
i need you now like i need you then
you always said we'd still be friends someday

if you leave i won't cry
i won't waste one single day
but if you leave don't look back
i'll be running the other way
seven years went under the bridge
like time was standing still
heaven knows what happens now
you've gotta say you will
i'll touch you once, i'll touch you twice
i won't let go at any price
i need you now like i need you then
you always said we'd meet again

i touch you once, i touch you twice
i won't let go at any price
i need you now like i need you then
you always said we'd still be friends

i touch you once, i touch you twice
i won't let go at any price
i need you now like i need you then
you always said we'd meet again someday

if you leave
if you leave
if you leave
don't look back
don't look back 

if joan of arc had a heart
would she give it as a gift?
to such as me who longs to see
how an angel
ought to be

her dream is to give her heart away
like an orphan along the way
she cared so much, she offered up
her body to the grave 

little catholic girl is falling in love
a face on a page, gift from above
she should have known better than to give her heart
she should have known better than to ever part
without me
without me
i gave her everything that i ever owned
i think she understood but she never spoke
she should have not tried to be that way
she shouldn't have to go there ever again
without me
without me
now listen to us good, and listen well
listen to the song, everything we tell
we should have known better than to give her away
we should have known better to this very day
without me
without me
listen, joan of arc, all you got to do
say the right words and i'll be coming through
hold you in my arms and take you right away
now she's on her away to another land
we never understood why she gave her hand
she shouldn't ought to promise, cause it's just pretend
i know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again
without me
without me
without me
without me 

talk to me, don't lie to me
save your breath
don't look at me, don't smile at me
just close your eyes
i was so impressed by you
i was running blind
i would fall for every trick
every twist of mind

heaven is cold
without any soul
it's hard to believe
i was so in love with you

don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes
just walk away
don't phone me up, don't call around
don't waste your time
you were so in awe of me
you were so divine
you would do just anything
to still be mine
heaven is cold
without any soul
it's hard to believe
i was so in love with you

all the things you said to me
i was so obsessed
you were always talking talking
god i did my best

heaven is cold
without any soul
it's hard to believe
i was so in love with you 

our one source of energy
the ultimate discovery
electric blue for me
never more to be free
electricity
nuclear and hep
carbon fuels from the sea
wasted electricity
our one source of energy
electricity
all we need to live today
a gift for man to throw away
the chance to change has nearly gone
the alternative is only one
the final source of energy
solar electricity
electricity
electricity
electricity
electricity
electricity

secret
secret
i've got a secret and i can't explain
all the time i've waited for this day
all along i was never in doubt
i've always knew it would never get out
there are things that i cannot tell
and there are things that you know damn well
this is getting very hard for me
i guess you'd better just wait and see
this is all
this is all
secret
you heard a message and the message was clear
all the time you wipe away that tear
all i want is to hold your hand
to see the sun and walk the sand
you make me sad and you make me glad
and now you see all my secret is is love, is love, is love
my secret is this love
everyday you're always there
you comfort me and make me feel it's worth my while
and then i look around and you're not there
and every day you say you care and i'll beware
secret
this is all
this is all
i got a secret and i can't explain (this is all)
secret
all i want is to hold your hand (this is all)
all along i was never in doubt (this is all)
secret
to see the sun and to walk the sand (this is all)
secret
i got a secret and i can't explain (this is all)
secret 

it worries me this kind of thing
how you hope to live alone
and occupy your waking hours
we're taking sides again
i just wept i couldn't understand
why you started this again
and every day you send me more
it makes it worse is this a plan of yours
to ensure i don't forget
i'd write and tell you that i've burnt them all
but you never send me your address
and i've, i've kept them anyway
so don't ask me if i think it's true
that communication can bring hope to those
who have gone their separate ways
it hardly touched me when it should have then
but memories are uncertain friends
when recalled by messages
coded messages
poison letters 

born in kansas
on an ordinary plain
ran to new york
but ran away from fame
only seventeen
when all your dreams came true
but all you wanted
was someone to undress you
and all the stars you kissed
could never ease the pain
still the grace remains
and though the face has changed
you're still the same
and it's a long long way
from where you want to be
and it's a long long way
but you're too blind to see
frame of silence
of an innocence divine
is a dangerous creation
when you fail the test of time
and all the photographs
of ghosts of long ago
still they hurt you so
won't let you go
and you still don't know
and it's a long long way
from where you want to be
and it's a long long way
but you're too blind to see
when you look around yourself now
do you recognize the girl
the one who broke a thousand hearts
terrified the world
and all the stars you kissed
could never ease the pain
and if the face has changed
the grace remains
and you're still the same
and it's a long long way
from where you want to be
and it's a long long way
but you're too blind to see 

you say that love will capture me
but not unless you give it free
we're sailing on the seven seas
sister ray is on tv
the light of love that shines so bright
that the f.b.i. won't sleep tonight
because i'm so in awe of you
that i don't know what to do
and i'm sailing on the seven seas so blue
sick and tired, and i don't know why
skin and bone won't touch the sky
sex and lies can't bring me down
because i've sold my soul all over town
and i'm so in awe of you
that i don't know what to do
and i'm sailing on the seven seas so blue
people try and drag us down
so we learn to swim before we drown
'cause i'm so in awe of you
that i don't know what to do
and i'm sailing on the seven seas so blue
and i'm so in awe of you
that i don't know what to do
and i'm sailing on the seven seas so blue 

the punishment of luxury
is in the air for all to see
and it's ugly now
and it's getting worse everyday
(hey! hey! hey!)

dilettante, savoir faire
can i have my check please sir
cos i'm leaving now
couldn't take it another day
(hey! hey! hey!)

think you're right, think you're free
floating in your purgatory
but you made your choice
and you're living it everyday
(hey! hey! hey!)

lazy girl, dirty boy
surrounded by your broken toys
and you don't know how
to make the pain just go away
(hey! hey! hey!)
so close your eyes, and shut your mouth
you make me want to scream and shout
so close your eyes, and shut your mouth
you make me want to scream and shout
so close your eyes, and shut your mouth
you make me want to scream and shout
(hey! hey! hey!)

the punishment of luxury
is in the air for all to see
(hey! hey! hey!)
the punishment of luxury
is in the air for all to see
(hey! hey! hey!)
the punishment of luxury
is in the air for all to see
(hey! hey! hey!) (for all to see!)
punishment of luxury
is in the air for all to see
(hey! hey! hey!) 

if you were born in heaven, girl, i'd understand so well
but ever since i've met you, child, you've made my life such hell
with every day that passes i fall nearer to the ground
it seems that i've been looking for something that won't be found

i was only dreaming (dreaming)
i was only trying to catch your eye (trying to catch your eye)
i was only wishing you would notice me
instead you said goodbye

could this be the new answer then to all the dreams we've made?
could there be some solution, please, to rid me of this grace?
but every single second that you held me in your arms
you build me up, you raised me up, you killed me with your charms

i was only dreaming (dreaming)
i was only trying to catch your eye (trying to catch your eye)
i was only wishing you would notice me
instead you said goodbye

(dreaming)
(trying to catch your eye)
won't you stay here tonight?
won't you make these feelings last?
can we start this all again?
would that be just too much to ask?
i was only dreaming (dreaming)
i was only trying to catch your eye (trying to catch your eye)
i was only wishing you would notice me
instead you said goodbye
i was only dreaming (dreaming)
i was only trying to catch your eye (trying to catch your eye)
i was only wishing you would notice me
instead you said
goodbye 

everyday
a new start
a cheap affair
a sordid truth
we'll never learn
to guide our hearts
we'll never find
what we deserve

she's leaving
she waited for so long

she'd pretend
that he cared
invent some tale
just to gain his heart
but no more dreams
she didn't dare
she washed her hands
of this whole affair

she's leaving
she waited for so long
but as she left
she gave her heart
abandoned hope
and turned for home
i thought i'd ask
but then again
the more we learn
the less we know 

no, no, no, no
no, no, no
tes-tes-t-t-t-t-tes
tesla girls, tesla girls
testing out theories
electric chairs and dynamos
dressed to kill, they're killing me
but heaven knows their recipe
no, no, no
you wouldn't believe me if i said
the things i've seen went over my head
i've been patient, heaven knows
i've learnt the rules and how it goes
i can't sit still or settle down
and when i walk i don't touch the ground
see those girls, they're heaven blessed
i guess it's so they know best
tesla girls, tesla girls
writing in their diaries
now and then they'll watch tv
now and then they'll speak to me
but heaven knows their recipe
no, no, no, what
you wouldn't believe them if they said
the things they've seen went over their heads
they've been patient, heaven knows
they seem to care and so it goes
they can't sit still or settle down
and when they walk they don't touch the ground
see those girls, they're heaven blessed
i guess it's so they know best
tesla girls
tesla girls
tesla girls
tesla girls
tesla girls, tesla girls
testing out theories
electric chairs and dynamos
dressed to kill they're killing me
tesla girls, tesla girls
i'm in love with tesla girls
now and then they'll watch tv
now and then they'll speak to me
but heaven knows, but heaven knows, but heaven knows their recipe
no, no, no
no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no 

to want this
of everything we've made
the times it's worked before
of all the things we've said
the times it's worked before today

to want this
of everything we've made
the times it's worked before
of all the things we've said
they always worked before today 

when i was only seventeen
my head was full of brilliant dreams
my heart would call and i would gladly go
at twenty one the world was mine
and i was yours and you're divine
and nothing else would matter to us so
i don't believe in destiny
i don't believe in love
i don't believe that anything will ever be enough...
man you should have seen us
on the way to venus
walking on the milky way
it was quite a day hey hey...
walking on the big stuff
acting like we're real tough
baby we were on our way
so what do you say hey hey
as time goes by reality
destroys your hope and dignity
there's nothing left but shadows on the wall
but just remember who you are
and where you've been you've come so far
and never ever let them see you fall
i don't believe in miracles
i don't believe in truth
i don't believe that anything can recreate your youth
man you should have seen us
on the way to venus
walking on the milky way
it was quite a day hey hey...
walking on the big stuff
acting like we're real tough
baby we were on our way
so what do you say hey hey
man you should have seen us
on the way to venus
walking on the milky way
it was quite a day hey hey...
walking on the big stuff
acting like we're real tough
baby we were on our way
so what do you say hey hey
man it's you to seen us this way we runaway with you (x3) 

this is the room
this is the wall
this is the body
i've been hoping for
these are the words
i've been longing just to say
so this is my goal
the aim of my life
this is the feeling
they warned me about
oh my god
what have i done this time
oh my god
what have i done this time
the think that you've done
you don't understand
the feeling the longing
the failing that's gone
(real heart stop in
the arms to be
everything shouting
in the new stone age)
oh my god
what have we done this time
oh my god
what have i done this time
(we'll start living
in the real stone age) 

i've got a telegraph
in my hand
words on paper
written in sand

we've got telegraph (we've got telegraph)
right across this land (all across this land)
it doesn't mean a damn thing
we don't understand
but who needs telegraph anyway?

i've got a telegraph (i've got a telegraph)
in my hand (in my hand)
words on paper (words on paper)

ha ha ha ha ha ha

now that time, it came calling
an angel has fallen
and nothing can be how it's been

and when love seemed so heartless
when light turned to darkness
now only her star can be seen

what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done?
what have we done?
what have we done?

you could talk without speaking
cry without weeping
those secrets will never be told

leave your bonds left unbroken
words left unspoken
and dreams that will never unfold
what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done?
what have we done?
what have we done?

so there's no one to cry for
to lay down and die for
now only the scars can be seen
(ha ha ha ha ha ha)

what have we done? (done done)
what have we done? (done done)
what have we done?
what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done? (done done done)
what have we done?
what have we done?
what have we done?
what have we done?
what have we done?
(ha ha ha ha ha ha)
