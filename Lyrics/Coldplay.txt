come up to meet you, tell you i'm sorry
you don't know how lovely you are
i had to find you, tell you i need you
tell you i set you apart
tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
oh, let's go back to the start
running in circles, coming up tails
heads on a science apart

nobody said it was easy
it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh, take me back to the start

i was just guessing at numbers and figures
pulling the puzzles apart
questions of science, science and progress
do not speak as loud as my heart
tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
oh, and i rush to the start
running in circles, chasing our tails
coming back as we are

nobody said it was easy
oh, it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be so hard
i'm going back to the start

oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning, i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own

i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listened as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead, long live the king

one minute i held the key
next, the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

i hear jerusalem bells a-ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason, i can't explain
once you'd gone, there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world

it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become

revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh, who would ever want to be king?

i hear jerusalem bells a-ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason, i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world

(oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah)
(oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah)

(oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah)
hear jerusalem bells a-ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
(oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah)
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
(oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah)
for some reason, i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world

mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm

look at the stars
look how they shine for you
and everything you do
yeah, they were all yellow
i came along
i wrote a song for you
and all the things you do
and it was called "yellow"
so then i took my turn
oh, what a thing to have done
and it was all yellow

(aah) your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones

i drew a line for you
oh, what a thing to do
and it was all yellow

(aah) your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(ooh) turn into something beautiful
(aah) and you know
for you, i'd bleed myself dry
for you, i'd bleed myself dry

it's true, look how they shine for you
look how they shine for you
look how they shine for
look how they shine for you
look how they shine for you
look how they shine

look at the stars
look how they shine for you
and all the things that you do

when you try your best, but you don't succeed
when you get what you want, but not what you need
when you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
stuck in reverse
and the tears come streaming down your face
when you lose something you can't replace
when you love someone, but it goes to waste
could it be worse?

lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you

and high up above or down below
when you're too in love to let it go
but if you never try, you'll never know
just what you're worth

lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you


tears stream down your face
when you lose something you cannot replace
tears stream down your face, and i
tears stream down your face
i promise you i will learn from my mistakes
tears stream down your face, and i

lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you

oh, they say people come, say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone, and the world may not know
still i see you, celestial

like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
like an eagle, you circled, in perfect purple
so how come things move on? how come cars don’t slow?
when it feels like the end of my world
when i should, but i can’t let you go

but when i’m cold, cold
yeah, when i’m cold, cold
there’s a light that you give me when i’m in shadow
there’s a feelin' within me, everglow

like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
and we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
but the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
life is short as the fallin' of snow
and now i’m gonna miss you, i know

but when i’m cold, cold
in water rolled, salt
and i know that you’re with me and the way you will show
and you’re with me wherever i go
and you give me this feelin', this everglow

oh, what i wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
yeah, i live for this feelin', this everglow

so if you love someone, you should let them know
oh, the light that you left me will everglow

turn your magic on
umi she'd say
everything you want's a dream away
and we are legends, every day
that's what she told me

ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
when she was just a girl
she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach
so she ran away in her sleep

and dreamed of para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
every time she closed her eyes

ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
when she was just a girl
she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach
and the bullets catch in her teeth
life goes on, it gets so heavy
the wheel breaks the butterfly
every tear, a waterfall
in the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
in the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

and dream of para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
she'd dream of para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise

so lying underneath those stormy skies
she said, "oh, oh-oh-oh-oh i know the sun must set to rise"

this could be para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
this could be para-para-paradise
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

a tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

closing walls and tickin' clocks

ee-oh, oh-oh

fixing up a car, driving it again
searching for the water, hoping for the rain
up and up, up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
up and up, up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it's in your blood, it's in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up, up and up, it's saying

we’re gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
we’re gonna get it, get it together i know
gonna get it, get it together and flow
gonna get it, get it together and go
up, and up, and up

lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
up and up, up and up
how come people suffer? how come people part?
how come people struggle? how come people break your heart?
break your heart?
yes i wanna grow, yes i want to feel
yes i wanna know, show me how to heal it up
heal it up
see the forest there in every seed
angels in the marble waiting to be freed
just need love, just need love
when the going is rough, saying

we’re gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
we’re gonna get it, get it together i know
gonna get it, get it together and flow
gonna get it, get it together and go

and you can say what is, or fight for it
close your mind or take a risk
you can say it’s mine and clench your fist
or see each sunrise as a gift


we’re gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
we’re gonna get it, get it together i know
gonna get it, get it together and flow
gonna get it, get it together and go
up, and up, and
we’re gonna get it, get it together right now

fixing up a car to drive in it again
when you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
don’t ever give up

oh no, i see
a spider web is tangled up with me
and i lost my head
and thought of all the stupid things i'd said

oh no, what's this?
a spider web, and i'm caught in the middle
so i turned to run
and thought of all the stupid things i'd done

and i, i never meant to cause you trouble
and i, i never meant to do you wrong
and i, well, if i ever caused you trouble
and oh no, i never meant to do you harm

oh no, i see
a spider web, and it's me in the middle
so i twist and turn
but here am i in my little bubble

singing that i never meant to cause you trouble
i never meant to do you wrong
and i, well, if i ever caused you trouble
oh no, i never meant to do you harm

they spun a web for me
they spun a web for me
they spun a web for me

i could be you, you could be me
two raindrops in the same sea
you could be me, i could be you
two angles of the same view
and we share the same blood


comme deux gouttes d’eau
on se ressemble
comme provenant de la même mère
comme deux ruisseaux (you could be me)
qui se rassemblent (i could be you)
pour faire les grandes rivières
and we share the same blood
yeah, we share the same blood


and we share the same blood
yeah, we share the same blood

music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future

same fucking blood
same fucking blood

been rusting in the rubble
running to a faint

found myself in trouble
thinking about what ain't
never gonna be a saint

saying float like an eagle
fall like the rain
pouring to put out the pain
oh again and again

now i'm hyp, hypnotised
yeah i trip, when i look in your eyes
oh i'm hyp, hypnotized
yeah i slip and i'm mesmerized

it's easy to be lethal
i'm learning from the news
it's a guidebook for the blues
saying it's the very same steeple
people want to choose
they just see it from different views

and threading the needle
fixing my flame
oh now i'm moved to exclaim
oh again, and again

how i'm hyp, hypnotised
yeah i trip, when i look in your eyes
oh i'm hyp, hypnotized
yeah i lift and i'm mesmerized

oh again, and again
oh i'm hyp, hypnotised

oh i'm hyp, hypnotised
it was dark
