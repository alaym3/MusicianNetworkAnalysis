i buried my heart in a hole in the ground
with the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
they threw me a party, there was no one around
they tried to call my girl but she could not be found
i buried my guilt in a pit in the sound
with the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
so don't step to me, kid, you'll never be found
cause while you were sleeping, i took over your town

when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya

i fell for a girl with a port-wine stain
i knew her initials but never her name
i tried and i tried and i was never the same
so no longer felt love and i'm forever changed

when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar

when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
i’m a sycophantic animal, i’m a sycophantic fool
i’m a sycophantic fool, i know
break up the chain, i'll break up the chain, i'll break it
give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
see you again, i'll see you again, i'll see ya
give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i feel low, when i feel low, i feel it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya 

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
what i give, it takes away
whether i go or when i stay
i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
i see a fire out by the lake
i'll drive my car without the brakes
i see a mountain in my way
it's looming larger by the day
i see a darkness in my fate
i'll drive my car without the brakes

oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
and my desire wears a dark dress
ah, each day, i see you less
oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

through lanes and stone rows
black granite, wind blows
fire lake and far flame
go now but come again
dark clouds gather 'round
will i run or stand my ground?

oh, when i come to climb
show me the mountain so far behind
yeah, it's farther away
its shadow gets smaller day after day

yeah, gimme my way
gimme my love
gimme my choice
you keep me coming around
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my voice
you keep me coming around
gimme my lungs
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my choice
you keep me coming 'round 

so i walked into the haze
and a million dirty waves
now i see you lying there
like a lilo losing air, air
black rocks and the shoreline surf
still dead summer i cannot bear
and i wipe the sand from my eyes
the spanish sahara, the place that you'd wanna
leave the horror here

forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust
forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust

now the waves they drag you down
carry you to broken ground
but i'll find you in the sand
wipe you clean with dirty hands
so god damn this boiling space
the spanish sahara, the place that you'd wanna
leave the horror here
forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust

i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am

forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust, it's future dust
a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am 

you don’t have my number
we don’t need each other now
we don’t need the city
the creed or the culture now

cause i feel, well, i feel alive
i feel, well, i feel alive
i feel the streets are not pulling me down

so people of the city
i don’t need your counsel now
and i don’t need your good advice
cause you don’t have my lover’s touch

you don’t have my number
we don’t need each other now
the creed or the culture
we can move beyond it now

now the wolf is knocking at my door
bang-bang, it asks for more
stand here, we stand tall
we can move beyond these walls
and i don’t need your counsel
and i don’t need these city streets
and i don’t need that good advice
cause we can move beyond it now

you don’t have my number
we don’t need each other now
the creed or the culture
you don’t have my lover’s touch

cause i feel, well, i feel alive
i feel, well, i feel alive
i feel the streets are not far from here

can you even hear me?
do you even know my name?
can you see the ocean there?
you don't have my lover's touch
you don't have my number
you don't have my number
i wonder, can you hear me?
and are you even listening now?
'cause you don’t have my number
and we don’t need each other now
and you can’t steal my thunder
cause you don’t have my lover’s touch

you don’t have my number
and i don’t need no one now
and i don’t need these city streets
the creed or the culture now
now
now 

now the sea eats the sky
but they say it's a lie
there's no birds left to fly
we'll hide out
oh, the weather's against us
houses underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
in the eye of the storm
the land where you were born
try to make no sound
we hide out
'cause they watch us in sleep
the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i said i'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting around
i wish i could've come up
i could've shouted out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down
in a world upside down
oh, to dream this all off
in the islands of the mind
the places they can't find
we'll hide out
and the black sky came down
and the cities underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
oh, to meet you again
to pass you on the stairs
to see you everywhere
in my dreams
'cause they watch us in sleep
and the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

to ourselves in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i said i'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting around
i wish i could've come up
i could've shouted out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down
i said i'm so sorry
that the world has fallen down
i wish i could do something more
i could shout it out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down
in a world upside down


(up)
(upside down, oh)
(upside down, oh)
(upside down, oh)

back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
i hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
we share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
i hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
we share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer 

the city i was born in
i left a long time ago
and we lost touch
grew apart my friend
my heart's an old pole dancer
troubled romancer, you know
it's a subway chancer
a question with no answer

come meet me by the river
see how time it flows
i'll meet you by the river
see how time it flows

and when we age
shed our skin and grow
we shed our layers
spread our wings and go
my heart's an old black panther
corrupted financer, you know
it's a troubled romancer
a question with no answer
come meet me by the river
see how time it flows
i'll meet you by the river
see how time it flows

come meet me by the river
see how time it flows
i'll meet you by the river
see how time it flows

ooooh, oooooh
(yeah) ooooh
(yeah) ooooh

oh now the river runs away but i chase it (yeah)
time holds no fear when i turn round to face it (yeah)
oh now the river runs away when i chase it (yeah)
time holds no fear when i turn round to face it (yeah)

come meet me by the river
see how time it flows
i'll meet you by the river
see how time it flows
oh now the river runs away but i chase it
time holds no fear when i turn round to face it
oh now the river runs away when i chase it
time holds no fear when i turn round to face it 

oh, i hoped that you were somebody
someone i could count
to pull me to my feet again
when i was in doubt
oh now, mama, do you hear me
calling out your name?
oh now, mama do you hear me
calling out your name?
calling out your name

now i'm the last cowboy in this town
empty veins and my plastic broken crown
they said i swam the seas then ran aground
they said i once was lost but now i'm truly found
and i know the place but not the way
i feel, i feel no shame
oh now, mama, do you hear my fear?
it's coming after me
calling out your name
calling out your name

stay with me
stay with me
but you threw your heart away
oh, i know just what to say
that the concorde, it can wait
we have still got time to say
and i know you ran away
oh, i know my feeling okay?
but now i've found love, the feeling won't go
now i found love, the feeling won't go
see you walk away
feeling okay now
happy now?

stay with me
stay with me
stay with me
stay with me
 

i'm on the red eye flight to nowhere good
how 'bout you?
i've been in the air for hours
meteor showers by the pool
so one last drink for summer
i'm always leaving, never you
come back to london thunder
the sound has sorrowed in my room
ye-yeah

and now the table's turned,  it's over
and with my fingers burned, i start anew
and now i've come back down, i'm older
i look for something else to hold on to

there's no way to realign
upholstered skin, i take back every line
lost my mind in san francisco
worn out disco when tempers cooled
there's no water
there is no sound
will you come around?
will you come around?
there is no space
there is no time
where to draw the line?
and now the table's turned,  it's over
and with my fingers burned, i start anew
and now i've come back down, i'm older
i look for something else to hold on to

i'm on the red eye flight to nowhere good
how 'bout you? 

give me something i haven't seen
give me the red light turning green
give me the words but not the page
give me it all
give me the time but not an age
give me a look but not the rage
give me the feel for where i'll go
give me it all
give me the way it could have been
give me the ghost that's on the screen
give me the way but not the means
give me it all
give me something i haven't seen
give me the red light turning green
give me the words but not the page
give me it all

i called you up three times last night
running through the streets, bloody from a fist fight
keep you warm, keep you there, wanna keep you all

see you there, wanna see you some day
as you look back, i'm pulling away
you caught the bus and i caught the train
all that remains are words in the rain
ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh
ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh

give me the shade of a thunder cloud
give me a good-bye said out loud
give me the day with no memory
give me it all
i know you could be here with me
by the rain and the palm of the valley
but you're there by the tube stop in the freezing rain

see you there, wanna see you some day
as you look back, i'm pulling away
you caught the bus and i caught the train
all that remains are words in the rain, rain, rain, rain

ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh
ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh

so, so long
i see you there
you fall like a fifty weight
the time goes
i'll be right there
i feel, i feel there's a fork in the road
oh-woah-woah
oh-woah-woah 

shadow, see how far i go
(step by step, i'll keep it up, i won't slow, i gotta go)
walk through the embers, through the rows
(with every shadow step i take, i'll make sure that i won't break)
show them all just what i know
(while the years, they come and go, i won't let myself get slow)
'cause they all just come and go
(with every step that i will take, i'll make sure that i won't break)

oh, if i fall down, fall down
then i know to keep on running
oh, if i fall down, fall down
then i know to keep on running

and if it hurts, don't let it show
(step by step, i'll keep it up, i won't slow, i gotta go)
while the seasons come and go
(with every shadow step i take, i'll make sure that i won't break)
shadow chiaroscuro
(while the years, they come and go, i won't let myself get slow)

when i, when i fall down, fall down
then i know to keep on running
oh, when i fall down, fall down
won't you come to keep me running?
yeah, i keep on running
well, i keep on running
loneliness of the long distance runner
shadow, come closer, so i'll go on further
loneliness of the long distance runner
shadow, come closer, so i'll go on further
loneliness of the long distance runner
shadow, come closer, so i'll go on further
loneliness of the long distance runner
shadow, come closer, so i'll go on further

oh, when i fall down, fall down
then i know to keep on running
oh, if i fall down, fall down
then i know to keep on running (woah)

fall down, when i slow down (keep on running)
slow down (keep on running)
oh, i slow down (keep on running)
when i fall down, keep on running
keep on running
keep on running
keep on running 

when i come to walk the line
the fire may come, but we'll be just fine
when i go to walk the line
the fire, it'll come but we'll be just fine

mouth of the ocean, be well spoken
watch your p's and q's
now that we're older, the future is colder
but what is there to do?
i'll walk the line, i'll be just fine
i'll be right back on time
the fire is coming, but we'll outrun it
we'll never be undone

oh, what came of the things we once believed?
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
oh, what came of the things we once believed?
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

and now our parents are long departed
who can finish the songs they started?
bodies are broken, but it's just a token
of what is surely to come
unstitch the suture, please pause the future
so i can collect my things
the fire is coming, but we'll outrun it
we'll never be undone
oh, what came of the things we once believed?
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
oh, what came of the things i once believed?
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

when i go to walk the line
the fire it comes, but i'll be just fine

oh, what came of the things we once believed?
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
oh, all lost and, oh, all lost, to the depths of a hungry sea
oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
all that's left, all that's left
is the echo of a roaring sea
long gone, long gone
to the trace of a memory
what came of the things i once believed?
all that's left, all that is left
is the trace of a memory 

it's a new day
just in time for me to say "i'm sorry"
for all the things i said but didn't mean
it's a new time
so why must i wait in line for what's mine?
it's a new day
why must it be the same?

been gone too long, so don't wait up
it's 3 am, i got held up
tried to call, i'm on my way

will i see you? i got lost in foreign lands
tried to get back, oh, i hoped you understand
just remember, that love is a gun in your hand

it's a new year
just in time for me to say "i'd be there"
but didn't make the grade
it's a new time
so why must i wait in line for what's mine?
it's a new day
always feels the same
been gone too long, so don't wait up
it's 3 am, i got held up
tried to call, i'm on my way

will i see you? i got lost in foreign lands
tried to get back, oh, i hoped you understand
wait forever
for love is a gun in your hand
in the deep blue, i'm a hundred miles away
treading water, it's too deep for me to stay
just remember, love is the gun in your hand

just in time for me to say "i'm sorry"
why must i wait in line for what's mine?

in the deep blue, see the whitecaps from the shore
but i can't swim, and it keeps me wanting more
just remember, love is a gun in your hand
will i see you?
i got lost in foreign lands
tried to make it back, oh, i hoped you understand
wait forever, for love is a gun in your hand 

we're caught up in silence
i lose you in degrees
see you through the glass doors

i’ve looked all up and down now
i lose you in degrees
come back around my way again
see me if you please
i'm tongue tied in silence
my words lost on the breeze
caught up in your orbit still
release me if you please

i lose you in degrees
don't leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don’t leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don't leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don't leave me on my knees

i saw the black rain pouring
a lost love on display
bit by bit and day by day
i know we've lost our way
and i hear your final footsteps
i've lost you by degrees
pressed up to the glass door
i couldn't watch you leave
i lose you in degrees
don't leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don't leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don’t leave me on my knees
i lose you in degrees
don’t leave me on my knees

when i was a latchkey kid on the luna
a free-from-guilt born babyboomer
can't you pick me up a little bit sooner?
i’ve been waiting all day, all day
when i was wasting my days at the lido
i was picking my teeth with a biro
i was keeping it cool with cryo
waiting all day, all day

infiltrator, hesitater, won't you come emancipator?

you got an albatross around your neck
around your neck
you got a hundred broken lightbulbs above your head
they said that you had it coming but i wouldn't bet
cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb and then you see red

sunblind
sunblind

you got an albatross around your neck
around your neck
you got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed
and you got a hungry green eyed monster that you keep fed
and it keeps on coming over it wants you dead

sunblind
sunblind

you burnt the lungs
that your ancestors created
you sat by the banks
of the river and you waited
till time rolled back
and the water had abated
you drank your share
but you still could not be sated
quicksands of the mind
and the sinkholes you may find
when you look through
the twisting of the vines
(the twisting of the vines)
time comes round again
it's etching at your bones
chill wind comes round
it's blowing through your home
quicksands of the mind
and the sinkholes you may find
when you look through
the twisting of the vines

you burnt the lungs
that your ancestors created
you sat by the banks
of the river and you waited
till time rolled back
and the water had abated
you drank your share
but you still could not be sated
you said you're scared
of the clocks that keep ticking over
we'll find a way
for a life that's worth living over
again and again
for a life that's worth living over
again and again
for a life that's worth living over
again and again
again and again and again
again again
again and again and again 

if you come again
i'll be sure to send
the tide to come meet you
and if i come again
please be sure to send
the moon to come meet me

i'll eat up all your pain, take in all the blame
be that someone to complain to
i'll be like water when you rise
plant a jasmine in the night

where i return
there's a moon pool on fire
into the surf again
there's a moon pool in bloom

if you come again
i'll be sure to send
the tide to come meet you
and if i come again
please be sure to send
the moon to come meet me
there's a lighthouse in the dark, a garden in the past
under bruisings of a night sky
be like water, when i rise
plant a jasmine in the night

when i return
there's a moon pool on fire
into the surf again
there's a moon pool in bloom

there's a serpent on the beach
if i'm out of reach
place a garland in the sea for me

when the tide comes rolling in
please be sure to send
a blood moon for me
a garland in the sea
and if i don't make it home

blood moon for me
a garland in the sea
and if i don't make it home

hey, now it's time to go
from the white wards of england
the crows line the rivers and roads
i wanna walk where i know
through the olive groves
the sky that knows my name
it gave me away
the magnolia moon
like an eggshell, a white bell
to lighten my cold room
so let me sleep where i lay
with a murder of crows
that live in the boughs of my brain

see me when i float like a dove
skies above lined with trees
i'm on my knees, i'm singing, please
come and take me away

time brings low all good things
when you open your eyes
when you open your eyes
now in the vastness of pines
where my ghost lies in loose-limbed array
i pass the time
and go upload my heart to the fatal shore
forevermore, it spins there behind closed doors
now, it's time to go through the fields of chrome
the rusted homes abandoned at the remains of the day
so come on, row me away
on black rivers and rainbows to neptune
where i can stay
see me when i float like a dove
the skies above lined with trees
i'm on my knees, i'm begging, please
come and take me away
come take me away
come take me away

time brings low the best of things
when you open your eyes
when you open your eyes, eyes
time brings low all good things
when we open our eyes
when we open our eyes


oh, i've waited so long
on the slow shores of england
to sing my last song
so come row me away
on black rivers and rainbows to neptune
where i can stay
see me when i float like a dove
the skies above lined with trees
i'm on my knees, begging, please
come and take me away
come take me away
come take me away 

time has come and time is gone
cities burn, we got youth to spend
and time to waste in love
to live again, my friend
through the flames and through the fire
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

'cause time away from me
is what i need to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over
coming down over
i'll be right there, i'm coming down over it
coming down over again

oh, oh-oh-oh
oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
oh, oh-oh-oh
oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

when all is said and all is done
our fathers run and leave all the damage
they've done behind
left us with the blind leading the blind
and time has come and time is done
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend
time away from me is what i need
to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over
coming down over
i'll be right there, i'm coming down over it
coming down over again

be right there, i'll be right there
down i go, i'll scream, i'll go down again
i feel my blood, i did my time
i'm deep in my head, i'm deep in my way
i'm deep in my soul
here i go
i'll be right there

i'm over it now, over it now, over it, i'm over it
over it, over it, over it
going over it, over and over it
finally over it, over it, over it
over and over it, over and over it
i mean over it, over and over it
over it, over and over it
over and over it
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
(the birds are all singing)
(the birds are all singing)
(the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world")
time away from me is what i need
to clear my sight and clear my head, clear my head
clear my head
clear my head 

i got to rip up the road
i got two nights in a row
oh, we gon' put on a show
with a black bull in tow
i’m in that holy ghost zone
i got a trunk full of gold
don't look at me like that
don't look at me like this
ooh

can you remember my name?
i swear you’re all just the same
ooh, tu parlais anglais?
can o' stella, fish fillet?
in a foreshortened future
i saw you drinking kombucha
and it really don't suit ya
and i'm not the waiter
ooh

i got a black bull in town
i call a wolf a wolf
this for real, ain't no spoof
i'm breaking bones on the roof
who me? i'm not aloof
forsooth, for shame
i done conquered where i came
and i'm a world away
’cause i’m a man of today

he not playing around
the black bull's in town
the black bull’s in town
he not playin' around
