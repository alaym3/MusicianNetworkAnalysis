listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding

there were seven spanish angels
at the altar of the sun
they were praying for the lovers
in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels
took another angel home

she reached down and picked the gun up
that lay smoking in his hand
she said, "father please forgive me
i can't make it without my man"
and she knew the gun was empty
and she knew she couldn't win
but her final prayer was answered
when the rifles fired again

at the altar of the sun
they were praying for the lovers

oh some rain, rain must pour
i'm so blue here without you
it keeps raining more and more
why don't you come on home?
oh yes, so i won't be all alone
if you don't think you'll be home soon
i guess i'll (drown in my own tears)
ooh, don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
when i'm in trouble, baby
(drown in my own tears)
oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
i guess i'll drown in my own tears
oh, mmmmm

am i blue? am i blue?
ain't these tears in these eyes telling you?

am i blue? you'll be too
if your schemes, like your dreams, done fell through

was a time i was her only one
now i am the sad and lonely one
oh yes i am

was i gay? till today
now she's gone and we're through
am i blue?

was a time i was her only one
now i am the sad and lonely one
i'm such a lonely one

was i gay? till today
now she's gone and we're through
am i blue?
