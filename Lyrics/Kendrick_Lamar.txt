pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' tetris
am to the pm, pm to the am, funk
piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
if i quit your bm, i still ride mercedes, funk
if i quit this season, i still be the greatest, funk
my left stroke just went viral

if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear—
yawk! yawk! yawk! yawk!

man down, where you from, nigga?
fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga

brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l boog, and yan yan, yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door, fuck is up?
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's, ar's, "ayy, y'all—duck!"
that's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
when we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, i guess
m.a.a.d. city

man down, where you from, nigga?
fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga

if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear—
yawk! yawk! yawk!—


wake yo' punk-ass up!
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, real simple and plain
let me teach you some lessons about the street
(smoke somethin', nigga!)
hood ('sup, cuz?)
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, how we do

fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact, i got fired, 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. "compton's human sacrifice"

g-yeah, cocaine, weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
dip, make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra, rosecrans, bullis, it's compton

i'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
shit, the hood took me under, so i follow the rules
but yeah, that's like me, i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay, the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
mount up, regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
trip, we in the hood still
so, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
perceive me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat?
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn, they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
probably go to the projects, i
live inside the belly of the rough, compton, usa
made me an angel on angel dust - what?

​m.a.a.d city
compton

nigga, pass dot the bottle, damn!
you ain't the one that got fucked up
what you holdin' it for?
niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
nigga, that ain't no word
nigga, shut up!
hey, dot, you good, my nigga?
don't even trip
just lay back and drink that

pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
faded (drank), faded (drank)

now i done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
backstroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
i was in a dark room, loud tunes
lookin' to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup i see the crowd mood
changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
po-pool full of liquor, i'ma dive in it

pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
faded (drank), faded (drank)

okay, now open your mind up and listen me, kendrick
i am your conscience, if you do not hear me
then you will be history, kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now
and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory, kendrick
if i take another one down
i'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe, i see the love in her eyes
i see the feelin', the freedom is granted
as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
this how you capitalize, this is parental advice
then apparently, i'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
i thought i was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
po-pool full of liquor, i'ma dive in it

pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
faded (drank), faded (drank)

i ride, you ride, bang
one chopper, one hundred shots, bang
hop out, do you bang?
two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
i ride, you ride, bang
one chopper, one hundred shots, bang
hop out, do you bang?
two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
po-pool full of liquor, i'ma dive in it

faded (drank), faded (drank)

(pool full of kendrick's lies in it)
aw man… where is she takin' me?
where is she takin' me?
(pool full of liquor ima die in it)

all i, all i, all i, all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane
tell me, do that sound familiar?
if it do, then you're like me
makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open i release
everything that corrode inside of me
i see you jokin', why you laugh?
don't you feel bad? i probably sleep
and never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
in god i trust, but just when i thought i had enough

they stomped the homie out over a bitch?
k-dot, you good, blood?
now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
that nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
we gon' do the same ol' shit
i'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways

and he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
and i hope that bitch that set him up out there

dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
eat at four daughters, brock wearin' sandals
yoga on a monday, stretchin' to nirvana
watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes

yesterday, i got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
he was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the lord had done
he said: "k-dot, can you pray for me? it been a fucked up day for me
i know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
he was lookin' for some closure, hopin' i could bring him closer
to the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but i told him
"i can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how i feel:
if somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
all the memories collected, moments you could never touch
i wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
i catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all i got
i chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!"
ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
i can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
it be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
you should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
matter fact, i'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(pray for me) damn!

it's not a place
this country is to me a sound
of drum and bass
you close your eyes to look around

hail mary, jesus and joseph
the great american flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
it's murder on my street, your street, back streets, wall street
corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
homicidal thoughts; donald trump's in office
we lost barack and promised to never doubt him again
but is america honest, or do we bask in sin?
pass the gin, i mix it with american blood
then bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?
i'll aks again—oops, accident
it's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
you overnight the big rifles, then tell fox to be scared of us
gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
america's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

it's not a place
this country is to me a sound
of drum and bass
you close your eyes to look ar—

i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me
lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it, but today i'm yelling

bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe

look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes
i can feel a new life, i always knew life can be dangerous
i can say that i like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture
when the color blind is hangin' with you?
fell on my face and awoke with a scar
another mistake livin' deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every making of his?
tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge
even a small lighter can burn a bridge

i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
to you that's a quick check
with all disrespect, let me say this

i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me
lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it, but today i'm yelling

bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe

i'm tryin' to keep it alive
and not compromise the feeling we love
you're tryin' to keep it deprived
and only co-sign what radio does
and i'm lookin' right past you
we live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
you live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
i know what you scared of
the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to
this shit is vital, i know you had to
die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
rather a seasonal name
i'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
i'ma break out and then hide every lock
i'ma break out and then hide every lock

i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
to me, that's amazin'
to you that's a quick check
with all disrespect, let me say this

i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me
lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it, but today i'm yelling

bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe

bitch, don't kill my vibe
you ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
don't you see that long line?
and they waiting on kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
threes in the air, i can see you are in sync
hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal

bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
walk out the door and they scream it's alive
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
talk too motherfuckin' much, i got my drink, i got my music

i say bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe


ayy, k-dot, get in the car, nigga!
come on, we finna roll out!
nigga, i got a pack of blacks and a beat cd
get yo' freestyles ready!

every second, every minute
man, i swear that she can get it
say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
hands up high, hands up high
tell 'em dim the lights down right now
put me in the mood
i'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

i recognize your fragrance
hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
uh, and i know your taste is
a little bit, hmm, high maintenance
uh, everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it?
i mean, i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
better yet, where your friends and 'em?
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends
and y'all curled in that little bitty range
i heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga, don't approach her with that atari
nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation rule a nation, i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs
'less i write it down for real, p.s

you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

i really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs
and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
young east african girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
i was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland
i could do it, maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
you were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
i mean, i write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin
and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
good god, what you doin' that walk for?
when i see that thing move
i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
they say communication save relations, i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
unless i write 'em down for real, p.s

you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

every time i write these words they become a taboo
makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it? i mean, you need to hear this
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
i mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference, it's coherent, i can hear it
uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, p.s

you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song

"i'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
where is you from? or it is a problem."
"ayy, you over here for sherane, homie?"
"yo, i don't care who this nigga over here for
if he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! i'm sorry."
"hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
i'ma tell you where i'm from, okay?
you gon' tell me where you from, okay?
or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"enough with all this talkin'."
"matter of fact, get out the van, homie! get out the car before i snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"

i got a bone to pick
i don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
sittin' in my throne again
ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
k-dot back in the hood, nigga!
i'm mad (hey mad!), but i ain't stressin'
true friends, one question

bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams—(what's the yams?)

the yam is the power that be
you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
(oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
i can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
what the fuck happened? (oh no!)
i swore i wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (a two-man cell)
something's in the water (something's in the water)
and if i gotta brown-nose for some gold
then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (oh yeah!)

bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams—(what's the yams?)

the yam brought it out of richard pryor
manipulated bill clinton with desires
twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
i was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (oh yeah)

bitch, where you when i was walkin'?

king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah

king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

you goat-mouth mammyfucker
i was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
this shit is elementary, i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "compton!"
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done, to be honest
and i put that on my momma and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
aw, yeah, fuck the judge
i made it past twenty-five, and there i was
a little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin', "annie, are you okay? annie, are you okay?"
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (oh yeah)

bitch, where you when i was walkin'—*gunshot*
by the time you hear the next pop
the funk shall be within you—*gunshot*
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

what you want you, a house⁠? you, a car?
forty acres and a mule? a piano, a guitar?
anything, see my name is lucy, i'm your dog
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
i can see the evil, i can tell it, i know it's illegal
i don't think about it, i deposit every other zero
thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the regal
digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico... ah!
i don't talk about it, be about it, every day i sequel
if i got it then you know you got it, heaven, i can reach you
pat dawg, pat dawg, pat dawg, my dog, that's all
bick back and chad, i trap the bag for y'all
i rap, i black on track so rest assured
my rights, my wrongs; i write 'til i'm right with god

wouldn't you know
we been hurt, been down before
nigga, when our pride was low
lookin' at the world like, "where do we go?"
nigga, and we hate po-po
wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
nigga, i'm at the preacher's door
my knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
but we gon' be alright

nigga, we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright

do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
huh? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright

i keep my head up high
i cross my heart and hope to die
lovin' me is complicated
too afraid of a lot of changes
i'm alright, and you're a favorite
dark nights in my prayers

i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence, sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin' in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self-destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin' for answers

everything black, i don't want black (they want us to bow)
i want everything black, i ain't need black (down to our knees)
some white, some black, i ain't mean black (and pray to the god)
i want everything black (we don't believe)
everything black, want all things black
i don't need black, want everything black
don't need black, our eyes ain't black
i own black, own everything black

six in the morn'
fire in the street
burn, baby, burn (you, you, you, you, you)
that's all i wanna see (you, you, you, you, you)
and sometimes i get off watchin' you die in vain
it's such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
but homie, you made me (you, you, you, you, you)
black don't crack, my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feelin' this way since i was sixteen, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american, i'm african, i'm black as the moon
heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fuckin' evil
i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin' my feelings, i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the bigger i shoot

i said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
and man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
how you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean, it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me 'til i'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
that i'ma be just another slave in my head
institutionalized manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me, don't you?
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin' me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can i help you?
how can i tell you i'm making a killin'?
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the bigger i shoot

i said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
and man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
how you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fuckin' aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius, excuse my french
but fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, i can tell 'cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you in love with that desert eagle
thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin' with pirus, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state "marcus garvey got all the answers"
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken, and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet 'cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
hypocrite!

when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow
i'm hopin' that i can borrow
a peace of mind, i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck
had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
my plan's rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride it's a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back, whispering "get 'em!"
i got 'em and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngin
in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child, i'm proud and well-devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'ma push it, wherever, whenever
and i love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop, i hope— 

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section.80
the message resembled "brenda's got a baby"
what's crazy was i was hearin' about it
but doubted your ignorance
how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
judgin' her past and shit?
well, it's completely my future
her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
and i'ma need that forty dollars
even if i got to fuck, suck and swallow
in the parking lot, gonzales park, i'm followed
by a married man, and father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes, i run away and never do miss 'em
see, my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em
back to where they used to be, then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
then you probably need to beat her, that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room, first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted, but fuck that "sorry for your loss" shit
my sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in?
i'll wait… your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date, just make sure i'm not in the song
'cause i don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact, did i mention that i physically feel great?
a doctor's approval is a waste of time, i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away, i'll never fade away, i know my fate
and i'm on the grind for this cake, i'ma get it or die tryin'
i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
you lyin' to these motherfuckers
talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

sometimes i look in the mirror
and ask myself: am i really scared of passin' away?
if it's today, i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
the scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon, and if i'm doomed
may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'ma rest
and you're right, your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak on somethin'
that's realer than the tv screen
by any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
her personal life, i was like "it need to be told"
cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly what'd happen if i ain't continue rappin'
or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
i count lives, all on these songs
look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
am i worth it? did i put enough work in?

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh


(on the phone)
"ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"
"nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"

"bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. like... nigga, i don't give a fuck, my nigga. we can go back right now."
"fuck! i'm tired of this shit! i'm tired of fuckin' runnin', i'm tired of this shit! my brother, homie!"

tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
my own kind, but retirin' nothin'
tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

dope on the corner, look at the coroner
daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
stray bullets, ak bullets
resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
bring her back, who got the footage?
channel 9, cameras is lookin'
it's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
banana clip, split his banana pudding
i'm like tre, that's cuba gooding
i know i'm good at
dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

how many sins? i'm runnin' out
how many sins? i lost count
dreams of ballin' like spalding
but only shotty bounce
the reaper callin', i'm cottonmouth
money is power (money is power)
yours is ours (yours is ours)
lay with a snitch, die with a coward
hope we get rich, hope we can tower
over the city with vanity with the music louder
the same song, a black flower
i'll show you how to
dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

what are we doin'? who are we foolin'?
hell is hot, fire is proven
to burn for eternity, return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
now back to business, loadin' the guns in
back of the buick, your hood is feudin'
the beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
hereditary, all of my cousins
dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

too many sins, i'm runnin' out
somebody send me a well for the drought
see all i know is takin' notes
on takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
my best days, i stress days
(lord, forgive me for all my sins, for i not know—)
my best days, i stress days
say "fuck the world," my sex slave
money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
whatever it is, know it's my next grave
tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
my momma say "see, a pastor give me a promise
what if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
the truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
you dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
so hop in that water, and pray that it works."

fuck! i’m tired of this shit!
i’m tired of fuckin' runnin', i’m tired of this shit!
that’s my brother, homie!
young man, come talk to me! is that what i think that is?
i know that's not what i think that is
why are you so angry?
see, you young men are dying of thirst
do you know what that means?
that means you need water, holy water
you need to be baptized, with the spirit of the lord
do you want to receive god as your personal savior?
okay, repeat after me:
"lord god, i come to you a sinner."
(lord god, i come to you a sinner)
"and i humbly repent for my sins."
(and i humbly repent for my sins)
"i believe that jesus is lord."
(i believe that jesus is lord)
"i believe you raised him from the dead."
(i believe you raised him from the dead)
"i would ask that jesus come into my life."
(i would ask that jesus come in my life)
"and be my lord and savior."
(and be my lord and savior)
"i receive jesus to take control of my life."
(i receive jesus to take control of my life)
"and that i may live for him from this day forward."
(and that i may live for him from this day forward)
"thank you, lord jesus
for saving me with your precious blood."
(thank you, lord jesus
for saving me with your precious blood)
"in jesus' name, amen."
(in jesus' name, amen)
alright now, remember this day
the start of a new life – your real life

i promised dave i'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
he said, "think about what you saying: "fuck niggas"
no better than samuel on the django
no better than a white man with slave boats"
sound like i needed some soul searching
my pops gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i'ma dedicate this one verse to oprah
on how the infamous, sensitive n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well, this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
n-e-g-u-s description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlook the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put my game in a song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me, or say it no more
black stars can come and get me
take it from oprah winfrey, tell her she right on time
kendrick lamar, by far, realest negus alive

uh-uh, fuck that

eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

man, i swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
pick him up, then i set him in cold water
then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope that take the pain away
from the feelin' that he feel today
you know when you part of section.80
you feel like no one can relate
'cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
i'm in the house party trippin' off
my generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
never no pancakes in the kitchen
man, not one of our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
who gives a fuck? we never do listen
'less it comes with an 808 (a melody and some hoes)
playstation and some drank (technology bought my soul)
lookin' around and all i see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
yep, her president is black, she black too
purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
she take it straight to the head, then she look at me
she got adhd

eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(they always told me adhd did it)
woah, woah-woah

and then she started
and then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
"beg your pardon? oh, i rap, baby, how old are you?"
she say twenty-two, i say twenty-three, "okay, then we are crack babies," damn
"why you say that?" she said, "where my drink at?"
"i'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax"
i stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, jumbotron
made to the back where she reside, then she said, "read between the lines," yep
hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up when the nuvo start to drown
her body, and i know the both of us really deep in the mood now
it's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (woah)
of that bay area kush, she looked at me, then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "get it understood"
"you know why we crack babies? because we born in the '80s
the adhd crazy"

eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(they always told me adhd did it)
woah, woah-woah

i'm high now (huh), i'm high now (huh)
i'm high now (huh), i'm high now (huh)
life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(pull them panties to the side now)
i don't think i could find a way to make it on this earth

i'll prolly die anonymous, i'll prolly die with promises
i'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
i'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
i'll prolly die because i ain't know demarcus was snitchin'
i'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
i'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
i'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
i'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause i'm movin' too fast
i'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
i'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
i'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
all worries in a hurry, i wish i controlled things

if i could smoke fear away, i'd roll that mothafucker up
and then i'd take two puffs
(i've been hungry all my life)
i'm high now (huh), i'm high now (huh)
i'm high now (huh), i'm high now (huh)
life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(pull them panties to the side now)
now

when i was 27, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial?
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me?
is it for the moment, and will he see me as job?
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before?
at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn

god damn you, god damn me
god damn us, god damn we
god damn us all

verse 2 says, "you only have i known of all the families of the earth, therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities"
so until we come back to these commandments
until you come back to these commandments
we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
because he said he's gonna punish us
the so-called blacks, hispanics, and native american indians
are the true children of israel
we are the israelites, according to the bible
the children of israel
he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
because we chose to follow other gods
that man chastens his son, so the lord, thy god, chasten thee
so, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chasten you
because he loves you, so that's why we get chastised
that's why we're in the position that we're in
until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
and do what the lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
we gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
here, in today, in the united states of america
i love you, family, and i pray for you
god bless you
shalom

ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
uh, yeah
uh, yeah
uh
yeah, uh

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two, one two)
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
won't you look to your left and right? make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

do you believe in me? are you deceiving me?
could i let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
is your smile on permanent? is your vow on lifetime?
would you know where the sermon is if i died in this next line?
if i’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
if the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
would you judge me a drug-head or see me as k. lamar?
or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
want you to love me like nelson, want you to hug me like nelson
i freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
you tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
but a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
won't you look to your left and right? make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
let my words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that—

do you believe in me? how much you believe in her?
you think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
you think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
you think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
like, who got your best interest?
like, how much are you dependent?
how clutch are the people that say they love you?
and who pretending?
how tough is your skin when they turn you in?
do you show forgiveness?
what brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
what kind of bridge did they burn?
revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
you wanna love like nelson, you wanna be like nelson
you wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
you wanna be remembered that delivered the message
that considered the blessing of everyone
this your lesson for everyone, say;

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
won't you look to your left and right? make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the voice of mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
let my word be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me, nigga—

i been wrote off before, i got abandonment issues
i hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
that’s not nelson-like—want you to love me like nelson
i went to robben’s island analysing; that’s where his cell is
so i could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
see i got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, murphy’s law
generation x—will i ever be your ex?
flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
it’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
how many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
is it moses? is it huey newton or detroit red?
is it martin luther? jfk? shooter—you assassin
is it jackie? is it jesse? oh, i know it’s michael jackson—oh

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
that nigga gave us "billie jean," you say he touched those kids?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
let my word be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

"i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didn’t wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
doesn’t mean i can’t respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i don’t know, i’m no mortal man
maybe i’m just another nigga”
shit and that’s all i wrote
i was gonna call it "another nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem
i just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
other than that, now that i finally got a chance to holla at you
i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
about a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
what you mean by that, what the ground represent?
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
right
that’s how i see it, my word is bond
i see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
right
the poor people is gonna open up this whole world
and swallow up the rich people
'cause the rich people gonna be so fat
and they gonna be so appetizing, you know what i’m saying wealthy, appetizing
the poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
right
you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna be like
you know what i'm saying, it's gonna be...
there might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
they might eat the rich, you know what i'm saying?
aight so let me ask you this then
do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
i see myself as a natural born hustler
a true hustler in every sense of the word
i took nothin’, i took the opportunities
i worked at the most menial and degrading job
and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it
i went from having somebody managing me
to me hiring the person that works my management company
i changed everything, i realized my destiny
in a matter of five years, you know what i’m saying?
i made myself a millionaire, i made millions for a lot of people
now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what i’m saying?
i made millions for the record companies
i made millions for these movie companies
now i make millions for, for us
and through your different avenues of success
how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
by my faith in god, by my faith in the game
and by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true"
right
you know what i’m saying?
and it was happening to me for a reason
you know what i’m saying, i was noticing, shit
i was punching the right buttons and it was happening
so it’s no problem, you know
i mean, it’s a problem but i’m not finna let them know
i’m finna go straight through
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
shit, i like to think that at every opportunity i’ve ever been, uh threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
and not only me but, it goes down my family tree
you know what i’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"we fighting a war, i’m fighting a war i can’t win
and i wanna lay it all down"
in this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'cause once you turn 30 it’s like
they take the heart and soul out of a man
out of a black man, in this country
and you don’t wanna fight no more
and if you don’t believe me, you can look around
you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
that’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
of the legacy you left behind, i can truly tell you that
there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, i wanted to ask you
what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
and next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
for real, i don’t think america know that
i think america think we was just playing
and it’s gonna be some more playing but
it ain’t gonna be no playing
it’s gonna be murder, you know what i’m saying?
it’s gonna be like nat turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna happen
that’s crazy, man, in my opinion
only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
sometimes i can like, get behind a mic
and i don’t know what type of energy i’ma push out
or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
damn
i wanted to read one last thing to you
it’s actually something a good friend had wrote
describing my world, it says:
“the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment
the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life
the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city
the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
he’s trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result?
wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
they are one and the same"
what’s your perspective on that?
pac? pac? pac?!
