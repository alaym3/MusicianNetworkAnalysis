oh hey, i wasn't listening
i was watching syria
blinded by the sunshine strip
and you, you were in the kitchen
oh your mariner's mouth
the wounded with the wounder's whip

and that's how summer passed:
the great dividing range, the green, green grass
and oh, maybe it was peace at last
who knew

then, hello love
my invincible friend
oh, hello love
the thistle and the burr
oh, hello love
for you i have so many words
but i, i forget where we were, no

oh hey, i wasn't listening
i was stung by all of us
the blind leading out the bored
and as per usual
you were skipping and laughing
eyes at the bedroom door
"don't take it so seriously, no
only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!"
maybe you're right, babe
maybe
that's how summer passed:
the great dividing range, the green, green grass
and oh, maybe i'll hold on fast
to you

then, hello love
my invincible friend
oh, hello love
the thistle and the burr
oh, hello love
for you i have so many words
but i, i forget where we were, no
i, i forget where we were, no
i forget where we were
i forget where we were

and that's how summer passed:
the great dividing range, the green, green grass
and oh, maybe it was peace at last
who knew 

meet me there
with bundles of flowers
we'll wade through the hours
of cold, winter
she'll howl at the walls
tearing down doors
of time, shelter, as we go

and promise me this
you'll wait for me only
scared of the lonely arms
that surface, far below these birds

and maybe, just maybe, i'll come home

oh, who am i, darling, to you?
who am i to tell you stories of mine?
who am i?
oh, who am i, darling, for you?
who am i to be your burden in time? lonely
who am i to you?
and who am i, darling, for you?
who am i to be your burden?
and who am i, darling, to you?
who am i?
i come alone here
i come alone here 

go your way
i'll take the long way 'round
i'll find my own way down
as i should
and hold your gaze
there's coke in the midas touch
a joke in the way that we rust
and breathe again
and you'll find loss
and you'll fear what you found
when weather comes
tearing down
there'll be oats in the water
there'll be birds on the ground
there'll be things you never asked her
oh how they tear at you now
go your way
i'll take the long way 'round
i'll find my own way down
as i should
and hold your gaze
there's coke in the midas touch
a joke in the way that we rust
and breathe again
and you'll find loss
and you'll fear what you found
when weather comes
tearing down
there'll be oats in the water
there'll be birds on the ground
there'll be things you never asked her
oh how they tear at you now 

i spent my time watchin'
the spaces that have grown between us
and i cut my mind on second best
the scars that come with the greenness
and i gave my eyes to the bottom
still the seabed wouldn't let me in
and i tried my best to embrace the darkness
in which i swim

now walking back down this mountain
with the strength of a turnin' tide
the wind's so soft and my skin
the sun so hot upon my side
looking out at this happiness
i searched for between the sheets
feeling blind to realise
all i was searching for was me
oh-ohh, all i was searching for was me

keep your head up, keep your heart strong
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set, keep your hair long
oh my, my darling
keep your head up, keep your heart strong
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set in your ways
and keep your heart strong
i saw a friend of mine the other day
and he told me that my eyes were gleaming
i said i had been away
and he knew, oh, he knew the depths i was meaning
it felt so good to see his face
the comfort invested in my soul
to feel the warmth of his smile
when he said 'i'm happy to have you home'
oh-ohh, 'i'm happy to have you home'

keep your head up, keep your heart strong
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set, keep your hair long
oh my, my darling
keep your head up, keep your heart strong
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set in your ways
but keep your heart strong

'cause i'll always remember you the same
eyes like wild flowers with your demons of change

(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
may you find happiness there
(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
may all your hopes all turn out right
(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
keep your head up, keep your heart strong
(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set, keep your hair long
(keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
oh my, my darling
keep your head up, keep your heart strong
no, no, no, no
keep your mind set in your ways
and keep your heart strong

'cause i'll always remember you the same
eyes like wild flowers with your demons of change 

black flies on the windowsill
that we are
that we are
that we are to know
winter stole summer's thrill
and the river's cracked and cold
see the sky is no man's land
a darkened plume to stay
hope here needs a humble hand
not a fox found in your place

and no man is an island, oh this i know
but can't you see, oh?
maybe you were the ocean, when i was just a stone

black flies on the windowsill
that we are
that we are
that we are to hold
comfort came against my will
and every story must grow old
still i'll be a traveler
a gypsy's reins to face
but the road is wearier
with that fool found in your place

and no man is an island, oh this i know
but can't you see, oh?
maybe you were the ocean, when i was just a stone
and no man is an island, oh this i know
but can't you see, oh?
maybe you were the ocean, when i was just a stone
so here we are

and i don't wanna beg your pardon
and i don't wanna ask you why
but if i was to go my own way
would i have to pass you by?
and i don't wanna beg your pardon
and i don't wanna ask you why
but if i was to go my own way
would i have to pass you by? 

climb out
out to where you see
the curl of the world
we're alone
just like you said
cold, cold world
life lasts
only one thing left to roll
last year to learn

you were the boat that breached
in a tale of conrad's
we will never be the change to the weather and the sea
and you knew that
you were the boat that breached
in a tale of conrad's
oh i loved you with the good and the careless in me
but it all goes back

climb out
out enough to see
the curl of the world
we're alone
just like you said
last year to learn

you were the boat that breached
in a tale of conrad's
we will never be the change to the weather and the sea
and you knew that
you were the boat that breached
in a tale of conrad's
oh i loved you with the good and the careless in me
but it all goes back

you were the boat that breached
in a tale of conrad's
we will never be the change to the weather and the sea
and you knew that
you were the boat that breached
in a tale out of conrad's
oh i loved you with the good and the careless in me
but it all goes back 

the end of the after
the weight of a war
the kindness gone to bed
the weight of your laughter
alive in the hall
did he hear, did he hear the fumbled words you said?

living without her
living at all
seems to slow me down
living forever
hell i don't know
do i care, do i care the thunder's rumbled sound?

and now i watch her
running round in love again
now i talk about you
when i'm with our mutual friends

the end of the after
the weight of a war
the kindness gone to bed
the threat of your laughter
alive after all
did he hear, did he hear the fumbled words you said?
living without her
living at all
seems to slow me down
living forever
pale light on all
do i care, do i care the thunder's rumbled sound?

and now i watch her
running round in love again
now i talk about you
when i'm with our mutual friends

and now i watch her
running round in love again
now i talk about you
when i'm with our mutual friends

could you be, could you be alone?
my hatred, my hate will bring me closer

this is it?
well this is desert
and what of him?
what the hell, love?
this is it?
well this is desert
and what of him?
what the hell, love?
this is it?
what the hell, love?
what the hell, love? 

door is locked, my gums are bleeding
outside she reads, outside she is reading
the evacuation procedure
out loud
clothes are off, my health receding
somewhere she dreams, somewhere she is dreaming
of caribbean nica libres
at dusk

while the faithful dispose of a generation
and all of the mountains whisper knowingly
i order a colada and sit to count my dollars
and watch eagles soar in circles
perpetually

forever, forever
such a beautiful thing

now i am older, i don't look over my shoulder
i know what is there in front of me
ten marlboro cigarettes
the rolled the butts into the bottle tops
today i will stare at the sea
till my eyes have had enough

enough, enough
is that enough?
 

darling, you're with me, always around me
only love, my only love
darling, i feel you under my body
only love, my only love
give me shelter, or show me heart
come on, love, come on, love
watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart...

and i'll be yours to keep
a wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep

wrapped up in dissonance
i'm sorry that i just walked away
lost in the insignificance of mine
i had no words to say
now i am better
i implore you to say it isn't right
but somewhere deep in history
your father pulled the teeth out of your fight

hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again, look who's laughing
you again, all you, all you, all you
hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again, look who's laughing
me again, all fired up on you

and now she's caught between
what to say and what she really means
wrapped up in empathy
the chemicals are pushing past my blood
hold all my cliches
they are tipping my tongue to tell you that it's love

hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again, look who's laughing
you again, all you, all you, all you
hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again now look who's laughing
me again, all fired up on you

and now she's caught between
what to say and what she really means
and i am finally coloring
inside the lines that i live between

hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again, look who's laughing
you again, all you, all you, all you
hold it in, let's go dancing
i do believe we're only passing through
wired again, look who's laughing
me again, all fired up on you 

oh my mind!
i walk down mayflower road again
the wailing sun
echoes from the park seem so absurd
the bus takes hours
i knew it would, but i can't shake the sting
can't spend my time
on everybody else
if buildings fell
at least we'd be in matrimony
i can't control
the words kaleidoscope inside my head

has the world gone mad
or is it me?
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
is it all so very bad?
i can't see
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
i saw the police
screaming something trivial
like, "keep the peace!"
the world moves on and you can't shake the sound
i know she's home
waiting on somebody
loathe in light
all in my mind
the anvil and the weight upon my back

has the world gone mad
or is it me?
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
is it all so very bad?
i can't see
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me

has the world gone mad
or is it me?
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
is it all so very bad?
i can't see
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
and i can't see, my love


has the world gone mad
or is it me?
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
is it all so very bad?
i can't see
all these small things, they gather round me
gather round me
and i can't see, my love


(and i can't see, my love) 

hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
i've come to know that memories
were the best things you ever had
the summer shone, beat down on bony backs
so far from home, where the ocean stood
down dust and pine cone tracks
we slept like dogs down by the fire side
awoke to the fog where all around us
the boom of summertime

we stood steady as the stars
in the woods so happy-hearted
and the warmth rang true inside these bones
and as the old pine fell we sang
just to bless the morning

hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
i've come to know the friends around you
are all you'll always have
smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone
careless and young, free as the birds that fly
with weightless souls
we stood steady as the stars
in the woods so happy-hearted
and the warmth rang true inside these bones
we stood steady as the stars
in the woods so happy-hearted
and the warmth rang true inside these bones
and as the old pine fell we sang
just to bless the morning

we grow, grow steady as the morning
we grow, older still
we grow, grow happy as a new dawn
we grow, grow older still
we grow, grow steady as the flowers
we grow, older still
we grow, grow happy as a new dawn
we grow, grow older still 

towing the line
i watched the host drink all the wine
and now she rambles
through the who's and who have not's
the old man is a painter
of tired sea scapes
tilted adventures
and so my mind wanders
picking at the table to cure the rot
like a bird in a world with no trees
you were hung up there in your disbelief
i know i'm a hard rock to drag around

love is in the early mornings
in the shadows under the trees
not in the cuckolded ashes
floating down from the rookery
down here i'll crow for you, you crow for me
down here i'll crow for you, you crow for me

towing the line
i watched the host drink all the wine
and now i’m purring
for a drop of anything
throwing stones at your window
you turn to me as if it’s simple
why can’t you be like the blackbird
and sing
i say i’m the westerlies in ireland
so decadent and violent
can’t you see i’m a forager
clawing at the bedrock

love is in the early mornings
in the shadows under the trees
not in the cuckolded ashes
floating down from the rookery
down here i'll crow for you, you crow for me
down here i'll crow for you, you crow for me 

depth over distance every time, my dear
and this tree of ours may grow tall in the woods
but it's the roots that will bind us here
to the ground
depth over distance was all i asked of you
and i may be foolish to fall as i do
still there's strength in the blindness you fear
if you're coming too
if you're coming too
hold on, wait until that lone sun
breaks from the arms of the lord
hold on, though we may be too young
to know this ride we're on
depth over distance was all i asked of you
and everybody round here's acting like a stone
still there's things i'd do, darling, i'd go blind for you
if you let grow sometimes, let it grow sometimes, let it grow
just let it grow sometimes
cause so hold on, wait until that lone sun
breaks from the arms of the lord
oh  hold on, though we may be too young
to know this ride we're on
oh hold on, though we may be too young
to know this ride we're on
oh depth over distance every time, my dear
and i may be foolish to fall as i do
still there's strength in the blindness you fear
if you're coming too
oh if you're coming too
so hold on, wait until that lone sun
breaks from the arms of the lord
hold on, though we may be too young
to know this ride we're on
to know this ride
to know this ride we're on 

to care
or not to care
to be there
in the distant and uncertain
to be aware
in an old iberian hotel room
that the devil
is not behind the curtain

she said walk in small steps
and fear floating
we made a pact
as saturn approaching
leaned on the sky
and smoking a cigarette
said it's late
you should be going
the wind is howling
the house is showing
(high numbers)

boat to an island on the wall
hand striking in slow motion
future singing in a field
shooting season's open
to care
or not to care
to be aware
in your absence, they made your choices for you
you were supposed to laugh
said the fortune to his sailor
this is the black mountain path
or these are the sunny shores to nowhere
well

boat to an island on the wall
a hand striking in slow motion
future singing in a field
shooting season's open

boat to an island on the wall
a hand striking in slow motion
that's it, that's it all
shooting season's open 

as a child it was not there
not scared of the blood
the creak and the thud inside your chest
clearly calm i'm keeping terrorised
the ageless thaw of winter
alone, but by your side
here in light hung a soft divide
the billowed curtain call
hold me down
was i born to lie?
here at all
here at all
my fear in lights
all i said comes home
i can't do this alone
asleep inside
i was born to lie
now prove me wrong
prove me wrong

but it's in your nature
blooms inside your blood
hold me in harm's way baby
all is now harmed
as a child it was not there
not scared of the blood
the creak and the thud inside your chest
clearly calm i'm keeping terrorised
the ageless thaw of winter
alone, but by your side
my fear in lights
all i said comes home
i can't do this alone
hold me down
was i born to lie?
now prove me wrong
prove me wrong

but it's in your nature
blooms inside your blood
hold me in harm's way baby
all is now harmed 

hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
yeah i know, i've been trying so hard
to keep in time with all of the hours in your day

hold it in, they wouldn't let you out among the crowd
not like that these streets will tear you down
how it is, under my skin
now you are; pictures of all you'll ever be

oh, i am not myself
today
i am not feeling
okay

hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
yeah i know, i've been trying so hard
to keep in time, with all of the sounds that you make

hold it in they come at you from both sides of your mind
thick and thin; these walls you'll always stand behind
i'm sick and tired, oh i begged for the world to change
but it don't, it ain't all you and that's the thing
i am not myself today
i am not feeling okay

and you showed me hope amidst the hellequins in spring
and you told me life was learning how to be your friend
 

always a riddle in the world she said
always a riddle inside my head
always a thing of wonder
the way we come to be
oh it's a big old place for me
yeah it's a big old world indeed
everyone is killing me and everything conspires

in dreams i have watched it spin
seen the violent crack of atoms
where all light comes in
in dreams i have lain in sin
just to be the cracked and the cared for

how can i ask, ask for more?

always a riddle in the world she said
always a riddle inside my head
always a thing of wonder
the way we come to be
oh it's a big old place for me
yeah it's a big old world indeed
been kicking my heels and wondering how i've been here so long

in dreams i have watched it spin
see a violent crack of atoms
where all light comes in
in dreams i saw aesop's kin
just a carcass of a man now alone inside his skin

where to, where to begin?

i live alone
i live a lonely life without you
and i may be troubled
but i'm gracious in defeat
and i may be troubled
but i'm gracious in defeat 

and the birds still sing outside
these windows where we sat together
like nothing ever happened here
the white house on the hill, black clouds of weather

and the church spire over the river
she still sits there, warm in the evening glow
but you don't care about these scenes i treasure
about these west winds, i know, i know

seems everything around here
stays like stone
seems it's about time, darling
we let this all go

everything must start again anew
everything just goes that way, my friend
every king knows it to be true
that every kingdom must one day come to an end

and the sun, she may be long gone
lost to these memories we found
but she'll be here when it's all done
when our bodies are lain beneath the ground
seems everything that goes around
comes around here
seems everything that stays
somehow gets me down again

everything must start again anew
everything just goes that way, my friend
every king knows it to be true
that every kingdom must one day come to an end 

my, my cold hearted child
tell me how you feel
just a blade in the grass
a spoke unto the wheel
my, my cold hearted child
tell me where it's all gone
oh the luster of your bones
those arms that held you strong

i've been worrying
that my time here's a little unclear
i've been worrying
that i'm losing the ones i hold dear
i've been worrying
that we all
live our lives
in the confines of fear

my, my cold hearted child
tell me how you feel
just a grain in the morning air
dark shadow on the hill
my, my cold hearted child
tell me where it all falls (tell me where it all falls)
this apathy you feel
will make a fool of us all

i've been worrying
that my time here's a little unclear
i've been worrying
that i'm losing the ones i hold dear
i've been worrying
that we all
live our lives
in the confines of fear

i will become what i deserve
oh, i will become what i deserve
oh, i will become what i deserve
oh, i will become what i deserve
oh, i will become what i deserve
(i've been worrying, i've been worrying)
oh, i will become what i deserve
(i've been worrying my time is a little unclear)
oh, i will become what i deserve
i've been worrying, i've been worrying
that my time here's a little unclear
i've been worrying, i've been worrying
that i'm losing the ones i hold dear
i've been worrying, i've been worrying
that we all
all live our lives
in the confines of fear
