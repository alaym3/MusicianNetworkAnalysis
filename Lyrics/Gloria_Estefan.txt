anything for you
though you're not here
since you said we're through
it seems like years
time keeps dragging on and on
and forever's been and gone
still i can't figure what went wrong
i'd still do anything for you
i'll play your game
you hurt me through and through
but you can have your way
i can pretend each time i see you
that i don't care
and i don't need you
and though you'll never see me crying
you know inside i feel like dying
and i'd do anything for you
in spite of it all
i've learned so much from you
you made me strong
but don't you ever think that i don't love you
that for one minute i forgot you
but sometimes things don't work out right
and you just have to say goodbye
i hope you find someone to please you
someone who'll care and never leave you
but if that someone ever hurts you
you just might need a friend to turn to
and i'd do anything for you
i'll give you up
if that's what i should do
to make you happy
i can pretend each time i see you
that i don't care and i don't need you
and though inside i feel like dying
you know you'll never see me crying
don't you ever think that i don't love you
that for one minute i forgot you
but sometimes things don't work out right
and you just have to say goodbye

o eh, o eh
o eh, oo, aah

you pretend like you are dead
but i know it
the rhythm is gonna get'cha

of what's happening to you
and before this night is through

de mi tierra bella, de mi tierra santa
oigo ese grito de los tambores
y los timbales al cumbanchar
y ese pregón que canta un hermano
que de su tierra vive lejano
y que el recuerdo le hace llorar
una canción que vive entonando
de su dolor, de su propio llanto
y se le escucha penar
la tierra te duele, la tierra te da
en medio del alma cuando tú no estás
la tierra te empuja de raíz y cal
la tierra suspira si no te ve más
la tierra donde naciste
no la puedes olvidar
porque tiene tus raíces
y lo que dejas atrás
la tierra te duele, la tierra te da
en medio del alma cuando tú no estás
siguen los pregones, la melancolía
y cada noche junto a la luna
sigue el guajiro entonando el son
y cada calle que va a mi pueblo
tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
tiene nostalgia como su voz
y esa canción que sigue entonando
corre en la sangre y sigue llegando
con más fuerza al corazón
la tierra te duele, la tierra te da
en medio del alma cuando tú no estás
la tierra te empuja de raíz y cal
la tierra suspira si no te ve más
tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
nunca la olvido
la llevo en mi sentimiento, ¡sí señor!
oigo ese grito, vive el recuerdo
corre en mi sangre
la llevo por dentro ¡como no!
canto de mi tierra bella y santa
sufro ese dolor que hay en su alma
aunque esté lejos yo la siento
y un día regreso, yo lo sé
siguen los pregones, la melancolía
y cada noche junto a la luna
sigue el guajiro entonando el son
y cada calle que va a mi pueblo
tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
tiene nostalgia como su voz
y esa canción que sigue entonando
corre en la sangre y sigue llegando
con más fuerza al corazón
la tierra te duele, la tierra te da
en medio del alma cuando tú no estás
la tierra te empuja de raíz y cal
la tierra suspira si no te ve más

here we are, face to face
we forget, time and place
hold me now, don't let go
though it hurts and we both know why
the time we spend together's gonna fly
and everything you do to me is gonna feel so right
baby when you're loving me i feel like i could cry
'cause there's nothing i can do to keep from loving you
here we are, all alone
trembling hearts, beating strong
reaching out, a breathless kiss
i never thought could feel like this
i want to stop the time from passing by
i wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine
baby when you're close to me, i want you more each time
and there's nothing i can do to keep from loving you
there's nothing i can do
i'm helpless in your arms
oh baby what you do
i'm in love, this is it
there's no turning back this time
no, no, no
here we are, once again
but this time we're only friends
funny world, sometimes lies
become the game, when love's the prize
and though no one knows what's going on inside
and all the love i feel for you is something i should hide
when i have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime
that there's nothing i can do to keep from loving you
no, no, no
can't keep from loving you baby
no, no, no
there is nothing i can do, my baby
can't keep from loving you

mambo cabana, oh-oh
mambo cabana, oh-oh-oh

the plane leaves in the morning
soon the world will see you shining
and i wish i could go with you
but your journey isn't mine
and the world will soon adore you
as i learn to live without you
every melody is for you
every song i write about you
and this fear that keeps me by the door
i shouldn't interfere with you wanting more
i am here, just on another shore
always in your corner watching you soar
when your plane lands on the runway
keep this song inside your heart
oh-oh, when the road goes only one way
keep this song inside your heart
oh-oh, when the years pass but thе love stays
keep this song inside your heart
oh-oh, i'll bе with you when the song plays
all along inside your heart
oh-oh
mambo cabana
oh-oh
cuando aterrices en la pista
deja que cante el corazón
cuando el camino pierda la vista
deja que cante el corazón
pasan los años, pasan los meses
deja que cante el corazón
y nuestro amor nunca envejece
deja que cante el corazón
keep this song inside your heart
canta el corazón

some dreams
live on in time forever
those dreams
you want with all your heart
and i'll do whatever it takes
follow through with the promise i made
put it all on the line
what i hoped for at last would be mine
if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
from that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
know that i've tried my very best
i'd put my spirit to the test
if i could reach
some days
are meant to be remembered
those days
we rise above the stars
so i'll go the distance this time
seeing more the higher i climb
that the more i believe
all the more that this dream will be mine
if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
from that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
knowing that i've tried my very best
i'd put my spirit to the test
if i could reach
if i could reach, higher
just for one moment touch the sky
that one moment in my life
i'm gonna be stronger
i'm gonna be so much stronger
yes i am
i put my spirit to the test
if i could reach
if i could, if i could
if i could reach
reach, i'd reach, i'd reach
i'd reach, i'd reach so
much higher

sometimes it's hard to make things clear
or know when to face the truth
and i know that the moment is here
i'll open my heart and show you inside
my love has no pride
i feel with you
i've got nothing to hide
so open your eyes and see who i am
and not who you want for me to be
i am only myself, myself

i don't wanna lose you now
we're gonna get through somehow
i don't wanna lose you now or ever
baby, i finally found
the courage to stand my ground
but if you want me
i'll be around forever

we all make mistakes
we all lose our way
but we stood the test of time
and i hope that's the way it will stay
it's all up to you to tell me to go
'cause it won't be me to walk away
when you're all that i know
and i know that

i don't wanna lose you now
we're gonna get through somehow
i don't wanna lose you now or ever, never
baby, i finally found
the courage to stand my ground
but if you want me
i'll be around forever

love sometimes can be like destiny
there's no way to say forever
it may not realize your dreams
and love sometimes is like the blowing wind
it can take us to wherever
sending us on silent wings
but i have broken all the rules of love
i never dreamed that i could come this far
and now i'm lost in my emotions
you're becoming my devotion
there's nothing i can do to stop this love for you
i was not supposed to fall in love with you
i have someone else and someone else is loving you
and i was not supposed to let this love get through
so let me say for real: heaven's what i feel when i'm with you
this feeling is forever, it is forever
you make me feel like heaven, i feel like heaven
my love is true when i'm with you
how could i have known that in your eyes
i would find the deepest answers to the questions of my heart
and how could i have known that by your side
was the light to fill the darkness in the shadows of my life
but i have broken all the rules of love
i never dreamed that i could come this far
and now i'm lost in my emotions
you're becoming my devotion

tengo marcado en el pecho
todos los días que el tiempo
no me dejó estar aquí
tengo una fe que madura
que va conmigo y me cura
desde que te conocí
tengo una huella perdida
entre tu sombra y la mía
que no me deja mentir
soy una moneda en la fuente
tú mi deseo pendiente
mis ganas de revivir
tengo una mañana constante
y una acuarela esperando
verte pintado de azul
tengo tu amor y tu suerte
y un caminito empinado
tengo el mar del otro lado
tú eres mi norte y mi sur
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a envolverme en tu ropa
susúrrame en tu silencio
cuando me veas llegar
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a alegrar tu tristeza
vamos a hacer una fiesta
pa' que este amor crezca más
tengo una frase colgada
entre mi boca y mi almohada
que me desnuda ante ti
tengo una playa y un pueblo
que me acompañan de noche
cuando no estás junto a mi
tengo una mañana constante
y una acuerla esperando
verte pintado de azul
tengo tu amor y tu suerte
y un caminito empinado
tengo el mar del otro lado
tú eres mi norte y mi sur
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a envolverme en tu ropa
susúrrame en tu silencio
cuando me veas llegar
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a alegrar tu tristeza
vamos a hacer una fiesta
pa' que este amor crezca más
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a envolverme en tu ropa
susúrrame en tu silencio
cuando me veas llegar
hoy voy a verte de nuevo
voy a alegrar tu tristeza
vamos a hacer una fiesta
pa' que este amor crezca más

sé que aún me queda una oportunidad
sé que aún no es tarde para recapacitar
sé que nuestro amor es verdadero
y con los años que me quedan por vivir
demostraré cuánto te quiero
con los años que me quedan
yo viviré por darte amor
borrando cada dolor
con besos llenos de pasión
como te amé por vez primera
con los años que me quedan
te haré olvidar cualquier error
no quise herirte, mi amor
sabes que eres mi adoración
y lo serás mi vida entera
no puedo imaginar vivir sin ti
no quiero recordar cómo te perdí
quizás fue inmadurez de mi parte
no te supe querer
y te aseguro que los años que me quedan
(con los años que me quedan)
los voy a dedicar a ti (para ti)
hacerte tan feliz
que te enamores más de mí
yo te amaré hasta que muera
como comprobar que no soy quien fui
el tiempo te dirá, si tienes fe en mí
que como yo te amé, más nadie
te podrá amar jamás
dime que no es el final
sé que aún me queda una oportunidad
sé que aún no es tarde para recapacitar
sé que nuestro amor es verdadero, ah
y con los años que me quedan por vivir
demostraré cuánto te quiero
ah, sé que nuestro amor es verdadero
y con los años que me quedan por vivir
demostraré cuánto te quiero
cuánto te quiero

why be afraid if i'm not alone?
life is never easy
the rest in unknown
up to now for me
it's been hands against stone
each and every moment
searching for what to believe

i finally see the light now
and it's shining on me
coming out of the dark
i know the love that saved me
sharing with me

starting again is part of the plan
i'll be so much stronger

but your love helped me to make it
coming out of the dark
i see the light now

you say i know it's a waste of time
there's no use trying
so scared that life's gonna pass you by
your spirit dying
not long ago

keep every tear like an ocean
for every day that my fortune
kept me from being with you
i craddle your faith that reveals me
grows like a flower, then heals me
fills me with promise anew
i carry you on disillusion
when my pathetic confusion
kept me from speaking the truth
i'm simply a coin in your fountain
lost like the seconds i'm counting
'til i am closer to you
i cherish every morning that found us
with the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
i carry your joy in my footsteps
making my way to your harbour
i don't need to go any farther
you are my sun and my moon
wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful
back in your arms where i'm happy
i would do anything gladly
only to see you again
wrapped in your arms i can wander
up to the heaven's above me
hearing you say that you love me
back in your arms where i'm free
keep every phrase barely spoken
left from your lips
they have broken
free as you give me your love
the yearning is constant and steady
when i'm with you
i'm already
everything i can become
i cherish every morning that found us
with the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
i carry your joy in my footsteps
making my way to your harbour
i don't need to go any farther
you are my sun and my moon
wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful
back in your arms where i'm happy
i would do anything gladly
only to see you again
wrapped in your arms i can wander
up to the heaven's above me
hearing you say that you love me
back in your arms where i'm free

they say stay home
please don't go outside
there's no use dying
each time someone
comes within six feet
we feel like crying

not long ago
we could touch our friends
and our relations
they made it clear
we are all locked away
to our frustration

there in your house is the answer
find it i know it will pull you through

put on your mask
when you go out in public
put on your mask
help save the world from covid

i know it's true
we're all going through
this nasty virus
we understand
if we wash our hands
we can survive this

we gotta keep looking on to tomorrow
there is so much in life that is meant for you

put on your mask
when you are buying groceries
put on your mask
it might help our prognosis
put on your mask
don't stop before it's over
put on your mask
this hell is far from over
put on your mask

come on, shake your body baby, do the conga

things rarely go as planned
all the dreams that we envisioned
seemed to crumble in our hands
so suddenly alone
with my thoughts and my decisions
with the life that i have known
that will forever be changed
and i pray it’s for the better
taking what we learned together
to finally build a better world

but we needed time to catch up
the race we started, put on pause
slow the wheels that, fast, were grinding
on the things that matter most
we needed time to let go
of worthless things we valued wrong
to rediscover new directions
new beginnings
there’s so much we can do
since we’re all in this together
let’s find ways to make it through
there’s something to be said
for having time to mull it over
think about what lies ahead
this exceptional moment
inconceivable and strange
where we stop to rearrange
where we’re forced to reexamine
what we truly care for
who we would sacrifice all for

but we needed time to catch up
the fires we started, let cool down
slow the speed that we were driving
stop the train and just get off
we needed time to finally see
there’s so much more that we can be
to reimagine, make some good news
find a new way
and when we’re finally looking in our rearview mirror
i hope it shows us the way forward
that much clearer
with our baggage much lighter
grateful, caring and wiser

but we needed time to catch up
the fights we started, wind them down
slow the rhetoric we’re spouting
when we’ve just walked on common ground
we needed time to recognize
how easily we’re all equalized
each one of us pieces of the same thing
of the same team
things rarely go as planned
