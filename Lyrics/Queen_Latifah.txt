uh, u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity
u.n.i.t.y., love a black man from infinity to infinity
(who you callin' a bitch?)

u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity (you gotta let him know)
(you go, come on, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black woman from (uh, you gotta let him know)

(come on, come on, now here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black man from (yeah, you gotta let him know)
infinity to infinity (you ain't a bitch or a ho)

instinct leads me to another flow
every time i hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
tryna make a sister feel low
you know all of that gots to go
now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
but don't you be calling me out my name
i bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
that's why i'm talkin', one day i was walkin' down the block
i had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
i walked past these dudes when they passed me
one of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
i turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
then the little one said, "ha ha, yeah me, bitch," and laughed
since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
huh, i punched him dead in his eye
and said, "who you callin' a bitch?" yeah!

u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity (here we go, you gotta let him know)
(you go, come on, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black woman from (you gotta let him know)
infinity to infinity (you ain't a bitch or a ho, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity (uh, you gotta let him know)
(you go, come on here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black man from (yeah, you gotta let him know)
infinity to infinity (you ain't a bitch or a ho)

i hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
and take it out on me but that's about enough
you put your hands on me again i'll put your ass in handcuffs
i guess i fell so deep in love i grew dependency
i was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
all that i knew was you was all the man i had
and i was scared to let you go
even though you treated me bad
but i don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
you say i'm nothin' without ya but i'm nothing' with ya
a man don't really love you if he hits ya
this is my notice to the door, i'm not takin' it no more
i'm not your personal whore, that's not what i'm here for
and nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me
brother you wait and see (who you callin' a bitch? uh!)

u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity (here we go, you gotta let him know)
(come on, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black man from (yeah, you gotta let him know)
infinity to infinity (you ain't a bitch or a ho, here we go)

(come on, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black woman from (yeah, you gotta let him know)
infinity to infinity (you ain't a bitch or a ho)

what's goin' on in your mind is what i ask ya
but like yo-yo, you don't hear me though
you wear a rag around your head
and you call yourself a "gangsta bitch"
now that you saw apache's video
i saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
i peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
but where did all of this come from?
a minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
now you a wannabe...hard
you barely know your abc's, please
there's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (young lady)?
uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
'cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(barking with no bite!)
she got to wear that for life
(who you callin' a bitch? uh!)

u.n.i.t.y., u.n.i.t.y. that's a unity (here we go, you gotta let him know)
(come on, here we go)
u.n.i.t.y., love a black woman from (you gotta let him know)

there's a light in the darkness
though the night is black as my skin
there's a light burning bright, showing me the way
but i know where i've been

there's a cry in the distance (oooo)
it's a voice that comes from deep within (hey yeah)
there's a cry asking why, i pray the answer's up ahead
'cause i know where i've been

there's a road we've been travelin'
lost so many on the way
but the riches will be plenty
worth the price, the price we had to pay

there's a dream in the future
there's a struggle that we have yet to win
and there's pride in my heart 'cause i know where i'm going
yes i do!
and i know where i've been, yeah

there's a road
we must trave
there's a promise
we must make
but the riches
will be plenty
worth the price
and price we had to pay
there's a dream (dream)
yeah yeah yeah
in the future
there's a struggle
that we have yet to win
and there's pride
in my heart
'cause i know where i'm going
and i know where i've been
yeah

there's a road (there's a road)
we must travel (we must travel)
there's a promise (there's a promise)
that we must make (that we must make)
but the riches (oh, but the riches)
will be plenty (riches will be many)
worth the risk (worth the risk)
and the chance (and the chance)
we take
there's a dream

in the future there's a struggle (struggle)
that we have yet to win (we have yet to win)
use that pride (pride)
in our hearts (in our hearts)
to lift us up (lift us up)
to tomorrow (ooo)
'cause just to sit still would be a sin
(i know it! i know where i'm going)
lord knows i know where i've been
(know where i've been)
i give thanks to my god 'cause i know where i've been

the ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
a woman can bear you, break you, take you
now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
a sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

ayo, let me take it from here, queen...
excuse me but i think i'm about do
to get into precisely what i am about to do
i'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
so listen very carefully as i break it down for you
merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
let me state the position: ladies first, yes? (yes)
(yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

believe me when i say being a woman is great, you see
i know all the fellas out there will agree with me
not for being one but for being with one
because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
we are the ones that give birth
to the new generation of prophets because it's ladies first

i break into a lyrical freestyle
grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
sloppy slouching is something i won't do
some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
i'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(with what?) with a little touch of "ladies first"
who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
if you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
i'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
a female rapper with the message to send the
queen latifah is a perfect specimen

my sister, can i get some?

sure, monie love, grab the mic and get dumb

yo, praise me not for simply being what i am
born in l-o-n-d-o-n and sound american
you dig exactly where i'm coming from
you want righteous rhyming, i'mma give you some
to enable you to aid yourself and get paid
and the material that has no meaning i wish to slay
pay me every bit of your attention
like mother, like daughter, i would also like to mention
i wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
of which is now systematically given
desperately stressing i'm the daughter of a sister
who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
plus one more; all four
have a job to do, we doing it
respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
and next up is me, the m-o-n-i-e l-o-v-e
and i'm first cause i'm a l-a-d-i-e

contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
cooling on the scene with my european partner
laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
when i get there, that's when i tax
the next man, or the next woman
it doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
and i'll recite the chapter in verse
the title of this recital is "ladies first"
step out into the night
queens of civilization are on the mic
the scene is right, the crowd is hype
i expel the wack and those who bite
why, cause i'm that type
swaying with beats 45 king style
he wants me to sing but i swing, so meanwhile
a footnote for the opposite sex
monie ripped the mic, i rocked it next
plex, you never catch me at my worst
you get the drift? it's ladies first

yeah, well, well, owww
yeah yeah...
bring on that pecan pie
pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy
scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
don't be stingy, i'm a growing girl
i offer big love with no apology
how can i deny the world the most of me
i am not afraid to throw my weight around
pound by pound by pound
because i'm big, blonde and beautiful
face the fact, the simply irrefutable
no one wants a meal that only offers the least
when girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast (oh ho)
slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese (woah)
then take a look inside my book of recipes (ooo)
now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
we need a man who brings a man-size appetite
i'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
i'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice (oo ooo)
we'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot
keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot
because i'm big, blonde and beautiful
there is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable (oo oo oo)
why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid (ooo)
when edna, you look like the whole parade
they say that white has might and thin is in
well, that's just bull
'cause ladies, big is back, and as for black
it's beautiful
all shapes and sizes, follow me
who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree (oo, oo oo oo)
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)
oh yeah, groovy baby, groovy

and now, ladies and gentlemen
the keeper of the keys
the countess of the clink
the mistress of murderer's row
matron mama morton!

ask any of the chickies in my pen
they'll tell you i'm the biggest mother... hen
i love them all and all of them love me
because the system works
the system called... reciprocity!
got a little motto
always sees me through
when you're good to mama
mama's good to you
there's a lot of favors
i'm prepared to do
you do one for mama
she'll do one for you
they say that life is tit for tat
and that's the way i live
so i deserve a lot of tat
for what i've got to give
don't you know that this hand
washes that one too
when you're good to mama
mama's good to you
if you want my gravy
pepper my ragú
spice it up for mama
she'll get hot for you
when they pass that basket
folks contribute to
you put in for mama
she'll put out for you
the folks atop the ladder
are the ones the world adores
so boost me up my ladder, kid
and i'll boost you up yours
let's all stroke together
like the princeton crew
when you're strokin' mama
mama's strokin' you
so what's the one conclusion
i can bring this number to?
when you're good to mama
mama's good to you!

we gon take this one over to 275 halsted
384 stuyvesant
we gon take it over to 155 morgan
144 harrison

watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a dt
but it's home, so i flex, get pressures off my chest
slip in a tape, now which hood should i hit next?
stomach ache, head to steak-n-take for a bean pie
get a final call from the brother in the bow tie
i'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
i passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
hit by a stray, but i pray that there's a hood in heaven
fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
you know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
so it's back to the block, time to play

no stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
no reason to put queen in front of the name latifah
i come with the real life perspective and rule
'cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
so it's back to the block, time to play

now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off?
see why i pictured me on this side of the law
high heels leave holes, you'd-a thought i was gunnin'
now the cops comin', i ain't runnin' (he had it comin')
girl, you shoulda seen it, shoulda bobbed and weaved
before the cops came, got a couple of clean hits

or get into some ol' otha shit!
 (2x)

turnin' rough niggas into bitches like "what?!"

well, it's almost nightfall
and there's no forecast of rainfall
and i'm in the mood for a party
so i'm gonna go out to a club
and give the dancefloor body
so i jump in the car and go to the venue
walk in the door and now i'm on the menu
guys in the house, they're watching me
they're clocking me, there's no stopping me

(desire) i know you want me
(you're fine) thank you
but i'm not the type of girl that you think i am
i don't jump into the arms of every man
(but i'm paid) i don't need your money
(i love you) you must be mad
easy lover is something that i ain't
besides, i don't know you from a can of paint

tell me why is it when i walk past the guys
i always hear, "yo, baby"?
i mean like what's the big idea?
i'm a queen, nuff' respect
treat me like a lady
and, no, my name ain't yo and i ain't got your baby
i'm looking for a guy who's sincere
one with class and savoir-faire
i'm looking for someone who has to be
perfect for the queen latifah, me

fly girl, fly girl
come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine
and i want you to be mine
fly girl, fly girl
have no fear, your heart is in good hands
won't you let me be your man?

all my friends are in relationships
some of them good ones and some of them bad ones
some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
and some of the good ones ended up sad ones
you see? loving, it ain't hard to get
i want a friend, not just a lover
someone who is dedicated only to me
not to me and two or three others
one who will not lie to me or think
he can get my love by buying me
i know i'll find him someday
and when i find him
he sure won't say



lounging, sitting in the house
and i'm cooling, first day of the week
so there's nothing to do
and i'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
momma never said there'll be days like this
so i called her and we talked for a while
hang up the phone feeling better
with a smile
it's cool, cuz '91 is my year
and this time i know i'm gonna hear


fly girl 

why y'all ain't say—?!
yo, you know
you know you was supposed to say something to me
ooh, baby baby!

yo, tell me who got my back? (the bronx got your back!)
yo, tell me who got my back? (brooklyn got your back!)
yo-yo-yo who got my back? (uptown got your back!)
thank you as i come back into the beat
give a shoutout to my brother l.a.n.c.e
up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
you know you're too good to be forgotten
papa wasn't there but there was lance in the house
and so, to me and mommy, you the man of the house
always flip the script back to the old days
i used to rock it on the high school stage
i used to drink 40s
back then i didn't blaze
switched to the pipe with the peace these days
just go on to let you know i flow on
i'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on (hoo-ooo)
that's what we about to do (hoo-ooo)

yo chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)
uh
(gimme five on the black hand side)
come on chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)

check it fear don't live in here
tears don't bring me cheers
so gear for another year because i had it up to here
yeah, i'm about through with you
you wack and rooty poo
rip up a crew after i hear the one and the two
i'm ret' to set it off again
wanna bet i can wreck you and your next of kin?
in fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt
you best to get your narrow ass off that crack
we'll play any show and i know that i'll pack it
attack it with my tactics
i'm loaded like a full metal jacket
i flip mines to get mines
i'm happy to get with you
but you can't come out to play right now
you got to much shit to do
it's all game
it all sounds the same
them suckers know my name is
sitting on the tips of their brains
but they're ashamed
they scared to face me
yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
they must be freaking crazy
i'm the la la la from halstead
bred with the queen as a prefix
it's off with your head
and that's a promise 'cause i don't make threats
so mind your neck, 'cause it's about to get set

c'mon set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)
uh, set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)
somebody set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)
watch the la, set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)
uh, set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)

(gimme five on the black hand side)
watch the la, set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)
checks the queen, set it off
(gimme five on the black hand side)

parlay
ah uh, yeah (3x)
black reign, 1993
i'd like to welcome you to this album
matter of fact, i'd like to welcome you to a new day
a new day to hear me
check this out ya'll

you asked, i came, so behold the queen
let's add a little sense to the scene
i'm living positive, not out here knocked up
but the lines are so dangerous, i ought to be locked up
this rhyme doesn't require prime time
i'm just sharing thoughts of mine
back again cause i knew you wanted it
from the latifah with the queen in front of it
dropping bombs, you're up in arms, you're puzzled
the lines will flow like fluid while you're guzzling
the sip i drop you on a bdp-produced track
from krs, to be exact
it's a flavor unit quest that today has me speaking
cause it's knowledge i'm seeking
enough about myself, i think it's time that i tell you
about the evil that men do


situations, reality—what a concept!
nothing ever seems to stay in step
so today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers
here are some things i want to cover
a woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?
because she's living on welfare
i government can't come up with a decent housing plan
so she's in no man's land
it's a sucker who tells you you're equal
you don't need him—johannesburg's crying for freedom!
we the people hold these truths to be self-evident
but there's no response from the president
someone's living the good life, tax-free
except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free
and that's just part of the message
i thought i had to send you about the evil that men do


tell me, don't you think it's a shame?
when someone can put a quarter in a video game
but when a homeless person approaches you on the street
you can't treat him the same
it's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind
that black-on-black crime only shackles and binds
you to a doom, a fate worse than death
but there's still time left
stop putting your conscience on cease
and bring about some type of peace
not only in your heart, but also in your mind
it will benefit all mankind
then there will be one thing that will never stop
and it's the evil that men do

(queen latifah)
yo what's up this is queen latifah in the house
definetely representin jersey on the love love
coolin' out in cali; shootin' living single
but damn i miss home

i can't.. forget new jersey
(verse 1: queen latifah)
when i think of home i think of a place where there's love over-flowin'
and all my family and peeps i knew when i was growin
mommy and daddy made me proud to an owens
taught me to keep goin'
straight up but never knowin'
i would become her eminence and royal highness
the queen latifah; no doubt; one of new jersey's finest
so, set if off
get 'em up on my own
cause jersey's what i think about when i think of home
don't let no one get close to you except the chosen few
stick with the ones who meant the most to you
when you were broke and blue, that's how fam do
that's how you stay true around these snakes
that freakin' smile when they hate you
i'm quick to take the ride down for in-town (?)
(just another day living on a down)
my experience legit, my rhymes is on hit
it's mad truth to the rumor we the shit; i can't forget

(verse 2: queen latifah)
i used to work at burger king but after takin orders
i used to take the path to latin quarters across the waters
when i learned to do the wop, yo, i couldn't stop
i brought it back around the way to show the people on my block
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so simple like that there is nothin to it
so, we meet at irvington high halls and after school i'd run
to the willowbrook mall boostin' with sulamon
i had a talent for getting 'em for gear
petty thief, small time crook of the year
but i chilled cause i had bigger dreams than to steal
and ramsey came for me and apache to put our voices on a reel
and i could hear myself on the radio
"45 king special red alert show"
cause that's what life was all about to me
r-e-p flavor unit, representin' jersey

(verse 3: queen latifah)
i think about my mom and my brothers when i'm on swoll
shakim, when i'm on swoll
my baby sister, when i'm on swoll
hoffstead, when i'm on swoll
ill-town, when i on swoll
jill-town, j.c, when i'm all swoll
irvington, newark and so on, when i'm all swoll
recognize the home of my soul
we got naughty
and uh we got nicky
we got redman, the artifacts and whitney
bon jovi them my bogeys
bruce springsteen, and das efx
shaquille o'neal, oh he'll catch wreck
tisha campbell, jerry lewis, tony bennett
back spin, or spin it
thursday, peppermint i'm in it
shadow's, i knows no foes in the spot
cause them peeps is my peeps and my back is got
nuf' respect to your burough, your block
you're black; i love to see us move as a flock
unstrapped, against each other
no body armor
nobody harms a hair on a head, everything's calmer
and we cool, the ghetto stars and fools
we paid the dues
we made the blues
so come on with the come on
get down with the get down
i'm down with my hometown sound

my mellow, latee, was kicking flavor
the r.e. posse said "yo latifah we can do this"
so i paused and took a thought
then my brillance i caught
and i agreed because i already knew this
now you should want to flex
cause i'm in full effect
queen latifah is five-oh on this set
you've been begging and dying
for somebody's rhyming to set you free
for god so loved the world he gave you me
i'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
and the mic? this mic in my hand? i'm rulin'!
so prepare your mind for my lifeline
and meet the new queen of royal badness
latifah has the spirit so head for the water
and dive into the wrath of my madness

cost of living getting higher
cause them to run away
queen latifah getting higher
cause them to run away

some mcs act bold and arrogant
vain and using each other to compete with
these subjects i pity
cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
to write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
there are those who like my taste
but don't consider biting
there's penalties for those who don't do right
and just be reciting
everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
it's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
well, mine are growing
yes you know like all the woman inside of me
despite what you do or say
and even in spite of me
brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
dying to have a lover of my likeness
so release all your shyness
just call me "your highness"
and dare to feel the wrath of my madness

cost of living getting higher
cause them to run away
queen latifah getting higher
cause them to run away

word of mouth is always everlasting
and everlasting are the words that i bring
the ruler of the ring is lord ramsey
and music is made by mark the 45 king
you tremble for my treble
you're begging for the bass
the voice is too vicious
the same as the pace
the crowds, they love me
the brothers give only hugs
their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug
as a bug, you know why? because i'm bugging
off the beats that dj mark is loving
so plex off the sounds that i'm pumping
i'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
come on, just get into it
don't lie and say you've been through it
feel the wrath of my madness

cost of living getting higher
cause them to run away
queen latifah getting higher
cause them to run away

the scene is mine cause i took it
i took it for the money and i took it for the fun
don't step up in my face
you don't want to feel the taste
don't try to play me out
cause i am not the one
brothers on my bra strap
sisters clocking my sound, why?
because they wanna be down with the
queen l-a-t-i-f-a-h in command
i supply the concept for you to understand
for those who want to bite
don't make me have to fuss
the only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
suckers on the tip
you're loving me, you're leaving me
you wish that one day you could have this
come on, you know the time
just be thankful for the rhyme
and get up on the wrath of my madness

the queen is hyped up
the queen is hyped up
the queen is hyped up
the queen is hyped up
ay yo manda
what's up la?
yo, people have been trying to get fierce on me
i think it's time i tell them about themselves
yo, just give it to them safari style
well, well, well
it's the l a the t i the f a h, you'll see why
q u double e n. is the reason i must be myself
what else? well fame hasn't got me
souped up selling out, sloppy or poppy
there so much to live for, therefore
here's more from a woman
all women keep the rumors to yourself
the over blown home grown not known
fools who never shown proof let alone own
a lot of props or a hip hip pop chart
notch on your clock is my spot
now who got the mott’s?
why you little played out
aa-choo!
i'm allergic to wack crews
the la, the ti, the fah
the queen is up
throwing salt that you never seen before
how dare those who talk we can't have them
some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
but a wise, civilized and growing higher
judgments from the queen punishment is the fire
i'm here to make these fools out of liars
you must learn step and respect the sire, face the fire
latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear
the sound is playing like a q-tip digging your ear ear
mama zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace
i never run my piece damn! i'll take it to your face
open why you hoping none stutter stop 'em
maybe choke (choke)
because it's very hard to breathe while la got you in a yolk
i'll cut your throat, i'll cut it short
no one ever getting near
latifah's had it up to here

give it to 'em queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
give it to 'em queen (i got it)
give it to 'em queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
give it to 'em queen (i got it)
give it to 'em queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
give it to 'em queen (i got it)
give it to em queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
the queen l a t i f a h in command
some of these commercial entertainers
are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
try to dis dana, bumping me off
because the queen has reached a certain plateau
all i do is boo and say "is that so?"
talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
they'd be selling nike tongues instead of sneakers
kay sa rah sa rah, blase bla, etcetera
this is a scene from the queen la, la
lovely and lyrically loose, but lady like
im too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose i got
when im in town i give the boosters booster shots
breaks breaks, face face, never never, waste waste
your mind on a rhyme
that will get thrown in your fronting face
i'll cut your throat, i'll cut it short
no one ever getting near
latifah's had it up to here

royal and loyal
face the fire boy
you wouldn't get the time of the day
so make way, hey, silence i say
lay low and have a cold one
cause the whipping i'm dishing is an old one
i through some soul into my morning bowl then i rolled
i took your gold and stopped your singled
cause it never ever sold
matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
so you could never give me body or come in my house
the flavor unit is doing it back again this year
how many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
feel the force of my holocaust i'm staring at ya
put in a bid on who will fall i'm sure to match ya
snatch ya stature
your broken looks more like a fracture
catch that rapper
latifah will be back to crush ya
go buy a heart
cause from the start i told ya no one getting near
latifah's had it up to here

give it to 'em queen, who got it?
give it to 'em queen latifah
give it to 'em queen, who got it?
give it to 'em queen, the flavor unit
give it to 'em queen, i got it
give it to 'em queen, latifah
give it to 'em queen, dj a d
give it to 'em queen, ease off
give it to 'em queen

l a, l a t i f a h in command
give it to 'em queen
l a t i f a h in command
give it to 'em queen
l a t i f a h in command
give it to 'em queen
l a t i f a h in command
l a t i f a h in command

i can't understand, i can't understand
i can't understand, i can't understand
(it's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

forgive me father for i have sinned
i just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
she wasn't causin' it
she must be stupid as a fiend
they should have told the child 'you don't step to the queen!'
perplexed and i'm vexed 'cause everywhere i go
people be flexin' expectin' me to wanna flow
i don't play that, the only way that
i would be playing is if i pay back
and run the playback, so whatcha sayin'?
you don't wanna be a sista' in the name of rap
and yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
i would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
but now i'm fed, so it's off with your head
now
the moral of the verse is your career is through
and don't be fuckin' with nobody who ain't fuckin' with you
if i was in yo shoes i'd let the bs start walkin'
next time there might not be no talkin'

i can't understand, i can't understand
i can't understand, i can't understand
(it's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

a brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
he was on a quest and i was who he was seekin'
and although i am black and he was a puerto rican
ain't make no diff to me, so we continued to speak and
we hit it right off and everything was on a roll
before i knew it, i fell in love with his soul
"aye papi! aye!" was the cry as he made love to me
i was freaked by the way he used to do me
and then one day when i was washin' our clothes
a number fell outta his pocket and her name was rose
a girl's number? hmmm. that struck me kinda funny
i lost my grip, i had to call up the honey
"there was a chick on the side!" oh no it couldn't be!
"there was a chick on the side!" he's down with opp?
i gave you the whole shabang
just to find another woman hittin' my thang

i can't understand, i can't understand
i can't understand, i can't understand
(it's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)
i can't understand, i can't understand
i can't understand, i can't understand
(it's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

why the negative vibes? and why do people take bribes?
i don't understand it, yo (i don't know)
why do bad people live? and why do good people die?
somebody gotta tell me why  (i don't know)
why do people smoke crack? and why do white fight black?
what's that scenario?  (i don't know)
why do hearts get broken? why the chumps get choked?
they know i ain't no joke  (i don't know)
now, with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
it's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond
i'm tryin' to be as logical as i possibly can
but for the life of me, you know i just can't understand
what's goin' on sometimes
so situations like this come out in my rhymes
but queen latifah ain't gone just yet
'cause when it comes to masterin' confusion i'm a vet

i can't understand, i can't understand
i can't understand, i can't understand
(it's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

brothers better strap they thang-thang

if you can't protect a peck, your chances fail
that's just the pride i keep
he could great sideways, inside out
but still left on the side street
that's just a bare fact
my definition of bareback?
“come at me bare? don't come back”
slap!
try fittin' with a mitten
so you won't be trippin' and flippin'
and skinnydipping in the queen's kitten
so come and get candid

and don't get tricky with the kissy poo
and don't say “don't be cruel” when i'm dissin' you
kissin' you don't mean stickin' you
and if i was wishing to
then you gotta know who i listen to
like tlc
me in heat
when lovin' me, couldn't care
if your hat was to da back, g
don't turn the caution off

and don't say “always” then “often” and soften
someday soon, you got to get to love what you got
then you get love a lot

the safe one's a strapped one
and i don't wanna buy my friends
forget your promises and use your “condom” sense

and i'll be here 'til the last hard head dead ho's gone
either strap up or pack up is my motto
you say, “i wanna stay”
