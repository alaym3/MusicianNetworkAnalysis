it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
i'm not one of those who can easily hide
i don't have much money, but, boy, if i did
i'd buy a big house where we both could live
if i was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
i know it's not much, but it's the best i can do
my gift is my song, and this one's for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple, but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
but the sun's been quite kind while i wrote this song
it's for people like you that keep it turned on
so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do
you see, i've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
anyway, the thing is, what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple, but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

she packed my bags last night, pre-flight
zero hour: 9:00 a.m
and i'm gonna be high as a kite by then
i miss the earth so much, i miss my wife
it's lonely out in space
on such a timeless flight

and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
i'm not the man they think i am at home
oh, no, no, no
i'm a rocket man
rocket man!
burning out his fuse up here alone
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
i'm not the man they think i am at home
oh, no, no, no
i'm a rocket man
rocket man!
burning out his fuse up here alone

mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
in fact, it's cold as hell
and there's no one there to raise them if you did
and all the science, i don't understand
it's just my job five days a week
a rocket man
a rocket man

and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
i'm not the man they think i am at home
oh, no, no, no
i'm a rocket man
rocket man!
burning out his fuse up here alone
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
i'm not the man they think i am at home
oh, no, no, no
i'm a rocket man

burning out his fuse up here alone

and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time
and i think it's gonna be a long, long time

when are you gonna come down?
when are you going to land?
i should have stayed on the farm
i should have listened to my old man
you know you can't hold me forever
i didn't sign up with you
i'm not a present for your friends to open
this boy's too young to be singing the blues

ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah-ah, ah

so goodbye yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you can't plant me in your penthouse
i'm going back to my plough
back to the howling old owl in the woods
hunting the horny-back toad
oh, i've finally decided my future lies
beyond the yellow brick road

ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah-ah, ah

what do you think you'll do, then?
i bet they'll shoot down the plane
it'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
to set you on your feet again
maybe you'll get a replacement
there's plenty like me to be found
mongrels who ain't got a penny
sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah-ah, ah

so goodbye yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you can't plant me in your penthouse
i'm going back to my plough
back to the howling old owl in the woods
hunting the horny-back toad
oh, i've finally decided my future lies
beyond the yellow brick road

ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah-ah, ah

blue jean baby, l.a. lady
seamstress for the band
pretty-eyed, pirate smile
you'll marry a music man
ballerina, you must've seen her
dancing in the sand
and now she's in me, always with me
tiny dancer in my hand

jesus freaks out in the street
handing tickets out for god
turning back, she just laughs
the boulevard is not that bad
piano man, he makes his stand
in the auditorium
looking on, she sings the songs
the words she knows, the tune she hums

but, oh, how it feels so real
lying here with no one near
only you, and you can hear me
when i say softly, slowly

hold me closer, tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today
hold me closer, tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today

ooh

hey kids, shake it loose together
the spotlight's hitting something
that's been known to change the weather
we'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
you're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

say, candy and ronnie, have you seen them yet?
ooh, but they're so spaced out
b-b-b-bennie and the jets
oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
oh, bennie, she's really keen

she's got electric boots, a mohair suit
you know i read it in a magazine, oh
b-b-b-bennie and the jets

hey kids, plug into the faithless
maybe they're blinded, but bennie makes them ageless
we shall survive, let us take ourselves along
where we fight our parents out in the streets
to find who's right and who's wrong

say, candy and ronnie, have you seen them yet?
ooh, but they're so spaced out
b-b-b-bennie and the jets

you could never know what it's like
your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
and there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
you'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
and did you think this fool could never win?
well look at me, i'm a-coming back again
i got a taste of love in a simple way
and if you need to know while i'm still standing
you just fade away

don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did?
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
and i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

once, i never coulda hoped to win
you starting down the road, leaving me again
the threats you made were meant to cut me down
and if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
and i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)


don't you know that i'm still standing better than i ever did?
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
and i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

i can't light no more of your darkness
all my pictures seem to fade to black and white
i'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
frozen here on the ladder of my life

too late to save myself from falling
i took a chance and changed your way of life
but you misread my meanin' when i met you
closed the door and left me blinded by the light

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

i can't find, oh, the right romantic line
but see me once and see the way i feel
don't discard me just because you think i mean you harm
but these cuts i have, oh, they need love to help them heal

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

there's a calm surrender to the rush of day
when the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
an enchanted moment, and it sees me through
it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

and can you feel the love tonight?
it is where we are
it's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight?
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best

there's a time for everyone if they only learn
that the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
there's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
when the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

and can you feel the love tonight?
it is where we are
it's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight?
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best

it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best

goodbye, norma jeane
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
they crawled out of the woodwork
and they whispered into your brain
they set you on the treadmill
and they made you change your name

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did

loneliness was tough
the toughest role you ever played
hollywood created a superstar
and pain was the price you paid
and even when you died
oh, the press still hounded you
all the papers had to say
was that marilyn was found in the nude

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did

goodbye, norma jeane
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
goodbye, norma jeane
from the young man in the 22nd row
who sees you as something more than sexual
more than just our marilyn monroe

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did

it's getting late, have you seen my mates?
ma, tell me when the boys get here
it's seven o'clock and i wanna rock
wanna get a belly full of beer
my old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
and my old lady, she don't care
my sister looks cute in her braces and boots
a handful of grease in her hair

oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
oh, saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
i'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
i may use a little muscle to get what i need
i may sink a little drink and shout out, "she's with me!"
a couple of the sounds that i really like
are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
i'm a juvenile product of the working class
whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh


oh, don't give us none of your aggravation

oh, and i can see daniel wavin' goodbye
god, it looks like daniel
must be the clouds in my eyes

they say spain is pretty, though i've never been
and daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
lord, i miss daniel
oh, i miss him so much

oh, daniel, my brother, you are older than me
do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
your eyes have died, but you see more than i
daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

i remember when rock was young
me and susie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
but the biggest kick i ever got
was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
while the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
we were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock

well, crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time, and i guess i never will
oh, lawdy mama, those friday nights
when susie wore her dresses tight
and the crocodile rocking was out of sight

laa, la-la-la-la-laa
la-la-la-la-laa
la-la-la-la-laa

but the years went by and the rock just died
susie went and left us for some foreign guy
long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans
but they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the crocodile rock
learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the crocodile rock would last

well, crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time, and i guess i never will
oh, lawdy mama, those friday nights
when susie wore her dresses tight
and the crocodile rocking was out of sight

laa, la-la-la-la-laa

don't wish it away
don't look at it like it's forever
between you and me, i could honestly say
that things can only get better

and while i'm away
dust out the demons inside
and it won't be long before you and me run
to the place in our hearts where we hide

and i guess that's why they call it the blues
time on my hands could be time spent with you
laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
rollin' like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why they call it the blues

just stare into space
picture my face in your hands
live for each second without hesitation
and never forget i'm your man

wait on me, girl
cry in the night if it helps
but more than ever, i simply love you
more than i love life itself

and i guess that's why they call it the blues
time on my hands could be time spent with you
laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
rollin' like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why they call it the blues

goodbye england's rose
may you ever grow in our hearts
you were the grace that placed itself
where lives were torn apart
you called out to our country
and you whispered to those in pain
now you belong to heaven
and the stars spell out your name

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

loveliness we've lost
these empty days without your smile
this torch, we'll always carry
for our nation's golden child
and even though we try
the truth brings us to tears
all our words cannot express
the joy you brought us through the years

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

goodbye england's rose
may you ever grow in our hearts
you were the grace that placed yourself
where lives were torn apart
goodbye england's rose
from a country lost without your soul
who'll miss the wings of your compassion
more than you will ever know

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

it's a human sign
when things go wrong
when the scent of her lingers
and temptation's strong
into the boundary
of each married man
sweet deceit comes callin'
and negativity lands

cold, cold heart
hardened by you
some things lookin' better, baby
just passin' through

and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts livin'
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all

mutual misunderstandin'
after the fact
sensitivity builds a prison
in the final act
we lose direction
no stone unturned
no tears to damn you
when jealousy burns

cold, cold heart
hardened by you
some things lookin' better, baby
just passin' through

and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts livin'
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all

cold, cold heart
hardened by you
some things lookin' better, baby
just passin' through

and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts livin'
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all

no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all

'cause he likes the name
and he sends him to the finest school in town
levon, levon likes his money
he makes a lot, they say

in a garage by the motorway

he was born a pauper to a pawn on a christmas day
when the new york times said "god is dead

alvin tostig has a son today

and he shall be levon
and he shall be a good man
and he shall be levon
in tradition with the family plan
and he shall be levon
and he shall be a good man
he shall be levon

levon sells cartoon balloons in town
his family business thrives
jesus blows up balloons all day
sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
and jesus, he wants to go to venus
leave levon far behind
take a balloon and go sailin'
while levon, levon slowly dies

he was born a pauper to a pawn on a christmas day
when the new york times said "god is dead
and the war's begun"
alvin tostig has a son today

and he shall be levon

you stand at the edge while people run you through
and i thank the lord there's people out there like you
i thank the lord there's people out there like you

while mona lisas and mad hatters
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
turn around and say, "good morning" to the night
for unless they see the sky
but they can't, and that is why
they know not if it's dark outside or light

this broadway's got
it's got a lot of songs to sing
if i knew the tunes, i might join in
i'd go my way alone
i'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in new york city

subway's no way for a good man to go down
rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
and i thank the lord for the people i have found
i thank the lord for the people i have found

when i think of those east end lights, muggy nights
the curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
prima donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
and it's one more beer, and i don't hear you anymore
we've all gone crazy lately
my friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (ooh)

and someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
you almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
you nearly had me roped and tied
altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
you're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
fly away, high away, bye-bye (ooh)


i never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
a slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
i'm strangled by your haunted social scene
just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
it's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! listen to me good
i'm sleepin' with myself tonight
saved in time, thank god my music's still alive
(oh!)

someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(sugar bear, sugar bear)
you almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
you nearly had me roped and tied
altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
you're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
fly away, high away, bye-bye (ooh)


and i would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
clingin' to your stocks and bonds
payin' your h.p. demands forever
they're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
so save your strength, and run the field you play alone

someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
you almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
you nearly had me roped and tied
altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
you're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
fly away, high away, bye-bye

someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)
someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(someone saved my life tonight)

when i look back, boy, i must have been green
bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
until i saw your city lights, honey, i was blind

they said, get back, honky cat
better get back to the woods
but, i quit those days and my redneck ways
and, oh, change is gonna do me good
you better get back, honky cat
living in the city ain't where it's at
it's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
it's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

well, i read some books and i read some magazines
about those high-class ladies down in new orleans
and all the fools back home, well, said i was a fool
they said, oh, "believe in the lord" is the golden rule

they said, get back, honky cat
better get back to the woods
but i quit those days and my redneck ways
and, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(ooh, baby)
they said, get back, honky cat
better get back to the woods
well, i quit those days and my redneck ways
and, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

they said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
but how can you stay when your heart says no
ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

you better get back, honky cat
better get back to the woods
well, i quit those days and my redneck ways
and, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
you better get back, honky cat
living in the city ain't where it's at
it's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
it's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

oh yeah, get back, honky cat
get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
get back, honky cat
get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
oh, get back, honky cat, get back
get back, honky cat, whoo
oh yeah, redneck ways and
whoo
