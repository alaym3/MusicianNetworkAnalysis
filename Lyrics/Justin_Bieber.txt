for all the times that you rained on my parade
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
you think i'm cryin' on my own, well i ain't

and i didn't wanna write a song
'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't, but you still hit my phone up
and baby, i'll be movin' on
and i think you should be somethin' i don't wanna hold back
maybe you should know that

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

but when you told me that you hated my friends
the only problem was with you and not them
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from

and i didn't wanna write a song
'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't, but you still hit my phone up
and baby, i'll be movin' on
and i think you should be somethin' i don't wanna hold back
maybe you should know that

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
i never felt so low and i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls?

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

you gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
you know i try, but i don't do too well with apologies
i hope i don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'cause i just need one more shot at forgiveness
i know you know that i made those mistakes maybe once or twice
by once or twice, i mean maybe a couple a hundred times
so let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'cause i just need one more shot at second chances

yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'cause i'm missing more than just your body
oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
yeah, i know that i let you down
is it too late to say i'm sorry now?

i'm sorry, yeah
sorry, yeah
sorry
yeah, i know that i let you down
is it too late to say i'm sorry now?

i'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
but you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
i'll go, i'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
can we both say the words and forget this?

yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'cause i'm missing more than just your body
oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
yeah, i know that i let you down
is it too late to say i'm sorry now?

i'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no)
'cause i'm missing more than just your body (your body)
oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
yeah, i know that i let you down
is it too late to say i'm sorry now?

i'm sorry, yeah
sorry, oh

is it too late to say i'm sorry now?
i'm sorry, yeah

there was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us, nor could ever come above

she woke me up daily, don't need no starbucks
she made my heart pound, and skip a beat when i see her in the street and
at school on the playground, but i really wanna see her on the weekend

my life is a movie and everyone's watching
so let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
when the pressure's coming down like lightning
it's like they want me to be perfect
when they don't even know that i'm hurting

cause life's not easy, i'm not made out of steel
don't forget that i'm human, don't forget that i'm real
act like you know me, but you never will
there's one thing that i know for sure
i'll show you
i'll show you
i'll show you
i'll show you

i've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
when the pressure's coming down like lightning
it's like they want me to be perfect
when they don't even know that i'm hurting

cause life's not easy, i'm not made out of steel
don't forget that i'm human, don't forget that i'm real
act like you know me, but you never will
there's one thing that i know for sure
i'll show you
i'll show you
i'll show you
i'll show you
cause life's not easy, i'm not made out of steel
don't forget that i'm human, don't forget that i'm real
act like you know me, but you never will
there's one thing that i know for sure

i'll show you
i'll show you

mark my words, that's all that i have
mark my words, give you all i got
in every way i will
you're the only reason why
oh i don't wanna live a lie
mark my words
mark my words

so you heard it all before
falling in and out of trust
trying to rekindle us
only to lose yourself
but i won't let me lose you
and i won't let us just fade away
after all that we've been through
i'ma show you more than i ever could say

mark my words, that's all that i have
mark my words, give you all i got
in every way i will
you're the only reason why
oh i don't wanna live a lie
mark my words
mark my words

dance with me under the diamonds
see me like breath in the cold
sleep with me here in the silence
come kiss me, silver and gold

you say that i won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
so just hold on like you will never let go
yeah, if you ever move on without me
i need to make sure you know that

you are the only one i'll ever love (i gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (i gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
lookin' back on my life, you're the only good i've ever done (ever done)
yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (anyone), not anyone

forever's not enough time to (oh)
love you the way that i want (love you the way that i want)
'cause every mornin', i'll find you (oh)
i fear the day that i don't

you say that i won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
'cause certain things are out of our control
yeah, if you ever move on without me
i need to make sure you know that

you are the only one i'll ever love (only one, i gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (i gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
lookin' back on my life, you're the only good i've ever done (i've ever done)

yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone

feeling like i'm breathing my last breath
feeling like i'm walking my last steps
look at all of these tears i've wept
look at all the promises that i've kept

i put my all into your hands
here's my soul to keep
i let you in with all that i can
you're not hard to reach

and you bless me with the best gift
that i've ever known
you give me purpose
yeah, you've given me purpose

thinking my journey's come to an end
sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
i'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

i put my heart into your hands
learn the lessons you teach
no matter when, wherever i am
you're not hard to reach

and you've given me the best gift
that i've ever known
you give me purpose everyday
you give me purpose in every way

oh, you are my everything
oh, you are my everything

i don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. but i feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  we weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
you can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. you know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. if you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
that’s what happening with me, it’s like “god, i’m giving it all i’ve got, sometimes i’m weak and i’m going to do it.” and it’s like i’m not giving myself grace, i’m just like understanding that’s how it is

if i was your boyfriend, i’d never let you go
i could take you places you ain’t never been before
baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
i got money in my hands that i’d really like to blow
swag swag swag, on you
chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
i dunno about me, but i know about you
so say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

i’d like to be everything you want
hey girl, let me talk to you

if i was your boyfriend, i'd never let you go
keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
and i can be a gentleman, anything you want
if i was your boyfriend, i’d never let you go, i’d never let you go

tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don’t
i could be your buzz lightyear, fly across the globe
i don’t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
i‘ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
you could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
swaggy

i’d like to be everything you want
hey girl, let me talk to you

if i was your boyfriend, i'd never let you go
keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
and i can be a gentleman, anything you want
if i was your boyfriend, i’d never let you go, i’d never let you go

so give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all i need, girl
spend a week with your boy, i’ll be calling you my girlfriend
if i was your man (if i was your man), i’d never leave you, girl
i just wanna love and treat you right

if i was your boyfriend, i'd never let you go (oh yeah)
keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone (never be alone)
and i could be a gentleman (a gentleman, ooh), anything you want
if i was your boyfriend (boyfriend), i’d never let you go
i’d never let you go (if i was your boyfriend)

'less you're waking up in here with me
oh, my heart's a vacant house
when you're gone away, it's so empty
and love don't make sense when it's empty (oh no)
