"show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
the one that makes me scream", she said
"the one that makes me laugh", she said
and threw her arms around my neck
"show me how you do it, and i promise you
i promise that i'll run away with you
i'll run away with you"

spinning on that dizzy edge
kissed her face and kissed her head
dreamed of all the different ways i had to make her glow
"why are you so far away?", she said
"why won't you ever know that i'm in love with you?
that i'm in love with you?"

you, soft and only
you, lost and lonely
you, strange as angels
dancing in the deepest oceans
twisting in the water
you're just like a dream
you're just like a dream

daylight licked me into shape
i must have been asleep for days
and moving lips to breathe her name
i opened up my eyes
and found myself alone, alone
alone above a raging sea
that stole the only girl i loved
and drowned her deep inside of me

you, soft and only
you, lost and lonely
you, just like heaven

i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can fall apart
tuesday, wednesday, break my heart
oh, thursday doesn't even start

tuesday, wednesday heart attack
thursday never looking back

monday you can hold your head
tuesday, wednesday stay in bed
or thursday watch the walls instead
it's friday, i'm in love

saturday, wait
and sunday always comes too late
but friday, never hesitate

dressed up to the eyes
it's a wonderful surprise
to see your shoes and your spirits rise
throwing out your frown
and just smiling at the sound
and as sleek as a shriek
spinning round and round
always take a big bite
it's such a gorgeous sight
to see you eat in the middle of the night
you can never get enough
enough of this stuff
it's friday i'm in love

i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can fall apart
tuesday, wednesday break my heart
thursday doesn't even start
it's friday, i'm in love

whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am home again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am whole again

whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am young again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am fun again

however far away
i will always love you
however long i stay
i will always love you
whatever words i say
i will always love you
i will always love you

(fly me to the moon)


whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am free again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am clean again

however far away
i will always love you
however long i stay
i will always love you
whatever words i say
i will always love you
i will always love you

i would say i'm sorry
if i thought that it would change your mind
but i know that this time
i have said too much, been too unkind

i tried to laugh about it
cover it all up with lies
i tried to laugh about it
hiding the tears in my eyes
'cause boys don't cry
boys don't cry

i would break down at your feet
and beg forgiveness, plead with you
but i know that it's too late
and now there's nothing i can do

so i try to laugh about it
cover it all up with lies
i try to laugh about it
hiding the tears in my eyes
'cause boys don't cry
boys don't cry

i would tell you that i loved you
if i thought that you would stay
but i know that it's no use
and you've already gone away

misjudged your limits
pushed you too far
took you for granted
i thought that you needed me more, more, more

now i would do 'most anything
to get you back by my side
but i just keep on laughing
hiding the tears in my eyes
'cause boys don't cry
boys don't cry

boys don't cry

i've been looking so long at these pictures of you
that i almost believe that they're real
i've been living so long with my pictures of you
that i almost believe that the pictures are all i can feel

remembering you standing quiet in the rain
as i ran to your heart to be near
and we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
how i always held close in your fear

remembering you running soft through the night
you were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
and screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
and you finally found all your courage to let it all go

remembering you fallen into my arms
crying for the death of your heart
you were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
you were always so lost in the dark

remembering you, how you used to be
slow drowned, you were angels
so much more than everything
hold for the last time then slip away quietly
open my eyes, but i never see anything

if only i'd thought of the right words
i could have held on to your heart
if only i'd thought of the right words
i wouldn't be breaking apart
all my pictures of you

looking so long at these pictures of you
but i never hold on to your heart
looking so long for the words to be true
and always just breaking apart
my pictures of you

there was nothing in the world
that i ever wanted more
than to feel you deep in my heart
there was nothing in the world
that i ever wanted more
than to never feel the breaking apart
all my pictures of you

i spy with the corner of my little eye
something beginning with 's'

on candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
softly through the shadow of the evening sun
stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
looking for the victim shivering in bed
searching out fear in the gathering gloom
and suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
and there is nothing i can do when i realise with fright
that the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

quietly he laughs and shaking his head
creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
and softer than shadow and quicker than flies
his arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
don't struggle like that or i will only love you more
for it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
the spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

and i feel like i'm being eaten
by a thousand million shivering, furry holes
and i know that in the morning
i will wake up in the shivering cold
and the spiderman is always hungry

"come into my parlor," said the spider to the fly
"i have a little something here"

i've waited hours for this
i've made myself so sick
i wish i'd stayed asleep today
i never thought this day would end
i never thought tonight could ever be
this close to me

just try to see in the dark
just try to make it work
to feel the fear before you're here
i make the shapes come much too close
i pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait
until i sha-ha-ha-hake

but if i had your faith
then i could make it safe and clean
oh, if only i was sure
that my head on the door was a dream

i've waited hours for this
i've made myself so sick
i wish i'd stayed asleep today
i never thought this day would end
i never thought tonight could ever be
this close to me

but if i had your faith
then i could make it safe and clean
oh, if only i was sure
that my head on the door was a dream

oh, i miss the kiss of treachery
the shameless kiss of vanity
the soft and the black and the velvety
up tight against the side of me
and mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
and run in thickening streams of greed
as bit by bit it starts the need
to just let go my party piece

i miss the kiss of treachery
the aching kiss before i feed
the stench of a love for a younger meat
and the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
the holding up on bended knees
the addiction of duplicities
as bit by bit it starts the need
to just let go my party piece

but i never said i would stay to the end
so i leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
screaming me over and over and over
i leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
songs about happiness murmured in dreams
when we both of us knew how the ending would be

so it's all come back round to breaking apart again
breaking apart like i'm made up of glass again
making it up behind my back again
holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
holding it up behind my head again
cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
round and round and round and it's coming apart again
over and over and over

and now that i know that i'm breaking to pieces
i'll pull out my heart and i'll feed it to anyone
i'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
for the love of the crowd
and the three cheers from everyone
dropping through sky
through the glass of the roof
through the roof of your mouth
through the mouth of your eye
through the eye of the needle
it's easier for me to get closer to heaven
than ever feel whole again

but i never said i would stay to the end
i knew i would leave you with babies and everything
screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
screaming it over and over and over
i leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
and stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
and songs about happiness murmured in dreams
when we both of us knew how the end always is
how the end always is

how the end always is
how the end always is
how the end always is
how the end always is
always is
always is

yesterday i got so old, i felt like i could die
yesterday i got so old, it made me want to cry
go on, go on, just walk away
go on, go on, your choice is made
go on, go on and disappear
go on, go on away from here

and i know i was wrong when i said it was true
that it couldn't be me and be her inbetween without you
without you

yesterday i got so scared, i shivered like a child
yesterday, away from you, it froze me deep inside
come back come back, don't walk away
come back, come back, come back today
come back, come back, why can't you see?
come back, come back, come back to me

and i know i was wrong when i said it was true
that it couldn't be me and be her in between without you
without you
without you, without you

without you, without you
without you, without you

come closer and see
see into the trees
find the girl while you can
come closer and see
see into the dark
just follow your eyes
just follow your eyes

i hear her voice
calling my name
the sound is deep
in the dark
i hear her voice
and start to run
into the trees
into the trees
into the trees

suddenly i stop
but i know it's too late
i'm lost in a forest
all alone
the girl was never there
it's always the same
i'm running towards nothing
again and again and again and again

i think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
and the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
and it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
and then you smiled for a second

i think i'm old and i'm feeling pain, you said
and it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
and it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
and then you smiled for a second

sometimes you make me feel
like i'm living at the edge of the world
like i'm living at the edge of the world
it's just the way i smile, you said

oh, it's opening time down on fascination street
so let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
because i feel it all fading and paling, and i'm begging
to drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

yeah, i like you in that like i like you to scream
but if you open your mouth, then i can't be responsible
for quite what goes in or to care what comes out
so just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

and let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
if you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
so just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
and let's hit opening time down on fascination street

so pull on your hair, pull on your pout
cut the conversation, just open your mouth
pull on your face, pull on your feet
and let's hit opening time down on fascination street

down on fascination street
down on fascination street
down on fascination street
on fascination street

oh, elise it doesn't matter what you say
i just can't stay here every yesterday
like keep on acting out the same
the way we act out
every way to smile, forget
and make-believe we never needed
any more than this
any more than this

oh, elise it doesn't matter what you do
i know i'll never really get inside of you
to make your eyes catch fire
the way they should
the way the blue could pull me in
if they only would, if they only would
at least i'd lose this sense of sensing
something else that hides away
from me and you, there are worlds to part
with aching looks and breaking hearts
and all the prayers your hands can make
oh, i just take as much as you can throw
and then throw it all away
oh i'll throw it all away
like throwing faces at the sky
like throwing arms round yesterday
i stood and stared
wide-eyed in front of you
and the face i saw looked back the way i wanted to
but i just can't hold my tears away the way you do
elise, believe i never wanted this
i thought this time i'd keep all of my promises
i thought you were the girl i always dreamed about
but i let the dream go
and the promises broke and make-believe ran out

so, elise it doesn't matter what you say
i just can't stay here every yesterday
like keep on acting out the same
the way we act out
every way to smile, forget
and make-believe we never needed
any more than this
any more than this

and every time i try to pick it up
like falling sand
as fast as i pick it up
it runs away through my clutching hands
but there's nothing else i can really do
there's nothing else i can really do
there's nothing else i can really do
at all

we move like cagey tigers
we couldn't get closer than this
the way we walk, the way we talk
the way we stalk, the way we kiss
we slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
getting bigger and sleeker, and wider and brighter
we bite and scratch and scream all night
let's go and throw all the songs we know

into the sea, you and me
all the years and no one heard
i'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
we missed you hissed the lovecats
we missed you hissed the lovecats
we're so wonderfully, wonderfully
wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
oh, you know that i'd do anything for you
we should have each other to tea, huh?
we should have each other with cream?
then curl up in the fire
and sleep for awhile
it's the grooviest thing
it's the perfect dream
into the sea, you and me
all the years and no one heard
i'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
we missed you hissed the lovecats
we missed you hissed the lovecats
we're so wonderfully, wonderfully
wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
oh, you know that i'd do anything for you
we should have each other to dinner, huh?
we should have each other with cream?
then curl up in the fire
get up for awhile
it's the grooviest thing
it's the perfect dream

hand in hand is the only way to land
and always the right way round
not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
how could we miss someone as dumb as this?

i love you, let's go
oh, solid gold
how could we miss
someone as dumb as this?

it doesn't matter if we all die
ambition in the back of a black car
in a high building there is so much to do
going home time, a story on the radio

something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
a prayer for something better
a prayer for something better
please love me
meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
creeping up the stairs in the dark
waiting for the death blow
waiting for the death blow
waiting for the death blow

stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
fighting for freedom on the television
sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
have we got everything?,
she struggles to get away
the pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
waiting for saturday, the death of her father pushing her
pushing her white face into the mirror
aching inside me and turn me 'round
just like the old days
just like the old days
just like the old days
just like the old days

caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
just a piece of new meat in a clean room
the soldiers close in under a yellow moon
all shadows and deliverance under a black flag
a hundred years of blood, crimson
the ribbon tightens round my throat
i open my mouth and my head bursts open
a sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
thrashing in the water
over and over, we die one after the other
over and over, we die one after the other
one after the other
one after the other
one after the other
one after the other

it feels like a hundred years
a hundred years
a hundred years
a hundred years
a hundred years

before we finally  bbc 2 today  a reminder that there's a treat in store for opera lovers  tomorrow evening with a sparkling performance from the royal opera house in covent garden of one of the world's best-loved romantic operas: pavarotti  puccini at 5-past-8 tomorrow. well now there's the last look at the clock this eve, and the time's just winding its way round to eight minutes to one. if you're still up and about and want a bit more entertainment, a reminder that our colleagues over at bbc radio are still on the airwaves. on radio 2 in eight minutes sheila tracey - that's radio 2's "tiger tim" - takes over with the truckers' hour, and then at 2 o'clock you and the night and the music with tim gudgin through 'til five. but for now, on behalf of everyone here on bbc 2, this is robin whitting-

yeah, a green sedan. no, the licence plates were covered with mud. they took tyres and gas. (tell him they took all the cash.) they robbed the cash register too. i got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again. (i wonder if the baby is born yet.) poor joan. they're being blamed for every crime committed in the country


a hand in my mouth
a life spills into the flowers
we all look so perfect
as we all fall down
in an electric glare
the old man cracks with age
she found his last picture
in the ashes of the fire

an image of the queen
echoes round the sweating bed
sour yellow sounds inside my head
in books
and films
and in life
and in heaven
the sound of slaughter
as your body turns...

but it's too late
but it's too late

one more day like today and i'll kill you
a desire for flesh
and real blood
and i'll watch you drown in the shower
pushing my life through your open eyes...

i must fight this sickness
find a cure
i must fight this sickness

kiss me goodbye, pushing out before i sleep
can't you see i try?
swimming the same deep water as you is hard
"the shallow drowned lose less than we," you breathe
the strangest twist upon your lips
"and we shall be together
we shall be together"

"kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me"
and face pushed deep, reflections meet
the strangest twist upon your lips
and disappear, the ripples clear
and laughing, break against your feet
and laughing, break the mirror sweet
"so we shall be together
so we shall be together"

"kiss me goodbye," pushing out before i sleep
it's lower now, and slower now
the strangest twist upon your lips
but i don't see, and i don't feel
but tightly hold up silently
my hands, before my fading eyes
and in my eyes your smile
the very last thing before i go
the very last thing before i go
the very last thing before i go

i will kiss you, i will kiss you
i will kiss you forever on nights like this
i will kiss you, i will kiss you
and we shall be together

standing on the beach
with a gun in my hand
staring at the sky
staring at the sand
staring down the barrel
at the arab on the ground
i can see his open mouth
but i hear no sound

i'm alive
i'm dead
i'm the stranger
killing an arab

i can turn
and walk away
or i can fire the gun
staring at the sky
staring at the sun
whichever i chose
it amounts to the same
absolutely nothing

i'm alive
i'm dead
i'm the stranger
killing an arab

i feel the steel butt jump
smooth in my hand
staring at the sea
staring at the sand
staring at myself
reflected in the eyes
of the dead man on the beach
(the dead man on the beach)

i'm alive
i'm dead
i'm the stranger
killing an arab

'don't look, don't look,' the shadows breathe
whispering me away from you
'don't wake at night to watch her sleep
you know that you will always lose
this trembling, adored
tousled birdmad girl'

but every night i burn
every night i call your name
every night i burn
every night i fall again

'oh, don't talk of love' the shadows purr
murmuring me away from you
'don't talk of worlds that never were
the end is all that's ever true
there's nothing you can ever say
nothing you can ever do'

still every night i burn
every night i scream your name
every night i burn
every night the dream's the same
every night i burn
waiting for my only friend
every night i burn
waiting for the world to end

'just paint your face' the shadows smile
slipping me away from you
'oh, it doesn't matter how you hide
find you if we're wanting to
so slide back down and close your eyes
sleep a while, you must be tired...'

but every night i burn
every night i call your name
every night i burn
every night i fall again
every night i burn
scream the animal scream
every night i burn
dream the crow black dream
every night i burn
scream the animal scream
every night i burn
dream the crow black dream

dream the crow black dream...
dream the crow black dream...
dream the crow black dream...
dream the crow black dream...

i'm running out of time
i'm out of step and closing down
and never sleep for wanting hours
the empty hours of greed
and uselessly always the need
to feel again the real belief
of something more than mockery
if only i could fill my heart with love
