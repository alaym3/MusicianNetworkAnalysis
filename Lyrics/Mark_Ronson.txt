this world can hurt you
it cuts you deep and leaves a scar
things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
and nothing breaks like a heart

i heard you on the phone last night
we live and die by pretty lies
you know it, oh, we both know it
these silver bullet cigarettes
this burning house, there's nothing left
it's smoking, we both know it
we got all night to fall in love
but just like that, we fall apart
we're broken, we're broken

mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

well, there's broken silence
by thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
and this broken record
spin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)
this world can hurt you
it cuts you deep and leaves a scar
things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

we'll leave each other cold as ice
and high and dry, the desert wind
is blowin', is blowin'
remember what you said to me?
we were drunk in love in tennessee
and i hold it, we both know it

mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

well, there's broken silence
by thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
and this broken record
spin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)
this world can hurt you
it cuts you deep and leaves a scar
things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
nothing breaks like a heart
mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

my heart, my heart
well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
my heart, my heart
nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

well, there's broken silence
by thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
and this broken record
spin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)
this world can hurt you
it cuts you deep and leaves a scar
things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
but nothing breaks like a heart
mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart

i'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
but they don't have a shot when i compare them to you
it's too late, too late
baby, i know i'll never find you again
find you again

baby, baby, i
walk in the late night
looking for your eyes
put up a fight to find you
lose it every time
you were the last of your kind
all of the blame's mine

and i remember you told me
that we could work it all out, don't you worry
and now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
but if you say try again, i'd be ready
i'm ready, yeah

i'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
but they don't have a shot when i compare them to you
it's too late, too late
baby, i know i'll never find you again
find you again

have mercy on me, please
i messed up to the third degree
this crush is kind of crushing me
i do therapy at least twice a week
there's a you-shaped space in my bed
always you-shaped thoughts inside my head, like
i keep wishing i'd run into you
la cienega, where i remember you

and i remember you told me (told me)
that we could work it all out, don't you worry (yeah, yeah, yeah)
and now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
but if you say try again, i'd be ready
i'm ready

i'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
but they don't have a shot when i compare them to you
it's too late, too late
baby, i know i'll never find you again

find you again
find you again
find you again
find you again
find you again (it's too late)
find you again (it's too late)
find you again (it's too late)
find you again (it's too late)

i'll try to pass the night away with somebody new (find you again)
but they don't have a shot when i compare them to you (find you again)
it's too late, too late
baby, i know i'll never find you again
find you again

i wade the water, i feel it all
i ask myself a million questions in the dark
i lay in silence, but silence talks
it tells me heaven is no closer than it was

my heart keeps pulling in the wrong direction
i'm about to cross that line
looking for the wrong affection
night after night
tryna find a new distraction

i'm about to cross that line
looking for the wrong affection
night after night, i'm
tryna find a new distraction

run your fingers down the cool
underbelly of the blue evening
crank that vapor-wagon
start that kick dragon beating
step out on the patio
follow where your daddy-o's leading
wrestle with our shadow twins
hold'em till they're glowin' in warning
hit that bubble kit now
laughin' as you breathe out, easy
drop another daffodil
we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil sail off the map until morning
baby just say no to sleep
bodies got to keep exploring
sweet volcano violence
vast new continents spawning
drop another daffodil
we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning
put another record on
maybe chaka khan or rocky
catch on fire above the
green empire of the kraken
flow with the isosceles
to the beat of six knees knocking
drop another daffodil we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning

whenever you would get up in your feelings, i would always listen
now you turn around and leave

oh, if we fall apart, let's do it in the dark
hit me in the heart this time

don't you leave me lonely tonight
'cause i won't forgive you (won't forgive you)
don't you leave me lonely tonight
'cause i can't forget you (can't forget you)
i toss and turn alone in my bed
when you should be laying here beside me instead
oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'cause i won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time

tell me if this love is a lie
'cause the ticking time is passing me by, babe
i'm waiting, but the second hand is turning
burning all the circles in my mind, eh
anticipating 'cause you know i'm never satisfied
and i don't want to hear the reasons why, why, why we fight, eh

oh, if we fall apart, let's do it in the dark
hit me in the heart this time

don't you leave me lonely tonight
'cause i won't forgive you (won't forgive you)

fucking around, i'm falling in love
saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
all that you were, all that you lost
who ever thought it came with a cost?

we were alone, we were to blame
alive with the same blood in our veins
i never thought to find a way here
well, you can't plan for this one, it's nothing compared
to the fate of the thing searching forward to me
all the world to be seen as it's all passing by

fucking around, i'm falling in love
saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
all that you were, all that you lost
who ever thought it came with a cost?
i ran to you, i ran to you
i ran to you and you know why
i ran to you, i ran to you
i ran to you and you know why

love the way you read my eyes
i love the way you read my eyes

to the fate of the thing searchin' forward to me
when it's finally seen all the love in your eyes
well, i should've known it, how the world disappeared
when you came around, when you came around
when you came around
when you came around, you came around

fucking around, i'm falling in love
saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
all that you were, all that you lost
who ever thought it came with a cost?
i ran to you, i ran to you
i ran to you and you know why
i ran to you, i ran to you
i ran to you and you know why

love the way you read my eyes
i love the way you read my eyes

wasted on your love
wasted on the things you don't remember about yourself
the way you turn me on
it's easy to forget all of the ways you scare me, too, yeah
you come for all my words
lovingly examining the angles of my point of view
you hand me only parts
but i can see the facets of your love that you don't want me to

all of my love
swing and a miss every time that we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us
oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us

well, i'm the second one
he was first, and now i'm here without a clue of what to do
i take it personal
constantly comparing all my actions to the ones you knew

all of my love
swing and a miss every time that we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us
oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us

our love, our trust
no matter which way you cut it
there's pieces of us
our love, our trust
no matter which way you cut it
there's pieces of us

our love, our trust
no matter which way you cut it

our love, our trust
no matter which way you cut it
(there's pieces of us)
our love, our trust

all of my love
swing and a miss every time that we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us
oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
and now all i got is pieces of us

damn, we got a little bit crazy
wasn't expectin' you, baby
lock my heart, with a key
had to take some time for just me
worryin' about my safety
thinkin' about you daily
are you more than a tease?
got me swingin' from a trapeze

and not just anybody made feel like that
not just anybody sets me on fire
gotta be the one to take a risk
ain't nobody else on my list, just you
so don't go and let me down like that
i don't wanna be the one alone
i never mess around like you, my love

why must we hide?
oh, i feel it so, so deep inside
promise you're trying
and look at me in the eye

you're acting just a little bit shady
feeling cut off from you lately
oh, won't you call me back, please?
need to know you're falling as deep
please, don't leave me lonely
please, don't let me down
will i wake up alone this time?

promise me heaven
i'll wait until you lay me down

i wanna be near you
every night, i'm thinkin' 'bout you

why must we hide?
oh, i feel it so, so deep inside
promise you're trying
and look at me in the eyes

but you don't let it show
you don't say how you feel, how you feel
you don't say what you want
you don't say how you feel, it's no good
yeah, you don't let it show
you don't say how you feel, i can feel
it's real, it's not even real
you don't say what you want
you don't say how you feel, it's no good
could be good, it could be so good, yeah, yeah

why must we hide?
oh, i feel it so, so deep inside
promise you're trying
and look at me in the eye

tell me, tell me, tell me if you feel this feeling real
or i'll let you go, let you go
tell me, tell me, tell me if you feel this feeling real
and i'll let you know, i'll let you know
i don't wanna let you go, you go
'cause it's real to me

oh, keep on meditatin', activatin', anything to keep me uplifted
keep on relevatin', elevatin', anything to keep me up

heavy on down, yeah, the weight's too much
i don't wanna drown, but the waves keep on rolling
pour out what's left in a heart-shaped case
you can have it all, yeah, it's yours to break
if i don't get it right with you this time, i'm hopeless

but sometimes, you think it's been long enough
but old wounds carry, carry into brand new love
and words won't make up for the hurt i've caused
but i'll make right whatever i've done

when i'm spinning
you bring me back to earth and you fix it
when nothing's making sense and i'm dizzy
yeah, you're the only one that i want

on and on and on, feeling on and on
on and on, on and on, on and on
on and on and on, feeling on and on
on and on, on and on, on and on

driving through ghosttown
metal horses a thousand feet high
orange sky
pulling your top down
in the back of some prettyboy's ride
you get high

avenues
empty as .44 clips
cargo ships, teen zombies ghost-riding their whips
(see how they play)

you're always summer breaking
running wild in the street after dark
you're always summer breaking
hanging out with the boys in the park
summer is gone
you're gonna need someone
to break your fall

give him a haircut
in the old kitchen chair in your yard
saint delilah
he thinks you care
does he know you're too bright and too hard
like a diamond

play your game
play him the way you played me
be the girl you pretend to pretend not to be
(see how they play)

you're always summer breaking
running wild in the street after dark
you're always summer breaking
hanging out with the boys in the park
summer is gone (you're gonna need someone)
summer is gone (you're gonna need someone)
summer is gone
(you're gonna need someone)
to break your fall

baby, can't you see, i'm calling
a girl like you, should wear a warning
it's dangerous, i'm fallin'

oooh, nigga, i'm burnin' up

there's no escape, i can't wait
i need a hit, baby, give me it
you're dangerous, i'm lovin' it

enough to make a nigga, go crazy
shut down the grammy's, ask my grammy
wu-tang for the kids, but your host can't stand me
wu-tang for the kids, bust them off for family
catch me on disney (ma, who is he?)
down dirty, stinky, grime and grizzly
old man mcgirt, lookin' under your skirt
fucked the pussy til' it's orange, like ernie and bert -like, ooh

too high, can't come down
it's in my head, spinning 'round and 'round
can you feel me now?

with a taste of your lips, i'm on a ride
you're toxic, i'm slipping under
with a taste of a poison paradise
i'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
and i love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
yeah, i'm burnin' up from what you do, you know that you toxic?

like, ooh, nigga, i'm burnin' up; she said, ooh, nigga, i'm burnin' up
meth got the weed, we can burn it up; i told the d.j., nigga, turn it up
i want a girl that help me take my medication
so i don't end up at the police station
i don't wanna go back to the police station
they tried to send dirt on a long vacation

it's getting late, to give you up
i took a sip, from my devil cup
slowly, it's taking over me
too high, can't come down
it's in the air, and it's all around
can you feel me now?

stop me, oh, stop me
stop me if you think that you've
heard this one before
stop me, oh, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
i still love you, oh, i still love you
only slightly, only slightly less than i used to
my love
i was delayed, i was way-laid
an emergency stop
i saw the last ten seconds of life
i crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald, buddhist reflect
and plan a mass murder
who said i'd lied to her?
oh, who said i'd lied because i never? i never!
who said i'd lied because i never!
i was detained, i was restrained
and broke my knee
and broke my spleen
(and then he really laid into me)
friday night in out-patients
who said i'd lied to her?
oh, who said i'd lied because i never? i never!
who said i'd lied because i never!
oh, so i drank one
it became four
and when i fell on the floor ...
...i drank more
stop me, oh, stop me
stop me if you think that you've
heard this one before
stop me, oh, i said stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
i still love you, oh, i still love you
only slightly, only slightly less than i used to
my love
set free me why don't you
get out my life why don't you
cause you don't really love me, no
you just keep my hanging on
set me free why don't you girl
get out my life girl
cause you don't really love me, no, no
you just keep my hanging on

time on your side that will never end
the most beautiful thing you could ever spend
but you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
drifting apart like a plate tectonic

it don't matter to me
cause all i wanted to be
was a million miles from here
somewhere more familiar

too much time spent dragging the past up
i didn't see you not looking when i messed up
settling down in your early twenties
suck more blood than a back-street dentist

it don't matter to me
cause all i wanted to be
was a million miles from here
somewhere more familiar

and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home

great ruins make for a greater glory
the only thing growing is our history
knock me down i'll get right back up again
i come back stronger than a powered-up pac man

it don't matter to me
cause all i wanted to be
was a million miles from here
somewhere more familiar

and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home...
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from home
and oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been this far away from...
