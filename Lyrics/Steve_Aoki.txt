i had a feeling you were troubled
the night i pulled you from the rubble
when will we release this disaster piece?
from the ceiling or the gutter
get my bleeding heart aflutter
and i can't erase the sad memories

got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down
got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

tonight, why are you so broken?
wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
all about you
tonight, why are we still holding on?

it's never enough for you
it's never enough for you

heard a rumor you were leaving
the west coast tomorrow evening
wasting no time, saying your goodbyes
for the life of me, i can't find
anyone to share or kill time
i want you back, my little heart attack

i got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down
i got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

tonight, why are you so broken?
wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
all about you
tonight, why are we still holding on?

when the walls fall down and you run from the dust as it covers your lungs it’s never enough for you
when this stolen sky comes crashing down up on this waste of a life it’s never enough for you
it's never enough for you
it's never enough for you

it's never enough for
it's never enough for you
it's never enough for
it's never enough for you

i got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down
i got time on my hands
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

it's never enough for you

i got time on my hands (my hands)
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down
i got time on my hands (i  got time on my hands)
i got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

free your mind
free, free your mind
c'mon, c'mon, yeah, yeah
aoki, kells, uh!

if the leather fades and the children age
and the love we share separates
in a perfect world, do we know we're done?
but i don't wanna grow up, not for anyone
i wanna be alone with the system home
i wanna take control of, but never own
if i could free this
i said if i could free this
if i could free this fucking madness in my mind

free your mind
free, free your mind

kells
and if tomorrow i wake up and i’m sixty years old
i hope when i look in the mirror and ask "have you lived?"
i look right back and say, “shit, you tell me!”

so i smoke this herb with my homies
park the car with my homies
couldn't afford a roof over my head
but i let that bitch burn with my homies
we're living life in the moment
walk in this bitch like we own this
screaming out "fuck the world" till it's morning
and if i can free this
madness i could stop the screaming
the inside of my mind needs freedom
and it's magic on a perfect evening
all i wanna do is have a little sunlight
all i wanna do is drink a little moonshine
i can show these motherfuckers how it's done right
don't nobody out here wanna have a good time?
when the summer days turn into the past
with the runaways and forever outcasts
every age come and get into the future
'cause nowadays our youth does not last
i wish i could free this
i wish i could free this
i wish i could free the fucking madness in my mind

free your mind
free, free your mind
