saying that i hurt you but i still don't get it
you didn't love me, no, not really
wait
i could have really liked you
i'll bet, i'll bet that's why i keep on thinking 'bout you
it's a shame (shame), you said i was good
so i poured it down, so i poured it down

and now i don't understand it
you don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
and i know i shouldn't say it
but my heart don't understand

why i got you on my mind

i had a heart then
but the queen has been overthrown
and i'm not sleeping now
the dark is too hard to beat
and i'm not keeping up
the strength i need to push me

you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i'm alone
and so i tell myself that i'll be strong
and dreaming when they're gone
cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
calling, calling, calling home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i'm alone

noises, i play within my head
touch my own skin
and hope that i'm still breathing
and i think back to when
my brother and my sister slept
in an unlocked place
the only time i feel safe

i'm a pain, i'm a child, i'm afraid
but yeah, you understand

stripped to the waist we fall into the river
cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
i've been trying to hide
we held our breath to see our names are written
on the wreck of '86
that was the year i knew the panic was over

yes, since we found out
since we found out

that anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could

after the war, we said we'd fight together
i guess we thought "that's just what humans do"
letting darkness grow
as if we need its palette and we need its color

but now i've seen it through
and now i know the truth

that anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could

baby, i'll give you everything you need
i'll give you everything you need, oh
i'll give you everything you need
but i don't think i need you

stripped to the waist we fall into the river
cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
i've been trying to hide
we held our breath to see our names are written
on the wreck of '86
that was the year i knew the panic was over

yes, since we found out
since we found out

that anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could happen
anything could

i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be
i know it's going to be, oh

but i don't think i need you
but i don't think i need you
but i don't think i need you
but i don't think i need you

how long will i love you
as long as stars are above you
and longer if i can
how long will i need you
as long as the seasons need to
follow their plan

how long will i be with you
as long as the sea is bound to
wash up on the sand

how long will i want you
as long as you want me to
and longer by far
how long will i hold you
as long as your father told you
as long as you can

how long will i give to you
as long as i live through you
however long you say
how long will i love you
as long as stars are above you
and longer if i may

how long will i love you
as long as stars are above you

remember me in a simple way, not what i did or said
when i think of you now, i just think of the day we met
don't forget me, like i didn't care
yeah, i stole from myself just to make you complete

(flux, flux)
i don't think you have the patience
i don't think you know the difference
(flux, flux)
and i don't want cute imitations
i know you wanted to save me

and i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, but it's not enough
and i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, i just keep holding on

would you be taking me higher?
would we be living as liars?
i wanna know, i wanna know

when the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
all those days on the beach will be washing away from me
i will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

(flux, flux)
i should be counting my blessings
staying safe in confusion
(flux, flux)
and maybe i'm learning my lesson
i know you wanted to save me

i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, but it's not enough
and i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, i just keep holding on

would you be taking me higher?
would we be living as liars?
i wanna know, i wanna know
would we be living in camden?
getting a ticket to your band?
i wanna know, i wanna know

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh

oh, i'm still in love with the idea of loving you (oh, with the idea)
it's a state of flux (it's a state of)
but it's not enough (it's not enough)
i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, i just keep holding on
(oh, i just keep holding on)
i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, but it's not enough (oh, i'm still in love)
i'm still in love with the idea of loving you
it's a state of flux, i just keep holding on

do you remember when we moved out?
my mum said, "i love you, but it's a small house"
so we changed up and saved up
gave up our town
we were dangerous, couldn't tame us
what's missing now?

time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
suddenly, we got no time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
we're so busy doing life (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
that i miss your eyes on mine, mine

if you just focus on me
like we were sixteen
and plotting our lives
can i wear your t-shirt and sleep
on you while i dream
of all the good times?
when we were sixteen

like we were sixteen
like we were sixteen

do you remember the teacher said
"you're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head"
but years gone and we held on with the best intent
just two kids who kicked it on msn

oh, time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
suddenly, we got no time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
we're so busy doing life (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
that i miss your eyes on mine, mine

oh, if you just focus on me
like we were sixteen
and plotting our lives (when we were plotting our lives)
can i wear your t-shirt and sleep (oh)
on you while i dream (oh)
of all the good times?
when we were sixteen

like we were sixteen
oh, oh
like we were sixteen

let's take the love that we found
and give it back to ourselves
sometimes, these things don't work out
sometimes, there'll be no one else
they said we'd never even make it this far
but here we are
and we're still counting stars
like we were sixteen

oh, when we were sixteen
oh, oh
we're still counting stars like we were sixteen
we're still counting stars like we were sixteen

that feeling that doesn't go away just did
and i walked a thousand miles to prove it
and i'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
the color of my blood is all i see on the rocks
as you sail from me

alarms will ring for eternity
the waves will break every chain on me
my bones will bleach
my flesh will flee
so help my lifeless frame to breathe

and god knows, i'm not dying but i breathe now
and god knows, it's the only way to heal now
with all the blood i lost with you
it drowns the love i thought i knew

the lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
and this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
and i'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
and my blood is all i see
as you steal my soul from me

alarms will ring for eternity
the waves will break every chain on me

and god knows, i'm not dying but i bleed now
and god knows, it's the only way to heal now
with all the blood i lost with you
it drowns the love i thought i knew


and god knows, i'm not dying but i bleed now
and god knows, it's the only way to heal now
with all the blood i lost with you
it drowns the love i thought i knew
and god knows, i'm not dying but i bleed now
and god knows, it's the only way to heal now
with all the blood i lost with you
(i lost with you, i lost with you)
it drowns the love i thought i knew
(i thought i knew, i thought i)

it's the strangest feeling
feeling this way for you
there's something in the way you move
something in the way you move
with you i’m never healing
it’s heartache through and through
there's something in the way you move
i don’t know what it is you do
not one bone in your body good enough for me
but this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
when our eyes meet, i can only see the end
but tonight i'm here, yours again

but tonight i'm gonna lose it all
playing with fire, i was the first to fall
heart is sinking like a cannonball
baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

something in the way you move
there's something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh
there's something in the way you move
something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

there's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight, (night)
there's something in the way you do
there's something in the way you
push me closer, further
break me just enough
your lies always seem so true
there's nothing  left for me to lose
there's not one thing i can do to change your ways
but i can't sit back and take the lonely days
when our eyes meet, i can only see the end
and tonight the rain pours again

but tonight i'm gonna lose it all
playing with fire, i was the first to fall
heart is sinking like a cannonball
baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

something in the way you move
there's something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh
there's something in the way you move
something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

but tonight i'm gonna lose it all
playing with fire, i was the first to fall
heart is sinking like a cannonball
baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

something in the way you move
there's something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh
there's something in the way you move
something in the way you do it
something in the way you move
oh

help me, my god, this got messy
least i got the best seat
'cause we put on one hell of a show
waiting, i just keep on waiting
for the final curtain
'cause i just can't let go of your love

ooh
you say my name like you know my dark side, ooh
can't beat the taste of the tears that i'll cry, ooh

slow grenade is blowing up
my mistakes, so why don't i
why don't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must want it
that's why i'm not running from it
can't escape this blowing up
in my face, so why can't i
why can't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must love it
that's why i'm not running from it

crazy, late nights in the city
drink until you hate me
then say that i should just let you go (just let you go)
but hold on, why do we still hold on?
think that we should move on
but we're too scared of being alone (being alone)

ooh
you say my name like you know my dark side, ooh (oh)
can't beat the taste of the tears that i'll cry, ooh

slow grenade is blowing up
my mistakes, so why don't i
why don't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must want it
that's why i'm not running from it
can't escape this blowing up
in my face, so why can't i
why can't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must love it
that's why i'm not running from it

ah-ooh, ah-ooh
why can't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must love it
that's why i'm not running from it

help me, my god, this got messy
least i got the best seat
'cause we put on one hell of a show
woah, yeah

oh, slow grenade is blowing up
my mistakes, so why don't i
why don't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must want it
that's why i'm not running from it
can't escape this blowing up (ooh)
in my face, so why can't i
why can't i stop it? (hey)
still got time for me to stop it (hey)
it's like a part of me must love it
that's why i'm not running from it (oh)

ah-ooh, ah-ooh (oh)
why can't i stop it?
still got time for me to stop it
it's like a part of me must love it
that's why i'm not running from it

you know we can get away
because i'm calling your name
every day i feel this pain
but you just turn and walk away

no, i just can't keep hanging on
to you and me
i just don't know what is wrong
with you and me

touch me and then turn away
and put your hands into the flame
tell me if you feel this pain
cause i don't wanna be a ball and chain

no, i just can't keep hanging on
to you and...
i just don't know what is wrong

yeah, give me that respect, forgive me and forget
you've got to get a grip, living on the edge
i barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
and if there is too much on my plate then i ain't finishing my veg
and if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
you got me wrapped up in your shit, i'm feeling mummified
i've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
you gave me what i needed and i gave her everything she wanted
there's something 'bout your cleavage, now i can't put my fingers on it
been taking me the deepest, i thought that she was gonna vomit
if all women are from venus then i guess i really got a rocket
you've got a noose around my neck but i'm still hanging on
we've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
i spat a verse, she sang a song
she broke my heart, i took some gaviscon

i just can't keep hanging on
to you and me
with you and me
with you and

eyes make their peace in difficulties
with wounded lips and salted cheeks
and finally, we step to leave
to the departure lounge of disbelief

and i don't know where i'm going
but i know it's gonna be a long time
and i'll be leaving in the morning
come the white wine, bitter sunlight

wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time
before daylight

and the canyon underneath the trees
behind the dark sky, you looked at me
i fell for you, like autumn leaves
never faded, evergreen

and i don't know where i'm going
but i know it's gonna be a long time
cause i'll be leaving in the morning
come the white wine, bitter sunlight

wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time

i can't face this, now everything has changed
i just wanna be by your side
here's hoping we collide
here's hoping we collide
here's hoping we collide

wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time

wanna hear your beating heart, tonight

starry, starry night
paint your palette blue and grey
look out on a summer's day
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
shadows on the hills
sketch the trees and the daffodils
catch the breeze and the winter chills
in colors on the snowy linen land

now i understand
what you tried to say to me
and how you suffered for your sanity
how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they did not know how
perhaps they'll listen now

starry, starry night
flaming flowers that brightly blaze
swirling clouds in a violet haze
reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue
colors changing hue
morning fields of amber grain
weathered faces lined in pain
are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

now i understand
what you tried to say to me
and how you suffered for your sanity
and how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they did not know how
perhaps they'll listen now

for they could not love you
but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in sight
on that starry, starry night
you took your life, as lovers often do
but i could've told you, vincent
this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

starry, starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frameless heads on nameless walls
with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
like the strangers that you've met
the ragged men in their ragged clothes
the silver thorn of bloody rose
lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

now i think i know
what you tried to say to me
and how you suffered for your sanity
and how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they're not listening still
perhaps they never will

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
take it all away

breathe your smoke into my lungs
in the back of the car with you i stare into the sun
still not too old to die young
but lovers hold on to everything
and lovers hold on to anything

i chase your love around a figure 8
i need you more than i can take
you promise forever and a day
and then you take it all away (-way, -way)
and then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)

place a kiss on my cheekbone
then you vanish me, i'm buried in the snow
but something tells me i'm not alone
but lovers hold on to everything
and lovers hold on to anything

i chase your love around a figure 8
i need you more than i can take
you promise forever and a day
and then you take it all away (-way, -way)
and then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)

so lovers hold on to everything
and lovers hold on to anything
so lovers hold on to everything
and lovers hold on to anything

i chase your love around a figure 8
i need you more than i can take
you promise forever and a day
and then you take it all away
i chase your love around a figure 8
i need you more than i can take
you promise forever and a day
and then you take it all away (-way, -way -way, -way, -way, -way)
and then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)

you trembled like you'd seen a ghost
and i gave in
i lacked the things you need the most
you said, "where have you been?"
you wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
i wonder why
i remind you of the days you poured your heart into
but you never tried
i've fallen from grace
took a blow to my face
i've loved and i've lost
i've loved and i've lost

explosions on the day you wake up
needing somebody and you've learned
it's okay to be afraid
but it will never be the same
it will never be the same

you left my soul bleeding in the dark
so you could be king, ah
the rules you set are still untold to me
and i've lost my faith in everything
the nights you could cope
your intentions were gold
but the mountains will shake
i need to know i can still make

explosions on the day you wake up
needing somebody and you've learned
it's okay to be afraid
but it will never be the same

and as the floods move in
and your body starts to sink
i was the last thing on your mind
i know you better than you think
because it's simple, darling, i gave you a warning
now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
so watch them fall with you, in slow motion
i pray that you will find peace of mind
and i'll find you another time
i'll love you, another time

explosions on the day you wake up
needing somebody and you've learned
it's okay to be afraid
but it will never be the same
it will never be the same

you're the light, you're the night
you're the colour of my blood
you're the cure, you're the pain
you're the only thing i wanna touch
never knew that it could mean so much, so much
you're the fear, i don't care
‘cause i've never been so high
follow me through the dark
let me take you past the satellites
you can see the world you brought to life, to life

so love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
what are you waiting for?

fading in, fading out, on the edge of paradise
every inch of your skin is a holy grail i've got to find
only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah
i'll let you set the pace
‘cause i'm not thinking straight
my head's spinning around, i can't see clear no more
what are you waiting for?

love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
what are you waiting for?

i'm alive
i know my heart is beating, but my head's in the sky
i found a different meaning since you came in my life
now all of time is standing still, shining so bright
deer in headlights
i know i did wrong
i used to think that i was so invincible
i tore myself to pieces, had to put on a show
you put me back together
and it feels like home, it feels like home

and i'm trying to make the most of my mistakes
if you were me, i know you'd do the same thing
but some things in my past i cannot change
but i can change

and maybe i'm paying for the things i've done
and maybe i'm paying for the ones i've hurt
but i feel a change in the love i'm given
i'm turning the page on my indecision
and maybe you'll stay if i overcome
the highs and the lows and the rising sun
but i feel a change in the love i'm given
i'm turning the page now, am i forgiven?

i'm still on fire
from all the times i tried to climb higher and higher
but you put me in the water now, i drown in desire
for all the things you make me feel
you make me feel better, you make me feel better

and i'm trying to make the most of my mistakes
if you were me, i know you'd do the same thing
but some things in my past i cannot change
but i can change

and maybe i'm paying for the things i've done
and maybe i'm paying for the ones i've hurt
but i feel a change in the love i'm given
i'm turning the page on my indecision
and maybe you'll stay if i overcome
the highs and the lows and the rising sun
but i feel a change in the love i'm given
i'm turning the page now, am i forgiven?

yeah, i've been changing the love i'm given (change)
yeah, i've been changing the love i'm given (change)
yeah, i've been changing the love i'm given (change)
yeah, i've been changing the love i'm given (change)

and maybe i'm paying for the things i've done

and maybe i'll stay if i overcome (oh, the love i'm given)
the highs and the lows and the rising sun (oh, the love i'm given)
but i feel a change in the love i'm given (oh, the love i)
oh, the love, the love i'm given

yeah, i feel a change in the love i'm given (change)
