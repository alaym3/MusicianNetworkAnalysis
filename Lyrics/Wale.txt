monogamy or whatever you call it
i'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
most of us is rushin' into it anyways
you know what i'm sayin'?
you ain't rushin' for love, and i ain't up here to judge
let's neglect the what if's
and make it do what it does, let's get it

is it bad that i never made love?
no, i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl, i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit, no, not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
yeah, i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
bad that i never made love
no, i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
(let's get it!)

bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
and the hood girls want a smart nigga
college girls all want a thug
so it seems that we fiend what we don't need
got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
i ain't 'bout to judge you, don't judge me
you ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'cause i heard you (bad, nooo)
in the literal sense i mean that
rough sex, sayin' i love ya
but to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
i know, i just be callin' her mean-ass
oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
but the problem is probably a deep past
still i'm feelin' of somethin' i need bad
thinkin' if i get her, i get her to need this
i don't need emotions to open your deep sea
i conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
beg? nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
slow motion around, put it down
lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

is it bad that i never made love?
no, i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl, i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit, no, not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
yeah, i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
(yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

she hurt feelings, she break hearts
she stay quiet, she play smart
she take pride in goin' out
and gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
she no saint, but she don't pose
she don't wear make-up by the boatload
ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
she don't really date much, but it slows her up
she got haters, but we all do
heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
baby, look at they approach, how they court you
all those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(bad, nooo) in the physical sense i mean that
i ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
i ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
play big, trust me i'll humble yo' mean-ass
look, shawty is actually in prevent
'cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
yep—bed, floor, couch, more
more, shower, lord, perm, done
love? nah, called in the morn'
cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

is it bad that i never made love?
no, i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl, i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit, no, not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
yeah, i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
bad that i never made love
no, i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck

let me rap to you real quick
i wanna enjoy the luxury of like
not knowing each other for real, hold up
lotus flower bomb, firefly
when i'm low, she take me high
i can teach you all the sounds of love

flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
and you got that bomb, huh, i'm tryna detonate you
no disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
try to keep my spirits up, that's why i lays it down
try to keep your spirits up, lil' vodka, whatever
took you forever to get dressed, i acknowledge your effort
so i clap for her, she deserves an applause
shawty working so hard, she deserve that vuitton
shawty, where your baton? racing through my mind like
she heard that i got that work, i heard that she been on strike
care to tell? i read your mind, she been on them dollars first
caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
i can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
i'm just tryna work that, huh, they just tryna work your nerves
i'm just tryna read your mind, i'm just tryna feed you mine
i'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

we're living in a fantasy
i feel it when you dance with me
it's feeling like you need to be
my lady, my baby, yeah
can't you see
i'm talking about eternity?
tell me, would you care to be
my lady, my baby?

flower bomb, can i blow up on your mind?
this is not no sandra bull', but you're potion #9
navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
and i hate to tell you too much 'cause i stay with too much pride
and we way too young to know love, maybe not, but we don't need no rush
don't believe in love at first sight, but i believe in love at first, huh
can i be with you just one night? i could wear you out inside
i could tell you like persistence, but i make you cum in tris
i just think we need one night, can't decide if i came right
easy, baby, my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
i ain't thinking, i ain't right, can't decide, but i can't fight
easy, baby, you the bomb and all but i be damned if i do not land mine
or at least try, can i speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
can we take shots? what's your flavor? flat drinks we call a cups
i just think i need one night, slightly more if it's done right
with that gorgeous face, i don't know your name
it ain't important babe 'cause i'ma call you mine

we're living in a fantasy (haha, ralph)
i feel it when you dance with me
it's feeling like you need to be
my lady, my baby, yeah
can't you see
i'm talking about eternity?
tell me, would you care to be
my lady, my baby?

'cause i don't know you, you don't know me
the clock keeps ticking, baby, what's it gon' be?
i don't know you, you don't know me
let me teach you all the sounds of love
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
ee-ee-ee-ee-ee, i, o, u
baby, this was for you (for you)
lotus

seinfield: getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
and you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, "what, what's going on here," you know?
"boy this thing is really, really goes high!"
wale: i'm looking down, 'oh shit!'
seinfield: and then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. you go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
wale: even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
seinfield: no it's uh, it's like any growth. you're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. it's gonna be new. you're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
this is forever
i gotchu

if there's a question of my heart, you've got it
it don't belong to anyone but you
if there's a question of my love, you've got it
baby, don't worry, i've got plans for you
baby, i've been making plans, oh love
baby, i've been making plans for you
baby, i've been making plans
baby, i've been making plans for you

(my sincerest apologies, i mean it)
look, i'll admit it, albeit pathetic
that i'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
it’s not your fault they try get me cause i'ma need the sales
cause i'm selfish, and i need you to myself
tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
cause i failed and see you 'bout to cry
cause when i enter they city they leave without they pride
i'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
wrong, how dare i say ignore them?
preparing for that day i leave you here and switch you for them
it's hard, you know temptation and all
bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - i'm wrong

but i'm promisin' you better though
and your friends sayin', "let him go"
and we ain't gettin' any younger
i can give up now, but i can promise you forever though

if there's a question of my heart, you've got it
it don't belong to anyone but you
if there's a question of my love, you've got it
baby, don't worry, i've got plans for you
baby, i've been making plans, oh love
baby, i've been making plans for you
baby, i've been making plans
baby, i've been making plans for you

(realest shit i ever wrote, realest shit i ever wrote
realest shit i ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
i’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
the day i find a woman i prolly be scared to share it
the idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
and true my wall could use some plaques, but still i gotta floss
brush you off, see i'm kinda lost
now i'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
and dark, good nigga, troubled heart
went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
this is hard, tryna find some time to move on
cause when we lost our baby, i got shady, shit got too dark
soft, and i thank you baby, you strong
my ex before you married too, you solo, i say so long
nah, good terms how that ended
but it surely put a dent on how i worry about this business
off white picket fences, on flights with the children
on site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

but i plan to do it better though
but you still sayin' let it go
we ain't gettin' any younger
women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

if there's a question of my heart, you've got it
it don't belong to anyone but you
if there's a question of my love, you've got it
baby, don't worry, i've got plans for you
baby, i've been making plans, oh baby
i've been making plans, oh love
baby, i've been making plans for you
baby, i've been making plans
baby, i've been making plans for you

we ain't nothin' but some planets
seinfield: i always feel like i’m a planet. and these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. and, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. and you can only do it when one planet passes real close. and you look and you go, “hey, i think i can jump across.”

the time is now, on everything
took my heart away from money
i ain't interested in fame
and i pray that never change
ambition is priceless
it’s something that’s in your veins
and i put that on my name

uh, only hope i had was selling dope
was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
my momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
i grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
oh, i was raised by the stop sign
no religion i was getting saved by the glock nine
by the minute i was getting paid like a hot line
servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
well connected, well respected and well protected
ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
ain't get my message, was no signal when i was texting
the niggas i was calling was fraud and i learned my lesson
now i move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
so throw that pass, i’ll be the cornerback
me and folarin mmg gon' bring that warner back

for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
look, they gon' love me for my ambition
beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

it speaks for itself
define ambition for me

my ambition to win, just to get me some ends
help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a benz
i saw momma praying as she wait on results
it was hot in the kitchen can i wait on the porch
my father was missing, war lord oliver north
life was diggin’ me deeper, i kept on coming up short
breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
not too many options when you coming from the projects
sittin’ in the trap now you moving cyndi lauper
girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
and i doubt that ever change
ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
and i doubt that ever change
ambition is my shit and i put that on my name
and i doubt that ever change

for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
look, they gon' love me for my ambition
beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

well wishes to my opposition
you niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
i got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
but every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
and i ain't spend a minute up in the streets
but i’m limitless mentally, i’m lyrically zmt
lebron shit, i was in that 6 after 23
and family is everything, and money is less important
long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
i got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
but i got that green on my eyes
and that ain’t no donnie simpson
i retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
they placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
you know you real you don’t say it
you know you real, we gon feel it
ralph!

beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
they gon love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
look, they gon love me for my ambition
beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
they gon love me for my ambition

yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
son of a mother studying at udc
sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
on everything i wear it, all the america's tees
this whole system most prolific in the dmv
listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don’t get the beef
make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
you gon' need more than wikipedia to get to me
pg to mo county bet they all know about me
every hood, every 'burb, i got superb balance
from the city that made me love you forever for it
hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
you made me what i am, you made me what i'm not
they gon' love you a little different when you at the top

give me love, baby

yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold
as you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
having dinner with leonsis i'm dreaming to own
but for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
i'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
women in town, but i'm manifestating every goal
i see potential in john, talk to him once a week
media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
i lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
when i was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
lord father if i opted to follow them
my heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
and it's rare when i'm anywhere with too many heads
niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
how could you blame us envy?
we do the same thing for a living
know the same niggas, but they all commend me
champagne i'ma spill it until we all fill up
maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
and probably not, but i'm temporarily out of fizzucks
so tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

(keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go

i guess maybe some little problems could arise
(there are always a few)
if anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(devastating)
because this is very good
(and that would be good)
that would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

tryna keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
tell everybody that we're just friends
but to be honest that platonic shit's for tv shows
same place, we're with different folks
case closed if they crack the code
is it me, or is you cold?
cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
go put a sweater on or get a room
forbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice
lot of ways i can get to you
but my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

still we keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
could somebody tell somebody
i'm somebody and i'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
work

i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time, we can hook up
we can hang out, we can just chill

tryna keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
tell 'em all that we're just cool
as far as me and you, we got a simple code
spendin' nights, well that's optional
no telephones in the afternoon
i know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
every time your ass in the mood
sharin' thoughts when we share a room
though we barely talk when we share a room
in the dark, still see your curves
body like what, swear to god you're a miracle

still we keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
could somebody tell somebody
i'm somebody and i'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go

i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time, we can hook up
we can hang out, we can just chill

i mean let's say, what if we did?
(what if?)
is that like the end of the world or something?
(certainly not!)
why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
(i know!)
i mean really, what is the big deal? we go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. it's not complicated
(it's almost stupid if we didn't!)
it's moronic
(absurd!)

i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time, we can hook up
we can hang out, we can just chill

baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again

shawty, can i fill your tank, yeah?
i start off with that, "what you drinkin'?"
pardon if i'm road raging
but i know you heard my drive is crazy
yeah, let me pace that with some patience
let me do it till i fill every void
you're like a maybach, thinking damn
they ain't even make 'em like you no more
it's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
i adore you up, baby suicide
a little wordplay, i'm hoping i can make you smile
least until i'm out of line like a dui
girl, you remind me of my jeep
can i see what's up with that g-wagon?
can i take you off of these streets?
to the side of me, i'm trying to see your hazards
trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
gotta make it last, i hope you comfortable
i need to get to you, you're like a '62
a little work then it's curtains when i'm skrrting through
came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
that mean i gots a few, but i believe in you
trying to chase the cat, know i'm killing it, dawg
you ain't feeling me naw, that mean i don't need the roof

you remind me of my jeep, i wanna ride it
you something like my car
i got the keys to them, i need the keys to you

you put on a show, you don't need no clothes
give me little bit more, always take it slow
i know you don't wanna stop, i'm trying to make it go
now speed it up like a maserati, and look at me and pose

baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again

a good woman is scarce to us
and i wasn't prepared to love
i know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me
i'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
a good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
you heard it all, but hear this love
one night with dude, i be the reason you cool
so let me know am i clear enough, yeah, what's up?
way i, way i, that's the way i think
shawty straight like a concept on bayonne street
in the morning i slide over, she needs a ride i'm like
"tight, let's keep it amg"
sliding down, precipitating is straight
top down, let me kiss your physique
i'm digging your fleek, i'm checkin' your gear
can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
she like when i drive it, i like it in park
pull that thing over you likely to sore
i got her floating like riding on stars
so i keep it gps, see where this going
nothing will stop it, i slide in no prob
ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
so know when i'm not here the viper is on

you put on a show, you don't need no clothes
give me little bit more, always take it slow
i know you don't wanna stop, i'm trying to make it go
now speed it up like a maserati, and look at me and pose

baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
baby, you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again

i thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing
i think it's only right, hoarse and everything
like fuck it though, what's up

pessimism is all that she know
cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
i been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach
told her, "give me your heart; try to get you the globe"
have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it
every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
we go together / break up
we go together / break up
ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up
when we good, we good shawty
we don't ever make love
but if i call you out your name, i bet your ready to "uh!"
you say you ready, you ain't ready enough
cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up
this is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
she the shit, she the one
she got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done
this is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
she the shit, she the one
she got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done

cause i, am feeling this deep down in my heart
i'm feeling like i never want to be apart
but just when it gets good, she's gone
and i'm left right back at start..

my girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
she can only take so much more than her heart got
she can only live for the moment

hey! happy festivus everyone!

i promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch

we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light
we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light
we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light
we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light

man they really ain't serious
do you know what type of women i've been dealing with?
i used to pop blues with my lil' chick
i call her boo cuz her real one i will forget
i use a uber to scoop me to sls
what you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?
oh no, no these women ain't serious
do you know what type of women i've been dealing with?
try to tell me adderall make her get a rush
used to use it to study until she fell in love
told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
told her "nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough"
nah nah nah
these women ain't serious
she sprinkled a little something up in her liq
start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched
kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip
i'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
but for now, they're wild
they rather get it in

girls on drugs
girls on drugs
girls on drugs
pills and subs when them beers ain't enough
they still need love

we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light
we go deep and we don't get no sleep
cause we be up all night until the early light

in her purse where her hand go
she disperse by the handful
coco make her go up
nothing popping, pop a xan' when she laying low
bars to break, so many bars to break
she at the grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake
she like "oh my god, i'm on the moon and i'm lit"
and my particular moon like a platoon and shit
you know the hitters that i'm dealing with
politicians and niggas living it on the rip
and my position to give my lyrics to little kids
is not official unless i'm giving them authentic
we're all living with small demons
we're all sinning, it's all similar
broads with us and they bong hitting
let me tell you about the women i be chilling with
the really insecure ones look good in here
nothing fill the void of a little pill
a little shot, she ain't shy when the liq spill
and it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
beside that the lime light be so real
let me tell you about the women i be chilling with
told me nobody love her, that's why she cut her wrist
not enough for the hospital but cut it close
that's why she want to get high cuz she be feeling low
told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke
so i could numb her insides and we will never know

girls on drugs
girls on drugs
girls on drugs
pills and subs when them beers ain't enough
they still need love

and if loving her is wrong then i just know i won't see heaven
she say she from seattle, she 20 and some change
before i get to t.i.a, i'm sure to make her rain
then i'm back up on my plane, chi-town o'hare
we spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from harold's
i told her this here's overrated, but i love your city baby
gotta get back to the d, you know we finally famous

tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
wale, oww!

i apologize, i don’t recollect your name

our faucets used to drip, i used to ride the bench
but it was written in cursive for this king to exist
packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
marc jacob the makeup, she givenchy consumer
gianni versaci connoisseur, a carnivore
accountable for a half a million uncounted for, boy
hahahah (m-m-maybach music)

but i'm giving it foundation when i write lyric
that anvil neidhart minus bright knickers
maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
when bret hart meet brett farve
a sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four

intro
yeah, see, breaking up is hard
to move along, it's even harder
it's over, she got colder, now
can't locate where her heart is
and i'm just being honest
since we not even talking
my mind won't let you go
shit, even consider stalking now
you know i be teasing, though
you know that my ego won't
thought this was forever love
guess that was just seasonal
she got back with her old boy
she probably had a reason though
although thought that we would grow
guess that wasn't feasible
but we ain't gonna be beefing, no
i miss you at my recent show
i speak to cj often and sometimes
i just want to speak you up
yeah, hit you up
or call you up, or send a text
your new man got my respect
so if i do call it's just a check
heard that you alright though
my nigga for life though
it's funny how this life go
we love for a while then a light goes
took me a while just to write those
pride, i had a fight so
i'mma stop right there and i know you don't care
but i hope you got that bite, boo, ay

yeah, tell me about the love of ours
"contemplate", i wrote about her
we no longer close or nothing
that's why she ignore my flowers
and my call and my text
spending her time with him i guess
i regret some shit i did
but darling, is y'all intimate?
who was better? i know i was
don't you lie, don't blow my buzz
you ask me who i'm stroking now
i say that the pool is closed
can we stay broken up?
and all these pages, close them up
i hope we both do learn from this
so my next joint don't got to be so rough
huh, got to get better with time
relationships should never rewind
better leave it all behind
guess that means you can never be mine
well, um, there's a but
without your love it's cold as fuck
life is a movie we both say "cut"
but most times darling the sequel sucks

ambitious girl, your drive, drives me crazy
i'm tryna stay with you, lay with you
i'll pay your tuition, and pray with you if you ain't in to wishin
i'm tryna fuck the shit out your aspirations
see, the last one i dated, i hated
we wake up, i go to work, she leave out
come back with some make up, high heels, and a purse, or
worse i ask, "babygirl, what you aspire to be?"
she reply to me like, "why you perspiring me?" bitch..
pardon me if i'm sweating you but
i wanna see something else in you before i invest in you
ambitious girl, (what its hittin for?)
i'd rather you tell me to hit you later
because you gotta finish a paper
than to be in my face asking for a rose cup
see these bitches can't cut in yo business
i'm in love with your business
and your productivity is the reason i interest, ambitious girl
see, i like the person that you are
but i'm in love with the person that you have potential to be
and all your dreams sharing with me
and your secrets baring with me
and the flaws, you ain't even got to mention to me
ambitious girl, you just wanna win, and you'd rather chase your dreams
then to try to chase these men
that try to chase these skirts
that try to chase these shots with flavors that ain't even as sweet as her
my ambitious girl, i won't forget you
i just reflect on how i ain't met you, yet boo
you somewhere, getting your life in order
so for this time being, i hope this open scribe might support her
support her, or work her, she worth it

huh, rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
damn, check
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
all my little homies up in prison
i'ma let you know just how i'm livin'

i can tell you 'bout the mach five
i can show you what them blocks buy
i can tell you 'bout my block ties
i can take you to the far side
poor decision makin' plaguing niggas' lives
you sellin' crack up on your momma porch
while she still goin' through her new divorce
he has a thrill as he raise his voice
when he really needs to raise his boys
young thugs with so much talent
young thugs havin' no balance
young niggas havin' no fathers
young niggas catchin' dope charges
growin' up she say she felt alone
now she strippin' for that pot of gold
another fish in the bowl
they say her mother never played her role
i heard her mother always on the roll
her mother always wearin' gold
where i'm from, i guess that's how it goes

rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions, damn
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
all my little homies up in prison
lupe, gotta tell 'em how you livin'

the beloved t-rex says
"grown man bars is somethin' you gotta deal with"
whole hand cards but nothin' that you can build with
that sound like bullshit from out a bull mouth
even the tepee is a full house
simple shelter keep you out the cold
if we hold it close together, we'll never fold
why you lettin' the devil beat you out your soul?
if you don't believe in god then at least believe in odds
this house of our is just a house of cards
just without the yards, and nice adjacent parks
we was born black, but that shit'll make you dark
even with a handful of hearts
mind on the club just to find a little love, my regards
cause when your p-o-v is poverty
it's like d-o-c a lottery, that d-o-c be lock and key
finna d-o-p-e, bob and weave and that boxer boxin' free
up out them rings like it was rocky iii, caught up in the game now
look at how we came out like olly olly oxen free
golly, why they watchin' me?
yeah, yeah, poor decider since like four, five or
sugar-coated colored edibles
instead of buildin' up a habit in them vegetables
now early 30s, my blood pressure's incredible
medical, yeah nigga, i'm tellin' you
coveting cars over community
rappers influence your shootin' sprees
turn around and publish bars like it ain't got shit to do with me
easy to record so ruthlessly, rich niggas

rich niggas makin' poor decisions (yeah)
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions

yeah, uh, can't tell you 'bout that h dude
but i'll tell you 'bout this hate dude
and i'll show you where they raise a tool
it'll have a nigga late for the labels or the latest shoes
i'm from an era where gold trinkets could buy attention
and the hoes thinking might blow your winky for a known emblem
label whores who fuck a sale and suck a store
lust apparel who dream of rolls but can't accord
or afford a dodge or a ford
where she end up on your knob cause she has never been adored
lord help us, my generation come to an end
cause we all selfish but livin' shallow, how we gon' swim?
i mean really, why should i pretend?
walk a day up in my tennis, my soul is possessed
i'm reppin' my set, no matter who posin' against
once i got hot, they only good option to vent
ralph, genius

rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions
rich niggas makin' poor decisions, damn

ay ricky, i'ma flip the mission
how 'bout poor niggas makin' rich decisions?
yeah, poor niggas makin' rich decisions
that shit right there is more efficient
i think that might be a better description
poor niggas makin' rich decisions
can't afford 'em but you still gon' get 'em
that's a poor nigga making rich decisions
buyin' jewelry but you know your vision
yeah, on a mission, hah
maybe part two, yeah!
