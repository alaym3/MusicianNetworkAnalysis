speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. this note should be pretty easy to understand
all the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. i haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. i feel guilty beyond words about these things
for example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for freddie mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something i totally admire and envy. the fact is, i can't fool you, any one of you. it simply isn't fair to you or me. the worst crime i can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if i'm having 100% fun. sometimes i feel as if i should have a punch-in time clock before i walk out on stage. i've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and i do, god, believe me i do, but it's not enough). i appreciate the fact that i and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. i must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. i'm too sensitive. i need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms i once had as a child
on our last 3 tours, i've had a much better appreciation for all the people i've known personally, and as fans of our music, but i still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy i have for everyone. there's good in all of us and i think i simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. the sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, pisces, jesus man. why don't you just enjoy it? i don't know!
i have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what i used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. and that terrifies me to the point to where i can barely function. i can't stand the thought of frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that i've become
i have it good, very good, and i'm grateful, but since the age of seven, i've become hateful towards all humans in general. only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. only because i love and feel sorry for people too much i guess
thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. i'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! i don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away
peace, love, empathy
kurt cobain
frances and courtney, i'll be at your altar
please keep going courtney, for frances
for her life, which will be so much happier without me
i love you, i love you

she gives me everything
and tenderly
the kiss my lover brings
she brings to me
and i love her

bright are the stars that shine
dark is the sky
i know this love of mine
will never die
and i love her

a love like ours
will never die
as long as i
hold you near me

bright are the stars that shine
dark is the sky
i know this love of mine
will never die
and i love her

she says i’m beans, and i’ve been lost
and i don’t mean, the poison’s gone
and i feel drained, the side that you know
will die within me, and i’ll be yours

and i know you hope i’m in denial of love
and i know you’ll only ever see me in this cell
hiding and taken to the back of her reason
if i only knew you wouldn't dance, for my money
only this i know
time i’ve seen alone

and find the things that says i’m gone
inside i breathe and thrive alone
she said don’t be, excitable
the night is deep, i died alone
she’s had a dream, wish i hadn’t gone
inside i weep, inside i’m gone
she’s saving pain and hiding hope
inside of me-e, i’ve been grown

burn the nothing
from the night away
fear in the million
from the love of her
burn the nothing
from the night away
burn the writing
friends and i away
*phone ringing*

hello?
no, she is not
she went to work
alright

and if you say your prayers
you will make god happy
and if you do what's told
you will make me happy
i'll keep you in a jar
and you will seem happy
i'll give you breather holes
you will think you're happy now

you're in a laundry room
you're in a laundry room
you're in a laundry room

and if you save yourself
you will make them happy
they'll bring you fine rewards
then you will feel happy
i'll keep you in my room
i'm sure you'll be happy
and if you save one soul
you will think you're happy now

you're in a laundry room
you're in a laundry room
you're in a laundry room
you're in a laundry room

she only lies
just to save my feelings
i cry, in spite
just to make a feeling
i hold inside
guilt, that isn't reeling
fried the lie
just to burn my eyes


ohhh
ohh

she only lies
just to save my feelings
i only cry
just to make her feel guilty
i cry, in spite
just to save my reasons
i know it's right
'cause i want her to die
i don't love her
no, i really hate her
and i know that you will hate her too
if you are given half a chance at all

hey...
one less side of me
wonder how i breathe
i know that i need

here i come
watch me someday
and i'll know, the day before
and i, better say it
and i know, watch it before it dies
like i, always say your lies
and i know that i need to grow
what are you waiting
to tell me
get on a rail
one more other day
what am i doing here?
what may i've ever...?

it's a cause for my seed
it's such a (?) before it falls
if so, it's from my breathe
and i got my (?) in my way
and i, (?) from my breeze
and i got to find this before it blows

what more can i say?
never said my name
never met my enemy
never said i'm...
never said my name
never met my-

in a community that stresses macho male sexual stories as a highlight of all conversation
i was an under-developed immature fat little dude that never got laid and was constantly razzed
"oh, poor little kid!"
it bothered me probably more so because i was horny and frequently had to make up stories like
"uh, when i went on vacation i met this chick and we fucked and she loved it!"
etcetera, etcetera...
this tipical pubescent problem was in effect during the height of my problems with my father and stepmom
you know, the tipical wicked-stepmom story
and so, i moved to both grandparents' and four sets of aunts' and uncles'
and so forth and so on within the year
and in eighth grade, my mom had no choice to take me in because my dad packed my stuff
and drove me to her house in the morning and left me there
she was pissed
i accumulated quite a healthy complex, not to mention the complexion
then one day i discovered the most ultimate form of expression ever
marijuana
oh boy, pot!
i could escape all day long and not have the routine nervous breakdowns once a week
only being stoned for the first few times was what i claimed as something i would do for the rest of my life
and i would practically do anything to ensure my supply of the fantastic weed
trevor was a guy i hated, but resorted to becoming friends with
because he was the only person i could get pot from
he was the kingpin
trevor, ace, john and derren
all white-trash, lowlife scums of the earth according to the jocks, had been going to this girl's house after school, and they invited me
we got to the door and a very fat girl let us in
it wasn't obvious to me for over an hour that this girl seemed kind of quiet
until one of the guys pointed out that she was in a special ed class
i'm sure a lot of kids would call her a retard and some just slow
and at the time, and still to this day, i would call her quiet and illiterate but not retarded
the object of the guys who had be going there for the past month was to steal booze from the downstairs basement den of her house
while others distracted her by opening covers and doors and pretending to eat all the food
one would go down and take a fifth and then exit out the downstairs
so we'd do this routine every otherday and got away with it for, oh, about a month
and during that month it happened to be the epitome of my mental abuse from my mother
it turned out that pot didn't help me escape my troubles too well anymore
and i was actually enjoying doing rebellious things like stealing booze and busting store windows and-
and nothing ever mattered
i decided within the next month, i'll not sit on my roof and think about jumping
but i'll actually kill myself
and i wasn't going out from this world without actually knowing what it was like to get laid
so one day after school i went to the girl's house alone
and invited myself in and she offered me some twinkies
and i sat on her lap and i said
"let's fuck"
and i touched her tits and she went into her bedroom and got undressed in front of me
and i watched and realised that it was actually happening
so i tried to fuck her but i didn't know how
and i asked her if she had ever done this before
and she said "a lot of times", mainly with her cousin
i got grossed out very heavily
with how her vagina smelled and her sweat reeked
so i left
my conscience grew to where
i couldn't go to school for a week and when i went back i got in-house suspension for skipping
and that day, the girl's father came in and screaming and accusing someone of taking advantage of his daughter
and so during lunch, a rumour started, and by the next day
everyone was waiting for me to yell and cuss and spit at me and callin' me "the retard-fucker"
i couldn't handle the ridicule
so i got high and drunk and walked down to the train tracks and laid down
and put two big pieces of cement on my chest and legs and i waited for the eleven o'clock train
and the train came closer and closer and closer
and it went on the next track besides me instead of over me
the tension from school had an effect on me and so i couldn't attend the school anymore
and the train scared me enough to try to rehabilitate myself and my
my lifting weights and mathematics seemed to be improving so i became less manically depressed
but still haven't had any friends because i...
i hated everyone, for they were so phoney

beans, beans, beans
jessie ate some beans

kiss me good and piss me off
and grease me  and preen me
maybe someday and i will fall
and i will call
and greet thee
and greet, and greet, and greet, and greet
and greet, and greet, and greet

and finally i will drain you down
and draw things up and find me gone
and finally i'm gone
i'm tired of everyone
and finally i will drown the sun
and die at my side
i’ll paint me good
and frame me mother

and she nuttered me
and girly
and go away
and paint me mountains
inside a fire
and then throw me on board
and the dreams discarded
and she’s inside of you

well phrase god
and praise god
and drown me slow
and the giant who told them who we
don’t rain heat

do re mi, do re mi, do re mi
do re mi, do re mi

finally on
and i’m not gone
but trying hard
with the rain and all
and phrase god
amaze god
grace god and then you’ll fall
your wings grow

do re mi, do re mi, do re mi
do re mi, do re mi,  do re mi
do re mi, do re mi,  do re mi

and i am afraid
it's a fire - our house is gone
and i refrain
are you god, are you good

and now your fingers meet the floor
and now i can barely be alone
and now i am one to obey me
preach me fire and lead the way
be silent bit and i will say
you see in fire me away
and now, and now, hey
keep it down to one more spacious
one more howl and i feigned my service
someday i'll find my way to something
it's not hard to relieve my service
come inside of her inner circles
someday i won't be high, no way, it's over
she seems to read minds
and i'm dead, dumb and blind
wait the fame i use
she's the same
old age (x3)

some are killed and some are wounded
some were kind and i feigned my service
someday i won't find my way, its over
its not fair he believes my servants
one more hours in the week my servants
someday i will wound my way to something
she seems to read minds
and i'm dead, dumb and blind
face the face in the mirror

old age (x4)

'cause you're just afraid to see, you're all weird
come on higher way i'm begging, see?
one more hour and i face my service
come on down to relieve my servants

it's so relieving
to know that you're leaving
as soon as you get paid
it's so relaxing
to hear that you're asking
whenever you get your way
it's so soothing
to know that you'll sue me
this is starting to sound the same

i miss the comfort in being sad
i miss the comfort in being sad
i miss the comfort in being sad

in her false witness
we hope you're still with us
to see if they float or drown
our favorite patient
a display of patience
disease-covered puget sound
she'll come back as fire
to burn all the liars
leave a blanket of ash on the ground

i miss the comfort in being sad
i miss the comfort in being sad
i miss the comfort in being sad


it's so relieving
to know that you're leaving
as soon as you get paid
it's so relaxing
to know that you're asking

this is starting to sound the same

i miss the comfort in being sad
i miss the comfort in being sad

why does leoda swing and straddle the tired little rhesus monkey?
collecting figurines with long john silvers
shish kabobs in the relatives of rhesus monkey
who are see, here, say no evil?
and you better follow this rule
i can't fucking read this
nor can i ride with the bad sharks in the winnebago
squeeze the pus pockets of your bare fist
in the fold of link sausage you mod
beware of the care wigs have no substitute to coke
with balding label mates in a pool of freezer burn
he killed his fucking son didn't he?
well then need i say more?
if i don't like myself how can i live?
how can i like you?
questions, questions, brown bag it
swimming in the pennyroyal tea
brush him with lemon juice
spayed, shaved, neutered, greased, tied, drugged, plucked and fucked

she could have known that it's for shame
she could have seen the sun and drain
she could have known and hid the sky
she could have seen the dark before

she could have
cheer me
she could have just
stayed the same
she could have just
stayed the same
she could have just
stayed the same
she could have

she could have soared with pleasant dreams
she could have saw the way i see
she could have make out her room
she could have known everything they're all the same

she could have been
so insane
she could have been
so insane
she could have been
so strange
she could have been
so strange

"time will dissolve
if sea monkeys are present.
sea monkeys will hatch and reproduce"
he said to the little girl.
"sea monkeys are brine shrimp.
the tooth fairy is your mom.
paula abdul is a sea monkey."
they found the little girl's skin under his yellow cigarette-stained fingernails.
once the little girl went to tower records and saw some records displayed.
the records were of prince's batman.
instantly the little girl associated any raw albums or cds with paula abdul.
she said "paula abdul, mommy!"
she started dancing and singing her song.
mommy patted the little girl's head as blood dripped from the corner of her eyelid.
then they squirmed away to frolic in instant life solutions step number three.
