he was a boy, she was a girl
can i make it any more obvious?
he was a punk, she did ballet
what more can i say?
he wanted her, she'd never tell
secretly she wanted him as well
but all of her friends stuck up their nose
they had a problem with his baggy clothes

he was a skater boy, she said, "see you later, boy"
he wasn't good enough for her
she had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
she needed to come back down to earth

five years from now, she sits at home
feeding the baby, she's all alone
she turns on tv, guess who she sees
skater boy rockin' up mtv
she calls up her friends, they already know
and they've all got tickets to see his show
she tags along, stands in the crowd
looks up at the man that she turned down

he was a skater boy, she said, "see you later, boy"
he wasn't good enough for her
now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he's worth?
he was a skater boy, she said, "see you later, boy"
he wasn't good enough for her
now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he's worth?

sorry, girl, but you missed out
well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
we are more than just good friends
this is how the story ends
too bad that you couldn't see
see the man that boy could be
there is more than meets the eye
i see the soul that is inside
he's just a boy and i'm just a girl
can i make it any more obvious?
we are in love, haven't you heard
how we rock each other's world?

(yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'm with the skater boy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i said, "see you later, boy" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'll be backstage after the show (yeah, yeah, yeah)
i'll be at our studio (yeah, yeah, yeah)
singin' the song we wrote (yeah, yeah, yeah)

i've gotta keep the calm before the storm
i don’t want less, i don't want more
must bar the windows and the doors
to keep me safe, to keep me warm
yeah, my life is what i'm fighting for
can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
and my voice becomes the driving force
i won't let this pull me overboard

god, keep my head above water
don't let me drown, it gets harder
i'll meet you there, at the altar
as i fall down to my knees
don't let me drown, drown, drown
don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

so pull me up from down below
’cause i'm underneath the undertow
come dry me off and hold me close
i need you now, i need you most

god, keep my head above water
don’t let me drown, it gets harder
i'll meet you there, at the altar
as i fall down to my knees
don't let me drown, drown, drown
don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
don't let me drown, drown, drown
(i keep my head above water, above water)
don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

and i can't see in the stormy weather
i can't seem to keep it all together
and i, i can't swim the ocean like this forever
and i can't breathe
god, keep my head above water
i lose my breath, at the bottom
come rescue me, i'll be waiting
i'm too young to fall asleep

so god, keep my head above water
don't let me drown, it gets harder
i'll meet you there, at the altar
as i fall down to my knees

don't let me drown
don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
don't let me drown
and keep my head above water, above water
(don't let me, don't let me drown)

there's nothing but the rain
no footsteps on the ground
i'm listening, but there's no sound

isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
won't somebody come take me home?

it's a damn cold night
tryin' to figure out this life
won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
i don't know who you are, but i
i'm with you

i never thought i'd need you there when i cried
and the days feel like years when i'm alone
and the bed where you lie is made up on your side

when you walk away
i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now?

when you're gone
the pieces of my heart are missin' you
when you're gone
the face i came to know is missin' too
when you're gone, the words i need to hear
to always get me through the day
and make it okay
i miss you

i've never felt this way before
everything that i do reminds me of you
and the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
and they smell just like you
i love the things that you do

when you walk away
i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now?

when you're gone
the pieces of my heart are missin' you

i ain't playing no games
'cause i've got nothing left to lose
i'm so tired of circular motions
they leave me dizzy and confused
my heart, oh no, is not your revolving door
i get stuck spinning and spinning and spinning
oh, 'til i collapse on the floor

but every time that you touch me
i forget what we're fighting about
oh, you come and you leave
shame on me for believing every word out of your mouth

tell me it's over if it's really over
'cause it don't feel like it's over
whenever you're closing the door, no
so tell me it's over

darling, you
oh, you taste so bittersweet
can't get you off of my lips
you're dangerous
wanna take me like a thief

oh, and i
i should let this go
i try and i try, i try
but why, why won't you leave me alone?

tell me it's over if it's really over
'cause it don't feel like it's over
whenever you're closing the door, no
so tell me it's over if it's really over
'cause every time you come over
it doesn't feel over no more
so tell me it's over

i keep on leaving the light on
hoping to find something else, oh
i've played the fool for the last time
i just can't do this myself

tell me it's over if it's really over
'cause it don't feel like it's over
whenever you're closing the door, no
tell me it's over if it's really over
'cause every time you come over
it doesn't feel over no more
so tell me it's over

love that once hung on the wall
used to mean something
but now it means nothing
the echoes are gone in the hall
but i still remember
the pain of december

oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
i'm sorry, it's too late

i'm breakin' free from these memories
gotta let it go, just let it go
i've said goodbye, set it all on fire
gotta let it go, just let it go

oh-oh
oh-oh

you came back to find i was gone
and that place is empty
like the hole that was left in me
like we were nothing at all
it's not what you meant to me
thought we were meant to be

oh, there isn't one thing left you could say (left you could say)
i'm sorry, it's too late

i'm breakin' free from these memories
gotta let it go, just let it go
i've said goodbye, set it all on fire
gotta let it go, just let it go

i let it go (and now i know)
a brand new life (is down this road)
and when it's right (you always know)
so this time (i won't let go)

there's only one thing left here to say
love's never too late

i've broken free from those memories
i've let it go, i've let it go
and two goodbyes led to this new life
don't let me go, don't let me go

oh-oh
oh-oh
oh-oh
don't let me go
don't let me go
don't let me go
don't let me go

won't let you go
don't let me go
won't let you go
don't let me go
won't let you go
don't let me go
won't let you go
don't let me go

last night i blacked out, i think
what did you, what did you put in my drink?
i remember makin' out and then (oh, oh)
i woke up with a new tattoo
your name was on me and my name was on you
i would do it all over again

you said, "hey (hey), what's your name?" (what's your name?)

i just watched her make
the same mistakes again

what's wrong, what's wrong now? (what's)
too many, too many problems (wrong)
don't know where she belongs (no)
where she belongs

she wants to go home, but nobody's home
that's where she lies, broken inside
with no place to go, no place to go
to dry her eyes, broken inside

open your eyes (open your eyes)
and look outside
find the reasons why
you've been rejected (you've been rejected)
and now you can't find
what you've left behind

be strong, be strong now (be)
too many, too many problems (strong)
don't know where she belongs (no)

she's fallen from grace, she's all over the place
yeah

she wants to go home, but nobody's home
that's where she lies, broken inside
with no place to go, no place to go
to dry her eyes, broken inside

she's lost inside, lost inside, oh, oh
