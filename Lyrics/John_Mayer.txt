ah, ah, ah
ah...

i'm the boy in your other phone
lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
pushing 40 in the friend zone
we talk and then you walk away, every day
oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
and maybe you're right to doubt me, but

but if you give me just one night
you're gonna see me in a new light
yeah, if you give me just one night
to meet you underneath the moonlight
oh, i want a take two, i want to break through
i wanna know the real thing about you
so i can see you in a new light

take a ride up to malibu
i just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
what would it matter if your friends knew?
who cares what other people say, anyway
oh, we can go far from here
and make a new world together, babe

'cause if you give me just one night
you're gonna see me in a new light
yeah, if you give me just one night
to meet you underneath the moonlight
oh, i want a take two, i want to break through
i wanna know the real thing about you
so i can see you in a new light

ay, ay
ay, ay
ay, ay
ay, ay
ay, ay
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

yeah, if you give me just one night
you're gonna see me in a new light
yeah, if you give me just one night
to meet you underneath the moonlight

what do i do with all this, what do i do with all this
love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
what do i do with all this, what do i do with all this
love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
what do i do with all this, what do i do with all this
love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
what do i do with all this, what do i do with all this
ooh, yeah

gravity is working against me
and gravity wants to bring me down

oh, i'll never know
what makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
dream of ways to throw it all away

woah, woah
gravity is working against me
and gravity wants to bring me down

oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
and can't sustain like one half could
it's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees


oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
and can't sustain like one half could
it's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

woah, woah
gravity, stay the hell away from me
woah, woah
gravity has taken better men than me
now, how can that be?

just keep me where the light is
just keep me where the light is
just keep me where the light is
come on, keep me where the light is
come on, keep me where the light is
come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is

it's not a silly little moment
it's not the storm before the calm
this is the deep and dying breath of
this love that we've been working on
can't seem to hold you like i want to
so i can feel you in my arms
nobody's going to come and save you
we pulled too many false alarms

we're going down
and you can see it, too
we're going down
and you know that we're doomed
my dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

i was the one you always dreamed of
you were the one i tried to draw
how dare you say it's nothing to me?
baby, you're the only light i ever saw
i'll make the most of all the sadness
you'll be a bitch, because you can
you try to hit me, just to hurt me
so you leave me feeling dirty
'cause you can't understand

we're going down
and you can see it, too
we're going down
and you know that we're doomed
my dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

go cry about it, why don't you?
go cry about it, why don't you?
go cry about it, why don't you?

my dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
burning room
burning room
burning room
burning room

don't you think we ought to know by now?
don't you think we should have learned somehow?
don't you think we ought to know by now?
don't you think we should have learned somehow?
don't you think we ought to know by now?
don't you think we should have learned somehow?

how much of my mother has my mother left in me?
how much of my love will be insane to some degree?
and what about this feeling that i'm never good enough?
will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

how much of my father am i destined to become?
will i dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
will i let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

i can feel the love i want
i can feel the love i need
but it's never gonna come the way i am
could i change it if i wanted?
can i rise above the flood?
will it wash out in the water
or is it always in the blood?

how much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
does a broken home become another broken family?
or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

i can feel the love i want
i can feel the love i need
but it's never gonna come the way i am
could i change it if i wanted?
can i rise above the flood?
will it wash out in the water
or is it always in the blood?

i can feel the love i want
i can feel the love i need
but it's never gonna come the way i am
could i change it if i wanted?
can i rise above the flood?
will it wash out in the water
or is it always in the blood?

i know a girl
she puts the color inside of my world
but she's just like a maze
where all of the walls all continually change
and i've done all i can
to stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
now i'm starting to see
maybe it's got nothing to do with me

fathers, be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers, be good to your daughters too

oh, you see that skin?
it's the same she's been standing in
since the day she saw him walking away
now she's left
cleaning up the mess he made

so fathers, be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers, be good to your daughters too

boys, you can break
you find out how much they can take
boys will be strong
and boys soldier on
but boys would be gone without warmth from
a woman's good, good heart

on behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
you are the god and the weight of her world

so fathers, be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers, be good to your daughters too

so mothers be good to your daughters, too
so mothers be good to your daughters, too

no, i'm not color blind
i know the world is black and white
i try to keep an open mind
but, i just can't sleep on this tonight

stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i can't take the speed it's moving in
i know i can't
but honestly, won't someone stop this train?

don't know how else to say it
don't want to see my parents go
one generation's length away
from fighting life out on my own

stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i can't take the speed it's moving in
i know i can't
but honestly, won't someone stop this train?


so scared of getting older
i'm only good at being young
so i play the numbers game
to find a way to say that life has just begun

had a talk with my old man
said, "help me understand"
he said, "turn 68, you'll renegotiate"

"don't stop this train
don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
and don't think i couldn't ever understand
i tried my hand
john, honestly, we'll never stop this train"

once in a while, when it's good
it'll feel like it should
and they're all still around
and they're still safe and sound
and you don't miss a thing
'til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

singing, "stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i can't take the speed it's moving in
i know i can't
'cause, now, i see, i'll never stop this train"

one, two
one, two, three

me and all my friends
we're all misunderstood
they say we stand for nothing and
there's no way we ever could
now we see everything that's going wrong
with the world and those who lead it
we just feel like we don't have the means
to rise above and beat it

so we keep waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
it's hard to beat the system
when we're standing at a distance
so we keep waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change

now if we had the power
to bring our neighbors home from war
they would have never missed a christmas
no more ribbons on their door
but when you trust your television
what you get is what you got
cause when they own the information, oh
they can bend it all they want

that's why we're waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
it's not that we don't care
we just know that the fight ain't fair
so we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change


and we're still waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
one day our generation
is gonna rule the population
so we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change

now we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting (waiting)
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change

i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore
i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore
i don't know what it's like to land
and not race to your door
i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore
i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore
i'm not sure that i really ever could
hold on to your hotel key
and your bedroom neighborhood
and be sleepwalking in hollywood

i'm going to steer clear
or burn up in your atmosphere
i'm going to steer clear
because i'd die if i saw you
i'd die if i didn't see you there
so i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore

i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore
i'd get lost on the boulevard at night
without your voice to tell me
"i love you, take a right"
the ten and the two is the loneliest sight

i'm going to steer clear
or burn up in your atmosphere
i'm going to steer clear
because i'd die if i saw you
i'd die if i didn't see you there
so i don't think i'm going to go to l.a. anymore

i think i'm going to stay
going to stay in the gray
think i'm going to stay
and all the street lights say
"never mind, never mind"
and the canyon lines say
"never mind, never mind"
the sunset says
"we see this all the time"
never mind, never you mind

wherever i go, whatever i do
i wonder where i am in my relationship to you
wherever you go, wherever you are
i watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
wherever i go, whatever i do
i wonder where i am in my relationship to you
wherever you go, wherever you are
i watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar

paper doll, come try it on
step out of that black chiffon
here’s a dress of gold and blue
sure was fun being good to you

this one we made just for fall
and winter runs a bit too small
this mint green is new for spring
my love didn't cost a thing

you’re like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what they’re running from
was it just too far to fall
for a little paper doll

fold a scarf, moroccan red
tie your hair behind your head
strap into some heels that hurt
you shoulda' kept my undershirt

you’re like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what they’re running from
was it just too far to fall
for a little paper doll


cut the cord and pull some strings
make yourself some angel wings
and if those angel wings don’t fly
someone’s going to paint you another sky

'cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what they’re running from
was it just too far to fall?
was it just too far to fall?

moving on and getting over
are not the same, it seems to me
'cause you've been gone, i'm growing older
but i still can't seem to get you off my mind
and i do believe i feel you all the time

moving on and getting over
are not the friends they used to be
it's been so long since i got to hold you
but i still can't seem to get you off my mind
and i do believe i feel you all the time, all the time

tell me i can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
tell me i can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
for all my running, i can understand
i'm one text away from being back again
but i'm moving on and i'm getting over
i'm getting over, i'm getting over
i got to get over

moving on and getting over
it's been so long; it just goes to show you
that i still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
and i sure would like to see you one more time

it's taken me so long just to say "so long"
and baby it's so wrong, but i'm moving on
i'm gonna get a new girl
a something-i-can-do-girl
to try to get me through, girl
'cause i'm moving on
i'm moving on
and i'm moving on
i'm moving on
and i'm moving on
consider me as good as gone
'cause i'm moving on
i'm moving on
moving on, baby
moving on
moving on

only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
so gorgeous, a man might cry
burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
so gorgeous, a man might cry
back in paris you told me you were suicidal
it's not a vacation if i lose you to the eiffel
you're gorgeous but you can't fly
a hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
we took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

wildfire
wildfire
wildfire
wildfire

i still feel like your man
i still feel like your man
i still feel
i still feel
i still feel like your man

the prettiest girl in the room she wants me
i know because she told me so
she says come over
i'd like to get to know you
but i just don't think i can

'cause i still feel like your man
still feel like your man
i still feel like your man
still feel like your man
i still feel like your man

i still keep your shampoo in my shower
in case you wanna wash your hair
and i know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
but i do not really care
'cause as long as it is there

i still feel like your man
still feel like your man
still feel like your man, oh mama
still feel like your man
i still feel like your man, your man

(ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
still think i'm never gonna find another you
still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
and don't you know, babe
i'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

'cause i still feel like your man
still feel like your man
(i still feel like) still feel like your man (oh honey)
still feel like your man
i still feel like your man
still feel like your man
still feel like your man (and i don't know why)
still feel like your man

i still feel like
i still feel like
i still feel like
i still, i still

rosie
come down and get the door for me
i'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
rosie
i know you said no more for me
but that was all before this dream that just came to me

don't leave me here
under the january rain
come let me in
take my heart by the hand
and lead me back to your room
and sing me your tune

rosie
you don't have to hide his things
i'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
whoa-oh-oh, rosie
don't you know my love is true
'perdon' and 'lo siento', see, i learned those words for you

don't leave me here
under the january rain
come let me in
take my heart by the hand
and lead me back to your room
and sing me your tune

don't leave me here
under the january rain
come let me in
take my heart by the hand
and lead me back to your room
and sing me your tune

oh honey
you don't have to try so hard
to hurt me
don't worry
i been thinking bout you too
what do we do

your heart is where my head should be
the dissonance is killing me
it breaks my heart
it breaks my heart

oh honey
oh honey
it's just a wave
it's just a wave
and i know
that when it comes
i just hold on
i just hold on

oh honey
i been talking to myself
just to hear you
and you're saying
everything i wish you would
and it's so good

it's raining on the mission bell
they're draining out the wishing well
it breaks my heart
it breaks my heart

oh honey
oh honey
it's just a wave
it's just a wave
and i know
that when it comes
i just hold on
i just hold on

i rose in you like morning light
and sheltered you asleep at night
it breaks my heart
it takes all the love i have to say
i know we're gonna be ok
it breaks my heart
it breaks my heart

oh honey
oh honey
it's just a wave
it's just a wave
and i know
that when it comes
i just hold on
until it's gone

young and full of running
tell me where has that taken me
just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
love is really nothing
but a dream that keeps waking me
for all of my trying, we still end up dying
how can it be?

don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'cause i'm just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad, i'll go back on the things i believe
there i just said it, i'm scared you'll forget about me

so young and full of running
all the way to the edge of desire
steady my breathing, silently screaming
i have to have you now
wired and i'm tired
think i'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
and find me on yours

don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'cause i'm just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad, i'll go back on the things i believe
there i just said it, i'm scared you'll forget about me


don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
because i'm just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad, i'll go back on the things i believe
there i just said it, i'm scared you'll forget about me

we got the afternoon
you got this room for two
one thing i've left to do
discover me, discovering you
one mile to every inch of
your skin like porcelain
one pair of candy lips and
your bubblegum tongue

and if you want love we'll make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break 'em
this is bound to be a while

your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland

something 'bout the way
your hair falls in your face
i love the shape you take when
crawling towards the pillowcase
you tell me where to go
and though i might leave to find it
i'll never let your head hit the bed
without my hand behind it

you want love, we'll make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break 'em
this is bound to be a while

your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland
(i'll never speak again, again
i'll use my hands)

damn, baby
you frustrate me
i know you're mine all mine, all mine
but you look so good it hurts sometimes

your body is a wonderland (i'll never speak again, again)
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland (i'll never speak again, again)
your body is a wonderland (i'll use my hands)

lightning strike
inside my chest to keep me up at night
dream of ways
to make you understand my pain

clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare

if you want more love
why don't you say so?
if you want more love
why don't you say so?

drop his name
push it in and twist the knife again
watch my face
as i pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare

if you want more love
why don't you say so?
if you want more love
why don't you say so?
just say so

how come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far i fall?
god only knows how much i'd love you if you let me
but i can't break through it all
it's a heart, heartbreak

i don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
let's just fix this whole thing now
i swear to god we're gonna get it right
if you lay your weapon down

red wine and ambien
you're talking shit again
it's heartbreak warfare
good to know it's all a game
disappointment has a name
it's heartbreak, heartbreak

it's heartbreak warfare
it's heartbreak warfare
it's heartbreak warfare

it's a friday, we finally made it
i can't believe i get to see your face
you've been working and i've been waiting
to pick you up and take you from this place

love on the weekend
love on the weekend
like only we can
like only we can
love on the weekend
love on the weekend
i'm coming up and i'm loving every minute of it

you be the dj, i'll be the driver
you put your feet up in the getaway car
i'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
i want you, baby, like you can't understand

oh, love on the weekend
love on the weekend
we found a message in a bottle we were drinking
love on the weekend
love on the weekend
i hate your guts 'cause i'm loving every minute of it

oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

i gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
my clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
down there below us, under the clouds
baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down

and i'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
into another serotonin overflow
love on the weekend
love on the weekend
i'm busted up but i'm loving every minute of it
(love on the weekend)
(love on the weekend)

i'm looking for a little love
i'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(love on the weekend)
(love on the weekend)
(love on the weekend)

i'm such a bore, i'm such a bummer
there must be more behind the summer
i want someone to make some trouble
been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
take me out and keep me up all night
let me live on the wilder side of the light

carry me away
carry me away
carry me away
carry me away
carry me away
carry me away

you carnivore, you loose cannon
can i have some more? i can't understand it
you fast car, you foolish spender
you know you are, and i surrender
so come on over and wake me up
put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
you know i need you, and that's for sure
you're just the kinda crazy i've been lookin' for

carry me away
carry me away
carry me away
(where the sun hits my face all different)
carry me away
carry me away
carry me away

"welcome to the real world", she said to me
condescendingly
take a seat, take your life
plot it out in black and white
well i never lived the dreams of the prom kings
and the drama queens
i'd like to think the best of me
is still hiding up my sleeve

they love to tell you
stay inside the lines
but something's better
on the other side

i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above

so the good boys and girls take the so called right track
faded white hats, grabbing credits and
maybe transfers
they read all the books, but they can't find the answers
and all of our parents, they're getting older
i wonder if they've wished for anything better
while in their memories, tiny tragedies

they love to tell you
stay inside the lines
but something's better
on the other side

i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above

i am invincible
i am invincible
i am invincible
as long as i'm alive

i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above
i just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
i'm going to bust down the double doors
and when i stand on these tables before you
you will know what all this time was for
