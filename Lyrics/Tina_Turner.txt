you must understand though the touch of your hand
makes my pulse react
that it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
opposites attract

only logical
you must try to ignore that it means more than that

out of the ruins
out from the wreckage
can't make the same mistake this time
we are the children, the last generation
we are the ones they left behind
and, i wonder when we are ever gonna change
living under the fear, until nothing else remains

we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome

looking for something we can rely on
there's gotta be something better out there
love and compassion
their day is coming
all else are castles built in the air
and i wonder when we are ever gonna change
living under the fear, until nothing else remains

all the children say
we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome

so, what do we do with our lives
we leave only a mark
will our story shine like a light
or end in the dark
give it all or nothing

we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome

see reflections on the water
more than darkness in the depths
see him surface in every shadow
on the wind i feel his breath
golden eye i found his weakness
golden eye he'll do what i please
golden eye no time for sweetness
but a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees

you'll never know
how i watched you from the shadows as a child
you'll never know
how it feels to be the one who's left behind
you'll never know the days, the nights
the tears, the tears i've cried
but now my time has come
and time, time is not on your side

see him move through smoke and mirrors
feel his presence in the crowd
other girls, they gather around him
if i had him i wouldn't let him out
golden eye not lace or leather
golden chain take him to the spot
golden eye i'll show him forever
it'll take forever to see
what i've got

you'll never know
how i watched you from the shadows as a child
you'll never know
how it feels to get so close
and be denied
it's a gold and honey trap
i've got for you tonight
revenge, it's a kiss, this time i won't miss
now i've got you in my sight
with a golden eye

golden, golden eye
with a golden eye
golden eye, golden eye
golden eye, golden eye

you take the good along with the bad
sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
(one more time)
you know you love him, you can't understand (tell me 'bout it)
why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man?

and listen, he's got me smiling when i should be ashamed

there's a pale moon in the sky
the kind you make your wishes on
oh, like the light in your eyes
the one i built my dreams upon
it's not there any longer

with a clever mind
but your intellect ain't no match
for this heart of mine

all i want is a little reaction
just enough of to tip the scales
i'm just using my female attraction
on a typical male, on a typical male

your sense of justice i'll embrace
but your defense don't help my case
i'm deep in trouble with the law
something about authority
seems to bring out the bad in me

some boys just got the look of a greek adonis
an' some boys just try to talk you off your feet
some boys think they're god's gift to woman
an' some boys just think they're sweet enough to eat
i change the habit of a lifetime
don't even try
'cause when you cut down deeper than the icing
you realize

what you get is what you see
ain't nothing more to it
and if you wanna love a woman like me
it takes a man to do it
if what you get is what you see
then i don't want your kind of love

some guys just got lips that you can't help kissing
and some guys just got a smile you can't resist
some guys just got to build a reputation
they just wanna add you to the list
you got a lot of physical attraction
i can't deny, but can you guarantee me satisfaction
while, i'm still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, oohhh

what you get is what you see
ain't nothing more to it
and if you wanna love a woman like me
it takes a man to do it
if what you get is what you see
then i don't want your kind of love

so, let me see your cards on the table
before i buy
i always read the writing on the label
so, give me reason to believe
there's more to you than meets the eye

what you get is what you see
ain't nothing more to it
and if you wanna love a woman like me
it takes a man to do it
if what you get is what you see
then i don't want your kind of love

ain't nothing more to it
doesn't matter, doesn't matter at all
i don't want your kind of love
ain't nothing else to it
i don't want your kind of love, oooohh
what you get is what you see

when the earth was young
and the air was sweet
and the mountains kissed the sky
in the great beyond with its many paths
man and nature lived side by side
in this wilderness of danger and beauty
lived three brothers bonded by love
their hearts full of joy
they ask now for guidance
reaching out to the skies up above

great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same

give us wisdom to pass to each other
and give us strength so we understand
that the things we do
the choices we make
give direction to all life's plans
to look and wonder at all we've been given
in our world that's not always as it seems
every corner we turn only leads to another
a journey ends but another begins

ooo, great spirits of all who lived before
(take our hands)
take our hands and lead us
(fill our hearts)
fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(you know you can show)
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
ooo, great spirits of all who lived before
(take our hands)
take our hands and lead us
(fill our hearts)
fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(you know you can show)
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
brothers all the same!

make me over, i wanna be made over
hey lord
make me over, i wanna be made over
i wanna go places, i wanna do some things
i wanna be a star, i wanna have a big name
but in my heart, let beauty reign
and when i'm done, i wanna have fame
lord make me nice, lord make me good
give me power, give me love
i wanna be desireable, voluptous, tenderlized

i made a resolution and i plan to keep my word
but i need you to make it work
you've got to read the message
understand what's on my mind
'cause not to see would be a crime
and we could lose it anytime

we've got to show some respect
we've got to learn to protect
don't take it for granted, i know
that if you want to stay close
we've got to show some respect

but i believe in working, then i believe in a little help
cause i'm not a light unto myself
without a thing of value, why settle for second best
we don't know what's up ahead
and we can't let ourselves forget

we've got to show some respect
we've got to learn to protect
don't take it for granted, i know
that if you want to stay close
we've got to show some respect

for the things that i love about you
from the woman that you see inside
don't let it walk out the door
love follows every time

we've got to show some respect
we've got to learn to protect
don't take it for granted, i know
that if you want to stay close
we've got to show some respect
