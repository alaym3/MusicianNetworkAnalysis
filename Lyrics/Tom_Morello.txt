from the time i was born
through all of my days
try to catch my breath
out of the womb and into the flames
searching for the neon path

i've been waiting my whole life
in the crossfire, yeah
i've been hiding my whole life
in the crossfire, yeah the crossfire
every time i move
every step that i take
everywhere i look
it's right in front of my face
one foot in the shadows
one foot on the brakes
one foot towards the gallows
where it's quiet and safe

every step that i take
every step that i take
every step that i take
step that i take
every step that i take

lost in the motions
locked in the safe
trying to forget the key
and i know where i lost it
but i'll never say

i've been waiting my whole life
in the crossfire, yeah

everywhere i look
it's right in front of my face
one foot in the shadows
one foot on the brakes
can't shake this force that
keeps calling my name

every step that i take
every step that i take
every step that i take
every step that i take

i see what's happening, i can read between the lines
i see what's happening, i can read between the lines

there's always a punk mother fucker popping that weak shit

now i pray like a vulture
send my truth to the wind
i'm no priest, i'm no prophet
i only came for your sin

so do me wrong
i know ya can

you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, don't leave me burned
and you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, you knew i'd turn

and i won't break the commission
nothing good ever lasts
i see you beg for forgiveness
no quarter given, no rust

so do me wrong
i know ya can, i know ya can

you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, don't leave me burned
and you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, you knew i'd turn


do me wrong

flesh of my flesh, you knew i'd turn
you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, don't leave me burned
and you told me you would find another way
flesh of my flesh, you knew i'd turn

nobody said it would be easy
nobody said that it would all be fine
but to get where we're going
brother, you gotta hold the line
it ain't a matter of "if"
nah, it's just a matter of time
but to get where we're going
sister, gotta hold the line

you gotta stay steadfast, tread lightly
'cause they're looking for a reason to knock you down
but you can't ask too politely
in the trenches, you gotta get loud

hold the line
hold the line, uh
don't pay 'em no mind, oh
hold the line

nobody said it happens overnight
but if you're looking for a sign
remember everybody that stood up before you
oh, they hold the line
they wanna tell you "you're already free"
put these chains on and rob you blind
when they co-op the movement
don't trip, just hold the line, hold the line

hold the line
hold the line, uh
don't pay 'em no mind, oh
hold the line

you gotta stay steadfast, tread lightly
'cause they're looking for the reason to knock you down
but you can't ask too politely
in the trenches, you gotta get loud

you gotta stay steadfast, tread lightly
'cause they're looking for the reason to knock you down
but you can't ask too politely

hold the line

don't pay 'em no mind, oh
hold the line

rise like coyotes
rise like coal blackened thunder
the fleet has left
while the admiral slumbered
vigilante nocturno
test the chains
gnaw the screws
we are many
they are few
check it
it's lead poisoning

i live in a land of black ropes, white justice
as long as she wear the blindfold, i can't trust this
i'm imagining what can bring such hate
this phobia or dislike, grounds for a debate
some say it's trigger happy, i say it's lead poisoning
somethin' that's deeply rooted in official embroidering
the difference? we went from water hoses to bullets
but the valve or trigger, just a different figure to pull it
murdered by the state like the cousin of the john the baptist
as if black youths aren't nothing but target practice
overindulgence of power, a monstrous binge
this creates anger, make me want to seek revenge
you invade our protests, guns and heavy armor
riot shields and yielding a badge of dishonor
just a disguised version of the kkk
kops killing kids about seven a day

lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
it's lead poisoning
rise
rise
rise
rise

in all reality, police brutality cause too many casualties
it starts from the improper training, brainwashing of their faculty
suppose to serve and protect, not disturb and disrespect
with six niggas on my curb face down inside the projects
a long-term effect they done got on my community
they killed little bill but the badge gave them immunity
rodney king caught a stampede on tv
now they chokin' niggas out 'til he's like "i can't breathe"
i used to watch starksky and hutch and baretta and adam-12 and such
dreamin' i could be a cop when i grow up
i would see you in my neighborhood and i would trust you
but now i understand why eazy-e is like "fuck you!"

lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning
lead- lead- lead poisoning

it's lead poisoning

just last night i finished a bite
at the corner of illinois grand
when a shadow passed over broadway and dover
seven bodies smashed into the damn
the next day they say the levee gave way
birds fell from the sky like stars
there was ice in the elms, no one at the helm
the damn finally broke but no one thought to film

the exodus of the greyhound bus
as it roared from heaven's gate
flash bulb pop as the front linе drop
i'ma turn up to interstate 80! (80, 80, 80)

now a river kеpt rising and i was surmising
if i stood up, i might stand a chance
to avoid a repeat of those that died in their sleep
'cause they didn't have the courage to dance
well the locks were shaking, and no one's waiting
to see who's in line for the throne
something on my mind burns like turpentine
it scours the soul and steals the spine

so kick up some gravel and watch us unravel
wait, what the fuck's that in the shade?
now i try to stay calm, i'm sure it don't mean no harm
but i hit the gas on interstate 80 (80, 80, 80)




baby, you wanna live forever?
calculate some beats and some rhymes
while you and yours was acting clever
i was barreling 'cross the state line
now who's gonna last and who's gonna pass?
i got news, we all pass in time
the file's deleted, my mission's completed
and everyone's repaid in kind

i got one more idea the next time i see ya
here's a trick i learned down in haiti
slip on your sunday shrouds, turn the radio up loud
and disappear down interstate 80 (80, 80, 80)

i be damned i gave my last
i be damned i gave my last
to a coyote
i be damned i gave my last
to a coyote
to get me across the border
i be damned i gave my last
to a coyote
to get me across the border
left me to be a sheep
for the slaughter
somehow i survive
when a lot of my friends died
that's how i learn to run and
cry at the same time
spent days in the dark
looking for a spark for the fire
that would keep me going
at night
in the valley of death
my name changed
got introduced to
my best friend pain
that's my partner when
i'm dancing in the rain
i walk through the
desert until it became

my lane, my game
i came through the desert
till it became
my role, my goal, my soul
in the desert
till became
my own

one hour out of guadalajara
no pit stops even though
the engine getting hotter
surviving off my own sweat
i drink it outta bottles
i see a lotta y'all parched
and that's the fucking problem
see in the valley of death
your name would change
let me introduce you
to my friend pain
my partner with me
dancing in the rain
walk with me in the desert
see how it does when
it's your own lane
my game

i came through the
desert till it became
my role, my goals, my soul
in the desert, till it became
my own

my lane, my game
i came through the desert till
it became
my role, my goal, my soul
in the desert, till it became
my lane, my game
i came through the desert till
it became
my role, my goal, my soul
in the desert till it
became my own

turn out the light
close your eyes and count to three
we're in the dark
darkness, only you and me
you can't escape
the path of everlasting flame
the spell was cast
the third time that you called my name

believe, believe what i say
i'm driving to texas
and now, now isn't the time
you'll break this transfixion

i'm in a car
corridor of endless trees
drilling a hole
memories escaping me
i was alive
i drank the sunlight just like you
i changed my statе
to replicate the blacknеss of the blood you drew

believe, believe what i say
i'm driving to texas
and now, now isn't the time
you'll break this transfixion

don't wake me up
don't wake me up
don't wake me up
don't wake me up

believe, believe what i say
i'm driving to texas
and now, now isn't the time
you'll break this transfixion

and how long?

we drown them out
with lights and sound
we drown them out
with lights and sound

from the red ropes to the masses
we are one and the same
every billboard we are burning
a delusion up in flames

and how long can we dance around
the hungry mouths, the burning streets?
and how long can we drown them out
with lights and sound
while the bombs fall at our feet?
and how long can we drown them out
with lights and sound
while the bombs fall at our feet?

living easy, living free

it feels like redemption
i walked through a wall
nothing could stop me
david and saul
the house is on fire
my mom’s underneath
my brother is crying
gnashing of teeth
he's using a wall
to keep himself warm
we killed all the cops last night and
prayed right through the storm

mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm

gnarled of metal
stabbing up at the sky
used to be downtown where the
people worked 'til they died
it went as it was written
it followed jerome
so this is naraka, baby
it feels like i'm home
i said "hold me, you're gorgeous"
this is truly the end
then we fucked for a long, long time
and continued to descend
i carried the flag
and heeded the call
it feels like redemption, baby
david and saul

mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm

i'm going down, down, down, ooh
