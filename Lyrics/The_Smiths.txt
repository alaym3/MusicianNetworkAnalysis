take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
and they're young and alive
driving in your car
i never, never want to go home
because i haven't got one anymore
take me out tonight
because i want to see people
and i want to see life
driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their home
and i'm welcome no more

and if a double-decker bus crashes into us
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

take me out tonight
take me anywhere, i don't care, i don't care, i don't care
and in the darkened underpass
i thought "oh god, my chance has come at last"
but then a strange fear gripped me and i just couldn't ask
take me out tonight
oh, take me anywhere, i don't care, i don't care, i don't care
driving in your car
i never, never want to go home
because i haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, i haven't got one
oh, oh

and if a double-decker bus crashes into us
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

oh, there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out

punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
will nature make a man of me yet?
when in this charming car
this charming man
why pamper life's complexity
when the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
i would go out tonight but i haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said, "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said, "return the ring"
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things

i would go out tonight but i haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said, "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
naaa nana nana nana, this charming man
naaa nana nana nana, this charming man

ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said, "return the ring"
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things

oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
oh well, enough said

i know it's over - still i cling
i don't know where else i can go
over...

oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea wants to take me
the knife wants to slit me
do you think you can help me?
sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
though she needs you more than she loves you

and i know it's over - still i cling
i don't know where else i can go
over and over and over and over
over and over...
i know it's over, and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me, and said:

"if you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you're so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so very entertaining
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so very good-looking
why do you sleep alone tonight?
i know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they're in each other's arms..."

it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
over, over, over, over
it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
over, over
love is natural and real
but not for you, my love
not tonight, my love
love is natural and real
but not for such as you and i
my love

oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
oh mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head
mother, i can feel the soil falling over my head

i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am the son and heir
of nothing in particular

you shut your mouth, how can you say
i go about things the wrong way?
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

there's a club if you'd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
and you go home and you cry and you want to die

when you say "it's gonna happen now"
well, when exactly do you mean?
see i've already waited too long
and all my hope is gone


you shut your mouth, how can you say
i go about things the wrong way?
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

sweetness, sweetness i was only joking when i said
i'd like to smash every tooth in your head
oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, i was only joking when i said
by rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

and now i know how joan of arc felt
now i know how joan of arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her walkman started to melt (oh)
(hoo-hoo-hoo)

bigmouth la-da-da-dada, bigmouth la-da-da-da
bigmouth strikes again
and i've got no right to take my place
with the human race (oh, oh, oh-oh)

i was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
but heaven knows i'm miserable now
i was looking for a job and then i found a job
and heaven knows i'm miserable now

in my life, why do i give valuable time
to people who don't care if i live or die?

two lovers entwined pass me by
and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i was looking for a job and then i found a job
and heaven knows i'm miserable now

in my life, oh, why do i give valuable time
to people who don't care if i live or die?

what she asked of me at the end of the day
caligula would have blushed
"oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
and i naturally fled

in my life, why do i smile
at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?

i was happy in the haze of a drunken hour

sing me to sleep
sing me to sleep
i'm tired and i
i want to go to bed
sing me to sleep
sing me to sleep
and then leave me alone
don't try to wake me in the morning
'cause i will be gone

don't feel bad for me
i want you to know
deep in the cell of my heart
i will feel so glad to go

sing me to sleep
sing me to sleep
i don't want to wake up
on my own anymore
sing to me

i don't want to wake up

i really want to go

there is another world
there is a better world

oh, take me back to dear old blighty
put me on the train for london town
take me anywhere
drop me anywhere
in liverpool, leeds or birmingham
but i don't care
i should like to seeâ€”

i don't bless them

farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
hemmed in like a boar between archers
her very lowness with her head in a sling
i'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
i say charles don't you ever crave
to appear on the front of the daily mail
dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(oh, oh-oh, oh)

and so i checked all the registered historical facts
and i was shocked into shame to discover
how i'm the 18th pale descendent
of some old queen or other
oh has the world changed, or have i changed?
oh has the world changed, or have i changed?
some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
i swear to god, i swear i never even knew what drugs were
(oh, oh-oh, oh)

so i broke into the palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said, "eh, i know you, and you cannot sing"
i said, "that's nothing, you should hear me play piano"
we can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
no-one talks about castration
(oh, oh-oh)

we can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty, oh, oh
(these are the things that kill me)
we can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair, oh
(these are the things that kill me)
all their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

past the pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
pass the pub that wrecks your body
and the church, all they want is your money
the queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb

life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely

a dreaded sunny day
so i meet you at the cemetry gates
keats and yeats are on your side
a dreaded sunny day
so i meet you at the cemetry gates
keats and yeats are on your side
while wilde is on mine

so we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people, all those lives, where are they now?
with-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
they were born, and then they lived, and then they died
seems so unfair, i want to cry
you say: "'ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but i've read well and i've heard them said
a hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

if you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs when you fall
who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall
you say: "'ere long done do does did"
words which could only be your own
and then produce the text from whence was ripped
some dizzy whore, 1804

a dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
and i meet you at the cemetry gates
oh, keats and yeats are on your side
a dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
and i meet you at the cemetry gates
keats and yeats are on your side, but you lose
'cause whale blubber wilde is on mine
sugar!

good times for a change
see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad
so please, please, please
let me, let me, let me
let me get what i want this time

haven't had a dream in a long time
see, the life i've had can make a good man bad
so, for once in my life, let me get what i want
lord knows it would be the first time
lord knows it would be the first time

in a river the color of lead
immerse the baby's head
wrap her up in the news of the world
dump her on a doorstep, girl
this night has opened my eyes
and i will never sleep again
you kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of twenty-five
oh, he said he'd cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will

oh, save your life
because you've only got one
the dream has gone
but the baby is real
oh, you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh, you did a bad thing
and i'm not happy
and i'm not sad

a shoeless child on a swing
reminds you of your own again
she took away your troubles
oh, but then again
she left pain

oh, please save your life
because you've only got one
the dream has gone
but the baby is real
oh, you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh, you did a bad thing
and i'm not happy
and i'm not sad

oh oh
oh
oh la la
and i'm not happy
and i'm not sad
oh oh
oh
oh la la
and i'm not happy
and i'm not sad

from the ice age to the dole age
there is but one concern
i have just discovered:

some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

as anthony said to cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
"oh i say"

some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

send me the pillow (pillow)
the one that you dream on
send me the pillow (pillow)
the one that you dream on
and i'll send you mine

panic on the streets of london
panic on the streets of birmingham
i wonder to myself...
could life ever be sane again?
the leeds side-streets that you slip down
i wonder to myself...

hopes may rise on the grasmere
but, honey pie, you're not safe here
so you run down to the safety of the town
but there's panic on the streets of carlisle
dublin, dundee, humberside
i wonder to myself...

burn down the disco
hang the blessed dj
because the music that they constantly play
it says nothing to me about my life
hang the blessed dj
because the music they constantly play

on the leeds side-streets that you slip down
provincial towns you jog 'round

hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj
hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj
hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj
hang the dj, hang the dj
hang the dj, hang the dj

frankly, mr. shankly, this position i've held
it pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
i want to leave, you will not miss me
i want to go down in musical history
frankly, mr. shankly, i'm a sickening wreck
i've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
i must move fast, you understand me
i want to go down in celluloid history, mr. shankly

fame, fame, fatal fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still i'd rather be famous
than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
but sometimes i'd feel more fulfilled
making christmas cards with the mentally ill
i want to live and i want to love
i want to catch something that i might be ashamed of

frankly, mr. shankly, this position i've held
it pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
oh, i didn't realise that you wrote poetry
i didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, mr. shankly
frankly, mr. shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain in the arse
i do not mean to be so rude
still, i must speak frankly, mr. shankly
oh, give us your money!

i dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but, "take me to the haven of your bed"
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees but so am i

oh, meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio

spending warm summer days indoors
writing frightening verse
to a buck-toothed girl in luxembourg

ask me, ask me, ask me
ask me, ask me, ask me
because if it's not love
then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together

nature is a language - can't you read?

i decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
england is mine, it owes me a living
but ask me why and i'll spit in your eye
oh ask me why and i'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to those dreams

does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
i dunno...

under the iron bridge we kissed
and although i ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am i still ill?
ohh...
oh, am i still ill?
ohh...

does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
i dunno...

ask me why and i'll die
oh ask me why and i'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if i were you i wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and i should know because i've seen them
but not very often

under the iron bridge we kissed
and although i ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am i still ill?
ohh...
oh, am i still ill?
ohh...

the boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire
for love

how can they look into my eyes
and still they don't believe me?
how can they hear me say those words
still they don't believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever, they ever believe me?
oh, ohh... ohhh... ohhhh

the boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire
for l-l-love

how can they see the love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us?
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they don't believe us now
will they ever believe us?
and when you want to live, how do you start?
where do you go? who do you need to know?
oh, ohh... ohhh... ohohohohoh

oh...
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
oh...
la lalala la da da...

all men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
for we have been through hell and high tide
i can surely rely on you
and yet you start to recoil
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

so, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but now you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight

the devil will find work for idle hands to do
i stole and i lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make me feel so ashamed
because i've only got two hands
but i'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

so, what difference does it make? (oooooh)
what difference does it make? (oooooh)
it makes none
but now you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
i stole, and then i lied
just because you asked me to
but now you know the truth about me
you won't see me anymore
well, i'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
but no more apologies
no more, no more apologies
oh, i'm too tired
i'm so sick and tired
and i'm feeling very sick and ill today
but i'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
oh, my sacred one...
oh...

hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different because it's us!
hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me

and if the people stare
then the people stare
oh, i really don't know
and i really don't care
kiss my shades...

hand in glove
the good people laugh
yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
but we've something they'll never have
hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
but we've something they'll never have

and if the people stare
then the people stare
oh, i really don't know
and i really don't care
kiss my shades...

so, hand in glove i stake my claim
i'll fight to the last breath
if they dare touch a hair on your head
i'll fight to the last breath
for the good life is out there somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
but i know my luck too well
yes, i know my luck too well
and i'll probably never see you again
i'll probably never see you again
i'll probably never see you again
oh
