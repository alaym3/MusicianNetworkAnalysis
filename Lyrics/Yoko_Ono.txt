kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
just one kiss, kiss will do
kiss, kiss kiss, kiss me love
just one kiss, kiss will do

why death
why life
warm hearts
cold darts

kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
i'm bleeding inside

it's a long, long story to tell
and i can only show you my hell

touch, touch, touch, touch me love
just one touch, touch will do
touch, touch, touch, touch me love
just one touch, touch will do
why me
why you
broken mirror
white terror

touch, touch, touch, touch me love
i'm shaking inside
it's that faint, faint sound of the childhood bell
ringing in my soul

kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
just one kiss, kiss will do 

oh, please don't give me that!
yes, i'm a witch
i'm a bitch
i don't care what you say
my voice is real
my voice speaks truth
i don't fit in your ways
i'm not gonna die for you
you might as well face the truth
i'm gonna stick around for quite awhile
we're gonna say
we're gonna try
we're gonna try it our way
we've been repressed
we've been depressed
suppression all the way
we're not gonna die for you
we're not seeking vengeance
but we're not gonna kill ourselves for your convenience
each time we don't say what we wanna say, we're dying
each time we close our minds to how we feel, we're dying
each time we gotta do what we wanna do, we're living
each time we're open to what we see and hear, we're living
we'll free you from the getthos of your minds
we'll free you from your fears and binds
we know you want things to stay as it is
it's gonna change, baby
it's gonna change, baby doll
it's gonna change, honey ball
it's gonna change, sugar cane
it's gonna change, sweetie legs
so don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us 

walking on thin ice
i'm paying the price
for throwing the dice in the air
why must we learn it the hard way
and play the game of life with your heart?

i gave you my knife
you gave me my life
like a gush of wind in my hair
why do we forget what's been said
and play the game of life with our hearts?
i may cry someday
but the tears will dry whichever way
and when our hearts return to ashes
it'll be just a story
it'll be just a story

ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai

ooh-ahooh

"i knew a girl who tried to walk across the lake
'course it was winter when all this was ice
that's a hell of a thing to do, you know
they say the lake is as big as the ocean
i wonder if she knew about it?"
 

you're a beautiful boy
with all your little toys
your eyes have seen the world
though you're only four years old
and your tears are streaming
even when you're smiling
please never be afraid to cry

you're a beautiful boy
with all your little ploys
your mind has changed the world
and you're now forty years old
you got all you can carry
and still somehow empty
don't ever be afraid to fly

all you beautiful boys
creating multiple plays
you like to fence in your world
and settle down when you're old
you can run from pole to pole

and never scratch your soul
don't be afraid to go to hell and back
don't be afraid to go to hell and back
don't be afraid to be afraid 

i see your face looking into the space
all tired and worried
why does it have to be like this, you and i
i wanted us to be happy
no one can see me like you do
no one can se you like i do
i see your face with a trace of life
being a wife and a woman
if i ever hurt you, please, remember
i wanted you to be happy
is there anything i want more
more than your trust and understanding?
no one can see me like you do
no one can se you like i do
i wanna quit moving
i wanna quit running
i wanna relax and be tender
i wanna see us together again
rocking away in our walnut chairs
even with your warmth and closeness
the feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse
no one can see me like you do
no one can se you like i do
even with our dreams and yearnings
the feeling of loneliness hangs over like a thirst
no one can see me like you do
no one can se you like i do
no one can see me like you do
no one can se you like i do 

we lost our green land
we lost our clean air
we lost our true wisdom
and we live in despair

oh sisters, oh sisters, lets stand up right now
it's never too late to start from the start
oh wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
and yes, my dear sisters, we must learn to ask

wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
that's what we live for now
oh wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
that's what we live for now

oh sisters, oh sisters, let's wake up right on
it's never too late to shout from our hearts
oh freedom, oh freedom that's what we fight for
and yes my dear sisters, we must learn to fight

oh freedom, oh freedom, that's what we ask for
that's what we live for now
oh freedom, oh freedom, that's what we ask for
that's what we live for now

oh sisters, oh sisters, let's give up no more
it's never too late to build a new world
oh new world, oh new world
that's what we live for
and yes, my dear sisters, we must learn to live

new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
that's what we all must all learn to build
oh new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
that's what we must now learn to build
new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
that's what we must now learn to be
oh new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
that's what we all must learn to be 

there may be not much difference
between chairman mao and richard nixon
we strip them naked

there may be not much difference
between marilyn monroe and lenny bruce
we check their coffins

there may be not much difference
between white house and hall of people
we count their windows

there may be not much difference
between raquel welch and jerry rubin
we hear their heartbeat

we're all water from different rivers
that's why it's so easy to meet
we're all water in this vast, vast ocean
someday we'll evaporate together
there may be not much difference
between eldridge cleaver and queen of england
we bottle their tears

there may be not much difference
between manson and the pope
we press their smile

there may be not much difference
between rockefeller and you
we hear you sing

there may not be much difference
between you and me
we show our dreams


hey! there's no difference!
what's the difference? what's the difference?
what? what?
there's no difference! there's no difference!
what's the difference? 

warzone, warzone

save your sweet talk for when you score
keep your monday kisses for your glass lady
i want the truth and nothing more

i'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony

you didn't have to tell a white lie
you know you scored me for life
don't stick your fingers in my pie
you know i'll see through your jive
i want the truth and nothing more


when you were angry you had love in your eyes
when you were sad you had a dream in your voice
but now your giving me your window smile
 

every man has a woman who loves him
in rain or shine or life or death
if he finds her in this lifetime
he will know when he presses his ear to her breast

why do i roam when i know you're the one?
why do i laugh when i feel like crying?

every woman has a man who loves her
rise or fall of her life and death
if she finds him in this lifetime
she will know when she looks into his eyes

why do i roam when i know you're the one?
why do i run when i feel like holding you?

every man has a woman who loves him
if he finds her in this lifetime
he will know 

all day long, i felt like
smashing my face in a clear glass window
but instead, i went out
and smashed up a phone box 'round the corner
i never had a chance to choose my own parents
i'd never know why i should be stuck with mine
mommy's always trying not to eat
and daddy's always smelling like he's pickled in booze
i never had a chance to choose my own name
i'd never know why i should be stuck with mine
mommy's always talkin' 'bout family pride
and daddy's always hiding 'bout his weekend rides
all day long, i felt like
smashing my neck in a clear glass window
but instead, i went out
and smashed up a station wagon 'round the block
i looked at the mirror and told myself
i'm glad i still don't look like them, at least
mommy's like a film star in a distorted mirror
daddy's like a guy who lost his stomach in the war
i went to shake hands with the president in miami
i went to a rock show to see mick jagger
and you'd never believe it, surprise of my life
they had paint on their faces, just like my mommy's
am i going crazy, or is it just you, daddy?
am i going nuts, or is it just you, mommy?
am i plain gone, or is it the world?
daddy, i'd rather have you dead than crazy
trying to talk to them is like eating tv dinner when you're angry
trying to get their love is like watching ice cream ad when you're hungry
they gave me a watch that's guaranteed not to break
but my mommy and daddy broke up last fall
am i going crazy, or is it just you, daddy?
am i going nuts, or is it just you, mommy?
am i plain gone, or is it the world?
mommy, i'd rather have you dead than crazy
all day long, i felt like
smashing my head in a clear glass window
but instead, i went out
and smashed up a churchyard 'round the corner 

two, one, two, three, four

people say i'm cool
yeah, i'm a cool chick, baby
every day i thank god
that i'm such a cool chick, baby

when i'm on the phone, i thank god
my voice sounds smooth and clear without a trace of tear
when i'm at work, i thank god
i still have that smile ma used to say lit her day

but something inside me, something inside me died that day

people say i'm cool
yeah, i'm a cool chick, baby
every day i thank god
that i'm such a cool chick, baby

when i'm with people, i thank god
i can talk hip when i'm crying inside
when i'm with friends, i thank god
i can light a cigarette when i'm choking inside
people say i'm cool
yeah, i'm a cool chick, baby
every day i thank god
that i'm such a cool chick, baby

a friend lent me shades
so i could hide my eyes that day
was a snowy day
the shades have seen a lot of things i didn't want to know myself

was like an accident, part of growing up
people tell me

but something inside me, something inside me died that day

what do you do-oo? what can you do?
what do you do-oo? what can you do? 

imagine there's no heaven
it's easy if you try
no hell below us
above us, only sky
imagine all the people
living for today
imagine there's no countries
it isn't hard to do
nothing to kill or die for
and no religion, too
imagine all the people
living life in peace
ooooh
you may say i'm a dreamer
i'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world
will live as one
imagine no possessions
i wonder if you can
no need for greed or hunger
a brotherhood of man
imagine all the people
sharing all the world
ooooh
you may say i'm a dreamer
i'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world
will be as one 

the food is cold
your eyes are cold
the window's cold
the bed is cold

give me something that's not cold
come on, come on
give me something that's not cold
come on, come on
give me something that's not cold
come on, come on

the chair is hard
your voice is hard
the money's hard
the living's hard

give me something that's not hard
come on, come on
give me something that's not hard
come on, come on
give me something that's not hard
come on, come on
give me, give me
and i'll give you a heartbeat
and a bit of tear and flesh
it's not very much but while it's there
you can have it, you can have it 

listen, the snow is falling o'er town
listen, the snow is falling ev'rywhere
between empire state building
and between trafalgar square
listen, the snow is falling o'er town
listen, the snow is falling o'er town
listen, the snow is falling ev'rywhere
between your bed and mine
between your head and my mind
listen, the snow is falling o'er town
between tokyo and paris
between london and dallas
between your love and mine
listen, the snow is falling ev'rywhere
snowdrift, snowfall, snow fluff
listen
listen
listen, baby
listen 

let me count the ways how i love you
it's like that gentle wind you feel at dawn
it's like that first sun that hits the dew
it's like that cloud with a gold lining telling us softly
that it'll be a good day, a good day for us
thank you, thank you, thank you
let me count the ways how i miss you
it's like that oak tree in my childhood garden
it's like that first summer i spent in egypt
it's like that warm evening you read to me
both knowing deeply that it's a good time, a good time for us
thank you, thank you, thank you
let me count the ways how i see you
it's like that lake in the mountain you heard about
it's like that autumn sky that stays so blue
it's like that air around me that holds me gently
whispering strongly that you're always there, always for me
thank you, thank you, thank you

i love you 

it's been very hard
but it's getting easier now
hard times are over, over for a while
the leaves are shining in the sun
and smiling inside
you and i watching each other on a street corner
cars and buses and planes and people go by

but we don't care
we want to know
we want to know in each other's eyes
that hard times are over, over for some time

hard times are over
hard times are over
hard times are over, over for a while

it's been very rough
but it's getting easier now
hard times are over, over for a while
the streams are twinkling in the sun
and i'm smiling inside
you and i walking together around the street corner
hard times are over
hard times are over
hard times are over, over for a while 

early in the morning i feel my pillow
i listen to the soundless phone
my thighs are sweaty, freezing inside
our beds empty as ever
what a bastard you are
leaving me all night missing you
slowly the door opens, you stand for a while
see if i'm asleep or just closing my eyes
i quickly get up and throw my pillows
throw an ashtray filled with butts
where were you all night, if i may ask you so?
though i don't care at all, i'd just like to know
right! you weren't near the phone to call me from
or is it you were afraid to wake me up?
i'm sick and tired of listening to the same old crap
you know half the world is occupied with you pigs
i can always get another pig like you
you've heard of female liberation, well that's for me
you'll see me walk out one day and then where will you be?
but don't you be too happy
i ain't walking out yet to give you satisfaction
i'm first gonna find something other than the walls
to have some human conversation
then i'll glow, ill be happy inside, my limbs will relax
and i can walk out into the world, singing with my people
but now i couldn't even move my muscles to go near the door
i've been sitting here too long and my legs are numb
are you listening, you jerk, you pig, you bastard
you scum of the earth, you good for nothing
are you listening?
oh, don't go, don't go
please, don't go
i didn't mean it, i'm just in pain
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
the door is closed, she's left alone
making herself a breakfast
her hands are shaking, her eyes looking out
watching the trees grow day by day
what a bastard the world is
taking my man away from me
taking the world away from me
female lib is nice for joan of arc
but its a long, long way for terry and jill
most of us were taught not to shout our will
few of us are encouraged to get a job for skill
and all of us live under the mercy of male society
thinking that their want is our need
