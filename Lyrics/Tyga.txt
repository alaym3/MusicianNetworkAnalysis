trying to forget someone that you love
like trying to remember someone that you never knew
think about it, i dream about it
my nightmares haunting me, i can’t sleep about it
anxiety, can’t breathe, can’t live without you
the revival, all these verses is my survival
standing at the podium, waiting on your arrival
one day but no return
like usher say, gotta let it burn

the hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
is waking up to see that person gone
you know it, it it takes seconds to say hello
but forever to say goodbye
moving on is easy, but what you leave behind
is what makes it hard…
