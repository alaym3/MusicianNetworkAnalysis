hey, where did we go?
days when the rains came
down in the hollow
playin' a new game
laughing and a running, hey, hey
skipping and a jumping
in the misty morning fog with
our hearts a thumpin' and you
my brown-eyed girl
you, my brown-eyed girl

whatever happened
to tuesday and so slow?
going down the old mine
with a transistor radio
standing in the sunlight laughing
hiding behind a rainbow's wall
slipping and sliding
all along the waterfall, with you
my brown-eyed girl
you, my brown-eyed girl

do you remember when we used to sing
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
just like that
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

so hard to find my way
now that i'm all on my own
i saw you just the other day
my, how you have grown
cast my memory back there, lord
sometimes i'm overcome thinking 'bout
making love in the green grass
behind the stadium with you
my brown-eyed girl
you, my brown-eyed girl

do you remember when we used to sing
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

we were born before the wind
also younger than the sun
ere the bonnie boat was won
as we sailed into the mystic

hark, now hear the sailors cry
smell the sea and feel the sky
let your soul and spirit fly
into the mystic

and when that foghorn blows
i will be coming home, mmhmm hmm
and when the foghorn blows
i want to hear it
i don't have to fear it

and i want to rock your gypsy soul
just like way back in the days of old
and magnificently we will float
into the mystic, mmm


when that foghorn blows
you know i will be coming home, mmm uh
and when that foghorn whistle blows
i gotta hear it
i don't have to fear it

and i wanna rock your gypsy soul
just like way back in the days of old
and together we will float
into the mystic, mmm

and i shall watch the ferry-boats, and they'll get high
on a bluer ocean against tomorrow's sky
and i will never grow so old again

in gardens all wet with rain

oh sweet thing
oh sugar-baby
oh sweet thing
sugar-baby, sugar-baby, sugar-baby
with your champagne eyes
and your saint-like smile

if i ventured in the slipstream
between the viaducts of your dream
where immobile steel rims crack
and the ditch in the back roads stop

could you find me?
would you kiss-a my eyes?
to lay me down
in silence easy
to be born again
to be born again

from the far side of the ocean
if i put the wheels in motion

would you kiss-a my eyes?
to lay me down
in silence easy
to be born again

talkin' to huddie ledbetter
showin' pictures on the wall
whisperin' in the hall
and pointin' a finger at me
there you go, there you go
standin' in the sun darlin'
with your arms behind you
and your eyes before

puttin' on his little red shoes
i see you know he's got clean clothes

trying to do my very best
lookin' straight at you

half a mile from the county fair
and the rain came pourin' down
me and billy standin' there
with a silver half a crown
hands are full of fishin' rods
and the tackle on our backs
we just stood there gettin' wet
with our backs against the fence

oh, the water
oh, the water
oh, the water
hope it don't rain all day

and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like jelly roll
and it stoned me
and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like going home
and it stoned me

and the rain let up
and the sun came up
and we were gettin' dry
almost let a pick-up truck
nearly pass us by
so we jumped right in
and the driver grinned
and he dropped us up the road
and we looked at the swim
and we jumped right in
not to mention fishing poles

oh, the water
oh, the water
oh, the water
let it run all over me

and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like jelly roll
and it stoned me
and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like going home
and it stoned me

2:12 - 2:53

on the way back home
we sang a song
but our throats were getting dry
then we saw the man
from across the road
with the sunshine in his eyes
well he lived all alone
in his own little home
with a great big gallon jar
there were bottles too
one for me and you
and he said "hey! there you are"

oh, the water
oh, the water
oh, the water
get it myself from the mountain stream

and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like jelly roll
and it stoned me
and it stoned me to my soul
stoned me just like going home
and it stoned me

well it stoned me to my soul
stoned on me just like jelly roll
and it stoned me
well it stoned me to my soul

down on cyprus avenue
with a childlike vision leaping into view
clicking, clacking of the high-heeled shoe
ford and fitzroy, madame george
marching with the soldier boy behind
he's much older now with hat on drinking wine
and that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through
the cool night air like shalimar
and outside they're making all the stops
the kids out in the street collecting bottle-tops
gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops
happy taken madame george
that's when you fall
whoa, that's when you fall
yeah, that's when you fall
when you fall into a trance
sitting on a sofa playing games of chance
with your folded arms and history books
you glance into the eyes of madame george
and you think you found the bag
you're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag
in the corner playing dominoes in drag
the one and only madame george
and then from outside the frosty window raps
she jumps up and says, lord, have mercy i think that it's the cops
and immediately drops everything she gots
down into the street below
and you know you gotta go
on that train from dublin up to sandy row
throwing pennies at the bridges down below
and the rain, hail, sleet, and snow
say goodbye to madame george
dry your eye for madame george
wonder why for madame george
and as you leave, the room is filled with music
laughing, music, dancing, music all around the room
and all the little boys come around, walking away from it all
so cold, and as you're about to leave
she jumps up and says, hey love, you forgot your gloves
and the loves to love to love the love
to say goodbye to madame george
dry your eye for madame george
wonder why for madame george
dry your eyes for madame george
say goodbye in the wind and the rain on the back street
in the backstreet, in the back street
say goodbye to madame george
in the backstreet, in the back street, in the back street
down home, down home in the back street
gotta go, say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
dry your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye
say goodbye to madame george
and the loves to love to love the love
say goodbye
say goodbye goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to madame george
dry your eye for madame george
wonder why for madame george
the love's to love, the love's to love, the love's to love
say goodbye, goodbye
get on the train

this is the train, this is the train
whoa, say goodbye, goodbye

little jimmy’s gone
away out of the back street out of the window
to the falling rain
right on time
right on time
that’s why broken arrow
waved his finger down the road so dark and narrow in the evening
just before the sunday six-bell chime
six bells chime
and all the dogs are barking
way on down the diamond-studded highway where you wander
and you roam from your retreating view
and way over on the railroad
tomorrow while the tipping trucks roll out all together
every scrapbook stuck with glue
and i’ll stand beside you
beside you
oh, child
to never never never wonder why at all
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
to never, never, wonder why at all
to never, never, never, wonder why
it’s gotta be, it has to be
way across the country where the hillside mountains glide
the dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander
past your window with the lantern lit
you held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze
said your time was open, go away along your merry way
past the brazen footlits of the silence easy
you breathe in, you breathe out
you breathe in, you breathe out
you breathe in, you breathe out
you breathe in, you breathe out
and you're high on your high-flying cloud
wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you
this time it's found you
you turn around
you turn around
you turn around
you turn around
and i'm beside you
beside you
oh darling
to never never wonder why at all
no, no, no, no, no
to never never never wonder why at all
to never never never wonder why it's got to be
it has to be
and i'm beside you
beside you
oh child
to never never wonder why at all
i'm beside you
beside you
beside you
beside you
ooooh, oooh
child

and i'm conquered in a car seat
not a thing that i can do

i may go crazy
before that mansion on the hill
i may go crazy
before that mansion on the hill
but my heart keeps beating faster
and my feet can't keep still
and all the little girls rhyme something
on the way back home from school
and all the little girls rhyme something
on the way back home from school
and the leaves fall one by one
and call the autumn time a fool
yeah, my t-tongue gets tied
every, every, every time i try to speak
my tongue gets tied
every time i try to speak
and my inside shakes just like a leaf on a tree
i think i'll go walking by the railroad with my cherry, cherry wine
i believe i'll go walking by the railroad with my cherry, cherry wine
if i pass the rumbling station where the lonesome engine drivers pine
wait a minute, yonder come my lady
rainbow ribbons in her hair

rainbow ribbons in her hair
six white horses and a carriage
she's returning from the fair
baby, baby, baby

up on cyprus avenue
and i'm conquered in a car seat
and i'm looking straight at you

the avenue of trees
keep walking down
in the wind and the rain, darling
you keep walking down when the sun shone through the trees
nobody, no, no, no, no, nobody stops me from loving you baby
so young and bold, fourteen-year old
baby, baby, baby

put it in a big brown bag for me
sail right around all the seven oceans
drop it straight into the deep blue sea

she's as sweet, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
just like honey, baby, from the bee

slim slow slider
horse you ride white as snow
slim slow slider
horse you ride is white as snow
tell it everywhere you go
saw you walking
down by the ladbroke grove this morning
saw you walking
down by the ladbroke grove this morning
catching pebbles for some sandy beach
you're out of reach
saw you early this morning
with your brand new boy and your cadillac
saw you early this morning
with your brand new boy and your cadillac
you're gone for something
and i know you won't be back
i know you're dying, baby
and i know you know it too
i know you're dying
and i know you know it too
every time i see you
i just don't know what to do

as you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
and you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
and you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
all the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever

and everything looks so complete
when you're walkin' out on the street
and the wind catches your feet
sends you flyin', cryin'
ooo-woo-wee, wild night is calling
ooo-ooh-wee, wild night is calling

all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
and the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
and the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
and the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder

and everything looks so complete
when you're walkin' out on the street
and the wind catches your feet
sends you flyin', cryin'
ooo-woo-wee, wild night is calling
ooo-ooh-wee, wild night is calling
the wild night is calling
the wild night is calling
