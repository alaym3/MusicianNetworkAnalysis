just a glance from behind
happened by chance or design
the perfume she wore
took me back through a door
i had closed long ago
suddenly
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember what we knew
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember when i thought it was you
we were young love was new
warm as the sun shining through
in your arms it seemed
i went back to a dream
i had seen long ago
suddenly
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember what we knew
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember when i thought it was you



don't stop it
rock it
don't stop it



looking at you sitting there
your mind a million miles away
might as well be talking to the walls
maybe they'll hear, what i've got to say

it's the same old story
about somebody with a dream
looking for the glory
no matter how far the future seems

you've got stars in your eyes
there's a whole world out there for you
you've got stars in your eyes
but it ain't gonna do
you've got stars in your eyes
there's a whole world out there for you
yeah, babe... yeah, babe

so much inside, you can't hold it all there
you've got to express your feelings
maybe one day the whole world will know
put a sail on your dreams and go sailing

it's the same old story
about somebody with a dream
looking for the glory
no matter how far the future seems

you've got stars in your eyes
there's a whole world out there for you
you've got stars in your eyes
lord, what are you gonna do, what are you gonna do
you've got stars in your eyes
there's a whole world out there for you
ooh yeah

stars...
oh, can't you see, yeah
that you're so much a part of me
i could never ever lead you wrong
with my arms wide open
i wanna, i wanna, i wanna make you strong
baby, i'll give you all i've got to give
and if you'll just open up your heart, and live

you've got stars in your eyes
there's a whole world out there for you
you've got stars in your eyes
what are you gonna do
you've got stars in your eyes
and the whole world is waiting for you

stars... love...
stars in your eyes
stars... at night
stars in your eyes
stars... in your eyes
stars in your eyes

tears at night 'cause you're scared
little girl all afraid
stuck between night and day
baby fell down, lost her way

but now we're here all alone
look and see
oh, running to me
just come running to me

running to me
baby, come running to me
running to me
come running
running to me

without the songs, you never heard of love
without the books, you never learned enough

just come running to me
just come running to me

just come running to me

(i'll be there with you, baby, i'm yours, i'm yours)

without the songs, you never heard of love
without the books, you never learned enough

exactly how you hear it, is exactly how it all went down
it was later in the evening
that the facts and the figures got turned around
true, there was a woman
yes, she did advance my way
and i can't be sure exactly
but i swear i saw her say my name

it was the right time
she was the real thing
i had to walk away

(see) don't wanna be, stitched up out of my mind
feeling strung out, laggin' behind
all trapped in, can't do a thing because i'm
locked down
stitched up, feeling the burn
all strung out, i finally learn that
trapped in, can't do a thing because i'm
locked down

i wonder where she came from
i wonder where she's gotta go
who's to say she's single
and who's to say she's on her own
girls like that don't sleep alone
(alright here's the thing, here's the thing)
that girl is flawless
and i know i'm not the first one to think that
and since i'm not the first, i sure won't be the last
i'd spend my whole life looking behind my back
i just don't think i'm up to that

stitched up, out of my mind
feeling strung out, laggin' behind
all trapped in, can't do a thing because i'm
locked down
stitched up, feeling the burn
all strung out, i finally learn that
trapped in you can't do a thing because you're
locked down


stitched up, out of my mind
feeling strung out, laggin' behind
all trapped in, i can't do a thing because i'm
locked down
stitched up, feeling the burn
all strung out, i finally learn that
trapped in you can't do a thing because you're
locked down
locked down

stitch me up, string me out
trap me in, lock me down
stitch me up, string me out
trap me in, lock me down (i don't wanna be)
stitch me up, string me out
trap me in, lock me down
stitch me up, string me out
trap me in, lock me down
because i'm down and down and down, ooh

in this proud land, we grew up strong
we were wanted all along
i was taught to fight, taught to win
i never thought i could fail
no fight left or so it seems
i am a man whose dreams have all deserted
i've changed my face, i've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose

don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not beaten yet
don't give up
i know you can make it good

though i saw it all around
never thought i could be affected
thought that we'd be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn
drove the night toward my home
the place that i was born, on the lakeside
as daylight broke, i saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground

don't give up
you still have us
don't give up
we don't need much of anything, no
don't give up
'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong


rest your head
you worry too much
it's gonna be alright
when times get rough
you can fall back on us
don't give up
oh, please, please, don't give up
got to walk out of here
i can't take anymore
gonna stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing
ooh, that river's flowing

moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job, so many men
so many men no one needs

don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not the only one
don't give up
no reason to be ashamed
don't give up
you still have us
(mmm, don't give up)
don't give up now
we're proud of who you are
don't give up
you know it's never been easy
don't give up
no matter what you do
don't give up
'cause i believe there's a place
there's a place where we belong

don't give up



when we walk, side by side, like brothers
oh, glory will stand up and whirl
then gabriel will blow as he never has blown before
there'll be fair weather
together
side by side
it will know, that hate will die, and love will win
so go forth, heroes!
peace on earth, and good will to all
who make it divine and so real
plant seeds for good deeds, like the trees and of course, love will grow!
money doesn’t fit into the scheme of things
so how can a house be built on angel wings?
fair weather
together
fair weather my friend
when we walk, side by side, like brothers
oh glory will stand up and whirl
then gabriel will blow as he never has blown before
there'll be fair weather
together
fair weather my friend



once i was traveling across the sky
this lovely planet caught my eye
and being curious i flew close by
and now i'm caught here until i die

until we die, until we die
learning to live together
learning to live together
learning to live together
'til we die

i lost my memory of where i've been
we all forgot we could fly
someday we'll all turn it to peaceful — man, it'd be amazing
and we'll return into the sky

until we die
until we die
learning to live together
learning to live together
learning to live together
'til we die

imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
no hell below us, above us only sky
imagine all the people living for today
imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
nothing to kill or die for and no religion too
imagine all the people living life in peace

you may say i'm a dreamer
but i'm not the only one
i hope some day you will join us
and the world will be as one



imagine no possessions, i wonder if you can
no need for greed or hunger; a brotherhood of man
imagine all the people sharing all the world

you may say i'm a dreamer
but i'm not the only one
i hope some day you will join us
and the world will live as one



you're so afraid our love won't last
living in the past
pretending you don't see
you're walking with those eyes of fear
through walls that aren't there
open up to me
trust me
never be afraid
i've never fooled you with those words
that hungry girls have heard
whispered in the dark
i've never played love like a game
or put you through the pain
of hiding from your heart
trust me
never be afraid, baby
trust me
open
up
your
heart
trust me
never be afraid
you're always looking for the lie
of foul play in my eyes
trying to play it smart
how can i show you how i feel
when you say nothing's real
and take my words apart
trust me
never be afraid, baby
trust me
open
up
your
heart
open up your heart

i was a sailor, i was lost at sea
under the waves before love rescued me
i was a fighter, i could turn on a thread
now i stand accused of the things i've said

when love comes to town i'm gonna jump that train
when love comes to town i'm gonna catch that flame
maybe i was wrong to ever let you down
but i did what i did before love came to town

used to find love under a red sunset
i was making promises i was soon to forget
i was as pale as the lace of my wedding gown
but i left him standing before love came to town

i ran into a juke joint when i heard the guitar scream
the notes were turning blue, i was dazing in a dream
as the music played i saw my life turn around
that was the day before love came to town

when love comes to town i'm gonna jump that train
when love comes to town i'm gonna catch that flame
well, maybe i was wrong to ever let you down
but i did what i did before love came to town


(ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

i was there when they crucified my lord, ooh
i held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
i threw the dice when they pierced his side
but i've seen love conquer the great divide

when love comes to town (baby, when love comes to town)
i'm gonna (baby, when love, baby) catch that train
when love comes to town (comes to town, baby)
i'm gonna catch that flame (catch it, baby)
maybe i was wrong (maybe you were wrong)
to ever let you down
but i did what i did (but i did what i did, baby)
before love came to town

yeah, before love came to town
ooh, ooh, yeah
love came
ooh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh
when love comes to town
when love comes to town
when love
when love comes to town
when love, baby
when love comes to town
gonna, gonna catch that plane, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
when love comes to town
ooh, hoo, oh
when love comes to town
ooh, hoo, oh
yeah, when love comes to town
uh-huh, uh-huh
when love, when love, when love, when love comes to town
oh, oh-oh, oh

ah, bem melhor seria
poder viver em paz
sem ter que sofrer
sem ter que chorar
sem ter que querer
sem ter que se dar
ah, bem melhor seria
poder viver em paz
sem ter que sofrer
sem ter que chorar
e ter que querer
sem ter que se dar
mas tem que sofrer
mas tem que chorar
e tem que querer
pra poder amar
ah, mundo enganador
paz não quer mais dizer amor
ah, não existe coisa mais triste que ter paz
e se arrepender e se conformar
e se proteger de um amor a mais
o tempo de amor
é tempo de dor
o tempo de paz
não faz nem desfaz
ah, que não seja o meu
o mundo onde o amor morreu
ah, não existe coisa mais triste que ter paz
e se arrepender e se conformar
e se proteger de um amor a mais
mas tem que sofrer
mas tem que chorar
e tem que querer
pra poder amar
ah, mundo enganador
paz não quer mais dizer amor
ah, não existe coisa mais triste que ter paz
e se arrepender e se conformar
e se proteger de um amor a mais
