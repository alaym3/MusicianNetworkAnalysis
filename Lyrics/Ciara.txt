50 cent
ciara
i'm focused, man (darkchild)
you should know this, man

just one dose of me will have you addicted
to know me is to love me; i handle my business
any city any town - touch down; i do my thing
i'm a hustler, baby, i provide by any means
i'm a great conversationist, you should know what i'm about
when you look at me baby you should see a way out
out the hood, out the drama, out the bentley that's on
out the headache an stress you done been through before

it's only been three months and i already got it bad
so hood that i keep on coming back
my girlfriend's telling me i don't know how to act
but i'm telling them, "baby, bye, fall back"
he's so good and he knows how to love me
but so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
he's my dude and you better get used to things
and i don't care what you say about me
they say

that he does it with the best, runs it in the west
tatted on his chest (uh-huh)
i like it (so what?), i like it
and they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause i am what he wants his girl and i love it

i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone
i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone

so when i had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
tried to be hard, but that he could never be
always tell me that no one could compare to me
but couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
from the a to hill up in beverly
he's so fly that he knows how to carry me
first class when they talk, we don't hear what they say

that he does it with the best, runs it in the west
tatted on his chest (uh-huh)
i like it (so what?), i like it
and they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause i am what he wants his girl and i love it

i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone
i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone

the more i get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more
i'll move an eighth for that girl; i'll move a half for that boy
then i flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
your friends try to confuse but you know what
my intentions are good, i can't help it i'm hood
i wouldn't change if i could, you shouldn't tell me i should
baby, you should take me as i am
an be happy you're my girl 'cause i'm happy i'm your man

if he gets caught, it just takes one call
i'll come running
boy, i promise i will be there for you
all my heart, it belongs to you
i can't lose you, boy, i just can't leave you alone

i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone
i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone
i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone
i can't leave 'em alone
i tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
it's just that he know what i want
so bad, i love that, i can't leave 'em alone

hey, hey, i got you
hey, hey, i got you

it all can push you over the edge sometimes
make you wanna jump off the ledge sometimes
make you wanna stand up and scream
make you feel like there is no one listening
this world can put a hole in your soul sometimes
put you at the end of your road
sometimes you just break down
when this world tries to end you, i defend you

i got your back, i got you
i take your side, i lay my life down for you
i'll crawl over broken glass, i will stand in the flame
take the bullet, take the blows, i would take all the pain

i could not foresee this thing happening to you
if i look hard enough into the setting sun
my love will laugh with me before the morning comes
