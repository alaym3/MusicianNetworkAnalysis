now the king told the boogie men
you have to let that raga drop
the oil down the desert way
has been shaken to the top
the sheikh he drove his cadillac
he went a' cruisin' down the ville
the muezzin was a'standing
on the radiator grille

shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah
shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah

by order of the prophet
we ban that boogie sound
degenerate the faithful
with that crazy casbah sound
but the bedouin they brought out
the electric kettle drum
the local guitar picker
got his guitar pickin' thumb
as soon as the shareef
cleared the square
they began to wail

shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah
shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah

now over at the temple
oh! they really pack 'em in
the in crowd say it's cool
to dig this chanting thing
but as the wind changed direction
and the temple band took five
the crowd caught a whiff
of that crazy casbah jive

shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah
shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah

the king called up his jet fighters
he said "you better earn your pay
drop your bombs between the minarets
down the casbah way"
as soon as the shareef was
chauffeured outta there
the jet pilots tuned to
the cockpit radio blare
as soon as the shareef was
out of their hair
the jet pilots wailed

shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah
shareef don't like it
rockin' the casbah, rock the casbah

(shareef don't like it)
thinks it’s not kosher
(rockin' the casbah
rock the casbah)
(shareef don't like it)
fundamentally can’t take it
(rockin' the casbah
rock the casbah)
(shareef don't like it)
you know he really hates it
(rockin' the casbah
rock the casbah)
(shareef don't like it)
really, really hates it

london calling to the faraway towns
now war is declared and battle come down
london calling to the underworld
come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls
london calling, now don't look to us
phony beatlemania has bitten the dust
london calling, see we ain't got no swing
'cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

the ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
engines stop running, but i have no fear
cause london is drownin', i, live by the river

(london calling) to the imitation zone
forget it, brother, you can go it alone
london calling to the zombies of death
quit holdin' out and draw another breath
london calling and i don't want to shout
but while we were talking i saw you noddin' out
london calling, see we ain't got no hyde
'cept for that one with the yellowy eyes

the ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
a nuclear error, but i have no fear
cause london is drowning, i, i live by the river


the ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in

and ya' know what they said? well, some of it was true!
(london calling) at the top of the dial
and after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(london calling)

i never felt so much alike alike alike...

spanish songs in andalucía
the shooting site in the days of '39
oh, please, leave the ventana open
federico lorca is dead and gone
bullet holes in the cemetery walls
the black cars of the guardia civil
spanish bombs on the costa rica
i'm flyin' in on a dc 10 tonight

spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

spanish weeks in my disco casino
the freedom fighters died upon the hill
they sang the red flag, they wore the black one
after they died it was mockingbird hill
back home the buses went up in flashes
the irish tomb was drenched in blood
spanish bombs shatter the hotels
my señorita's rose was nipped in the bud

spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

the hillsides ring with "free the people"
or can i hear the echo from the days of '39?
with trenches full of poets, the ragged army
fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
spanish bombs rock the province
i'm hearin' music from another time
spanish bombs on the costa brava
i'm flyin' in on a dc 10 tonight

spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh mi corazón
spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón

oh, mi corazón

hey, paul

when they kick at your front door
how you gonna come?
with your hands on your head
or on the trigger of your gun?
when the law break in
how you gonna go?
shot down on the pavement
or waiting in death row?

you can crush us
you can bruise us
but you'll have to answer to
oh, the guns of brixton

the money feels good
and your life you like it well
but surely your time will come
as in heaven, as in hell


you see, he feels like ivan
born under the brixton sun
his game is called survivin'
at the end of the harder they come
you know it means no mercy
they caught him with a gun
no need for the black maria
goodbye to the brixton sun

you can crush us
you can bruise us
but you'll have to answer to
oh, the guns of brixton

when they kick at your front door
how you gonna come?
with your hands on your head
or on the trigger of your gun?

you can crush us
you can bruise us
you can even shoot us
but, oh the guns of brixton

shot down on the pavement
waiting in death row
his game was survivin'
as in heaven, as in hell

you can crush us
you can bruise us
but you'll have to answer to
oh, the guns of brixton
oh, guns of brixton
oh, guns of brixton
oh, guns of brixton
oh, guns of brixton

i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality

i wasn't born, so much as i fell out
nobody seemed to notice me
we had a hedge back home in the suburbs
over which i never could see
i heard the people who live on the ceiling
scream and fight, most scarily
hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
that's how it's been, all around me

i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality

i'm all tuned in, i see all the programs
i save coupons from packets of tea
i've got my giant hit, discotheque album
i empty a bottle, i feel a bit free
the kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
making noises for company
long distance callers make long distance calls
and the silence makes me lonely

i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality

and it's not here
it disappeared

i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality
i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality
i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer
guaranteed personality
i'm all lost in the supermarket
i can no longer shop happily
i came in here for the special offer

i'm all lost in the supermarket

(the kingdom is ransacked
the jewels all taken back
and the chopper descends
they're hidden in the back
with a message on a half-baked tape
and the spool goes 'round
sayin' i'm back here in this place
and i could cry
and there's smoke you could click on)

takin' off his turban, they said, "is this man a jew?"
workin' for the clampdown
they put up a poster sayin' "we earn more than you!"

we will train our blue-eyed men
to be young believers

the judge said "five to ten" but i say "double that again"

how can you refuse it?
let fury have the hour, anger can be power
d'you know that you can use it?

the voices in your head are callin'
stop wasting your time, there's nothing comin'
only a fool would think someone could save you
the men at the factory are old and cunning
you don't owe nothin', so boy get running
it's the best years of your life they want to steal

but, you grow up and you calm down
and you're (workin' for the clampdown)
you start wearin' blue and brown
and (workin' for the clampdown)
so you got someone to boss around
it makes ya' feel big now
you drift until you brutalize
make your first kill now

in these days of evil presidentes
(workin' for the clampdown)
but lately one or two has fully paid their dues

who's barmy now?

you say you stand by your man
so tell me something i don't understand
you said you love me and that's a fact
and then you left me, said you felt trapped
well, some things you can explain away
but the heartache's in me 'til this day

you didn't stand by me
no, not at all
you didn't stand by me
no way

all the times when we were close
i'll remember these things the most
i see all my dreams come tumblin' down
i can't be happy without you around
so alone i keep the wolves at bay
and there's only one thing i can say

you didn't stand by me
no, not at all
you didn't stand by me
no way

you must explain
why this must be
did you lie
when you spoke to me?
did you stand by me?
no, not at all

now i got a job, but it don't pay
i need new clothes, i need somewhere to stay
but without all of these things i can do
but without your love, i won't make it through
but you don't understand my point of view
i suppose there's nothing i can do

you didn't stand by me
no, not at all
you didn't stand by me
no way

you must explain
why this must be
did you lie
when you spoke to me?
did you stand by me?

did you stand by me?
no, not at all
did you stand by me?
no way
did you stand by me?
no, not at all
did you stand by me?
no way

charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
charlie don't surf for his hamburger momma
charlie's going to be a napalm star
everybody wants to rule the world
it must be something we get from birth
one truth is we never learn
satellites will make space burn
we've been told to keep the strangers out
we don't like them starting to hang around
we don't like them all over town
across the world we are going to blow them down

charlie don't surf and we think he should
charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
charlie don't surf for his hamburger momma
charlie's going to be a napalm star
the reign of the super powers must be over
so many armies can't free the earth
soon the rock will roll over
africa is choking on their coca cola
it's a one a way street in a one horse town
one way people starting to brag around
you can laugh, put them down
these one way people going to blow us down

ken boothe for uk pop reggae
with backin' bands sound systems
if they got anything to say
there's many black ears here to listen

but it was four tops all night with encores from stage right
charging from the bass knives to the treble
but onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel

(dress back, jump back, this is a bluebeat attack)

foolin' with the guns
the british army is waitin' out there

and ask him for some wealth distribution?

punk rocker in the uk

hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

death or glory becomes just another story
death or glory becomes just another story

in every gimmick hungry yob diggin' gold from rock 'n' roll
grabs the mic and tell us he'll die before he's sold
but i believe in this and it's been tested by research
he who fucks nuns will later join the church

death or glory becomes just another story
death or glory becomes just another story

fear in the gun sights
they say "lie low"
you say "ok"
don't wanna play a show
no other thinking
was it death or glory now?
playin' the blues of kings
sure looks better now

death or glory, just another story
death or glory, just another story

in every dingy basement on every dingy street
every draggin' handclap over every draggin' beat
that's just the beat of time, beat that must go on
if you've been tryin' for years we already heard your song

death or glory becomes just another story
death or glory, just another story

gotta march a long way
fight a long time
get to travel over mountains
got to travel over seas
we gonna fight you, brother
we gonna fight 'til you lose
we gonna raise trouble
we gonna raise hell
we gonna fight you, brother
raise hell

death or glory becomes just another story

in such a small, small game
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat the tryin' man
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat the tryin' man

billy boy has been shot
and stagger lee's come out on top
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat the tryin' man
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat stagger man
you'd better stop (you better stop)
hey! it is the wrong 'em boyo, hey

(don't ya' know it is wrong?) well, play it, billy, play
an' you will find
it is the right 'em boyo

but if you must lie and deceit
and trample people under your feet
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat the tryin' man
(don't ya' know it is wrong?) to cheat a tryin' man
you better stop
it is the wrong 'em boyo

it is the wrong 'em boyo
it is the wrong 'em boyo
it is the wrong 'em
it is the wrong 'em boyo
it is the wrong 'em boyo

well, i got a friend who's a man (who's a man)
what man? the man who keeps me from the lonely
the only
he gives me what i need (what you need?)
what you got? i need it all so badly

oh, anything i want, he gives it to me
anything i want, he gives it, but not for free
it's hateful
and it's paid for
and i'm so grateful to be nowhere

this year i've lost some friends (some friends)
what friends? i dunno, i didn't even notice
you see, i gotta go out again (again)
my friend, i gotta see that main man
hey

oh, anything i want he gives it to me
anything i want, he gives it, but not for free
it's hateful
and it's paid for
and i'm so grateful to be nowhere

oh, anything i want he gives it to me
anything i want, he gives it, but not for free
it's hateful
and it's paid for
and i'm so grateful to be nowhere

i killed all my nerves (my nerves)
what swerves? i can't drive so steady
and already
i've lost my memory (my mind)
behind, i can't see so clearly

oh, anything i want, he gives it to me
anything i want, he gives it, but not for free
oh, anything i want he gives it to me (anything i want)
anything i want he gives it, but not for free (anything i want)
anything i want, anything i want

this is a public service announcement... with guitar!

know your rights
all three of 'em

number one
you have the right not to be killed
murder is a crime
unless it was done
by a policeman
or an aristocrat

oh, know your rights

and number two
you have the right to food money
providing of course you
don't mind a little
investigation, humiliation
and if you cross your fingers
rehabilitation

know your rights
these are your rights!
hey, say, wang

oh, know these rights

number three
you have the right to free speech
as long as you're not
dumb enough to actually try it

know your rights
these are your rights
oh, know your rights
these are your rights
all three of 'em, ha

and it has been suggested
in some quarters that this is not enough
well, get off the streets
get off the streets!
