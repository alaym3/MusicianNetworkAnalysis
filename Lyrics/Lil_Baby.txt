they want to see those officers arrested
officers arrested

i went to court and they sent me to prison
my mama was crushed when they said i can't leave
first i was drunk, then i sobered up quick
when i heard all that time that they gave to taleeb
he got a life sentence plus
we just some products of our environment
how the fuck they gon' blame us?
you can't fight fire with fire
i know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
i be judging by the mind and heart, i ain't really into faces
fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
crazy, i had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
stare in the mirror whenever you drive
overprotective, go crazy for mine
you gotta pay attention to the signs
seem like the blind following the blind
thinking 'bout everything that's going on
i boost security up at my home
i'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
i call him now, he'll pick up the phone
and it's five in the morning, he waking up on it

you know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
you gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
i want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
i want all my daughters to show out in public
seems like we losing our country
but we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to

people speaking for the people, i'm proud of them
stick together, we can get it up out of them
i can't lie like i don't rap about killing and dope, but i'm telling my youngins to vote
i did what i did 'cause i didn't have no choice or no hope, i was forced to just jump in and go

these scars too deep to heal us
what happened to covid? nobody remember
it ain't makin' sense, i'm just here to vent
it happen to one of your people, it's different
we get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
knowledge is power, i swear i'm a witness, i know that i'm gifted
i won't go too deep 'cause i'm scared they'll get me
ain't scared to admit it, some shit i can't mention
it's people who can, well, here's the chance
i won't take the stand, but i'll take a stand for what i believe
must not be breathing the air that i breathe
you know that the way that i bleed, you can bleed
i never been a fan of police
but my neighborhood know i try to keep peace
so it's only right that i get in the streets
march for a reason, not just on gp
our people died for us to be free
fuck do you mean? this was a dream
now we got the power that we need to have
they don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
