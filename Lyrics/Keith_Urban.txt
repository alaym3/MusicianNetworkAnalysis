you said "i love you" to me
and i don't know what that means
so i froze on my feet
people use it so carelessly
and i couldn’t believe
that you would dive in so deep
and you said perfectly
everything i’ve been feelin' about you
it’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

so come on and
take a little bit of my
heart tonight
no, i literally don't mind
just please don't misplace it
take a little bit of my
heart tonight
no, baby be mine now
baby, be mine now
maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

well i was never the type
to put it all on the line
but i've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
it was the way that the light
picked you out of that night
then you were right by my side
put a soul in my body
and now it’s time to close the space between the two of us
so come on and
take a little bit of my
heart tonight
no, i literally don't mind
just please don't misplace it
take a little bit of my
heart tonight
no, baby be mine now
baby, be mine now
maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

heart tonight

heart tonight

maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
and put our hearts in a parallel line
and put our hearts in a parallel line 

there'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
you pray more than you breathe
and you just wanna fall to pieces
and nights, those 2 am calls
where dreams become walls
and you just need a break
break on me

shatter like glass
come apart in my hands
take as long as it takes, girl
break on me
put your head on my chest
let me help you forget
when your heart needs to break
just break on me

there'll be times when someone you know
becomes someone you knew
but you'd do anything to change it
and words you wanna take back
but you know you can't
when the page just won't turn
and it still hurts
break on me
shatter like glass
come apart in my hands
take as long as it takes, girl
break on me
put your head on my chest
let me help you forget
when your heart needs to break
just break on me
(ooo oo aah aah, ooo oo aaah aah ooo ooo aaah aaah)

break on me
put your head on my chest
let me help you forget
when your heart needs to break
just break on me
break on me
break on me, baby

strong on her strong opinions

she's spinning around the room
when she's spinning around the room
she got the stars comin' out of her eyes
got everybody staring, like they're caught in the headlights
a little bit left, a little bit right
she'll wake you to make love in the middle of the night
and every breath that i take is brand new
i'm a man brought back to life
castor and pollux sent you to save me
i've returned to my gemini
ooh
she's in my heart now, in my heart now
spinning around the room
hey, hey, hey

there's a new wind blowing like i've never known
i'm breathing deeper than i've ever done
and it sure feels good, to finally feel the way i do

and i wanna love somebody
love somebody like you

and i'm letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
i've forgiven myself for the mistakes i've made
now there's just one thing
the only thing i wanna do, mmhm

i wanna love somebody
love somebody like you

yeah, i wanna feel the sunshine
shining down on me and you
when you put your arms around me
you let me know there's nothing in this world i can't do

i used to run in circles going nowhere fast
i'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back
couldn't walk a straight line even if i wanted to
i wanna love somebody
love somebody like you
whoa! here we go now!
hey, i wanna love ya baby

yeah, i wanna feel the sunshine
shinin' down on me and you
when you put your arms around me
well, baby there ain't nothing in this world i can't do

shining like its true
i wanna be the man that you run to whenever i call on you
when everything that loved someone finally found its way
wanna be a better man
i see it in you yeah
hey, i wanna be that 

i woke up early this morning around 4am
with the moon shining bright
as headlights on the interstate
i pulled the covers over my head
and tried to catch some sleep
but thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
i've been trying my best to get along
but that's ok
there's nothing left to say, but

take your records, take your freedom
take your memories, i don't need them
take your space and take your reasons
but you'll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact i'll feel a whole lot better
but you'll think of me, you'll think of me

i went out driving trying to clear my head
i tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
i guess i'm feeling just a little tired of this
and all the baggage that seems to still exist
it seems the only blessing i have left to my name
is not knowing what we could have been
what we should have been
so
take your records, take your freedom
take your memories, i don't need them
take your space and take your reasons
but you'll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact i'll feel a whole lot better
but you'll think of me

someday i'm going to run across your mind
don't worry, i'll be fine
i'm going to be alright
while you're sleeping with your pride
wishing i could hold you tight
i'll be over you
and on with my life

so take your records, take your freedom
take your memories, i don't need them
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact i'll feel a whole lot better
but you'll think of me
take your records, take your freedom
take your memories, i don't need them
take your space and all your reasons
but you'll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
because we have nothing left to weather
in fact i'll feel a whole lot better
but you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh
and you're going to think of me
oh yeah
ooh someday baby, someday
oooh ooh ooh oh
think of me
ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby 

i can feel it coming on now
as the music plays
taking shots with the night owls
as the world just fades away
got a paycheck in my pocket
'bout to get it all gone
light it up like a rocket
we're going all night long

everybody sing ooh, mmm
i love it when you ooh

when the sun goes down, stars come out

tear the top right off the ceiling
and i swear we're never, ever coming down
never coming down

oh, oh, ooh yeah
tell me now, can you feel it?
oh, oh
never, ever, never coming down
well, the band's on fire
and the beer is ice cold
we're going down to the wire
then we'll all go rolling home
and maybe we'll keep it going
'til we see that sun
coming up right here, right now
i wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud
ooh

when the sun goes down, stars come out
it's a, can you feel it?
when i take you by the hand, dancin’

the rain is coming down tonight
i'm smiling, looking at this photograph
i hear that song and i'm flying right back to when we had it made
every friday night when the sun went down
we'd be running them streets like we owned the town

and i just can't let it go, no, i just can't let it go
i wonder if you ever think about it like i do
seven kids on a two lane road
had the guns on the radio
after all this time it still feels so good

when i think about those summer nights
singin' out the window, on the back roads, sweet child of mine
sippin' on the loko's, spark, and light
ain't it funny how the best days of my life
was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

out of nowhere, it slipped away
and the rope by the river hangs silently
and the town that i knew ain't nothing like it used to be
ah, i can't explain
they took all the color from the picture frame
and the days got sold to the grit and the game
and i just can't let it go, no, i just can't let it go
i wonder if you ever think about it like i do
seven kids on my two lane road
we had the guns on the radio
after all this time it still feels, feels so good

when i think about those summer nights
singin' out the window, on the back roads, sweet child of mine
sippin' on the loko's, spark a light
ain't it funny how the best days of my life
was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
swinging on the line
living all that wasted time

hey, hey, now
summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
only music that we had was out the left speaker
we were living every second 'til the time ran out
we had nothing but we had it all

when i think about those summer nights
sneaking out the window, running back roads
your hand in mine
we were going nowhere, we were so alive
uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
we were swinging out on the line
living all that wasted time
hey, you know oh
all that wasted time
don't you feel it coming on back now
time, time, time 

i roll with the punches
i go with the flow
i used to fight against the tide
but i learned my lesson and now i know
that there's a better way to live this life
you've got to find your song and just sing it
and there's a better way to feel alright
let it all go and let love take control

i just ride
on a wave so free, just you and me
coming alive
it feels so good just watching the world going by
doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
mmm, every day
why would i wanna live any other way
than riding my wave? yeah

we all got problems
i've had my share of pain
i got scars in places that you can't even see, baby
but it made me who i am today
so when it rains, when there's a hurricane
you got to find your wave and just surf it
put some love in the world, find a boy or a girl
to heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it
so ride
on a wave so free, just you and me
coming alive
it feels so good just watching the world going by
doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
mmm, every day
why would i wanna live any other way
than riding my wave? yeah

you gotta watch out for the shine blockers
me, i'm just a time stopper
we gon' get there when we get there lil’ mama
we gotta depend on the waaaaaave
leanin' and dreamin'
pullin' up on the scene and we sting 'em
focused and floatin', we drinkin' and singin'

been a long time coming, but it's all (it's all good baby)
for the better (oh yeah)
what we can't do alone, we can all do together

let's ride
oh, oh
we're coming alive
it feels so good just watching the world going by
doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
yeah, every day
now why would i wanna live any other way?
ride
everyday, everyday
by
oh, everyday, everyday
ride
oh, oh, oh, i feel it baby, woo, woo

we were just a couple years short of the age
by my name on a fake id
and still 'bout a hundred away from the day
your daddy said you could run with me
we were a couple of line steppers
who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
never thinkin' we wouldn't last
i was your first and you were mine

and we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a harley
two heartbeats in the moonlight
we were both feet hangin' out over the edge
of the water tower skyline
at least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
i am who i am, i just miss who i was when we were
mm-hmm

we were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
had it all laid out in our mind
by the time we knew time was runnin' out
we'd done run out of time
and we were downtown saturday night, last-call cover band
'til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
like the stamp on the back of her hand
we were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
"pour some sugar on me"
we were a top down at johnson’s field
when she whispered that she wants me
at least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
i am who i am, i just miss who i was when we were
oh, mm-hmm

we were leather jackets hangin' onto a harley
two heartbeats in the moonlight
we were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
of the water tower skyline
at least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
i am who i am, i just miss who i was when we were
mmm, yes, i do

my friends say
"oh well, let that ship sail
you gotta let go of her"
just wasn't meant to be
but somewhere down deep, i still believe
that we were 

new york girls, they can be so pretty
but i get cold livin' in the city, oh
then i've got to go
and i've been west out to california
summer nights and girls are so much warmer there
they just don't have a care
but i know a place where the people are smilin'
takin' it easy and it's been a while since i've gone
and now it's time to go home

give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
you know what's on my mind
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time
you gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
whiskey, women and wine
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time

i-35, dallas down to austin
we can find a world we can get lost in there
where we can breathe the air, oh, oh
we can howl at the moon like a wild coyote
cactus in bloom and the pink peyote's so fine
so fine, we got nothin' but time, hee
give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
you know what's on my mind
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time
you gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
whiskey, women and wine
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time

and i know a place where the people are real
and they're takin' it easy and makin' you feel right at home
yeah, that's where i'm going, hee

give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
you know what's on my mind
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time
you gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
whiskey, women and wine
yeah, i'll show you where it's at
come on, let's get back on texas time

she's going to coachella with feathers in her hair
she got the past and a dream catcher in her rear-view mirror (woah)
oh, the band on her shirt, they're comin' on at nine
she doesn't even know right now where she's gonna stay tonight, she gon' stay tonight (woah)

she's on a mission, you can see
she's just gotta be free
red lips on a refugee

saturday night, feeling alright
show him what he lost in my jeans skin tight
stars coming out, the music up loud
saturday night, feeling alright
shades on, dancing with my hands up high
stars coming out, the music up loud

she loves driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm
driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm

palm trees fading like a summer fling
crystals on the dash, everybody singing "the shape of you," mmm (woah)
yeah, becky’s gone quiet on the passenger side
and maddie's in the back, just a little too high
looking like a teenage dream
red lips on a refugee

saturday night, feeling alright
show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight
stars coming out, the music up loud
saturday night, feeling alright
shades on, dancing with my hands up high
stars coming out, the music up loud

she loves driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm
yeah, driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm

everybody sing
mmm, mmm
oh
driving with her drop top

saturday night, feeling alright
show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight (hey)
stars coming out, the music up loud
saturday night, feeling alright (i'm feeling alright)
shades on, dancing with my hands up high (with my hands up high)
stars coming out, the music up loud
she loves driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm
driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm
oh, driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm
she's always driving with her drop top down
mmm, mmm 

i'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
that's alright cause i don't want to be alone
there's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
words i wished i'd said come on the radio

ooh, oh, oh, and i don't know why i do this to myself
ooh, oh, oh, i know you're with someone else

but in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
and it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
you got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
i never will forget
you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
and your fingertips slide up and down my back
breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
i'd give anything if i could bring it back, oh, oh

so, i've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
where i once held you and it's breaking my heart
i should take down all those pictures from my wall
promises we made won't fill this empty space
ooh, oh, oh, and i don't know why i just can't let you go
ooh, oh, oh, i know you're never coming back

but in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
and it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
you got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
i never will forget
you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
and your fingertips slide up and down my back
breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
i'd give anything if i could bring it back oh oh
but in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
and it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
you got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
i never will forget
you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
and your fingertips slide up and down my back
breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
i'd give anything if i could bring it back oh oh

mmmm
if i could bring you back
mmmm
just close my eyes... 

alone in this house again tonight
i got the tv on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
there's pictures of you and i on the walls around me
the way that it was and could have been surrounds me
i'll never get over you walking away

i've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
and i thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
but i'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
to hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry

would it help if i turned a sad song on
"all by myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
it's going to hurt bad before it gets better
but i'll never get over you by hiding this way

i've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
and i thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
but i'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
to hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry
i've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
and i thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
but i'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
to hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry
