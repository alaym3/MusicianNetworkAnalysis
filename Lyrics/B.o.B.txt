i could really use a wish right now
wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes
in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now
wish right now, wish right now

yeah, i could use a dream or a genie or a wish
to go back to a place much simpler than this
'cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
and all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
and all the pandemonium and all the madness
there comes a time where you fade to the blackness
and when you starin' at that phone in your lap
and you hopin' but them people never call you back
but that's just how the story unfolds
you get another hand soon after you fold
and when your plans unravel in the sand
what would you wish for if you had one chance?
so airplane, airplane, sorry i'm late
i'm on my way, so don't close that gate
if i don't make that, then i'll switch my flight

before it ever mattered what i had in my bank
yeah, back when i was tryna get a tip at subway
and back when i was rappin' for the hell of it
but nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
i'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
then maybe, oh maybe, i'll go back to the days
before the politics that we call the rap game
and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
and back before i tried to cover up my slang
but this is for decatur—what's up, bobby ray?
so can i get a wish to end the politics?
and get back to the music that started this shit?
so here i stand and then again i say
i'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

in the night sky are like shooting stars?

let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things woulda been no different
pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
they could blow away with the wind
"marshall, you're never gonna make it
makes no sense to play the game
there ain't no way that you'll win."
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
"fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!"
"you won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!"
"you need to get your cranium checked."
"you're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
and his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
to the rap olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainey
these food stamps and this wic shit
‘cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
but it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—

and all we do is light it up all night
all you see is strange clouds (strange clouds)
(hahahaha) strange clouds
all we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (b.o.b. fuck with me!)
(that's all we do, that's all we do)
and all we do is light it up all night
all you see is strange clouds (strange clouds)
strange clouds, strange clouds, strange clouds

well, ain't no question, yes, it's b.o.b, yes, definitely
up in the studio, i got all my necessities
if you want that real shit, you made the right selection (haha)
i'm decatur 'til i die (yeah), yes, i rep that definitely
they say i'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
i guess i must invest in the proper form of protection
and i say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
to a nigga from the hood, tryin' to aim for the top
i didn't even need no directions

i just wake up and then i roll up the purp
but these niggas wake up on my dick
at least have some breakfast first (hey)
nigga, keep your nourishment first
and your mind on my lyrics
'cause what you hopin' to accomplish
i already did it, bitch!

all we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(that's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do, hey)
and all we do is light it up (hey) all night
all you see is strange clouds (hey)
(strange clouds) strange clouds, bitch!
all we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(that's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do)
and all we do is light it up all night
all you see is strange clouds (all you see is, all you see)
(strange clouds, strange clouds, hey)

as the war between light and darkness continues
heroes and villains become harder to identify
kindred spirits separated at birth
fighting for their place in time to be solidified
the clock ticks faster and faster
while time runs a marathon in this babylon
but see, the end is only the beginning
the beginning of the calm before the storm

i used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
it seems the bigger i get it's the more they get mad at me
cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
and it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
and i swear it's like a fucked up reality
but creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
i guess, and i ain't too big on duality but
you think you know me? you ain't seen the half of me
so fly: no gravity, so high: mount everest
and the show must go on, yes, but i don't have to act in it
and they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
it just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
you hustle? well we are grand hustle, nigga, we mastered it
y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
drink wine out of chalices on sunday like we catholics
and if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
official, no artificial preservatives or additives
i love it all but i ain't attached to it
they call this a game because it is exactly

whenever i wake up, i get this feeling
that i can't wait up, cause time is ticking
bombs away (bombs away)
whenever i wake up, i get this feeling
that i can't wait up, cause time is ticking
bombs away (bombs away)

and it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
the world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
how do they exist if we don't know who they are?
they can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
from a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
but if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
and whoever they are, well i think that it's time we start takin' charge
fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
you could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
and in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
if you don't know what i mean, have you seen niagara falls?
man i swear this world is ours, but i've just been pushed too far
now i be beasting up on these bars
freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
good god, if i go this hard, by the time i'm ninety
i won't need viagra nah, even if i had a dog
i be the canine, i'd have a ball
better watch out when you cross my yard
i am a flame, i am the spark
i am in drive, y'all are in park
look at my shot, look at the arc
look at the crowd as soon as i start
look in they eyes and look in they hearts
two middle fingers straight at the law
sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
ufos don't make any noise
when they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard

whenever i wake up, i get this feeling
that i can't wait up, cause time is ticking
bombs away (bombs away)
whenever i wake up, i get this feeling
that i can't wait up, cause time is ticking
bombs away (bombs away)

as the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
unveiling the grim reality of duality
in which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
truth has many shades
it's not a matter of black and white, but gray
although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?

drinking a german beer, with a cuban cigar
in the middle of paris with a dominican broad
great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
she transferred to harvard from king's college in march
she says that i'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
michelangelo with the flow, picasso with the bars
she's well put together like a piece by gershwin
renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
and pack your bags real good, baby
'cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

you'll say you never had it so good

la, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
you never had it so good
la, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

suffering from first class cabin fever
five hour layovers from norway to egypt
i'm to the point like the pyramids of giza
still i'm to the left like the tower out in pisa
i'm feeling single baby, i could use a feature
swagger like caesar, i'll get you a visa
we can go to italy and maybe see the colosseum
i'll be da vinci if you'll be my mona lisa, now smile

well i been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
we'll hit up europe, yep, and spend some euros
and maybe visit berlin, the walls with the murals
this is your month baby, sign of the virgo
private reservations, glasses full of merlot
a rosé, a burgundy, traveling like turbo
brush up on your español, we're barcelona-bound, so smile
so pack your bags real good, baby
'cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
i see us on a beach down in mexico

yeah, you ain't seen my best
checkmate, ain't a game of chess
globalists see me as a threat
free thinking, got a world at my neck
hah, am i paranoid? picture malcolm x
in a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat
aye, neil tyson need to loosen up his vest
they probably write that man one hell of a check
aye, i'm over here on this side of town
come on over, over, over, over here, try to clown
aye, i never pipe down
if they weren't coming for me then
they definitely coming for me now
i can't even keep my phone charged up
all this shit i'm talking, i should get my home barred up
rappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up
now the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz
woo, use your, use your common sense
why is nasa part of the department of defense?
they divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees
feeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read

flat line, flat line
there's no superior blood line
flat line, flat line
you got me once but that died, aye

voice, voice, do i have a voice?
do i give a fuck? do i have a choice?
joint, joint, i roll up a joint
keep my shooters in the game like i hate to disappoint
i see only good things on the horizon
that's probably why the horizon is always rising
indoctrinated in a cult called science
and graduated to a club full of liars
heliocentrism, you were the sixth victim
fuck you and your team, you can sit on the bench with 'em
they nervous, but before you try to curve it
do your research on david irving
stalin was way worse than hitler
that's why the potus gotta wear a kippah
i'm a man first 'fore an artist
get a lawyer, look up doctor richard sauder

flat line
you fooled us for the last time
flat line, flat line
there's no superior blood line

so you want to find the farthest point from that center. and it turns out sea level at the equator is farther away from the center of the earth than sea level near the poles. it has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps
(why is that?)
because... earth, we know it spins, once a.... day. yes, thank you. three people know that, how long a day lasts here
(good for row number two, they're off to a great start)
so you, so you spin, you know when you spin pizza dough, it kind of flattens out. it gets wider in the middle and...so earth, throughout its life, even when it formed, it was spinning, and it got a little wider at the equator than it does at the poles. so it's not actually a sphere, it's an...it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid. that's what we call it. but not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator
(a little chubbier?)
little chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. so it turns out the pear-shapedness is bigger than the height of mount everest above sea level

flat line
you fooled us for the last time
flat line, flat line
there's no superior blood line
dead

seems like your heart stops workin'
the minute they close the curtain
you take off your mask
and take off your costume
and if anyone asks you're
taking a smoke break, you
drinking some coffee
but everyone knows what you're doin'
seems like the bus moves slower
just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
you take a few pills in beverly hills
but if anyone asks you've
got a prescription, you
got an addiction
who do you think that you're foolin'?

john doe
i just want the john i know
once you put the drinks on hold
maybe you could come back home
john doe
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

ah
errybody's addicted to somethin'
errybody got a grip onto somethin'
even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
maybe once, maybe twice
maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
without it, it's just harder to function at times
you race to the bottom of every single bottle
as if there was someone or somethin' to find
you struggle in your mind
and you tell yourself lie after lie
'til you get to the point where it's no longer private
the people that you work with notice the signs
when you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
so you break up the silence
you say you've been at the gym
but the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
so what you hidin'?

john doe
i just want the john i know
once you put the drinks on hold
maybe you could come back home
john doe
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

yeah
i probably had too many things
smashed too many freaks
had too much to dro...
i mean, had too much to drink
left the club, ended up in custody
random drug test, passed it luckily
my girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
with a woman up under me
i told her "wait!
it ain't what it look like!
i must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!"
well at least i admit it
'cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
that's just how you prevent it
well i ain't no different, i love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
i spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause i was afraid to succumb to the business
and what i'd become
but that what you'd judge you become
the path with the greatest resistance
that's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
my whole life i've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
when i told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now i can see it, it's optical

oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
john doe
i just want the john i know
once you put the drinks on hold
maybe you could come back home
john doe

i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

uhh
ever thought about losing it
when your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
you might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
and the grass so green on the other side
make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
but you still can’t find no food in it
that’s foolishness
and sometimes i wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
how much that cost?
does it even really matter?
'cause if life is a uphill battle
but y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
in the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
why so shallow? i’m just askin'
what’s the pattern to the madness?
everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
most of us ain’t hollywood actors
but if it’s all for one, and one for all
then maybe one day, we all could ball
do it one time for the underdogs
sincerely yours, from one of y'all

i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

i could feel your pain, i could feel your struggle
you just wanna live, but everything's so low
that you could drown in a puddle
that’s why i gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
for all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
to every single time that they play this song
you can say that that’s what bobby ray wrote for us
when the tides get too high
and the sea up underneath gets so deep
and you feel like you’re just another person
getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
uh, because we've both been there, both of us
but we still stand tall with our shoulders up
and even though we always against the odds
these are the things that’ve molded us
and if life hadn’t chosen us
sometimes i wonder where i would've wound up
'cause if it was up to me, i’d make a new blueprint
then build it from the ground up, hey
but if it’s all for one, and one for all
then maybe one day, we all could ball
do it one time for the underdogs
from bobby ray, to all of y’all

i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

all i heard was "that boy's pop"
all i heard was "that boy's not"
top 5 on any list, but i've moved up by five slots
i'm passed one, high as fuck
i don't see niggas until i look down
i've just turned my crib in to the hookah spot
you are now welcomed to the kush lounge
so miss me with that fuckery
girl, come here with that suckery
ham squad, hustle gang, that's that underground luxury

how much must i repeat? we only play for keeps
no time-outs, no free throws, no refs, no penalties
no handouts, no pit stops, no cheat codes, no sleep
but the drinks are on us, if you with it then pull up a seat

when you’re roaming through the jungle talk is nothing, talk is cheap
time is money, money is power, power corrupts eventually, damn
so what are the options? what are the choices left for me?
what other rule is left to break? i guess my fate is a quest for me
man i’m a dog that ain’t got no leash
man got a crib, it ain’t got no lease
man got a flow that ain't got no brain
but i still get brain, no hands no teeth, uh
nowadays, niggas are killas on the beat
but where i was raised all of the killas was down the street
better do your research
feeling like i fell out of the sky and landed feet first
my squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work
hell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat cause i took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and i want my dessert
so why not make a toast? tomorrow could always be worse
now keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter
and get that ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
i’m so grand hustle, you ain’t even in my league sir
what’s up with these nerds?
they be out here, gettin’ their salads tossed, gettin’ their leaves turned
the game just ain’t what it used to be, the quality is blurred
but a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged
so put it in the air if you entirely concur
she call me hippie cause i live without any concern
up on this green earth, i’m on them green herbs
yeah yeah, yeah, i stay in them trees like the keeblers
and they say that i look higher in person
as a kid i played in the yard, but now i’m astro turfing
i lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
made up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
run for cover, here comes trouble
my heart is going cold so i gotta sleep with warmer covers
polar bear pimpin’, solar flare spittin’
somebody tell ‘em that this is professional stuntin’, don’t attempt it
society is twisted, they tryna take us under
so when you see them folks, don’t forget to warn a brother
i made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
veni, vidi, vici, i came, i saw, i conquered
they mad cause i murdered the game
and their name wasn’t in the will
you see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal
and they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than a bill
but i’ll never sit down at another table unless i’m invited to the meal
to some it’s like conquering mountains, to me it’s like stepping on hills
remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
and the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill
and by the looks it’s about the time that you had your prescription filled
my life, full length feature presentation
there are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
a fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
there’s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement

30, you a fool for this one

dolla $ign

now open your mind up and listen you niggas
i am the master, the guru and after i school you i'm skinning you niggas
you finished, i'm making chinchillas out niggas
you should be embarrassed some banging pop rapper is killing you niggas
consider this tax for the swag that my city has given you niggas
and i know i'm the man, no, i don't need no grammy award on my mantle
know it don't matter, the beat it don't matter, the style, any flow i can channel
you see i'm from atlanta, east side of decatur, i grew up on candler
if you notice the way that i talk is vernacular, this is my actual grammar
i got these niggas nervous cause whatever lane that i'm in i'mma handle
your lyrics are wack and emotionally shallow
you lost in my thoughts, you don't know how to paddle
i know that i'm shining, i know that i'm shining
don't worry cause you can find shade in my shadow
from my point of view there's so many dead rappers
shit, all we need is a memorial banner
my first mixtape, they all said i sounded like dre
then they said my album was pop, didn't really sound like the mixtape
now i'm doing what i started, now they telling me i changed
i hear underrated so much you would swear it was my name
ain't no rappers on my list
come holla at me when you're done riding each others dick
25 million singles worlwide, i'll guess i'll take another hit
matter of fact i find this rap shit boring, man i'm over it
give me my guitar pick, i'll show you shit

mmm, hey, i eat it like dinner
you see this shit i gotta deal with from these beginners?
i ain't circusin' around with these clown-ass niggas
you snappin' at the heels of a world class sprinter
some may call this bullyin', some may call this bossin'
check the letter, man, you know i'm all city varsity
walk up on my field, you will get carried off it
we gon' need a body bag and we gon' need a coffin
who am i battling? i ain't even exhausted
you can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous
a sea of great whites, you are a dolphin
if i was you, i would be a little more cautious
i'm way too high for you to look at
the future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies
this is target practice but i don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore
cause it's just a waste of bullets
come and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'
i'm guessing they was hoping for some different results
i'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure
but fuck it, i guess i'mma have to let these niggas know
so i think it's time for these haters to get off my dick
got my own city, you can call it bobtropolis
east side representers reppin' with authority
and i ain't talking congressmen and i ain't talking politics
lookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages
but we already know that, so that is all to get
check the name tag, you know who the roster is
atl brand, hustle h.a.m squad in this bitch
like i ain't never had a mic
fresh to death, i see you in the afterlife
i eat bars, eat beats for my appetite
you wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite
what i gotta do to get some solidarity?
apparently, i need to speak with some more clarity
no luck needed, know no charity
and i'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me
b to the o, i said it once befo'
if i ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote
already graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe
but now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope
i'm bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin
call me jack-o-lantern, i get head like pumpkins
it's nothin', roll up the stuffin'
put it in the oven, get baked like muffins
if you ain't know, i guess i have to introduce ya
to my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to
body blow, uppercut, i do more than bruise ya
keep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future
