¿cómo puede ser verdad?

last night i dreamt of san pedro
just like i'd never gone, i knew the song
a young girl with eyes like the desert
it all seems like yesterday, not far away

tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
this is where i long to be, la isla bonita
and when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your spanish lullaby

i fell in love with san pedro
warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
te dijo, "te amo"
i prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
this is where i long to be, la isla bonita
and when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your spanish lullaby
i want to be where the sun warms the sky
when it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
beautiful faces, no cares in this world
where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

last night i dreamt of san pedro
it all seems like yesterday, not far away

tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
this is where i long to be, la isla bonita
and when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your spanish lullaby
(pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
this is where i long to be, la isla bonita
and when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your spanish lullaby

la-la-la-la-la-la-la
te dijo, te amo
la-la-la-la-la-la-la
él dijo que te ama
pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
la isla bonita
ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
spanish lullaby 

i made it through the wilderness

some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
i think they're okay
if they don't give me proper credit, i just walk away
they can beg and they can plead
but they can't see the light (that's right)
'cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always mister right

'cause we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl

some boys romance, some boys slow dance
that's all right with me
if they can't raise my interest, then i have to let them be
some boys try, and some boys lie
but i don't let them play, no way
only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'cause we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world

and i'm not afraid at all to die 'cause i believe him
god is on my side and i'll be his bride
i am not afraid 'cause i have faith in him
you can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
say that i'm a witch and burn me at the stake
it's all a big mistake
don't you know to doubt him is a sin?
i won't give in
they are so naive
they think we are not aware of their crimes
we know, but we are just not ready to act
the storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
i want to tell you about love and loneliness
but it's getting late now
can't you hear outside of your supreme hoodie
the wind that's beginning to howl?

it's a beautiful life 

everybody knows the damn truth
our nation lied, we lost respect
when we wake up, what can we do?
get the kids ready, take them to school
everybody knows they don’t have a chance
to get a decent job, to have a normal life
when they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
they pretend to help, it makes me laugh
i think i understand why peopl﻿e get a gun
i think i understand why we all give up
every day they have a kind of victory
blood of innocence, spread everywhe﻿re
they say that we need love

you only see what your eyes want to see
how can life be what you want it to be?
you're frozen when your heart's not open
you're so consumed with how much you get
you waste your time with hate and regret
you're broken when your heart's not open

mmmmmm, if i could melt your heart
mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
mmmmmm, give yourself to me
mmmmmm, you hold the key

now there's no point in placing the blame
and you should know i suffer the same
if i lose you, my heart will be broken
love is a bird, she needs to fly
let all the hurt inside of you die
you're frozen when your heart's not open

mmmmmm, if i could melt your heart
mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
mmmmmm, give yourself to me
mmmmmm, you hold the key
you only see what your eyes want to see
how can life be what you want it to be?
you're frozen when your heart's not open

mmmmmm, if i could melt your heart
mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
mmmmmm, give yourself to me

(hoo!)
(hoo!)
come on, girls!
do you believe in love?
'cause i got something to say about it
and it goes something like this

don't go for second best, baby
put your love to the test
you know, you know, you've got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then you'll know your love is real

you don't need diamond rings
or eighteen karat gold
fancy cars that go very fast
you know they never last, no no
what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you 'til you can't come down
(you'll never come down)
don't go for second best, baby
put your love to the test
you know, you know, you've got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then you'll know your love is real

long stem roses are the way to your heart
but he needs to start with your head
satin sheets are very romantic
what happens when you're not in bed?
you deserve the best in life
so if the time isn't right, then move on
second best is never enough
you'll do much better, baby, on your own
(baby, on your own)

don't go for second best, baby
put your love to the test
you know, you know, you've got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then you'll know your love is real
express yourself
you've got to make him express himself
hey, hey, hey, hey
so if you want it right now, make him show you how
express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
and when you're gone he might regret it
think about the love he once had
try to carry on, but he just won't get it
he'll be back on his knees
to express himself
you've got to make him express himself
hey, hey

what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you 'til you can't come down
(you'll never come down)

and when you're gone he might regret it
think about the love he once had
try to carry on, but he just won't get it
he'll be back on his knees, so please

don't go for second best, baby
put your love to the test
you know, you know, you've got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then you'll know your love is real
express yourself
you've got to make him express himself
hey, hey, hey, hey
so if you want it right now, make him show you how
express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
express yourself
(you've got to make him) so you can respect yourself
hey, hey
so if you want it right now, make him show you how
express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
express yourself

zephyr in the sky at night, i wonder
do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
she's got herself a universe gone quickly
for the call of thunder threatens everyone

and i feel like i just got home
and i feel
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel

faster than the speeding light she's flying
trying to remember where it all began
she's got herself a little piece of heaven
waiting for the time when earth shall be as one

and i feel like i just got home
and i feel
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel

quicker than a ray of light
quicker than a ray of light

through the endless years

she's got herself a universe
she's got herself a universe
she's got herself a universe
and i feel
and i feel
