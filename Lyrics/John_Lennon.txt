and the world will be as one

no need for greed or hunger
a brotherhood of man

sharing all the world
you

you may say i'm a dreamer
but i'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world will live as one

every day in every way
it's getting better and better

beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
beautiful boy

out on the ocean sailing away
i can hardly wait
to see you come of age
but i guess we'll both
just have to be patient
'cause it's a long way to go
a hard row to hoe
yes it's a long way to go
but in the meantime

before you cross the street
take my hand
life is what happens to you
while you're busy making other plans

beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
beautiful boy

darling sean
goodnight sean
see you in the morning
bright and early

so sgt. pepper took you by surprise
you better see right through that mother's eyes
those freaks was right when they said you was dead
the one mistake you made was in your head

ah, how do you sleep?
ah, how do you sleep at night?

you live with straights who tell you you was king
jump when your momma tell you anything
the only thing you done was yesterday
and since you're gone you're just another day

ah, how do you sleep?
ah, how do you sleep at night?


ah, how do you sleep?
ah, how do you sleep at night?

a pretty face may last a year or two
but pretty soon they'll see what you can do
the sound you make is muzak to my ears
you must have learned something in all those years

ah, how do you sleep?
ah, how do you sleep at night?

(for the other half of the sky)

by giving you no time instead of it all
till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all

a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be

they hurt you at home, and they hit you at school
they hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool
till you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules

a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be

when they've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
then they expect you to pick a career
when you can't really function, you're so full of fear

a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be

keep you doped with religion and sex and tv
and you think you're so clever and classless and free
but you're still fucking peasants as far as i can see

a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be

there's room at the top they are telling you still
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill
if you want to be like the folks on the hill

a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be

if you want to be a hero well just follow me
if you want to be a hero well just follow me

woman is the nigger of the world
yes she is, think about it
woman is the nigger of the world
think about it, do something about it

we make her paint her face and dance
if she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us
if she's real, we say she's trying to be a man
while putting her down, we pretend that she's above us

woman is the nigger of the world
yes, she is
if you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
woman is the slave of the slaves
ah, yeah, better scream about it


we make her bear and raise our children
and then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen
we tell her home is the only place she should be
then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend

oh, woman is the nigger of the world
yes she is
if you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
oh, woman is the slave to the slaves
yeah, alright, hit it!


we insult her every day on tv
and wonder why she has no guts or confidence
when she's young, we kill her will to be free
while telling her not to be so smart, we put her down for being so dumb

well, woman is the nigger of the world
yes, she is
if you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
woman is the slave to the slaves

we're playing those mind games together
pushing the barrier, planting seed
playing the mind guerilla
chanting the mantra, "peace on earth"
we all been playing those mind games forever
some kind of druid dude, lifting the veil
doing the mind guerilla
some call it magic, the search for the grail

love is the answer
and you know that, for sure
love is the flower
you gotta let it, you gotta let it grow

so keep on playing those mind games together
faith in the future, out of the now
you just can't beat on those mind guerillas
absolute elsewhere, in the stones of your mind
yeah, we're playing those mind games forever
projecting our images in space and in time

yes is the answer
and you know that for sure
yes is surrender
you gotta let it, you gotta let it go

so keep on playing those mind games together
doing the ritual, dance in the sun
millions of mind guerillas
putting their soul power to the karmic wheel
keep on playing those mind games forever
raising the spirit of peace and love
love!

love!
i want you to make love, not war
i know you've heard it before

don't they know we're so afraid?
isolation

we're afraid to be alone
everybody got to have a home
isolation

just a boy and a little girl
tryin' to change the whole wide world
isolation

the world is just a little town
everybody trying to put us down
i-isolation

i don't expect you to understand
after you've caused so much pain
but then again, you're not to blame
you're just a human, a victim of the insane

we're afraid of everyone
afraid of the sun
isolation

the sun will never disappear
but the world may not have many years
i-isolation

people say i'm crazy doing what i'm doing
well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
when i say that i'm okay well they look at me kind of strange
surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game
people say i'm lazy dreaming my life away
well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
when i tell 'em that i'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
don't you miss the big time boy? you're no longer on the ball

i'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
i really love to watch them roll
no longer riding on the merry-go-round
i just had to let it go

people asking questions lost in confusion
well i tell them there's no problem
only solutions
well they shake their heads and they look at me
as if i've lost my mind
i tell them there's no hurry
i'm just sitting here doing time

i'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
i really love to watch them roll
no longer riding on the merry-go-round
i just had to let it go
i just had to let it go

so long ago
was it in a dream, was it just a dream?
i know, yes i know
seemed so very real, it seemed so real to me
took a walk down the street
through the heat whispered trees
i thought i could hear, hear
hear, hear

somebody call out my name (john)
as it started to rain (john)
two spirits dancing so strange

ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé

dream, dream away
magic in the air, was magic in the air?
i believe, yes i believe
more i cannot say, what more can i say?
on a river of sound
through the mirror go around, around
i thought i could feel, feel
feel, feel

music touching my soul (nhoj)
something warm, sudden cold (nhoj)
the spirit dance was unfolding

ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé

ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé

our life together is so precious together
we have grown - we have grown
although our love is still special
let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

it's been so long since we took the time
no-one is to blame
i know time flies so quickly
but when i see you darling
it's like we both are falling in love again
it'll be just like starting over - starting over

everyday we used to make it love
why can't we be making love nice and easy
it's time to spread our wings and fly
don't let another day go by my love
it'll be just like starting over - starting over

why don't we take off alone
take a trip somewhere far, far away
we'll be together, all alone again
like we used to in the early days
well, well, darling

it's been so long since we took the time
no-one is to blame
i know time flies so quickly
but when i see you darling
it's like we both are falling in love again
it'll be just like starting over - starting over
look out

our life together is so precious together
we have grown - we have grown
although our love is still special
let's take our chance and fly away somewhere...
starting over

temperature's rising
fever is high
can't see no future
can't see no sky
my feet are so heavy
so is my head
i wish i was a baby
i wish i was dead

cold turkey has got me on the run

my body is aching
goose-pimple bone
can't see no body
leave me alone
my eyes are wide open
can't get to sleep
one thing i'm sure of
i'm in at the deep freeze

cold turkey has got me on the run


cold turkey has got me on the run

thirty-six hours
rolling in pain
praying to someone
free me again
oh, i'll be a good boy
please make me well
i promise you anything
get me out of this hell

cold turkey has got me on the run

oh, oh, oh, oh

when the night has come and the land is dark
and the moon is the only light we'll see
no i won't be afraid, no i won't be afraid
just as long as you stand, stand by me

so, darling, darling stand by me
oh now now, stand by me
stand by me, stand by me

if the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
and the mountain should crumble to the sea
i won't cry, i won't cry, no i won't shed a tear
just as long as you stand, stand by me

and darling, darling stand by me
oh, stand by me
stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
yeah


whenever you're in trouble won't you
stand by me
oh, now now, stand by me
oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
