just as i thought, it was going alright
i found out i'm wrong, when i thought i was right
it's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
i could say day, and you'd say night
tell me it's black, when i know that it's white
always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all
i could leave, but i won't go
though my heart might tell me so
i can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
but why does it always seem to be
me looking at you, you looking at me
it's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
turning me on, turning me off
making me feel like i want too much
living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
running around, staying out all night
taking it all instead of taking one bite
living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
i could leave, but i won't go
but it'd be easier i know
i can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
but why does it always seem to be
me looking at you, you looking at me
it's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
truth is i love you, more than i wanted to
there's no point in trying to pretend
there's been no one who makes me feel like you do
say we'll be together 'til the end
{bridge}
i could leave but i won't go

{outro}

i must've dreamed a thousand dreams
been haunted by a million screams
but i can hear the marching feet
they're moving into the street
now did you read the news today?
they say the danger's gone away
but i can see the fires still alight
they're burning into the night

there's too many men, too many people
making too many problems
and not much love to go round
can't you see this is a land of confusion?

this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
and these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
to make it a place worth living in

ooh, superman, where are you now
when everything's gone wrong somehow?
the men of steel, the men of power
are losing control by the hour

this is the time, this is the place
so we look for the future
but there's not much love to go round
tell me why this is a land of confusion

this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
and these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
to make it a place worth living in

i remember long ago
ooh, when the sun was shining
yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
and the sound of your laughter as i held you tight
so long ago

i won't be coming home tonight
my generation will put it right
we're not just making promises
that we know we'll never keep

too many men, there's too many people
making too many problems
and not much love to go round
can't you see this is a land of confusion?

now this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
and these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
to make it a place worth fighting for
this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
and these are the names we're given (oh, oh, oh)
stand up and let's start showing (oh, oh, oh)
just where our lives are going to

part i: "lover's leap" (0:00 - 3:47)
walking across the sitting room
i turn the television off
sitting beside you
i look into your eyes
as the sound of motor cars
fades in the nighttime
i swear i saw your face change
it didn't seem quite right

and it's, "hello babe
with your guardian eyes so blue
hey my baby, don't you know
our love is true?"

coming closer with our eyes
a distance falls around our bodies
out in the garden
the moon seems very bright
six saintly shrouded men
move across the lawn slowly
the seventh walks in front
with a cross held high in hand

and it's, "hey babe
your supper's waiting for you
hey my baby, don't you know
our love is true?"

i've been so far from here
far from your warm arms
it's good to feel you again
it's been a long, long time

hasn't it?
part ii: "the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man" (3:48 - 5:41)
i know a farmer who looks after the farm
with water clear, he cares for all his harvest
i know a fireman who looks after the fire

you, can't you see he's fooled you all?
yes, he's here again
can't you see he's fooled you all
share his peace, sign the lease
he's a supersonic scientist
he's a guaranteed eternal sanctuary man

"look, look into my mouth," he cries
"and all the children lost down many paths
i bet my life you'll walk inside"
hand in hand, gland in gland
with a spoonful of miracle
he's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary

(we will rock you, rock you little snake)
(we will keep you snug and warm)
part iii: "ikhnaton and itsacon and their band of merry men" (5:42 - 9:42)
wearing feelings on our faces
while our faces took a rest
we walked across the fields
to see the children of the west
but we saw a host of dark-skinned warriors
standing still below the ground
waiting for battle!

fight's begun, they've been released
killing foe for peace
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
and they're giving me a wonderful potion
'cause i cannot contain my emotion

and even though i'm feeling good
something tells me i'd better activate
my prayer capsule

today is a day to celebrate
the foe have met their fate
the order for rejoicing and dancing
has come from our warlord
part iv: "how dare i be so beautiful?" (9:43 - 11:04)
wandering in the chaos
the battle has left
we climb up the mountain
of human flesh
to a plateau of green grass
and green trees full of life

a young figure
sits still by a pool
he's been stamped "human bacon"
by some butchery tool
he is you

social security
took care of this lad
we watch in reverence
as narcissus is turned to a flower

(a flower?)
part v: "willow farm" (11:05 - 15:34)
if you go down to willow farm
to look for butterflies
or flutter-byes or gutter-flies
open your eyes
it's full of surprise, everyone lies
like the fox on the rocks
and the musical box
oh, there's mum and dad
and good and bad
and everyone's happy to be here

there's winston churchill dressed in drag
he used to be a british flag
plastic bag, what a drag
the frog was a prince
the prince was a brick, the brick was an egg
the egg was a bird
(fly away you sweet little thing)
(they're hard on your tail)
haven't you heard?
(they're going to change you)
(into a human being!)
yes, we're happy as fish
and gorgeous as geese
and wonderfully clean in the morning

we've got everything, we're growing everything
we've got some in, we've got some out
we've got some wild things floating about
everyone, we're changing everyone
you name them all, we've had them here
and the real stars are still to appear

(all change!)

feel your body melt
mum to mud to mad to dad
dad-diddley-office, dad-diddley-office
you're all full of ball
dad to dam to dum to mum
mum-diddley-washing, mum-diddley-washing
woo, you're all full of ball
let me hear your lies
we're living this up to the eyes
ooh ah, na-na-na
mama, i want you now

and as you listen to my voice
to look for hidden doors
tidy floors, more applause
you've been here all the time
like it or not, like what you got
you're under the soil
(the soil, the soil)
yes, deep in the soil
(the soil, the soil, the soil, the soil!)
so we'll end with a whistle
and end with a bang
and all of us fit in our places
part vi: "apocalypse in 9/8 (co-starring the delicious talents of gabble ratchet)" (15:35 - 20:50)
with the guards of magog, swarming around
the pied piper takes his children underground
dragons coming out of the sea
shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
he brings down the fire from the skies
you can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer below
he's getting out the marrow in your backbone
and the seven trumpets blowing
sweet rock and roll
gonna blow right down inside your soul
pythagoras with the looking glass
reflects the full moon
in blood, he's writing the lyrics
of a brand new tune

and it's, "hey babe
with your guardian eyes so blue
hey my baby, don't you know
our love is true?"

i've been so far from here
far from your loving arms
now i'm back again
and babe, it's gonna work out fine
part vii: "as sure as eggs is eggs (aching men's feet)" (20:47 - 23:06)
can't you feel our souls ignite?
shedding ever-changing colours
in the darkness of the fading night
like the river joins the ocean
as the germ in a seed grows
we've finally been freed to get back home

there's an angel standing in the sun
and he's crying with a loud voice
"this is the supper of the mighty one"
lord of lords, king of kings
has returned to lead his children home
to take them to the new jerusalem

"can you tell me where my country lies?"
said the unifaun to his true love's eyes
"it lies with me!" cried the queen of maybe
for her merchandise, he traded in his prize

"paper late!" cried a voice in the crowd
"old man dies!" the note he left was signed 'old father thames'
it seems he's drowned
selling england by the pound

citizens of hope and glory
time goes by, it's the time of your life
easy now, sit you down
chewing through your wimpy dreams
they eat without a sound
digesting england by the pound

young man says "you are what you eat," eat well
old man says "you are what you wear," wear well
you know what you are, you don't give a damn
bursting your belt that is your homemade sham

the captain leads his dance right on through the night
join the dance

follow on 'til the grail sun sets in the mould
follow on 'til the gold is cold
dancing out with the moonlit knight
knights of the green shield stamp and shout


there's a fat old lady outside the saloon
laying out the credit cards she plays fortune
the deck is uneven right from the start
and all of their hands are playing apart

the captain leads his dance right on through the night
join the dance

follow on, a round table-talking down we go
you're the show, off we go with
you play the hobbyhorse
i'll play the fool
we'll tease the bull
ringing round diddle loud, loud diddle round
follow on with a twist of the world we go
follow on 'til the gold is cold
dancing out with the moonlit knight
knights of the green shield stamp and shout

it's one o'clock and time for lunch
bum-de-dum, de-dum
when the sun beats down, and i lie on the bench
i can always hear them talk

there's always been ethel
"jacob, wake up, you've got to tidy your room now!"
and then mister lewis
"isn't it time that he was out on his own?"
over the garden wall, two little lovebirds, cuckoo to you
keep them mowing blades sharp

i know what i like
and i like what i know
getting better in your wardrobe
stepping one beyond your show, your show

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da
na-na, na-na-na
na-na, na-na-na

sunday night, mr. farmer called
said, "listen, son, you're wasting time
there's a future for you in the fire escape trade
come up to town"
but i remembered the voice from the past
"gambling only pays when you're winning!"
i had to thank old miss mort for schooling a failure
keep them mowing blades sharp

i know what i like
and i like what i know
getting better in your wardrobe
stepping one beyond your show, yeah
i know what i like
and i like what i know
getting better in your wardrobe
stepping one beyond your show

when the sun beats down, and i lie on the bench
i can always hear them talk
me, i'm just a lawnmower
you can tell me by the way i walk

i can't see you mama
but i can hardly wait
ooh, to touch and to feel you mama
oh, i just can't keep away
in the heat and the steam of the city
oh, it's got me running and i just can't brake
so say you'll help me mama
cause it's getting so hard
oh!

but i know you're always there

and i know inside you care

mama, mama
you're taking away my last chance
don't take it away
can't you feel my heart?
ha-ha, ha
ha-ha, ha
argh

it's hot, too hot for me, mama
but i can hardly wait
my eyes they're burning, mama
and i can feel my body shake
don't stop, don't stop me, mama
oh, make the pain, make it go away, hey he-ey
no, i won't hurt you, mama
but it's getting so hard
oh!

now i can't see you, mama
but i know you're always there
you taunt, you tease me, mama
but i never, never, never can keep away
it's the heat and the steam of the city
oh, got me running and i just can't brake
so stay, don't leave me, mama
cause it's getting so hard
oh!

mama, mama, don't go
no-hoh-hoh, don't go
ha ha don't go...
ha ha don't go...
don't go!
don't go!

well i've been waiting, waiting here so long
but thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now i know
she has a built-in ability
to take everything she sees
and now it seems i'm falling, falling for her

she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
it takes control and slowly tears you apart

well i don't really know her, i only know her name
but when she crawls under your skin
you're never quite the same, and now i know
she's got something you just can't trust
it's something mysterious
and now it seems i'm falling, falling for her

she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
it takes control and slowly tears you apart


she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
it takes control and slowly tears you apart

well, she don't like losing, to her it's still a game
and though she will mess up your life
you'll want her just the same, and now i know
she has a built-in ability
to take everything she sees
and now it seems i've fallen, fallen for her

she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
it takes control and slowly tears you apart

she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she seems to have an invisible touch, oh
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she seems to have an invisible touch, oh
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she seems to have an invisible touch, oh
she seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
she seems to have an invisible touch, oh

there is lambswool under my naked feet
the wool is soft and warm
gives off some kind of heat
a salamander scurries
into flame to be destroyed
imaginary creatures
are trapped in birth on celluloid
the fleas cling to the golden fleece
hoping they'll find peace
each thought and gesture
are caught in celluloid
there's no hiding in my memory
there's no room to avoid

the crawlers cover the floor
in the red ochre corridor
for my second sight of people
they've more lifeblood than before
they're moving in time
to a heavy wooden door
where the needle's eye is winking
closing in on the poor

the carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out"

there's only one direction in the faces that i see;
it's upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be
like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree
they are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free

the carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out"

mild mannered supermen are held in kryptonite
and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight
it's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight

the carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out"

the porcelain mannequin with shattered skin fears attack
the eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack
the liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack
and the tickler takes his stickleback

the carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out"

"we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out
we've got to get in to get out"
the carpet crawlers heed their callers
"we've got to get in to get out"

hot sun beating down
burning my feet just walking around
hot sun making me sweat
gator's getting close, hasn't got me yet

i can't dance, i can't talk
only thing about me is the way i walk
i can't dance, i can't sing
i'm just standing here selling everything

blue jeans sitting on the beach
her dog's talking to me but she's out of reach
she's got a body under that shirt
but all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

'cause i can't dance, i can't talk
only thing about me is the way i walk
i can't dance, i can't sing
i'm just standing here selling

oh and checking everything is in place
you never know who's looking on

young punk spilling beer on my shoes
fat guys talking to me trying to steal my blues
thick smoke, see her smiling through
i never thought so much could happen just shooting pool

but i can't dance, i can't talk
the only thing about me is the way that i walk
i can't dance, i can't sing
i'm just standing here selling

oh and checking everything is in place
you never know who's looking on
a perfect body with a perfect face — uh-huh

no, i can't dance, i can't talk
the only thing about me is the way i walk
no, i can't dance, i can't sing
i'm just standing here selling everything

but i can walk
no i can't dance
no no no i can't dance
no i said i can't sing
but i can walk

and the lamb lies down on broadway

early morning manhattan
ocean winds blow on the land
the movie-palace is now undone
the all-night watchmen have had their fun
sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
it's the same old ending
time to go, get out!
it seems they cannot leave their dream
there's something moving
in the sidewalk steam
and the lamb lies down on broadway

nightime's flyers feel their pains
drugstore takes down the chains
metal motion comes in bursts
but the gas station can quench that thirst
suspension cracked on unmade road
the trucker's eyes read 'overload'
and out of the subway
rael imperial aerosol kid
exits into daylight, spraygun hid
and the lamb lies down on broadway

the lamb seems right out of place
yet the broadway street scene
finds a focus in its face
somehow it's lying there
brings a stillness to the air
though man-made light
at night is very bright
there's no whitewash victim
as the neons dim, to the coat of white
rael imperial aerosol kid
wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did
and the lamb lies down on broadway

suzanne tired her work all done
thinks money-honey-be on-neon
cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
and the sawdust king spits out his scorn
wonder women you can draw your blind!
don't look at me!
i'm not your kind, i'm rael!
something inside me has just begun
lord knows what i have done
and the lamb lies down on broadway
on broadway

they say the lights
are always bright on broadway
they say there's always magic in the air

d'you see the face on the tv screen
coming at you every sunday?

on the cover of a magazine

the path is clear
though no eyes can see
the course laid down long before
and so with gods and men
the sheep remain inside their pen
though many times they've seen the way to leave

he rides majestic
past homes of men
who care not or gaze with joy
to see reflected there
the trees, the sky, the lily fair
the scene of death is lying just below

the mountain cuts off the town from view
like a cancer growth is removed by skill
let it be revealed
a waterfall, his madrigal
an inland sea, his symphony
na na na na na
na na

undinal songs
urge the sailors on
'til lured by the sirens' cry


now as the river dissolves in sea
so neptune has claimed another soul
and so with gods and men
the sheep remain inside their pen
until the shepherd leads his flock away
the sands of time were eroded by
the river of constant change

home from work, our juliet
clears her morning meal
she dabs her skin with pretty smells
concealing to appeal
"i will make my bed"
she said, but turned to go
can she be late for her cinema show?
cinema show

romeo locks his basement flat
and scurries up the stair
with head held high and floral tie
a weekend millionaire
"i will make my bed"
with her tonight, he cries
can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise?

take a little trip back with father tiresias
listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
i have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery
once a man, like the sea i raged
once a woman, like the earth i gave
but there is in fact more earth than sea


take a little trip back with father tiresias
listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
i have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery
once a man, like the sea i raged
once a woman, like the earth i gave
but there is in fact more earth than sea

all that time i was searching with nowhere to run to
it started me thinking, wondering
what i could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers
crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
all this time, i still remember everything you said
there's so much you promised, how could i ever forget

listen, you know i love you but i just can't take this
you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps
although i need you, i'm not gonna make this
you know i want to but i'm in too deep
so listen, listen to me
ooh, you must believe me
i can feel your eyes go through me
but i don't know why
ooh, i know you're going but i can't believe
it's the way that you're leaving
it's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault
i gave you too many reasons, being alone, when i didn't want to
i thought you'd always be there, i almost believed you
all this time, i still remember everything you said, oh
there's so much you promised, how could i ever forget

listen, you know i love you but i just can't take this
you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps
although i need you, i'm not gonna make this
you know i want to but i'm in too deep
so listen, listen to me
i can feel your eyes go through me
it seems i've spent too long
only thinking about myself, oh
now i want to spend my life
just caring bout somebody else

listen, you know i love you but i just can't take this
you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps
although i need you, i'm not gonna make this
you know i want to but i'm in too deep
you know i love you but i just can't take this
you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps
although i need you, i'm not gonna make this
you know i want to but i'm in too deep
you know i love you but i just can't take this
you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps
although i need you, i'm not gonna make this
you know i want to but i'm in too deep
you know i love you but i just can't take this

stay with me
my love, i hope you'll always be
right here by my side if ever i need you
oh, my love
in your arms
i feel so safe and so secure
and every day is such a perfect day to spend
alone with you

i will follow you, will you
follow me all the
days and nights that we
know will be, i will
stay with you will you
stay with me just one
single tear in each
passing year

with the dark
oh, i see so very clearly now
all my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
fading away
i can say
the night is long, but you are here
close at hand, oh, i'm better for the smile you give
and while i live i will

follow you, will you
follow me all the days and nights that we
know will be i will
stay with you will you
stay with me just one
single tear in each
passing year there will be


i will follow you will you
follow me all the
days and nights that we
know will be i will
stay with you will you
stay with me just one
single tear in each
passing year i will
follow you, will you
follow me all the
days and nights that we
know will be, i will
stay with you, will you
stay with me, just one
single tear in each
passing year, i will
follow you, will you
follow me all the
days and nights that we
know will be, i will
stay with you, will you
stay with me, just one
single tear in each
passing year...

i got sunshine in my stomach
like i just rocked my baby to sleep
i got sunshine in my stomach
but i can't keep me from creeping sleep
sleep, deep in the deep

rockface moves to press my skin
white liquids turn sour within
turn fast-turn sour
turn sweat-turn sour
must tell myself that i'm not here
i'm drowning in a liquid fear
bottled in a strong compression
my distortion shows obsession
in the cave, get me out of this cave

if i keep self-control
i'll be safe in my soul
and the childhood belief
brings a moment's relief
but my cynic soon returns
and the lifeboat burns
my spirit just never learns

stalactites, stalagmites
shut me in, lock me tight
lips are dry, throat is dry
feel like burning, stomach churning
i'm dressed up in a white costume
padding out leftover room
body stretching, feel the retching
in the cage, get me out of this cage

in the glare of a light
i see a strange kind of sight
of cages joined to form a star
each person can't go very far
all tied to their things
they are netted by their strings
free to flutter
in memories of their wasted wings

outside the cage i see my brother john
he turns his head so slowly round
i cry out help, before he can be gone
and he looks at me without a sound
and i shout "john please help me!"
but he does not even want to try to speak
i'm helpless in my violent rage
and a silent tear of blood
dribbles down his cheek
and i watch him turn again
and leave the cage
my little runaway
(raindrops keep falling on my head
they keep falling on my...)

in a trap, feel a strap
holding still, pinned for kill
chances narrow that i'll make it
in the cushioned straight jacket
just like 22nd street
when they got me by my neck and feet
pressure's building, can't take more
my headaches charge, my earaches roar
in this pain, get me out of this pain

if i could change to liquid
i could fill the cracks up in the rock
but i know that i am solid
and i am my own bad luck
but outside john disappears
and my cage dissolves
and without any reason
my body revolves

keep on turning
keep on turning
turning around
just spinning around

along the forest road, there's hundreds of cars - luxury cars
each has got its load of convertible bars, cutlery cars - superscars!
for today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
'cause they disagree on a gangland boundary
they disagree on a gangland boundary
there's willy wright and his boys -
one helluva noise, that's billy's boys!
with fully-fashioned bugs, that's little john's thugs
the barking slugs - supersmugs!
for today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
yes, these christian soldiers fight to protect the poor
east end heroes got to score in...

the battle of epping forest
yes it's the battle of epping forest
right outside your door
and you ain't seen nothing like it
no, you ain't seen nothing like it
not since the civil war

coming over the hill are the boys of bill
and johnny's lads stand very still
with the thumpire's shout, they all start to clout
- there's no guns in this gentleman's bout
georgie moves in on the outside left
with a chain flying 'round his head;
and harold demure, from art literature
nips up the nearest tree
(here come the cavalry!)
amidst the battle roar
accountants keep the score: 10-4
they've never been alone, after getting a radiophone
the bluebells are ringing for sweetmeal sam, real ham
handing out bread and jam just like any picnic
picnic - picnic - picnic

it's 5 to 4 on william wright; he made his pile on derby night
when billy was a kid, walking the streets
the other kids hid - so they did!
and now, after working hard in security trade, he's got it made
the shops that need aid are those that haven't paid
"i'll do my double-show quick!"
said mick the prick, fresh out the nick
"i sell cheap holiday. the minute they leave
and a visit i pay - does it pay!"
and his friend, liquid len by name
of wine, women and wandsworth fame
said "i'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!
i'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!"
got me framed

they called me the reverend when i entered the church unstained
my employers have changed but the name has remained
it all began when i went on a tour
hoping to find some furniture
followed a sign saying "beautiful chest"
it led to a lady who showed me her best
she was taken by surprise when i quickly closed my eyes
so she rang the bell and quick as hell
bob the nob came out on his job
to see what the trouble was
"louise, is the reverend hard to please?"
"you're telling me!"
"perhaps, sir, if it's not too late
we could interest you in our old-fashioned staffordshire plate?"
"oh no, not me, i'm a man of repute."
but the devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out "shoot!"
to save my steeple, i visited people;
for this i'd gone when i met little john
his name came, i understood
when the judge said "you are a robbing hood."
he told me of his strange foundation
conceived in sight of the woodstock nation
he'd had to hide his reputation
when poor, 'twas salvation from door to door
but now, with a pin-up guru every week
it was love, peace & truth incorporated for all who seek
he employed me as a karma-ma-mechanic, with overall charms
his hands were then fit to receive, receive alms

that's why we're in the battle of epping forest
yes it's the battle of epping forest
right outside your door
we guard your souls for peanuts
and we guard your shops and houses
for just a little more, just a little more

in with a left hook is the bethnal green butcher
but he's countered on the right by mick's chain-gang fight
and liquid len with his smashed bottle men
is lobbing bob the nob across the gob
with his kisser in a mess, bob seems under stress
but jones the jug hits len right in the mug;
and harold demure, who's still not quite sure
fires acorns from out of his sling
(here come the cavalry!)
up, up above the crowd
inside their silver cloud, done proud
the bold and brazen brass, seen darkly through the glass
the butler's got jam on his rolls; roy doles out the lot
with tea from a silver pot just like any picnic
picnic - picnic - picnic

along the forest road, it's the end of the day
and the clouds roll away
each has got its load - they'll come out for the count
at the break-in of day
when the limos return for their final review, it's all thru
- all they can see is the morning goo
"there's no-one left alive - must be a draw."
so the blackcap barons toss a coin to settle the score

there's something solid forming in the air
and the wall of death is lowered in times square
no one seems to care
they carry on as if nothing was there
the wind is blowing harder now
blowing dust into my eyes
the dust settles on my skin
making a crust i cannot move in
and i'm hovering like a fly
waiting for the windshield on the freeway

play me "old king cole"
that i may join with you
all your hearts now seem so far from me
it hardly seems to matter now

and the nurse will tell you lies
of a kingdom beyond the skies
but i am lost within this half-world
it hardly seems to matter now

play me my song
(here it comes again)
play me my song
(here it comes again)

just a little bit
just a little bit more time
time left to live out my life

play me my song
(here it comes again)
play me my song
(here it comes again)

old king cole was a merry old soul
and a merry old soul was he
so he called for his pipe
and he called for his bowl
and he called for his fiddlers three
but the clock, tick-tock
on the mantelpiece
and i want, and i feel, and i know
and i touch her warmth

she is a lady, she's got time
brush back your hair
(she’s got time, for she’s a lady)
and let me get to know your face
she is a lady, she is mine!
oh, brush back your hair
(she is mine, she is a lady)
and let me get to know your flesh

i've been waiting here for so long
and all this time has passed me by
it doesn't seem to matter now
you stand there with your fixed expression
casting doubt on all i have to say
why don't you touch me, touch me?
why don't you touch me, touch me?

touch me now, now, now, now, now!
now, now, now, now, now!
now, now, now, now, now!
now, now, now, now!
now, now, now, now!

blue girls come in every size
some are wise and some otherwise
they got pretty blue eyes
for an hour a man may change
for an hour her face looks strange
looks strange, looks strange
marching to the promised land
where the honey flows
and takes you by the hand
pulls you down on your knees
while you're down a pool appears
the face in the water looks up
and she shakes her head as if to say
that it's the last time you'll look like today

sail away, away
ripples never come back
gone to the other side
sail away, away

the face that launched a thousand ships
is sinking fast, that happens you know
the water gets below, seems not very long ago
lovelier she was than any that i know
angels never know it's time
to close the book
and gracefully decline
the song has found a tale
my, what a jealous pool is she
the face in the water looks up
she shakes her head as if to say
that the blue girls have all gone away

sail away, away
ripples never come back
they've gone to the other side
look into the pool, ripples never come back
dive to the bottom and go to the top
to see where they have gone
they've gone to the other side


sail away, away
ripples never come back
gone to the other side
look into the pool, the ripples never come back, come back
dive to the bottom and go to the top
to see where they have gone
they've gone to the other side

ripples never come back
sail away, away
sail away, away
ripples never come back
