losing you would end my life you see
because you mean that much to me
you could have told me yourself
that you love someone else
instead
i heard it through the grapevine
not much longer would you be mine
oh, i heard it through the grapevine
and i'm just about to lose my mind
honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

people say "believe half of what you see
son and none of what you hear"
but i can't help being confused
if it's true please tell me dear:
do you plan to let me go
for the other guy you loved before?
don't you know

i heard it through the grapevine
not much longer would you be mine, baby
i heard it through the grapevine
i'm just about to lose my mind
honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

honey, honey, i know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
that you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah)

flying high in the friendly sky
flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
rest of the folks are tired and weary
oh lord, and have laid their bodies down
i go to the place where danger awaits me
and it's bound to forsake me
so stupid minded
i can't help it, so stupid minded
but i go crazy when i can't find it
in the morning, i'll be alright, my friend
but soon the night will bring the pains
the pain, awful pain

flying high in the friendly sky
without ever leaving the ground
and i ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
nobody really understands, no, no
and i go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
self destruction's in my hand
oh lord, so stupid minded
oh and, i go crazy when i can't find it
well i know i'm hooked my friends
to the boy who makes slaves out of men
and oh, believe me
flying high in a friendly sky
flying high in a friendly sky 

i just want to ask a question:
who really cares, to save a world in despair?
who really cares?
there'll come a time (there'll come a time)
when the world won't be singing (when the world won't be singing)
flowers won't grow (flowers won't grow, no)
bells won't be ringing (the bells won't be ringing)
who really cares? (who really cares?)
who's willing to try? (who is willing to try?)
to save the world, (to save the world)
that's destined to die (that is destined to die)
when i look at the world (when i look at the world)
it fills me with sorrow (it fills me with sorrow)
little children today (children today)
are really going to suffer tomorrow (really suffer tomorrow)
(oh!) what a shame (what a shame)
such a bad way to live (such a bad way to live)
oh, who is to blame? (who is to blame?)
we can't stop living, (when we can't stop living)

(live for life) live for life
(but let live everybody)

(and if you want to love, you got to....save the babies)
(oh you've got the feeling, you've got the feeling)

but who really cares?
who's willing to try?
to save our world
to save our sweet world
to save a world
that is destined...to die
oh, la la la la, la la la
oh, oh, dig it everybody 

distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
ooh, so many miles away
heaven knows that i long for you
every night, every night
and sometimes i yearn through the day

distant lover (lover, lover)
you should think about me
say a prayer for me
please, please baby
think about me sometimes
think about me here
here in misery
misery

as i reminisce, ah baby
through our joyful summer together
the promises we made
all the daily letters
then all of a sudden
everything seemed to explode
now i gaze out my window
sugar, down a lonesome road
distant lover, ooh sugar
how can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
didn't you know, sugar
that every moment that i spent with you
i treasured it
like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
lord, have mercy

oh baby, don't go
please, come back, baby
something i want to say
when you left you took all of me with you
my lord i wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
please, please, please
oh please baby
come back home, little girl
oh baby please, please 

you were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
for you to understand what this means, i shall explain
i stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
yes, i'd forget it all once in bed with you
ooo darling how could we end up like this?
oh baby let me reminisce

oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
you set my soul on fire, my one desire
was to love you and think of you with pride
and keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
we could not bear the mental strain
leave you, i never meant to
now you see how much you hurt me
but if you ever need me, i'll be by your side
though the many happy times we had
can never really outweigh the bad
oh i'll never love nobody like i loved you baby

it's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darling
maybe we'll meet down the line
it's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and i
much too late for you to cry
it's too late for you and me, much too late for you and i
it's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
ah we tried, god knows we tried
now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
it's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
oh oh ohhh it's much too late
well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy 

sunny, yesterday my heart was filled with rain
sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
my sunny one shines so sincere
sunny one so true, i love you

sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
you gave to me your all and all
now i feel about ten feet tall
oh, sunny one so true, i love you

sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
yeah sunny, thank you for the facts from a to z
oh my life was torn like wind blown sand
then a rock was formed when you held my hand
sunny one so true, i love you
yes, yes

sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
oh you're my spark of nature's fire
you're my sweet complete desire
sunny one so true, i love you
sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
oh you're my spark of nature's fire
you're my sweet complete desire
oh, sunny one so true, i love you 

don't go and talk about my father
god is my friend, (jesus is my friend) he is my friend
he made this world for us to live in (he made this world)
and gave us everything (lord gave us everything)
and all he asks of us (peace!)
is we give each other love, oh yeah

don't go and talk about my father
because god is my friend, (jesus is my friend) he is my friend
he loves us whether or not we know it (just loves us, oh yeah)
and he'll forgive all our sins, (he'll forgive our sins) forgive all our sins
and all he asks of us, oh yeah, is we give each other love, oh yeah

love your mother, she bore you
love your father, he works for you
love your sister, she's good to you
love your brother, love your brother

don't go and talk about my father, he's good to us
god is my friend, (jesus is my friend) he is my friend
and when we call on him for mercy, mercy father
he'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes he will
all he asks of us, i know- 

 (spoken)
you know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
i mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all
but it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies
if you don't honor what you said, you lie to god. the words should be changed

ooh now as i recall, we tried a million times
again and again and again, and that isn't all
i gave my love to you each time to make amends
suddenly i start to realize i can't make it
pretty birds fly away, i had to leave you for my health's sake
what to do? make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
so if a fresh new love comes in, i won't say those words again
instead i'll say i'll try to love and protect you
with all my heart as long as you want me to baby
ooh if i love again i'm gonna try a new way this time
memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
so when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
you say you love me with all your heart
if you ever loved me with all of your heart
you'd never take a million dollars to part
i really tried, you know i tried, oh baby
although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
i really tried, you know how hard i tried, really tried
(all that rehearsing, baby)
we really lied, didn't we baby?
and on top of that you have scandalized, my name

what i can't understand is if you love me
how could you turn me in to the police
didn't i love you good and try to take care of you?
best i could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine
pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
one thing i can promise, friend; i'll never be back again
but i'm not really bitter, babe
i wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
good luck in the world
but i know you'll never be satisfied
no, you still want me standin' by your side
memories haunt you all the time
i will never leave your mind
got judgment on your side;
you've said bad things and you've lied
still i remember some of the good things, baby
like love after dark and picnics in parks
those are the days i'll not forget in my life
i'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
i'd rather remember all the fun we had
all i ever really wanted was
to love you and treat you right
all we did was fuss and fight
it don't matter baby
take a lesson from it all (come on)
i never thought i'd see the day when
you'd put me through what you put me through
you tried your best
you say i gave you no rest

when did you stop loving me?
when did i stop loving you?
when did you stop loving me?
when did i stop loving you?
when did you stop loving me?
when did i stop loving you? 

hey baby, that's alright people
i know that's alright
everyday, that's alright
oh, when we love each other

i know that's alright
oh just feel it, feel it
oh everybody feel it
god know that's alright, yes

some of us were born with money to spend
some of us were born for races to win
some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air

for those of us who simply like to socialize
for those of us who tend the sick
and heed the people's cries
let me say to you, right on

turn on, on, feel it, feel
yeah, oh, oh, oh lord, lord, people
and i say, right on
honey, right on
for those of us who live where peace is craved
for those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
for those of us who live a life, yeah
surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

for those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
for those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
for the soul that takes pride in his god
and himself and everything else

love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
ah, true love, love, love for your brother
and love, love for god
love, pure love

ah true love can conquer hate every time
give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
and my darling, one more thing
if you let me, i will take you to live where love is king
ah, baby

but there's always the first time, you know
so i made up my mind (come on baby, first time)

and soon as i know i've got you willing baby
