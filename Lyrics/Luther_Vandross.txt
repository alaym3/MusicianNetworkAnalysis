i can't fool myself, i don't want nobody else to ever love me
you are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
there's not a minute, hour, day or night that i don't love you
you're at the top of my list 'cause i'm always thinking of you
i still remember in the days when i was scared to touch you
how i spent my day dreaming planning how to say i love you
you must have known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in
that's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

oh, my love
a thousand kisses from you is never too much
i just don't wanna stop
oh, my love
a million days in your arms is never too much
i just don't wanna stop

too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
i called you up, but you weren't there and i was broken-hearted
hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
i'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
love is a gamble and i'm so glad that i am winning
we've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

oh, my love
a thousand kisses from you is never too much
(never too much, never too much, never too much)
i just don't wanna stop
oh, my love
a million days in your arms is never too much
(never too much, never too much, never too much)
and i just don't wanna stop
oh, my love
a thousand kisses from you is never
(never too much, never too much, never too much)
i just don't wanna stop
oh, my love
a million days in your arms is never too much

back when i was a child
before life removed all the innocence
my father would lift me high
and dance with my mother and me
and then
spin me around 'till i fell asleep
then up the stairs he would carry me
and i knew for sure
i was loved
if i could get another chance
another walk
another dance with him
i'd play a song that would never ever end
how i'd love love love
to dance with my father again
when i and my mother
would disagree
to get my way i would run
from her to him
he'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
then finally make me do
just what my mama said
later that night when i was asleep
he left a dollar under my sheet
never dreamed that he
would be gone from me
if i could steal one final glance
one final step
one final dance with him
i'd play a song that would never ever end
cause i'd love love love to
dance with my father again
sometimes i'd listen outside her door
and i'd hear how mama would cry for him
i'd pray for her even more than me
i'd pray for her even more than me
i know i'm praying for much to much
but could you send her
the only man she loved
i know you don't do it usually
but dear lord
she's dying to dance with my father again
every night i fall asleep
and this is all i ever dream

a chair is still a chair
even when there's no one sittin' there
but a chair is not a house
and a house is not a home
when there's no one there to hold you tight
and no one there you can kiss goodnight
woah girl

a room is a still a room
even when there's nothin' there but gloom
but a room is not a house
and a house is not a home
when the two of us are far apart
and one of us has a broken heart

now and then i call your name
and suddenly your face appears
but it's just a crazy game
when it ends, it ends in tears

pretty little darling, have a heart
don't let one mistake keep us apart
i'm not meant to live alone
turn this house into a home
when i climb the stairs and turn the key
oh, please be there
sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah

i'm not meant to live alone
turn this house into a home
when i climb the stairs and turn the key
oh, please be there, still in love
i said, still in love
still in love with me, yeah
are you gonna be in love with me?
i want you and need you to be, yeah
still in love with me
say you're gonna be in love with me
it's drivin' me crazy to think
that my baby couldn't be still in love with me
are you gonna be? say you're gonna be
are you gonna be? say you're gonna be
are you gonna be? say you're gonna be
well well, well well
still in love, so in love, still in love with me
are you gonna be?
say that you're gonna be
still in love with me, yeah
with me, oh
still in love with me, yeah

i thought sometime alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but i couldn't see that
i thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so i left the one i loved at home to be alone (alone)
and i tried to find
out if this one thing is true
that i'm nothing without you
i know better now
and i've had a change of heart
i'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
i'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
i'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
i'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah
and then i met someone
and thought she could replace you
we got a long just fine
we wasted time because he was not you
we had a lot of fun
though we knew we were faking
love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
so i'm here cause i found this one thing is true
that i'm nothing without you
i know better now
and i've had a change of heart
i'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
i'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
i'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
i'd rather have the one who holds my heart
who holds my heart
i can't blame you if you turn away from me, like i've done you
i can only prove the things i say with time
please be mine
i'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you
than good times with someone else (i know)
i'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime)
than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
i'd rather have hard times to gether
than to have it easy apart
i'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)
i'd rather have bad times with you (surely)
than good times with someone else (surely)
i'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah)
than safe and warm by myself (all by myself)

than to have it easy apart (you know it)
i'd rather have the one who holds my heart

to try when your arms are too weary
to reach the unreachable star

no matter how far
to fight for the right
without question or pause
to be willing to march, march into hell
for that heavenly cause
and i know
if i'll only be true
to this glorious quest
that my heart
will lie peaceful and calm
when i'm laid to my rest
and the world will be better for this

to reach the unreachable, the unreachable
the unreachable star

the impossible dream

the unreachable star

he works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
but it tears her apart cause nothing's for her heart
he pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
if he could only read her mind, she’d say

buy me a rose, call me from work
open a door for me, what would it hurt
show me you love me by the look in your eyes
these are the little things i need the most in my life
now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
as she sits and wonders if all she's doing is wrong
cause lately she’d try anything just to turn his head
would it make a difference if she said, if she said

and the more that he lives the less that he tries
to show her the love that he holds inside
and the more that she gives the more that he sees
this is the story of you and me
so i bought you a rose on the way home from work
to open the door to a heart that i hurt
and i hope you notice this look in my eyes
cause i'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
and i’m gonna hold you tonight, tonight
do all those little things for the rest of your life

there's a rose in a fisted glove
and the eagle flies with the dove
and if you can't be
with the one you love
it's alright
go ahead and love the one
love the one
love the one you're with
love the one
love the one
love the one you're with
ooh...hoo...come on, yeah

if your guy can't come to you

and if you can't be
with the one you love
honey, love the one you're with

and don't sit cryin' for good times you had
there's a girl right next to you
and she's waiting
for something to do

and there's a rose in a fisted glove
and the eagle flies with the dove
and if you can't be
with the one you love
do the wild thing, love the one you're with

hugging and kissing when your love is missing ain't love, just love (the one you're
with)

knowing love the way i do
i can say for certain that it's true
there's a chance for me and you
i surely feel like the time is near
the picture in my mind is very clear
i think love has brought us here

i remember not too long ago
i was just a lonely person with a lonely heart, yeah
and i was hoping there could one day be
be a chance for me to...

get the love that i'd been missing
sometimes love takes a long time
but wait for love and you're gonna get the
chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
oh my

when you take the chance on love you see
it's not a waste of time if you truly believe
the impossible can be
so hold on tight if you think you're right
'cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
you gave up too easily

now i remember spending all my time
on a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine, yeah
and i was hoping there could one day be

i don't know how love could do this to me
i've waited and waited for someone i never see
but i'm so sentimental and i'm so hopeful you'll be here
so here i am every year, every christmas
yeah
i've wished for you in my heart and in my head
and i got my answer that first moment that we met
and, oh yes, i believed you as you told me, as you said
you'd be here every year, every christmas
there must be a lesson for me to learn
if you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return
why should i be lonely? don't tell me it's fine
i have my pride, but i'd rather be with you tonight
so much emotion, it's driving me mad, yeah, yeah
but i'll take my chances with these feelings that i have
and i'll come back to this same corner where we met
and i'll be here every year, every christmas
mere words can't explain the pain and the fear
'cause, oh, i wonder, yes i wonder, are you gonna leave me standing here?
today's almost over, but i don't wanna leave
has my heart made a fool out of me?
my friends gather 'round me with holiday cheer, yeah
they say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here
well, i can't keep explaining what they'll never understand
and why i'm here every year, every christmas
i return every year, every christmas
i come here every year, every christmas

i, fell asleep late last night...
and i dreamed the night and almost half the day away
i just got up
so that i could hear her say
she's still in love
and no one can take her love away

ooh love, wakes me up every day
and i thought no one
could ever make me feel this way
it fills me up
every time i hear her say
she's still in love
and no one could take her love away

i wanna be loved
there's nothing better than love
what in the world could you ever be thinking of?
it's better by far
so let yourself reach for that star
and go no matter how far
to the one you love
to love

and i mean all these words i say
you don't have to guess
what's going on inside my head

just try to know
all the things that our hearts say
listen to love
and always get love to lead the way

whenever you love
there's nothing better than love
what in the world could you ever be thinking of?
it's better by far
so let yourself reach for that star
and go no matter how far
to the one you love

(for love, for love)
you know for love i would go anywhere
(for love) i would go there
(for love, for love)
for love to the ends of nowhere
it's for her love
and for her love
i would go
i would go
i would go
i would go...

and i would love (would love)
to just spend all my time
with a girl
who makes me feel her love is mine

someone you see
who would only dream of me
she'd be in love
just 'cause she'd want to be

she'd want to be loved
there's nothing better than love
what in the world could you ever be thinking of?
it's better by far
so let yourself reach for that star
and go no matter how far
to the one you love
oh, oh...
there's nothing better than love
what in the world could you ever be thinking of?
it's better by far
so let yourself reach for that star
and go no matter how far
to the one you love
oh, oh...
there's nothing better than love
what in the world could you ever be thinking of?
it's better by far
so let yourself reach for that star
and go no matter how far
to the one you love

oh yeah, well alright
oh yeah, well alright
oh yeah, well alright
oh yeah, well alright

roll back the rug, everybody
move all the tables and chairs
we're gonna have us a good time tonight
every time that we meet
we skip and we dip to the beat
yeah, yeah
what in the world could be better
than getting together
the last time we had a party
it ended when the sun came up
that's why your mama told you
that you couldn't go out
stay in the house

bad boy
he's gonna sneak out tonight
he's gonna tip by her window
cause he sure wants to get out and dance

everyone's here
let 'em all in
the chandelier downstairs has fallen
i know it's hard to resist
this is the party no one wanted to miss
but if you don't get home on the double, boy
you're going to be in trouble
i hope your mama don't look in your room
'cause if she does
she'll be here soon
boy, she's gonna be mad
you're a bad boy
and you've got it bad, boy
boy, say goodbye to your friends
'cause it's gonna be a while
til you see them again


everybody's swinging
dancing to the music on the radio
having a party
everybody's swinging
dancing to the music on the radio
you can't go
