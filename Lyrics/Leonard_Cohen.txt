now i've heard there was a secret chord
that david played, and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do ya?
it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall, the major lift
the baffled king composing "hallelujah"

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
you say i took the name in vain
i don't even know the name
but if i did, well really, what's it to ya?
there's a blaze of light in every word
it doesn't matter which you heard
the holy or the broken hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
i did my best, it wasn't much
i couldn't feel, so i tried to touch
i've told the truth, i didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
i'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah

baby, i've been here before
i know this room, i've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me, do you?
and remember when i moved in you
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 

if you are the dealer
i'm out of the game
if you are the healer
it means i'm broken and lame
if thine is the glory then
mine must be the shame
you want it darker
we kill the flame

magnified, sanctified
be thy holy name
vilified, crucified
in the human frame
a million candles burning
for the help that never came
you want it darker

hineni, hineni
i'm ready, my lord

there's a lover in the story
but the story's still the same
there's a lullaby for suffering
and a paradox to blame
but it's written in the scriptures
and it's not some idle claim
you want it darker
we kill the flame
they're lining up the prisoners
and the guards are taking aim
i struggled with some demons
they were middle-class and tame
i didn't know i had permission
to murder and to maim
you want it darker

hineni, hineni
i'm ready, my lord

magnified, sanctified
be thy holy name
vilified, crucified
in the human frame
a million candles burning
for the love that never came
you want it darker
we kill the flame

if you are the dealer
let me out of the game
if you are the healer
i'm broken and lame
if thine is the glory
mine must be the shame
you want it darker
hineni, hineni
hineni, hineni
i'm ready, my lord

hineni
hineni, hineni
hineni 

suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
you can hear the boats go by
you can spend the night beside her
and you know that she's half crazy
but that's why you want to be there
and she feeds you tea and oranges
that come all the way from china
and just when you mean to tell her
that you have no love to give her
then she gets you on her wavelength
and she lets the river answer
that you've always been her lover

and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that she will trust you
for you've touched her perfect body with your mind

and jesus was a sailor
when he walked upon the water
and he spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
and when he knew for certain
only drowning men could see him
he said "all men will be sailors then
until the sea shall free them"
but he himself was broken
long before the sky would open
forsaken, almost human
he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
and you want to travel with him
and you want to travel blind
and you think maybe you'll trust him
for he's touched your perfect body with his mind

now suzanne takes your hand
and she leads you to the river
she is wearing rags and feathers
from salvation army counters
and the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbour
and she shows you where to look
among the garbage and the flowers
there are heroes in the seaweed
there are children in the morning
they are leaning out for love
and they will lean that way forever
while suzanne holds the mirror

and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know you can trust her
for she's touched your perfect body with her mind 

i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
you were talking so brave and so sweet
givin' me head on the unmade bed
while the limousines wait in the street
those were the reasons, that was new york
we were runnin' for the money and the flesh
and that was called love for the workers in song
probably still is for those of them left
yeah, but you got away, didn't you babe?
you just turned your back on the crowd
when you got away, i never once heard you say
i need you
i don't need you
i need you
i don't need you
and all of that jivin' around
i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
you were famous, your heart was a legend
you told me again, you preferred handsome men
but for me you would make an exception
and clenching your fist for the ones like us
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
you fixed yourself, you said "well nevermind
we are ugly but we have the music"
and then you got away didn't you babe?
you just turned your back on the crowd
when you got away i never once heard you say
i need you
i don't need you
i need you
i don't need you
and all of that jivin' around
i don't mean to suggest
that i loved you the best
i can't keep track of each fallen robin
i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
that's all, i don't think of you that often 

it's four in the morning, the end of december
i'm writing you now just to see if you're better
new york is cold, but i like where i'm living
there's music on clinton street all through the evening
i hear that you're building
your little house deep in the desert
you're living for nothing now
i hope you're keeping some kind of record

yes, and jane came by with a lock of your hair
she said that you gave it to her
that night that you planned to go clear
did you ever go clear?

oh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
you'd been to the station to meet every train
but then you came home without lili marlene
and you treated my woman
to a flake of your life
and when she came back
she was nobody's wife
well, i see you there with the rose in your teeth
one more thin gypsy thief
well i see jane's awake
she sends her regard

and what can i tell you my brother, my killer?
what can i possibly say?
i guess that i miss you. i guess i forgive you
i'm glad you stood in my way
if you ever come by here
for jane or for me
well, your enemy is sleeping
and his woman is free

yes, and thanks for the trouble
you took from her eyes
i thought it was there for good
so i never tried
and jane came by with a lock of your hair
she said that you gave it to her
that night that you planned to go clear
sincerely, l. cohen 

dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic 'til i'm gathered safely in
lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love

oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
let me feel you moving like they do in babylon
show me slowly what i only know the limits of
oh, dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love

dance me to the wedding now, oh, dance me on and on
dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
we're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love

dance me to the children who are asking to be born
dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
dance me to the end of love

dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic 'til i'm gathered safely in
touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love 

everybody knows that the dice are loaded
everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
everybody knows the war is over
everybody knows the good guys lost
everybody knows the fight was fixed
the poor stay poor, the rich get rich
that's how it goes
everybody knows

everybody knows that the boat is leaking
everybody knows the captain lied
everybody got this broken feeling
like their father or their dog just died
everybody talking to their pockets
everybody wants a box of chocolates
and a long-stem rose
everybody knows
and everybody knows that you love me baby
everybody knows that you really do
everybody knows that you've been faithful
ah, give or take a night or two
everybody knows you've been discreet
but there were so many people you just had to meet
without your clothes
and everybody knows
everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows
everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows

and everybody knows that it's now or never
everybody knows that it's me or you
and everybody knows that you live forever
ah when you've done a line or two
everybody knows the deal is rotten
old black joe's still pickin' cotton
for your ribbons and bows
and everybody knows

and everybody knows that the plague is coming
everybody knows that it's moving fast
everybody knows that the naked man and woman
are just a shining artifact of the past
everybody knows the scene is dead
but there's gonna be a meter on your bed
that will disclose
what everybody knows
and everybody knows that you're in trouble
everybody knows what you've been through
from the bloody cross on top of calvary
to the beach of malibu
everybody knows it's coming apart
take one last look at this sacred heart
before it blows
and everybody knows

everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows
everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows
everybody knows 

the birds they sang
at the break of day
start again
i heard them say
don't dwell on what
has passed away
or what is yet to be
yeah the wars they will
be fought again
the holy dove
she will be caught again
bought and sold
and bought again
the dove is never free
ring the bells that still can ring
forget your perfect offering
there is a crack, a crack in everything
that's how the light gets in
we asked for signs
the signs were sent:
the birth betrayed
the marriage spent
yeah the widowhood
of every government
signs for all to see
i can't run no more
with that lawless crowd
while the killers in high places
say their prayers out loud
but they've summoned, they've summoned up
a thundercloud
and they're going to hear from me
ring the bells that still ring
forget your perfect offering
there is a crack, a crack in everything
that's how the light gets in
you can add up the parts
you won't have the sum
you can strike up the march
there is no drum
every heart, every heart
to love will come
but like a refugee
ring the bells that still can ring
forget your perfect offering
there is a crack, a crack in everything
that's how the light gets in
ring the bells that still can ring
forget your perfect offering
there is a crack, a crack in everything
that's how the light gets in
that's how the light gets in
that's how the light gets in 

come over to the window, my little darling
i'd like to try to read your palm
i used to think i was some kind of gypsy boy
before i let you take me home
now so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

well you know that i love to live with you
but you make me forget so very much
i forget to pray for the angels
and then the angels forget to pray for us
now so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

we met when we were almost young
deep in the green lilac park
you held on to me like i was a crucifix
as we went kneeling through the dark
oh so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

your letters they all say that you're beside me now
then why do i feel alone?
i'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
is fastening my ankle to a stone
now so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again
for now i need your hidden love
i'm cold as a new razor blade
you left when i told you i was curious
i never said that i was brave
oh so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

oh, you are really such a pretty one
i see you've gone and changed your name again
and just when i climbed this whole mountainside
to wash my eyelids in the rain
oh so long, marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again 

give me back my broken night
my mirrored room, my secret life
it's lonely here
there's no one left to torture
give me absolute control
over every living soul
and lie beside me, baby
that's an order!
give me crack and anal sex
take the only tree that's left
and stuff it up the hole
in your culture
give me back the berlin wall
give me stalin and st. paul
i've seen the future, brother
it is murder
things are going to slide (slide) in all directions
won't be nothing (won't be)
nothing you can measure anymore
the blizzard, the blizzard of the world
has crossed the threshold
and it's overturned
the order of the soul
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
you don't know me from the wind
you never will, you never did
i'm the little jew
who wrote the bible
i've seen the nations rise and fall
i've heard their stories, heard them all
but love's the only engine
of survival
your servant here, he has been told
to say it clear, to say it cold
it's over, it ain't going any further
and now the wheels of heaven stop
you feel the devil's riding crop
get ready for the future: it is murder
things are going to slide (slide) in all directions
won't be nothing (won't be)
nothing you can measure anymore
the blizzard, the blizzard of the world
has crossed the threshold
and it's overturned the order of the soul
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
there'll be the breaking of the ancient western code
your private life will suddenly explode
there'll be phantoms, there'll be fires on the road
and the white man dancing
you'll see your woman hanging upside down
her features covered by her fallen gown
and all the lousy little poets coming round
trying to sound like charlie manson
yeah the white man dancing
give me back the berlin wall
give me stalin and st. paul
give me christ
or give me hiroshima
destroy another fetus now
we don't like children anyhow
i've seen the future, baby: it is murder
things are going to slide (slide) in all directions
won't be nothing (won't be), nothing you can measure anymore
the blizzard, the blizzard of the world
has crossed the threshold
and it's overturned
the order of the soul
when they said (they said) repent (repent)
repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent)
repent (repent)
i wonder what they meant
when they said (they said) repent (repent)
repent (repent) 

i've seen you change the water into wine
i've seen you change it back to water, too
i sit at your table every night
i try but i just don't get high with you

i wish there was a treaty we could sign
i do not care who takes this bloody hill
i'm angry and i'm tired all the time
i wish there was a treaty, i wish there was a treaty
between your love and mine

ah, they're dancing in the street—it's jubilee
we sold ourselves for love but now we're free
i'm so sorry for that ghost i made you be
only one of us was real and that was me

i haven't said a word since you been gone
that any liar couldn't say as well
i just can't believe the static coming on
you were my ground, my safe and sound
you were my aerial
ah, the fields are crying out—it's jubilee
we sold ourselves for love but now we're free
i'm so sorry for that ghost i made you be
only one of us was real and that was me

i heard the snake was baffled by his sin
he shed his scales to find the snake within
but born again is born without a skin
the poison enters into everything

and i wish there was a treaty we could sign
i do not care who takes this bloody hill
i'm angry and i'm tired all the time
i wish there was a treaty, i wish there was a treaty
between your love and mine 

like a bird on the wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free
like a worm on a hook
like a knight from some old fashioned book
i have saved all my ribbons for thee
if i, if i have been unkind
i hope that you can just let it go by
if i, if i have been untrue
i hope you know it was never to you
like a baby, stillborn
like a beast with his horn
i have torn everyone who reached out for me
but i swear by this song
and by all that i have done wrong
i will make it all up to thee
i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
he said to me, "you must not ask for so much."
and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
she cried to me, "hey, why not ask for more?"
oh like a bird on the wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free 

the war was lost
the treaty signed
i was not caught
i crossed the line
i was not caught
though many tried
i live among you
well-disguised
i had to leave
my life behind
i dug some graves
you'll never find
the story's told
with facts and lies
i had a name
but never mind
never mind
never mind
the war was lost
the treaty signed
there's truth that lives
and truth that dies
i don't know which
so never mind
(...السلام و السلام)
your victory
was so complete
some among you
thought to keep
a record of
our little lives
the clothes we wore
our spoons our knives
the games of luck
our soldiers played
the stones we cut
the songs we made
our law of peace
which understands
a husband leads
a wife commands
and all of these
expressions of the
sweet indifference
some called love
the high indifference
some call fate
but we had names
more intimate
names so deep
and names so true
they're blood to me
they're dust to you
there is no need
and this survives
there's truth that lives
and truth that dies
never mind
never mind
i live the life
i left behind
there's truth that lives
and truth that dies
i don't know which
so never mind
(...السلام و السلام)
i could not kill
the way you kill
i could not hate
i tried, i failed
you turned me in
at least you tried
you side with them whom
you despise
this was your heart
this swarm of flies
this was once your mouth
this bowl of lies
you serve them well
i'm not surprised
you're of their kin
you're of their kind
never mind
never mind
i had to leave my
life behind
the story's told
with facts and lies
you own the world
so never mind
never mind
never mind
i live the life
i left behind
i live it full
i live it wide
through layers of time
you can't divide
my woman's here
my children too
their graves are safe
from ghosts like you
in places deep
with roots entwined
i live the life
i left behind
السلام و السلام
the war was lost
the treaty signed
i was not caught
across the line
i was not caught
tho many tried
i live among you
well-disguised

{no man can see
the vast design
or who will be
last of his kind} 

when they poured across the border
i was cautioned to surrender
this i could not do;
i took my gun and vanished
i have changed my name so often
i've lost my wife and children
but i have many friends
and some of them are with me
an old woman gave us shelter
kept us hidden in the garret
then the soldiers came;
she died without a whisper
there were three of us this morning
i'm the only one this evening
but i must go on;
the frontiers are my prison
oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
through the graves the wind is blowing
freedom soon will come;
then we'll come from the shadows
les allemands étaient chez moi
ils me dirent, "signe-toi,"
mais je n'ai pas peur;
j'ai repris mon arme
j'ai changé cent fois de nom
j'ai perdu femme et enfants
mais j'ai tant d'amis;
j'ai la france entière
un vieil homme dans un grenier
pour la nuit nous a caché
les allemands l'ont pris;
il est mort sans surprise
oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
through the graves the wind is blowing
freedom soon will come;
then we'll come from the shadows 

well i stepped into an avalanche
it covered up my soul;
when i am not this hunchback that you see
i sleep beneath the golden hill
you who wish to conquer pain
you must learn, learn to serve me well
you strike my side by accident
as you go down for your gold
the cripple here that you clothe and feed
is neither starved nor cold;
he does not ask for your company
not at the centre, the centre of the world
when i am on a pedestal
you did not raise me there
your laws do not compel me
to kneel grotesque and bare
i myself am the pedestal
for this ugly hump at which you stare
you who wish to conquer pain
you must learn what makes me kind;
the crumbs of love that you offer me
they're the crumbs i've left behind
your pain is no credential here
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound
i have begun to long for you
i who have no greed
i have begun to ask for you
i who have no need
you say you've gone away from me
but i can feel you when you breathe
do not dress in those rags for me
i know you are not poor
you don't love me quite so fiercely now
when you know that you are not sure
it is your turn, beloved
it is your flesh that i wear 

you came to me this morning
and you handled me like meat
you’d have to be a man to know
how good that feels, how sweet
my mirrored twin, my next of kin
i’d know you in my sleep
and who but you would take me in
a thousand kisses deep
i loved you when you opened like a
lily to the heat
you see i’m just another snowman
standing in the rain and sleet
who loved you with his frozen love
his second hand physique
with all he is, and all he was
a thousand kisses deep
i know you had to lie to me
i know you had to cheat
to pose all hot and hide behind
the veils of sheer deceit
our perfect porn aristocrat
so elegant and cheap
i’m old but i’m still into that
a thousand kisses deep
i’m good at love, i’m good at hate
it's in between i freeze
been working out, but its too late
it’s been too late for years
but you look good, you really do
the pride of boogie street,
somebody must have died for you
a thousand kisses deep
the autumn moved across your skin
got something in my eye
a light that doesn’t need to live
and doesn’t need to die
a riddle in the book of love
obscure and obsolete
until witnessed here in time and blood
a thousand kisses deep
and i'm still working with the wine
still dancing cheek to cheek
the band is playing auld lang syne
but the heart will not retreat
i ran with diz and dante
i never had their sweep
but once or twice they let me play
a thousand kisses deep
i loved you when you opened
like a lily to the heat
you see i'm just another snowman
standing in the rain and sleet
but you don’t need to hear me now
and every word i speak
it counts against me anyhow
a thousand kisses deep 

it's true that all the men you knew were dealers
who said they were through with dealing
every time you gave them shelter
i know that kind of man
it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
and then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
and then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
"i told you when i came i was a stranger
i told you when i came i was a stranger"
but now another stranger seems
to want you to ignore his dreams
as though they were the burden of some other
o you've seen that man before
his golden arm dispatching cards
but now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
and he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter
ah you hate to watch another tired man
lay down his hand
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
and while he talks his dreams to sleep
you notice there's a highway
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
it's curling just like smoke above his shoulder
you tell him to come in sit down
but something makes you turn around
the door is open, you can't close your shelter
you try the handle of the road
it opens do not be afraid
it's you my love, you who are the stranger
it is you my love, you who are the stranger
"well, i've been waitin', i was sure
we'd meet between the trains we're waitin' for
i think it's time to board another
please understand, i never had a secret chart
to get me to the heart of this
or any other matter"
when he talks like this you don't know what he's after
when he speaks like this you don't know what he's after
"let's meet tomorrow if you choose
upon the shore, beneath the bridge
that they are building on some endless river"
then he leaves the platform
for the sleeping car that's warm
you realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
and it comes to you, he never was a stranger
and you say, "ok, the bridge or someplace later"
and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
and then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
and then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
"i told you when i came i was a stranger
i told you when i came i was a stranger
i told you when i came i was a stranger
i told you when i came i was a stranger" 

the ponies run, the girls are young
the odds are there to beat
you win a while, and then it's done
your little winning streak
and summoned now to deal
with your invincible defeat
you live your life as if it's real
a thousand kisses deep
i'm turning tricks, i'm getting fixed
i'm back on boogie street
you lose your grip, and then you slip
into the masterpiece
and maybe i had miles to drive
and promises to keep
you ditch it all to stay alive
a thousand kisses deep

and sometimes when the night is slow
the wretched and the meek
we gather up our hearts and go
a thousand kisses deep
confined to sex, we pressed against
the limits of the sea
i saw there were no oceans left
for scavengers like me
i made it to the forward deck
i blessed our remnant fleet
and then consented to be wrecked
a thousand kisses deep
i'm turning tricks, i'm getting fixed
i'm back on boogie street
i guess they won't exchange the gifts
that you were meant to keep
and quiet is the thought of you
the file on you complete
except what we forgot to do
a thousand kisses deep

and sometimes when the night is slow
the wretched and the meek
we gather up our hearts and go
a thousand kisses deep
the ponies run, the girls are young
the odds are there to beat
you win a while, and then it’s done
your little winning streak
and summoned now to deal
with your invincible defeat
you live your life as if it’s real
a thousand kisses deep 

i loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
yes, many loved before us, i know that we are not new
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try
your eyes are soft with sorrow
hey, that's no way to say goodbye
i'm not looking for another as i wander in my time
walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
your eyes are soft with sorrow
hey, that's no way to say goodbye
i loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
yes many loved before us, i know that we are not new
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
your eyes are soft with sorrow
hey, that's no way to say goodbye 

they sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
for tryin' to change the system from within
i'm coming now, i'm coming to reward them
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
i'm guided by a signal in the heavens
i'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
i'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
i'd really like to live beside you, baby
i love your body and your spirit and your clothes
but you see that line there moving through the station?
i told you, i told you, told you, i was one of those
ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that i just might win
you know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
how many nights i prayed for this, to let my work begin
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
i don't like your fashion business, mister
and i don't like these drugs that keep you thin
i don't like what happened to my sister
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
i'd really like to live beside you, baby
i love your body and your spirit and your clothes
but you see that line there moving through the station?
i told you, i told you, told you, i was one of those
and i thank you for those items that you sent me
the monkey and the plywood violin
i practiced every night, now i'm ready
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
(i am guided)
ah remember me, i used to live for music (baby)
remember me, i brought your groceries in (ooh baby yeah)
well it's father's day and everybody's wounded (baby)
first we take manhattan, then we take berlin
