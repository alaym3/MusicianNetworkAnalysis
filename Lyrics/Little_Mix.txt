when you hold me in the street
and you kiss me on the dance floor
i wish that it could be like that
why can't it be like that? cause i'm yours

we keep behind closed doors
every time i see you, i die a little more
stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
it'll never be enough
it's obvious you're meant for me
every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
every second, every thought, i'm in so deep
but i'll never show it on my face

but we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

why can't you hold me in the street?
why can't i kiss you on the dance floor?
i wish that it could be like that
why can't we be like that? cause i'm yours

when you're with him, do you call his name
like you do when you're with me? does it feel the same?
would you leave if i was ready to settle down?
or would you play it safe and stay?

girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

why can't you hold me in the street?
why can't i kiss you on the dance floor?
i wish that it could be like that
why can't we be like that? cause i'm yours

and nobody knows i'm in love with someone's baby
i don't wanna hide us away
tell the world about the love we making
i'm living for that day, someday

why can't i hold you in the street?
why can't i kiss you on the dance floor?
i wish that we could be like that
why can't we be like that? cause i'm yours, i'm yours

oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
why can't i kiss you on the dance floor?
i wish that it could be like that (i wish)

why can't i say that i'm in love?
i wanna shout it from the rooftops
i wish that it could be like that (i wish)
why can't we be like that? cause i'm yours

why can't we be like that?
wish we could be like that

i always say what i'm feeling
i was born without a zip on my mouth
sometimes i don't even mean it
it takes a little while to figure me out
i like my coffee with two sugars in it
high heels and my jewellery dripping
drink and i get all fired up (hey, hey, hey)
insecure but i'm working with it
many things that i could get rid of
ain't about to give it up

i made a few mistakes, i regret it nightly
i broke a couple hearts that i wear on my sleeve
my mama always said, "girl, you're trouble" and
and now i wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
and every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
i can tell you're shy and i think you're so sweet
spending every night under covers and
still i wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(a woman)

woman like me, like a woman like me
la-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)
la-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

and baby, just be mine for the weekend
we can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
or we could just go out for the evening
hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
you got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
my hair with your fingers in it
love it when you turn me on
'yoncé with a little bit of
"love drunk" in the middle with it
get down to our favorite song

i made a few mistakes, i regret it nightly
i broke a couple hearts that i wear on my sleeve
my mama always said, "girl, you're trouble" and

doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

in a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that i knew
he made me feel like a woman
we were young and silly fools
anyway, he was in a band
wrote love songs about me
i wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
went something like

doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

every time we go dancing, i see his straying eyes
gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times
anyway, he start acting dumb, then i'll be on my way to leave
but i stopped in the tracks when i heard this melody
and it went like

doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

he used to sing me sweet melodies
he played me, made me believe it was real love
sang me sweet melodies
but the day he did me wrong
the song couldn't go on and on and on
he used to sing me sweet melodies
he played me, made me believe it was real love
sang me sweet melodies
but the day he did me wrong
the song couldn't go on and on and on

he would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
i was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet
that's when he came along, that's when i lost the groove
there was no song in the world
to sing along or make me move
sounded something like

doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (it was,)
doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (oh)

he used to sing me sweet melodies (oh-woah)

sang me sweet melodies
but the day he did me wrong (ah, yeah)

doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (oh, woah)

on and on, on and on
he used to sing me sweet melodies
he played me, made me believe it was real love
sing me sweet melodies
but the day he did me wrong (me wrong)
the song couldn't go on and on and on
on and on, and on, yeah

he used to sing me sweet melodies (melodies, yeah)

sang me sweet melodies, oh-oh
but the day he did me wrong (did me wrong)
the song couldn't go on and on and on

i've got wine and make-up wipes
i'll hold you (i'll hold you), i'll hold you (i'll hold you)
we can put the kettle on
talk 'bout how he's not the one (oh, yeah, yeah)
i told you
but, i'm never gonna say i told you so, oh

sha-la-la-la
sha-la-la-la

he might got the biggest ca-a-ar
don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles
said he got a lot of ca-a-ash
darling he can't buy my love, it's you i'm dreaming of

they try to romance me but you got that nasty
and that's what i want (that's what i want)
so baby, baby, come and save me
don't need those other numbers when i got my number one

last night i lay in bed so blue
'cause i realized the truth, they can't love me like you
i tried to find somebody new
baby, they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you (ah)

used to get it when i wa-a-ant
you were pouring out your love, i could never get enough
now i'm dealing with these boys
when i really need a man who can do it like i can

they try to romance me but you got that nasty
and that's what i want (that's what i want)
so baby, baby, come and save me
