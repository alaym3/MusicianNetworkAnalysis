just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
i walked out this morning and i wrote down this song
i just can't remember who to send it to

i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you again

won't you look down upon me, jesus
you've got to help me make a stand
you've just got to see me through another day
my body's aching and my time is at hand
and i won't make it any other way

oh, i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you again

been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

oh, i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you baby, one more time again, now

thought i'd see you one more time again
there's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
thought i'd see you, thought i'd see you, fire and rain, now

in my mind, i'm going to carolina
can't you see the sunshine?
now can't you just feel the moonshine?
and ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
yes, i'm going to carolina in my mind

karen, she's a silver sun
you best walk her way and watch it shine
watch her watch the morning come
a silver tear appearing now i'm crying, ain't i?
i'm going to carolina in my mind

there ain't no doubt in no one's mind
that love's the finest thing around
whisper something soft and kind
and hey, baby, the sky's on fire, i'm dying, ain't i?
i'm going to carolina in my mind

in my mind, i'm gone to carolina
can't you see the sunshine?
now can't you just feel the moonshine?
and ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
yes, i'm goin' to carolina in my mind

dark and silent late last night
i think i might have heard the highway call
geese in flight and dogs that bite
the signs that might be omens say i'm going, going
gone to carolina in my mind

now where holy host of others standing around me
still i'm on the dark side of the moon
and it looks like it goes on like this forever
you must forgive me
if its up and gone to carolina in my mind

in my mind i'm gone to carolina
can't you see the sunshine?
can't you just feel the moonshine?
and ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
yes, i'm gone to carolina in my mind
in my mind, i'm gone to carolina
can't you see the sunshine?
now can't you just feel the moonshine?
and ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
yes, i'm gone to carolina in my mind

gotta make it back home again soon
gotta get back to carolina soon
gotta make it back to my home again soon
oh no, gotta get back to carolina soon
carolina, yeah
gotta get back home soon
i can't travel no more, baby
gotta get back home again
gotta get back to carolina soon
gotta get back on home again soon

oh yeah yeah
you've got a friend

there is a young cowboy he lives on the range
his horse and his cattle are his only companions
he works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
waiting for summer, his pastures to change
and as the moon rises, he sits by his fire
thinking about women and glasses of beer
and closing his eyes as the dogies retire
he sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
as if maybe someone could hear
goodnight you moonlight ladies
rockabye sweet baby james
deep greens and blues are the colors i choose
won't you let me go down in my dreams?
and rockabye sweet baby james
now the first of december was covered with snow
so was the turnpike from stockbridge to boston
now the berkshires seemed dreamlike
on account of that frosting
with ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go, whoa
there's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
a song that they sing when they take to the sea
a song that they sing of their home in the sky
maybe you can believe it, if it helps you to sleep
but singing works just fine for me
so goodnight all you moonlight ladies
rockabye sweet baby james
deep greens and blues are the colors i choose
won't you let me go down in my dreams?
and rockabye sweet baby james

whenever i see your smiling face
i have to smile myself
because i love you (yes, i do)
and when you give me that pretty little pout
it turns me inside out
there's something about you, baby (i don't know)

isn't it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
it will grow stronger every day
oh, how much longer

a couple of times before
with the girl next door
but that was long before i met you

and i thank my lucky stars
that you are who you are
and not just another lovely lady
sent down to break my heart

isn't it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
it will grow stronger every day

way down here, you need a reason to move
feel a fool, running your stateside games
lose your load, leave your mind behind, baby james

oh, mexico
it sounds so simple, i just got to go
the sun's so hot i forgot to go home
guess i'll have to go now

americano got the sleepy eye
but his body's still shaking like a live wire
sleepy señorita with the eyes on fire

oh, mexico
it sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
the moon's so bright like to light up the night
make everything all right

baby's hungry and the money's all gone
the folks back home don't wanna talk on the phone
she gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
times are hard

oh, down in mexico
i never really been so i don't really know
oh, mexico
i guess i'll have to go
oh, mexico
i never really been but i'd sure like to go
sing woah, mexico
i guess i'll have to go now

talking 'bout in mexico (mexico)
in a honky-tonk down in mexico
oh, mexico, mexico, mexico
oh, mexico, mexico, mexico
oh, mexico, mexico, mexico
oh, mexico, mexico

even the old folks never knew
why they call it like they do
i was wondering since the age of two
down on copperline
copper head, copper beech
copper kettles sitting side by each
copper coil, cup o'georgia peach
down on copperline
half a mile down to morgan creek
leaning heavy on the end of the week
hercules and a hog-nosed snake
down on copperline
we were down on copperline
one summer night on the copperline
slip away past supper time
wood smoke and moonshine
down on copperline
one time i saw my daddy dance
watched him moving like a man in a trance
he brought it back from the war in france
down onto copperline
branch water and tomato wine
creosote and turpentine
sour mash and new moon shine
down on copperline
down on copperline
first kiss ever i took
like a page from a romance book
the sky opened and the earth shook
down on copperline
down on copperline yeah
took a fall from a windy height
i only knew how to hold on tight
and pray for love enough to last all night
down on copperline
day breaks and the boys wakes up
and the dog barks and the birds sings
and the sap rises and the angels sigh, yeah
i tried to go back, as if i could
all spec house and plywood
tore up and tore up good
down on copperline
it doesn't come as a surprise to me
it doesn't touch my memory
man i'm lifting up and rising free
down on over copperline
half a mile down to morgan creek
i'm only living for the end of the week
hercules and a hog-nosed snake
down on copperline yeah
take me down on copperline
oh down on copperline
take me down on copperline

there's something in the way she moves
or looks my way or calls my name
that seems to leave this troubled world behind
and if i'm feeling down and blue
or troubled by some foolish game
she always seems to make me change my mind

and i feel fine anytime she's around me now
she's around me now almost all the time
and if i'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
she's been with me now
quite a long, long time and i feel fine

every now and then the things i lean on lose their meaning
and i find myself careening
in places where i should not let me go
she has the power to go where no one else can find me
and to silently remind me
of the happiness and good times that i know

just got to know them, it isn't what she's got to say
or how she thinks and where she's been
to me the words are nice the way they sound
i like to hear them best that way
it doesn't much matter what they mean
she says them mostly just to calm me down

and i feel fine anytime she's around me now
she's around me now almost all the time
and if i'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
she's been with me now
quite a long, long time and i feel fine

how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you

i needed the shelter of someone's arms
there you were
i needed someone to understand my ups and downs
there you were
with sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion

i want to stop and thank you baby
i want to stop and thank you baby, yes i do
how sweet it is to be loved by you, feels so fine
how sweet it is to be loved by you

i close my eyes at night
wondering where would i be without you in my life
everything i did was just a bore
everywhere i went it seems i'd been there before
but you brighten up for me all of my days
with a love so sweet in so many ways

i want to stop and thank you baby
i just want to stop and thank you baby, whoa yes
how sweet it is to be loved by you (it's just like sugar sometimes)
how sweet it is to be loved by you, whoa yeah

you were better to me than i was to myself
for me there's you and there ain't nobody else

i want to stop and thank you baby
i just want to stop and thank you baby, oh yes
how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you
oh now, how sweet it is to be loved by you
it's like jelly baby, oh now
how sweet it is to be loved by you
just like honey to the bee, baby, yeah now
how sweet it is to be loved by you

when this old world starts a-getting me down
and people are just too much for me to face
i'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
and all my cares just drift right into space
on the roof, it's peaceful as can be
and there the world below don't bother me, no, no
so when i come home feeling tired and beat
i'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
i'll get far away from the hustling crowd
and all that rat-race noise down in the street
on the roof, that's the only place i know
look at the city, baby
where you just have to wish to make it so
let's go up on the roof
and at night the stars, they put on a show for free
and, darling, you can share it all with me
that's what i said, keep on telling you
that right smack dab in the middle of town
i found a paradise that's trouble-proof
and if this old world starts a-getting you down
there's room enough for two
up on the roof, up on the roof, up on the roof oh now
everything is all right, every thing is all right, come on
put down what you're doing tonight
and climb up the stairs with me and see me
you got the stars above and the city lights below oh whoa
come on up the roof now

the water is wide
i can't cross over
and neither have
i wings to fly
build me a boat
that can carry two
and both shall row
my love and i
there is a ship
and she sails the sea
she's loaded deep
as deep can be
but not so deep
as the love i'm in
i know not how
i sink or swim
oh love is handsome
and love is fine
the sweetest flower
when first it's new
but love grows old
and waxes cold
and fades away
like summer dew
build me a boat
that can carry two
and both shall row
my love and i
and both shall row
my love and i

long ago, but not so very long ago
the world was different, oh yes, it was
you settled down and you built a town and made it live
and you watched it grow, it was your town
time goes by, time brings changes, you changed too
nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
you never see it coming when the world caves in on you
on your town, nothing you can do
main street isn't main street anymore
lights don't shine as brightly as they shone before
to tell the truth, lights don't shine at all
in our town
sun comes up each morning, just like it's always done
get up, go to work, start a new day
you open up for business that's never going to come
as the world rolls by a million miles away
main street isn't main street anymore
no one seems to need us like they did before
it's hard to find a reason left to stay
but it's our town, love it anyway
come what may, it's our town

moving in silent desperation
keeping an eye on the holy land
a hypothetical destination
say, who is this walking man?
well, the leaves have come to turning
and the goose has gone to fly
and bridges are for burning
so don't you let that yearning
pass you by
walking man, walking man walks
well, any other man stops and talks
but the walking man walks
well the frost is on the pumpkin
and the hay is in the barn yeah
and pappy's come to rambling on
stumbling around drunk
down on the farm
and the walking man walks
doesn't know nothing at all
any other man stops and talks
but the walking man walks on by
walk on by
most everybody's got seed to sow
it ain't always easy for a weed to grow, no no
so he don't hoe the row for no one
for sure one's always missing
and something is never quite right
ah, but who would want to listen to you
kissing his existence good night
walking man walk on by my door
well, any other man stops and talks
but not the walking man
he's the walking man
born to walk
walk on walking man
well now, would he have wings to fly
oh would he be free
golden wings against the sky
walking man, walk on by
so long, walking man, so long

if i keep on talking now
i'll only start repeating myself
and all i can say is
i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you
if i slip and tip my hand
i'm certain to scare you away
then what would i say?
i'd be hurting, i'm certain
i'd be uncool to let you know
that you're the one
the fool who jumped the gun
cause i've been advised by other guys
you've left behind
your good byes are somewhat unrefined
but if i play my role just right
tonight could be my lucky night
and you could be mine
if i present it to you
with a flower in the moonlight
shiny and new
well, you couldn't say no tonight
if i keep my heart out of sight
if i play my role just right
then tonight could be my lucky night
and you could be mine
if i present it to you
with a flower in the moonlight
oh shiny and new
well, you couldn't say no tonight
if i keep my heart out of sight

i really can't stay
baby, it's cold outside
i've got to go away
oh darling, it's cold outside
this evening has been
just hoping that you'd drop in
so very nice
i'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
my mother will start to worry
beautiful, what's your hurry?
my father will be pacing the floor
listen to that fireplace roar
so really i'd better scurry
oh beautiful, please don't hurry
well, maybe just a half a drink more
why don't you put some music on while i pour
the neighbors will think
baby, it's bad out there
say, what's in this drink?
there's no cabs to be had out there
i wish i knew how
your eyes are like starlight now
to break this spell
i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
i ought to say no, sir
mind if i move in a little closer?
at least i'm going to say that i tried
oh, what's the sense in hurting my pride?
i really can't stay
baby, don't hold out
ah, but it's cold outside

what are you doing with your coat?
you don't need your coat
what are you putting your coat on for?
it's warm in here
you don't understand

i simply must go
baby, it's cold outside
oh, the answer is no
oh darling, it's cold outside
this welcome has been
i'm lucky that you dropped in
so nice and warm
look out the window at that storm
my sister will be suspicious
please but your lips look so delicious
my brother will be there at the door
waves upon a tropical shore
my maiden aunt's mind is vicious
oh but your lips look delicious
well, maybe just a half a drink more
there was never such a blizzard before
ooh, i got to go home
baby, you'll freeze out there
say, lend me your coat
it's up to your knees out there
you've really been grand
i thrill when you touch my hand
but don't you see
how can you do this thing to me?
there's bound to be talk tomorrow
think of my lifelong sorrow
at least there will be plenty implied
if you caught pneumonia and died
i really can't stay
get over that old out
ah, but it's cold outside
ah, but it's cold outside

baby, it's cold outside
baby, it's cold outside
it's cold outside
it's cold
baby, it's cold outside
you know that it's, you know that it's cold outside
ah, it's cold outside

darling, as a friend
sure, james
as a friend you, you must stay and, and warm up by this fire little bit
let me get you, let me get you a hot toddy or something
well, i really can't, i mean, my mother will worry about me
people are so suspicious, it's just an innocent suggesting
you stay warm and keep yourself healthy that's all
it's nippy out there, it's cold
oh, you know that drink does look kinda nice
it is a perfectly nice drink

baby, it's cold out; baby, it's cold
it's warm in here
baby, it's cold out
baby, it's cold outside

i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care
but i don't care even if i was a fool
i'm still in love with you
had i listened to the grapevine
i might have had my doubts
but i did my level best
just to block them out
cause love is so unwise
and love has no eyes
and it took a while for a fool to see
what his friends were on about
well i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care yeah
but i don't care even if i was a fool
i'm still in love with you
imagining your face
it almost fills the empty space before me
i can see you eyes
and almost hear your lovely lies oh yeah
i wish i was an old man
and love was through with me
i wish i was a baby
on my mama's knee
i wish i was a freight train
moving down the line
just to keep in track of time
without all these memories
well i was a fool to care
well i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care hey
but i don't care even if i was a fool
i'm still in love with you
baby, yes, i am
i could have opened my eyes
i could have seen through your lies
i could have stood for no more
i could have walked out the door
but i was a fool to care
i was a fool to care
well i was a fool to care
and i was a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) you weren't nothing but a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) just a country fool to care
(i was a fool to care) you weren't nothing but a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) just a country fool to care
(i was a fool to care) you weren't nothing but a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) just a country fool to care
(i was a fool to care) you weren't nothing but a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) just a country fool to care
(i was a fool to care) you weren't nothing but a fool to care
(i was a fool to care) just a country fool to care

so this old world must still be spinnin' around
and i still love you

and i can't sing the blues anymore
but i can sing this song

and no one's gonna take that time away
you can stay as long as you like

so close your eyes

i don't know no love songs
and i can't sing the blues anymore
but i can sing this song
