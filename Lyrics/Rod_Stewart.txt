i can tell by your eyes
that you've probably been crying forever
and the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
they're a mirror

i don't wanna talk about it
how you broke my heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here, won't you listen
to my heart?
oh, my heart

if i stand all alone
will the shadow hide the color of my heart?
blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
they're a mirror

i don't wanna talk about it
how you broke my heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here, won't you listen
to my heart?
oh, my heart


i don't wanna talk about it
how you broke this ole heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
oh, my heart
my heart
oh, my heart

sugar, sugar, oh

she sits alone waiting for suggestions
he's so nervous avoiding all the questions
his lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

if you want my body and you think i'm sexy
come on sugar let me know
if you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on honey tell me so
tell me so baby

he's acting shy looking for an answer
come on honey let's spend the night together
now hold on a minute before we go much further
give me a dime so i can phone my mother
they catch a cab to his high rise apartment
at last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

if you want my body and you think i'm sexy
come on honey tell me so
if you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on sugar let me know

his heart's beating like a drum
'cos at last he's got this girl home
relax baby now we are all alone


they wake at dawn 'cos all the birds are singing
two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
they got each other neither one's complaining
he says i'm sorry but i'm out of milk and coffee
never mind sugar we can watch the early movie

if you want my body and you think i'm sexy
come on sugar let me know
if you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on honey tell me so


if you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on sugar let me know
if you really, really, really, really need me
just let me know
just reach out and touch me
if you really want me
just reach out and touch me
come on sugar let me know
if you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on sugar let me know
if you, if you, if you really need me
just come on and tell me so

billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
and a head full of dreams
he said somehow, someway
it's gotta get better than this
patti packed her bags
left a note for her mama
she was just seventeen
there were tears in her eyes
when she kissed her little sister goodbye
they held each other tight
as they drove on through the night
they were so excited
we got just one shot of life
let's take it while we're still not afraid
because life is so brief
and time is a thief, when you're undecided
and like a fistful of sand
it can slip right through your hands

young hearts be free tonight
time is on your side
don't let them put you down
don't let 'em push you around
don't let 'em ever change your point of view

paradise was closed
so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
they took a tworoom apartment
that was jumping every night of the week
happiness was found in each other's arms
as expected, yeah
billy pierced his ears
drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

young hearts be free tonight
time is on your side
don't let them put you down
don't let 'em push you around
don't let 'em ever change your point of view

come on babe!


young hearts, be free tonight
time is on, on your side

billy wrote a letter back home
to patti's parents tryin' to explain
he said: "we're both real sorry
that it had to turn out this way"
but there ain't no point in talking
when there's nobody listening
so we just ran away
patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!

young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side

young hearts gotta run free
be free, live free
time is on, time is on your side
time, time, time
time is on your side
is on your side
is on your side
is on your side
young heart be free tonight
tonight, tonight, tonight
tonight, tonight, yeah

wake up, maggie
i think i got somethin' to say to you
it's late september
and i really should be back at school

i know i keep you amused
but i feel i'm being used
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
just to save you from being alone
you stole my heart and that's what really hurts

the morning sun, when it's in your face
really shows your age
but that don't worry me none
in my eyes, you're everything

i laughed at all of your jokes
my love you didn't need to coax
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
just to save you from being alone
you stole my soul and that's a pain i can do without

all i needed was a friend
to lend a guiding hand
but you turned into a lover, and mother, what a lover
you wore me out

all you did was wreck my bed
and in the morning kick me in the head
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
'cause you didn't want to be alone
you stole my heart, i couldn't leave you if i tried


i suppose i could collect my books
and get on back to school
or steal my daddy's cue
and make a living out of playing pool

or find myself a rock and roll band
that needs a helping hand
oh, maggie, i wished i'd never seen your face
you made a first-class fool out of me
but i'm as blind as a fool can be
you stole my heart, but i love you anyway


maggie, i wished i'd never seen your face
i'll get on back home one of these days
ooh, ooh, ooh

may the good lord be with you
down every road you roam
and may sunshine and happiness
surround you when you're far from home
and may you grow to be proud
dignified and true
and do unto others
as you'd have done to you

be courageous and be brave
and in my heart, you'll always stay
forever young, forever young
forever young, forever young

may good fortune be with you
may your guiding light be strong
build a stairway to heaven
with a prince or a vagabond

and may you never love in vain
and in my heart you will remain
forever young, forever young
forever young, forever young
forever young, forever young
yeah


and when you finally fly away
i'll be hoping that i served you well
for all the wisdom of a lifetime
no one can ever tell

but whatever road you choose
i'm right behind you, win or lose
forever young, forever young
forever young, forever young
forever young, forever young
for-forever young, forever young

and so you come to me with your questions
on a subject on which i'm well-versed
though i'm still as dumbfounded as the first time i found her
it's either a blessing or a curse
although i cannot offer solutions
it would be reckless of me to try
cause it's mystified man ever since time began
but hold on to your hat and i'll try

love is like a burning arrow
it can pierce the coldest heart
love is warm, love is patient
and the craziest thing you'll ever start, alright

i recall when i was a young man
a day i'm never allowed to forget
there was a girl that i met who i dreamed i would wed
forever our lives entwined
she said "you gotta stop worrying about the future
you know we're far too young for that
i wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring."
i never saw her pretty face again

love is life, love is yearning
it does not boast, but speaks the truth
love is fair and knows no boundaries
and the craziest thing you'll ever do, oh yeah
come on now

i wish you well in all of your travels
and may you find what you're searching for
it'll hit you like thunder when you find one another
and stay in your heart forevermore

love is like a four-leaf clover
hard to find and hold onto
love is blind, love is tender
and the craziest thing you'll ever do
so crazy

i am sailing, i am sailing
home again 'cross the sea
i am sailing, stormy waters
to be near you, to be free

i am flying, i am flying
like a bird 'cross the sky
i am flying, passing high clouds
to be with you, to be free

can you hear me, can you hear me
thro' the dark night, far away
i am dying, forever trying
to be with you, who can say
can you hear me, can you hear me
thro' the dark night far away
i am dying, forever crying
to be with you, who can say

we are sailing, we are sailing
home again 'cross the sea
we are sailing stormy waters
to be near you, to be free

oh lord, to be near you, to be free
oh (my) lord, to be near you, to be free
oh lord
oh lord, to be near you, to be free
oh (my) lord, to be near you, to be free
oh lord

ever seen a blind man cross the road
trying to make the other side?
ever seen a young girl growing old
trying to make herself a bride?

so what becomes of you my love
when they have finally stripped you of
the handbags and the gladrags
that your grandad had to sweat so you could buy?
baby

once i was a young man
and all i thought i had to do was smile
you are still a young girl
and you bought everything in style
listen

but once you think you're in, you're out
'cause you don't mean a single thing without
the handbags and the gladrags
that your grandad had to sweat so you could buy
ooh

sing a song of six-pence for your sake
and take a bottle full of rye
four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
and bake them all in a pie

they told me you missed school today
so what i suggest you just throw them all away
the handbags and the gladrags
that your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy
oh, woah

they told me you missed school today
so i suggest you just throw them all away
the handbags and the gladrags
that your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy ya, baby
bye, bye

stay away from my window
stay away from my back door too
disconnect the telephone line
relax baby and draw that blind

kick off your shoes and sit right down
loosen off that pretty french gown
let me pour you a good long drink
ooh, baby, don't you hesitate 'cause

tonight's the night
it's gonna be alright
'cause i love you girl
ain't nobody gonna stop us now

c'mon, angel, my hearts on fire
don't deny your man's desire
you'd be a fool to stop this tide
spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause

tonight's the night
it's gonna be alright
'cause i love you girl
ain't nobody gonna stop us now


don't say a word my virgin child
just let your inhibitions run wild
the secret is about to unfold
upstairs before the night's too old

tonight's the night
it's gonna be alright
'cause i love you woman
ain't nobody gonna stop us now

spent some time feelin' inferior
standing in front of my mirror
combed my hair in a thousand ways
but i came out looking just the same
daddy said, "son, you better see the world
i wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
but remember one thing don't lose your head
to a woman that'll spend your bread"
so i got out, woo

paris was a place you could hide away
if you felt you didn't fit in
french police wouldn't give me no peace
they claimed i was a nasty person
down along the left bank minding my own
was knocked down by a human stampede
got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
when all i wanted was a cup of tea
i was accused, woo
i moved on

down in rome, i wasn't getting enough
of the things that keep a young man alive
my body stunk but i kept my funk, woo
at a time when i was right out of luck
getting desperate, indeed i was, yeah
looking like a tourist attraction
oh my dear, i better get out of here
'fore the vatican don't give no sanction
i wasn't ready for that, no no

i moved right out east, yeah, listen
on the peking ferry i was feeling merry
sailing on my way back here
i fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
by the light of an eastern moon
shangai lil never used the pill
she claimed that it just ain't natural
she took me up on deck and bit my neck
oh people, i was glad i found her
oh yeah, i was glad i found her, woohoo
wait a minute

i firmly believe that i didn't need anyone but me
i sincerely thought i was so complete
look how wrong you can be
the women i've known i wouldn't let tie my shoe
they wouldn't give you the time of day
but the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
god i was glad i found her
and if they had the words i could tell to you
to help you on the way down the road
i couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats
'cause it's all been said before
make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off, ha
you didn't have to come here anyway

so remember, every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it
every picture tells a story, don't it

there are times to remember
and times that i wish to forget
our time together was tinged with love and regret
oh, my girl
my sweet, sweet little girl

didn't i try to tell ya that life was for living?
oh, didn't i?
and wasn't i the guy who said 'stay away from that tribe'?
oh, wasn't i?
and didn't i try to tell you 'that's stuffs gonna kill ya'?
oh, didn't i?
but you thought it was cool and i was just an old fool
oh, look at ya

you left home for the city with hollywood stars in your eyes
now your mother, god bless her, cries herself to sleep every night
oh my girl, my sweet innocent girl

didn't i search the streets for the beggars, pimps and cheats?
oh, didn't i?
and didn't i try to guide you to a baptism of fire?
oh, didn't i?
and didn't i try to warn ya 'bout that folk in california?
oh, didn't i?
but you said 'daddy, please don't worry, i got friends out there who love me'
now look at ya

oh baby, come back home, we can work this out
there is no blame
i wanna hold you close and stroke your hair and share your pain

didn't i do the best for you, try to make you stay in school?
didn't i?
once i was your hero but i went from ten to zero
oh, didn't i? now listen
for a roll on the dice you nearly paid the ultimate price
oh, didn't ya?
now i stand by your bedside, watching you fight for you life

where's the innocence? (where's the innocence? )
where's the future? (where is the future?)
where the beauty? (ooo)
where's the promise? (where is the promise?)
there are times to remember
and times that i wish to forget

i didn't know what day it was
when you walked into the room
i said hello unnoticed
you said goodbye too soon
breezing through the clientele
spinning yarns that were so lyrical
i really must confess right here
the attraction was purely physical
i took all those habits of yours
that in the beginning were hard to accept
your fashion sense, beardsley prints
i put down to experience
the big bosomed lady with the dutch accent
who tried to change my point of view
her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
but my heart cried out for you

you're in my heart, you're in my soul
you'll be my breath should i grow old
you are my lover, you're my best friend
you're in my soul

my love for you is immeasurable
my respect for you immense
you're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
you're beauty and elegance
you're a rhapsody, a comedy
you're a symphony and a play
you're every love song ever written
but honey, what do you see in me?

you're in my heart, you're in my soul
you'll be my breath should i grow old
you are my lover, you're my best friend
you're in my soul

you're an essay in glamour
please pardon the grammar
but you're every schoolboy's dream
you're celtic, united, but baby i've decided
you're the best team, i've ever seen
and there have been, many affairs
many times i've, thought to leave
but i bite my lip and turn around
cause you're the warmest thing, i've ever found

you're in my heart, you're in my soul
you'll be my breath should i grow old
you are my lover, you're my best friend
you're in my soul
you're in my heart, you're in my soul
you'll be my breath should i grow old
you are my lover, you're my best friend
you're in my soul
you're in my heart, you're in my soul
you'll be my breath should i grow old
you are my lover, you're my best friend
you're in my soul

i would have given you all of my heart
but there's someone who's torn it apart
and she's taken just all that i had
but if you want, i'll try to love again

baby, i'll try to love again but i know

the first cut is the deepest
baby, i know, the first cut is the deepest
when it come to being lucky, she's cursed
when it come to loving me, she's worst

i still want you by my side
just to help me dry the tears that i've cried
and i'm sure gonna give you a try
and if you want, i'll try to love again

baby, i'll try to love again but i know

the first cut is the deepest
baby, i know, the first cut is the deepest
and when it come to being lucky, she's cursed
when it come to loving me, she's worst

i still want you by my side
just to help me dry the tears that i've cried
but i'm sure gonna give you a try
'cause if you want, i'll try to love again

baby, i'll try to love again but i know

the first cut is the deepest
baby, i know, the first cut is the deepest
when it come to being lucky, she's cursed
when it come to loving me, she's worst

across the street, the river runs
down in the gutter, life is slipping away
let me still exist, in another place
running under cover of a helicopter blade
flames are getting higher in effigy
burning down the bridges of my memory
love may still be alive somewhere, someway
where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

oh, the rhythm of my heart
is beating like a drum
with the words, "i love you" rolling off my tongue
no, never will i roam
for i know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky, i'll be sailing

photographs and kerosene
light up my darkness
light it up! light it up!
i can still feel the touch
of your thin blue jeans
running down the alley, i've got my eyes all over you, baby
oh, baby

oh, the rhythm of my heart
is beating like a drum
with the words, "i love you" rolling off my tongue
no, never will i roam
for i know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky, i'll be sailing
i'll be sailing
i'll be sailing
i will

oh, i've got lightning in my veins
shifting like the handle of a slot machine
love may still exist in another place
i'm just yanking back the handle
no expression on my face

oh, the rhythm of my heart
is beating like a drum
with the words, "i love you" rolling off my tongue
no, never will i roam
for i know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky, i'll be sailing
oh, the rhythm of my heart
is beating like a drum
with the words, "i love you" rolling off my tongue
no, never will i roam
for i know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky, i'll be sailing
the rhythm of my heart
is beating like a drum
with the words, "i love you"
rolling off my tongue
no, never will i roam
for i know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky, i'll be sailing
ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh

who's that knocking on my door?
it's gotta be a quarter to four
is it you again coming 'round for more?
well you can love me tonight if you want
but in the morning make sure you're gone
i'm talkin' to you
hot legs
wearing me out
hot legs
you can scream and shout
hot legs
are you still in school?
i love you honey
gotta most persuasive tongue
you promise all kinds of fun
but what you don't understand
i'm a working man
gonna need a shot of vitamin e
by the time you're finished with me
i'm talking to you
hot legs
you're an alley cat
hot legs
you scratch my back
hot legs
bring your mother too
i love you honey
imagine how my daddy felt
in your jet black suspender belt
seventeen years old
he's touching sixty four
you got legs right up to your neck
you're making me a physical wreck
i'm talking to you
hot legs
in your satin shoes
hot legs
are you still in school?
hot legs
you're making me a fool
i love you honey
hot legs
making your mark
hot legs
keep my pencil sharp
hot legs
keep your hands to yourself
i love you honey
hot legs
you're wearing me out
hot legs
you can scream and shout
hot legs
you're still in school
i love you honey!

outside another yellow moon
has punched a hole in the night time mist
i climb through the window and down to the street
i'm shining like a new dime
the downtown trains are full
full of all them brooklyn girls
they try so hard to break out of their little worlds

you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
they have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
they're just thorns without the rose
be careful of them in the dark
oh if i was the one you chose to be your only one
oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

will i see you tonight on a downtown train
every night, every night its just the same
on a downtown train

i know your window and i know its late
i know your stairs and your doorway
i walk down your street and past your gate
i stand by the light of the four way
and watch them as they fall, oh baby
they all having their heart attacks
they stay at the carnival
but they'll never win you back

will i see you tonight on a downtown train
every night, every night its just the same
you leave me lonely
will i see you tonight on a downtown train
all my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
on a downtown train
will i see you tonight on a downtown train
every night, every night its just the same
will i see you tonight on a downtown train
all my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
on a downtown train
on a downtown train
all my dreams fall like rain
on a downtown train

when i need you
i just close my eyes and i'm with you
and all that i so want to give you
it's only a heartbeat away
when i need love
i hold out my hand and i touch, love
i never knew there was so much love
keeping me warm night and day

miles and miles of empty space in between us
a telephone can't take the place of your smile
but you know i won't be travellin' forever
it's cold out but hold out
and do like i do

when i need you
i just close my eyes and i'm with you
and all that i so want to give you, babe
it's only a heartbeat away

it's not easy when the road is your driver
honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
but you know i won't be travellin' a lifetime
it's cold out so hold out
and do like i do
when i need you


mmm
mmm, yes

when i need love
i hold out my hands and i touch, love
i never knew there was so much love
keeping me warm night and day
when i need you
i just close my eyes and you're right here by my side
keepin' me warm night and day
i just hold out my hands
i just hold out my hands
and i'm with you darlin'
yes, i'm with you darlin'
all i wanna give you
it's only a heartbeat away
oh, i need you, darlin'
