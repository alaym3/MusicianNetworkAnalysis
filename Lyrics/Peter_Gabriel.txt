climbing up on solsbury hill
i could see the city light
wind was blowing, time stood still
eagle flew out of the night
he was something to observe
came in close, i heard a voice
standing stretching every nerve
had to listen, had no choice

i did not believe the information
i just had to trust imagination
my heart going boom boom boom
"son," he said
"grab your things, i've come to take you home"

to keep in silence i resigned
my friends would think i was a nut
turning water into wine
open doors would soon be shut
so i went from day to day
though my life was in a rut
'til i thought of what i'd say
which connection i should cut
i was feeling part of the scenery
i walked right out of the machinery
my heart going boom boom boom
"hey," he said
"grab your things, i've come to take you home"
ay, back home

when illusion spin her net
i'm never where i want to be
and liberty she pirouette
when i think that i am free
watched by empty silhouettes
who close their eyes but still can see
no one taught them etiquette
i will show another me

today i don't need a replacement
i'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
my heart going boom boom boom
"hey" i said
"you can keep my things, they've come to take me home" 

love, i get so lost sometimes
days pass, and this emptiness fills my heart
when i want to run away, i drive off in my car
but whichever way i go, i come back to the place you are

all my instincts, they return
the grand façade, so soon will burn
without a noise, without my pride
i reach out from the inside

in your eyes, the light, the heat
in your eyes, i am complete
in your eyes, i see the doorway
in your eyes, to a thousand churches
in your eyes, the resolution
in your eyes, of all the fruitless searches
in your eyes
in your eyes, oh, i see the light and the heat
in your eyes, the light, the heat
in your eyes
oh, i wanna be that complete
in your eyes, the light, the heat
in your eyes
i wanna touch the light, the heat i see in your eyes
love, i don't like to see so much pain
so much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away
i get so tired, working so hard for our survival
i look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

and all my instincts, they return
and the grand façade, so soon will burn
without a noise, without my pride
i reach out from the inside

in your eyes your eyes, your eyes
in your eyes
in your eyes, the light, the heat
in your eyes, i am complete
in your eyes, i see the doorway
to a thousand churches
in your eyes, the resolution
in your eyes, of all the fruitless searches
oh, i see the light and the heat
in your eyes
oh, i wanna be that complete
in your eyes
i want to touch the light, the heat i see in your eyes
in your eyes
in your eyes
in your eyes
sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir

in this proud land we grew up strong
we were wanted all along
i was taught to fight, taught to win
i never thought i could fail
no fight left or so it seems
i am a man whose dreams have all deserted
i've changed my face, i've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose

don't give up 'cause you have friends
don't give up, you're not beaten yet
don't give up, i know you can make it good

though i saw it all around
never thought that i could be affected
thought that we'd be last to go
it is so strange the way things turn
drove the night toward my home
the place that i was born, on the lakeside
as daylight broke, i saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground

don't give up, you still have us
don't give up, we don't need much of anything
don't give up, 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
rest your head, you worry too much
it's going to be alright
when times get rough, you can fall back on us
don't give up, please don't give up
got to walk out of here, i can't take any more
gonna stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below
whatever may come and whatever may go
that river's flowing, that river's flowing

moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job, so many men
so many men no-one needs

don't give up 'cause you have friends
don't give up, you're not the only one
don't give up, no reason to be ashamed
don't give up, you still have us
don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
don't give up, you know it's never been easy
don't give up 'cause i believe there's a place
there's a place where we belong

don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
don't give up, don't give up, don't give up 

"a one... two... one, two, four..."

the book of love is long and boring
no one can lift the damn thing
it's full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing

but i
i love it when you read to me
and you
you can read me anything

the book of love has music in it
in fact that's where music comes from
some of it is just transcendental
some of it is just really dumb

but i
i love it when you sing to me
and you
you can sing me anything

the book of love is long and boring
and written very long ago
it's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
and things we're all too young to know
but i
i love it when you give me things
and you
you ought to give me wedding rings
and i
i love it when you give me things
and you
you ought to give me wedding rings
you ought to give me wedding rings 

i, i wish i could swim
like dolphins, like dolphins could swim
though nothing will keep us together
we can beat them, for ever and ever

oh we can be heroes, just for one day
oh we can be heroes, just for one day

i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive us away

oh, we can be heroes, just for one day
oh, we can be us, just for one day

i, i can remember
standing, standing by the wall
and the guns, shot above our heads
and we kissed, as though nothing could fall
and the shame, the shame was on the other side
oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
and we could be heroes, just for one day

with only one colour dead

did you think that your feet had been bound
by what gravity brings to the ground?
did you feel you were tricked by the future you picked?
well, come on down
all those rules don't apply
when you're high in the sky
so, come on down
come on down

we're coming down to the ground
there's no better place to go
we've got snow up on the mountains
we've got rivers down below
we're coming down to the ground
we hear the birds sing in the trees
and the land will be looked after
we send the seeds out in the breeze

did you think you'd escaped from routine
by changing the script and the scene?
despite all you made of it, you're always afraid
of the change
you've got a lot on your chest
well, you can come as my guest
so, come on down
come on down

we're coming down to the ground
there's no better place to go
we've got snow up on the mountains
we've got rivers down below
we're coming down to the ground
we hear the birds sing in the trees
and the land will be looked after
we send the seeds out in the breeze

like the fish in the ocean
we felt at home in the sea
we learned to live off the good land
learned to climb up a tree
then we got up on two legs
but we wanted to fly
oh, when we messed up our homeland
we set sail for the sky

we're coming down to the ground
there's no better place to go
we've got snow up on the mountains
we've got rivers down below
we're coming down to the ground
we hear the birds sing in the trees
and the land will be looked after
we send the seeds out in the breeze

we're coming down
coming down to earth
like babies at birth
coming down to earth
we're gonna find new priorities
these are extraordinary qualities

we're coming down to the ground
there's no better place to go

"hi there"

i'm on my way, i'm making it
i've got to make it show, yeah
so much larger than life
i'm going to watch it growing

the place where i come from is a small town
they think so small, they use small words
but not me - i'm smarter than that, i worked it out
i've been stretching my mouth
to let those big words come right out
i've had enough, i'm getting out
to the city, the big, big city
i'll be a big noise with all the big boys
so much stuff i will own

and i will pray to a big god
as i kneel in the big church

(big time) i'm on my way, i'm making it (big time)
(big time) i've got to make it show, yeah (big time)
(big time) so much larger than life
(big time) i'm going to watch it growing (big time)
my parties have all the big names
and i greet them with the widest smile
tell them how my life is one big adventure
and always, they're amazed
when i show them round the house, to my bed
i had it made like a mountain range
with a snow-white pillow for my big fat head

and my heaven will be a big heaven
and i will walk through the front door

(big time) i'm on my way, i'm making it (big time)
(big time) i've got to make it show, yeah (big time)
(big time) so much larger than life
(big time) i'm going to watch it growing (big time)

(big time) my car's getting bigger
(big time) my house, getting bigger
(big time) my eyes, getting bigger
(big time) and my mouth
(big time) my belly's getting bigger
(big time) and my bank account
(big time) look at my circumstance
(big time) and the bulge in my big, big, big, big, big, big
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big 

my body is a cage
that keeps me from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key
my body is a cage
that keeps me from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key

i'm standing on a stage
of fear and self doubt
it's a hollow play
but they'll clap anyway

my body is a cage
that keeps me from dancing with the one i love
my mind holds the key
my mind holds the key

my mind holds the key
i'm living in an age
that calls darkness light
though my language is dead
still the shapes fill my head
i'm living in an age
whose name i don't know
though the fear keeps me moving
still my heart beats so slow
my body is a
is a
is a
is a
is a
is a
is a
is a
is a
my body is a cage
my body is a cage
oh
my mind holds the key

my body is a cage
we take what we're given
just because you've forgotten
that don't mean you're forgiven
i'm living in an age
that screams my name at night
but when i get to the doorway
there's no one in sight
i'm living in an age
where i realize i'm dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key
you're standing next to me
my mind holds the key
set my spirit free
set my spirit free
set my body free
set my body free
set my body free 

looking down on empty streets, all she can see
are the dreams all made solid
are the dreams made real
all of the buildings, all of the cars
were once just a dream
in somebody's head
she pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam
she pictures a soul
with no leak at the seams

let's take the boat out
wait until darkness
let's take the boat out
wait until darkness comes

nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
nowhere in the suburbs
in the cold light of day
there in the midst of it, so alive and alone
words support like bone

dreaming of mercy street
wear your inside out
dreaming of mercy
in your daddy's arms again
dreaming of mercy street
i swear they moved that sign
dreaming of mercy
in your daddy's arms
pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth
tugging at the darkness
word upon word
confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
to the priest, he's the doctor
he can handle the shocks
dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips
of kissing mary's lips

dreaming of mercy street
wear your inside out
dreaming of mercy
in your daddy's arms again
dreaming of mercy street
i swear they moved that sign
looking for mercy
in your daddy's arms


mercy, mercy, looking for mercy
looking for mercy
mercy, looking for mercy
looking for mercy, looking for mercy
looking for mercy, looking for mercy
anne, with her father, is out in the boat
riding the water
riding the waves on the sea 

do solemnly swear
do solemnly swear
that i will support and defend
that i will support and defend
the constitution of the united states
the constitution of the united states
against all enemies
against all enemies
foreign and domestic
foreign and domestic

underneath the sky where the cold winds cross
there is an ocean where data flows
one man in a boat out on the sea
a sea of little bits of you and me

let it all go, set it all free
you let the whole wide world see
exactly what is going on
exactly who is looking on

stories start to leak, they colour your name
while up above cloud turns to rain
you can feel the touch of a hand you know well
it's a very long way from maryland
some say you're a patriot
some call you a spy
an american hero
or a traitor that deserves to die
in the heart of the free world
in the home of the brave you gave up everything
to bring down the veil

there's no safe place to go
now you've let that whistle blow
show exactly what is going on
show exactly who is looking on
let it all go
set it free
let it all go
let it go free
set it free
ha ha ha ha aah
ahh oh
information flow
information flow
information flow 

red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

i am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
i cannot make a single sound as you scream
it can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch
hey, we touch
this place is so quiet, sensing that storm

red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

well i've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town
they tell you that this rain can sting and look down
there is no blood around, see no sign of pain
hey, no pain
seeing no red at all, see no rain
red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

red rain
oh! oh!
putting the pressure on much harder now
to return again and again
red rain
just let the red rain splash you
let the rain fall on your skin
red rain
i come to you, defenses down
with the trust of a child
oh!

red rain coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

and i can't watch anymore
no more denial
it's so hard to lay down in all of this
red rain coming down
red rain is pouring down
red rain is coming down all over me
i see it

red rain coming down
red rain is pouring down
red rain is coming down all over me
i'm bathing in

red rain coming down
red rain is coming down
red rain is coming down all over me
i'm begging you

red rain coming down
red rain coming down
red rain coming down
red rain coming down
over me in the red, red sea
over me
over me
red rain 

i know something about
opening windows and doors
i know how to move quietly
to creep across creaky wooden floors
i know where to find precious things
in all your cupboards and drawers

slipping the clippers
slipping the clippers through the telephone wires
a sense of isolation
inspires, inspires me


i like to feel the suspense
when i'm certain you know i am there
i like you lying awake
your bated breath charging the air
i like the touch and the smell
of all the pretty dresses you wear

intruder's happy in the dark
intruder come
intruder come and he leave his mark
leave his mark, leave his mark

i am the intruder 

the wretched desert takes its form
the jackal proud and tight
in search of you i feel my way
through the slowest heaving night
whatever fear invents
i swear it make no sense
i reach out through the border fence
come down, come talk to me

in the swirling, curling storm of desire
unuttered words hold fast
with reptile tongue, the lightning lashes
towers built to last
darkness creeps in like a thief
and offers no relief
why are you shaking like a leaf
come on, come talk to me

ah please talk to me
won't you please talk to me
we can unlock this misery
come on, come talk to me
i did not come to steal
this all is so unreal
can't you show me how you feel now
come on, come talk to me
come talk to me
the earthly power sucks shadowed milk
from sleepy tears undone
from nippled skin as smooth as silk
the bugles blown as one
you lie there with your eyes half closed
like there's no one there at all
there's a tension pulling on your face
come on, come talk to me

won't you please talk to me
if you'd just talk to me
unblock this misery
if you'd only talk to me
don't you ever change your mind
now your future's so defined
and you act so deaf, so blind
come on, come talk to me
come talk to me

i can imagine the moment
breaking out through the silence
all the things that we both might say
and the heart it will not be denied
until we're both on the same damn side
all the barriers blown away
i said please talk to me
won't you please come talk to me
just like it used to be
come on, come talk to me
i did not come to steal
this all is so unreal
can you show me how you feel now
come on, come talk to me
come talk to me
i said please talk to me
if you'd just talk to me
unblock this misery
if you'd only talk to me
don't you ever change your mind
now your future's so defined
and you act so deaf and blind
and you act so deaf so blind
come on, come talk to me
come talk to me 

when the night shows
the signals grow on radios
all the strange things
they come and go as early warnings
stranded starfish have no place to hide
still waiting for the swollen easter tide
there's no point in direction
we cannot even choose a side

i took the old track
the hollow shoulder, across the waters
on the tall cliffs
they were getting older, sons and daughters
the jaded underworld was riding high
waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
and as the nail sunk in the cloud
the rain was warm and soaked the crowd

lord, here comes the flood
we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
if again the seas are silent, in any still alive
it'll be those who gave their island to survive
drink up, dreamers, you're running dry
when the flood calls
you have no home, you have no walls
in the thunder crash
you're a thousand minds, within a flash
don't be afraid to cry at what you see
the actors gone, there's only you and me
and if we break before the dawn
they'll use up what we used to be

lord, here comes the flood
we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
if again the seas are silent, in any still alive
it'll be those who gave their island to survive
drink up, dreamers, you're running dry


lord, here comes the flood
we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
if again the seas are silent, in any still alive
it'll be those who gave their island to survive
drink up, dreamers, you're running dry

drink up, dreamers, you're running dry 

stand back!
stand back!

what are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet
they're on to something, picking up
picking up this heat, this heat

give me steam
and how you feel can make it real
real as anything you've seen
get a life with this dreamer's dream

you know your culture from your trash
you know your plastic from your cash
when i lose sight of the track
you know the way back
but i know you
you know your stripper from your paint
you know your sinner from your saint
whenever heaven's doors are shut
you kick them open but
i know you
give me steam
and how you feel can make it real
real as any place you've been
get a life with the dreamer's dream

stand back!
stand back!
can't you see i've lost control
i'm getting indiscreet
you're moving in so close
until i'm picking up
picking up this heat, this heat

give me steam
and how you feel can make it real
real as anything you've seen
get a life with this dreamer's dream

you know your green from your red
you know the quick from the dead
so much better than the rest
you think you've been blessed
but i know you
you know your ladder from your snake
you know the throttle from the brake
you know your straight line from a curve
you've got a lot of nerve
but i know you
give me steam
and how you feel could make it real
real as any place you've been
get a life with the dreamer's dream

everybody nosedive
hold your breath, count to five
backslap, boobytrap
cover it up in bubblewrap
room shake, earthquake
find a way to stay awake
it's going to blow, it's going to break
this is more than i can take
oh yeah, i need steam
feel the steam all around me

ah you're turning up the heat
when i start to dream aloud
see you move your hands and feet
won't you step into this cloud of steam
this steam

give me steam
and how you feel can make it real
real as anything you've seen
get a life with this dreamer's dream
help me yeah
ready to steam out the log jam
stir crazy from the freezer to the boil
water's bubbling, it's bubbling
bubbling, bubbling
like it's coming to a boil
give me steam, lady
give me steam around me now
aah coming alive, coming alive
said give me some steam 

thick cloud, steam rising
hissing stone on sweat lodge fire
around me, buffalo roam
sage in bundle, rub on skin
outside, cold air
stand, wait for rising sun
red paint, eagle feathers
coyote calling, it has begun
something moving in
i taste it in my mouth and in my heart
it feels like dying, slow
letting go of life

(hyena wakan tanka)
(hyena wakan tanka)
(hyena wakan tanka)
(hyena wakan tanka)
(hyena wakan tanka)
(hyena wakan tanka)

medicine man lead me up through town
indian ground, so far down
cut up land, each house a pool
kids wearing water wings, drink in cool
follow dry river bed
watch scouts and guides make pow-wow signs
past geronimo's disco
sitting bull steakhouse, white men dream
a rattle in the old man's sack, see
look at mountain top, keep climbing up
way above us the desert snow
white wind blow
i hold the line, the line of strength that pulls me through the fear
san jacinto, i hold the line
san jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight
i hold the line
and the tears roll down my swollen cheek
think i'm losing it, getting weaker
i hold the line, i hold the line
san jacinto, yellow eagle flies down from the sun, from the sun


we will walk on the land
we will breathe of the air
we will drink from the stream
we will live, hold the line
hold the line, hold the line
we will live, hold the line
hold the line, hold the line
