came in from a rainy thursday
on the avenue
thought i heard you talking softly
i turned on the lights, the tv
and the radio
still i can't escape the ghost of you

what has happened to it all?
crazy, some'd say
where is the life that i recognize?
gone away

but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive

passion or coincidence
once prompted you to say
"pride will tear us both apart"
well now pride's gone out the window
cross the rooftops
run away
left me in the vacuum of my heart

what is happening to me?
crazy, some'd say
where is my friend when i need you most?
gone away

but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive

papers in the roadside
tell of suffering and greed
fear today, forgot tomorrow
ooh, here beside the news
of holy war and holy need
ours is just a little sorrowed talk
(just blown away)

and i don't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive

every world
is my world
(i will learn to survive)
any world
is my world
(i will learn to survive)
any world
is my world
every world
is my world

mine, immaculate dream
made breath and skin, i've been waiting for you
signed, with a home tattoo
happy birthday to you was created for you
(can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
oh, it'll take a little time
might take a little crime
to come undone now

we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child, stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into crime

who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?

words, playing me deja vu
like a radio tune, i swear i've heard before
chills, is it something real
or the magic i'm feeding off your fingers?
(can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
lost, in a snow filled sky
we'll make it alright
to come undone now

we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child, stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into crime

who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?

(can not forgive from falling apart)
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
(can not forgive from falling apart)
who do you need, (who do you love) who do you love?
(can not forgive from falling apart)
(who do you love) who do you love
when you come undone?
(can not forgive from falling apart)

ha-ha!

darken the city, night is a wire
steam in the subway, earth is afire
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
woman you want me, give me a sign
and catch my breathing even closer behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt, i'm after you
smell like i sound, i'm lost in a crowd
and i'm hungry like the wolf
straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
i'm on the hunt, i'm after you
mouth is alive, with juices like wine
and i'm hungry like the wolf

stalked in the forest, too close to hide
i'll be upon you by the moonlight side
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
high blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
you feel my heat, i'm just a moment behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt, i'm after you
scent and a sound, i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
i howl and i whine i'm after you
mouth is alive, all running inside
and i'm hungry like the wolf

hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf

burning the ground, i break from the crowd
i'm on the hunt, i'm after you
i smell like i sound, i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
i'm on the hunt i'm after you
mouth is alive, with juices like wine
and i'm hungry like the wolf

burning the ground, i break from the crowd
i'm on the hunt, i'm after you
scent and a sound, i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
i howl and i whine i'm after you
mouth is alive, all running inside

moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
cherry ice cream smile i suppose it's very nice
with a step to your left and a flick to the right
you catch that mirror way out west
you know you're something special
and you look like you're the best

her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twisting through a dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio, rio dance across the rio grande

i've seen you on the beach and i've seen you on tv
two of a billion stars it means so much to me
like a birthday or a pretty view
but then i'm sure that you know it's just for you

her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twisting through a dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio, rio dance across the rio grande


hey now woo look at that
did he nearly run you down?
at the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
you make me feel alive, alive, alive
i'll take my chance 'cause luck is on my side or something
i know what you're thinking
i tell you something, i know what you're thinking

her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twists across a dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio, rio dance across the rio grande
her name is rio, she don't need to understand
and i might find her if i'm looking like i can
oh rio, rio hear them shout across the land
from mountains in the north down to the rio grande

you saw me standing by the wall
corner of a main street
and the lights are flashing on your window sill
all alone ain't much fun
so you're looking for the thrill
and you know just what it takes
and where to go

don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after
no, don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after

feel the breeze deep on the inside
look you down into your well (do-do-do-do-do)
if you can, you'll see the world in all his fire (do-do-do-do-do)
take a chance like all dreamers
you can't find another way (do-do-do-do-do)
you don't have to dream it all
just live a day (do-do-do-do-do)

don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after
no, don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after

pretty looking road
i try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin (do-do-do-do-do)
don't ask me why, i'll keep my promise
melt the ice (do-do-do-do-do)
and you wanted to dance
so i asked you to dance
but fear is in your soul (do-do-do-do-do)
some people call it a one-night stand
but we can call it paradise (do-do-do-do-do)

don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after
no, don't say a prayer for me now
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after
save it 'til the morning after

do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do

save a prayer 'til the morning after
save a prayer 'til the morning after
save a prayer 'til the morning after
save a prayer 'til the morning after

*sound of camera shutters flickering*

see them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnight
heads turning as the lights flashing out it's so bright
then walk right out to the four-line track
there's a camera rolling on her back, on her back
and i sense the rhythm humming in a frenzy all the way down her spine

girls on film
girls on film
girls on film
girls on film

lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
in miles of sharp blue water coming in where she lies
the diving man's coming up for air
'cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair, by the hair
and she wonders how she ever got here as she goes under again

girls on film (two minutes later)
girls on film
girls on film (got your picture)
girls on film

wider baby smiling you've just made a million
fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
take one last glimpse into the night
i'm touching close i'm holding bright, holding tight
give me shudders in a whisper take me up till i'm shooting a star

girls on film (she's more than a lady)
girls on film
girls on film (two minutes later)
girls on film
girls on film (see you together)
girls on film
girls on film (see you later)
girls on film
girls on film (what you doing?)
girls on film

you've gone too far this time
but i'm dancing on the valentine
i tell you somebody's fooling around
with my chances on the danger line
i'll cross that bridge when i find it
another day to make my stand, oh woah
high time is no time for deciding
if i should find a helping hand, oh woah

oh, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
oh, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it

the reflex is a lonely child, who's waiting by the park
the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
and watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
and every little thing the reflex does
leaves you answered with a question mark

i'm on a ride, and i want to get off
but they won't slow down the roundabout
i sold the renoir and tv set
don't wanna be around when this gets out

so, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
oh, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it

the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
and watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
and every little thing the reflex does
leaves you answered with a question mark

no-no-notorious

no-no-notorious

i can't read about it
burns the skin from your eyes
i'll do fine without it
here's one you don't compromise
lies come hard in disguise
they need to fight it out
not wild about it
lay your seedy judgements
who says they're part of our lives?

you own the money
you control the witness
i'll leave you lonely
don't monkey with my business
you pay the prophets to justify your reasons
i heard your promise, but i don't believe it
that's why i've done it again

no-no-notorious

girls will keep the secrets (uh)
so long as boys make a noise
fools run rings to break up
something they'll never destroy
grand notorious slam (bam)
and who really gives a damn for a flaky bandit?
don't ask me to bleed about it
i need this blood to survive

you own the money

i'll leave you lonely

out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
all looking for a new place to drive
you sit beside me, so newly charming
sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side

and the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart

way down the lane away, living for another day
the aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle
my envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

and the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart

and the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart

sing, blue silver

and watching lovers part, i feel you smiling
what glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
to tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
but i'll only watch you leave me further behind

and the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart

and the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart

sing, blue silver
sing, sing blue silver

"known as albert schweitzer
there's more to this kind of camouflage, more than just colour and shape
who's crawling now in the tall grass near my tent?
listen"

meeting you with a view to a kill
face to face in secret places, feel the chill
nightfall covers me, but you know the plans i'm making
still overseas, could it be the whole earth opening wide
a sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
a week is why, until we...

dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
to fatal sounds of broken dreams
dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire

the choice for you is the view to a kill
between the shades assassination standing still
earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
first time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
a chance to find the phoenix for the flame
a chance to die, but can we...

dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
to fatal sounds of broken dreams
dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
when all we see is the view to a kill

wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
wild boys
wild! boys!

the wild boys are calling
on their way back from the fire
in august moon's surrender to
a dust cloud on the rise
wild boys fallen far from glory
reckless and so hungered
on the razors edge you trail
because there's murder by the roadside
in a sore afraid new world

they tried to break us
looks like they'll try again

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always shine

you got sirens for a welcome
there's bloodstain for your pain
and your telephone been ringing while
you're dancing in the rain
wild boys wonder where is glory
where is all you angels
now the figureheads have fell
and lovers war with arrows over
secrets they could tell
pre-chorus
they tried to tame you
looks like they'll try again

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always shine

wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always, wild boys

shake up the picture the lizard mixture
with your dance on the eventide
you got me coming up with answers
all of which i deny
i said it again
could i please rephrase it
maybe i can catch a ride
i couldn't really put it much plainer
but i'll wait till you decide
send me your warning siren
as if i could ever hide
last time la luna

i light my torch and wave it for the
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

breaking away with the best of both worlds
a smile that you can't disguise
every minute i keep finding
clues that you leave behind
save me from these reminders
as if i'd forget tonight
this time la luna

i light my torch and wave it for the
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite


i light my torch and wave it for the
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
new moon on monday
and a firedance through the night (fire dance through the night...)
i stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite (i light my torch and wave it for the...)

only came outside to watch the night fall with the rain
i heard you making patterns rhyme
like some new romantic looking for the tv sound
you'll see i'm right some other time

look now, look all around, there's no sign of life
voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
this is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth
bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop, this is planet parth

my head is stuck on something precious
let me know if you're coming down to land
is there anybody out there trying to get through?
my eyes are so cloudy i can't see you

look now, look all around, there's no sign of life
voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
this is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth
bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop, this is planet earth


look now, look all around, there's no sign of life

please, please tell me now
please, please tell me now
please, please tell me now
please, please tell me now

i made a break, i run out yesterday
tried to find my mountain hideaway
maybe next year, maybe no go
i know you're watching me
every minute of the day, yeah
i've seen the signs
and the looks and the pictures
that give your game away, yeah
there's a dream that strings the road
with broken glass for us to hold
and i cut so far before i had to say

please, please tell me now
is there something i should know?
is there something i should say
that would make you come my way?
do you feel the same?
'cause you don't let it show

people stare and cross the road from me
and jungle drums
they all clear the way for me
can you read my mind?
can you see in the snow?
and fiery demons all dance
when you walk through that door
don't say you're easy on me
you're about as easy as a nuclear war
there's a dream that strings the road
with broken glass for us to hold
and i cut so far before i had to say

please, please tell me now
is there something i should know?
is there something i should say
that would make you come my way?
do you feel the same?
'cause you don't let it show
please, please tell me now
is there something i should know?
is there something i should say
that would make you come my way?
please, please tell me now
can you see what makes me blow?
can you see how much i'd die
every time it passes by?
please, please tell me now
what it takes to make it show
is there something i should know?
is there something i should know?

telegram force and ready
i knew this was a big mistake
there's a fine line drawing
my senses together
and i think it's about to break

if i listen close i can hear them singers
voices in your body coming through on the radio

the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
through the borderline

nightshades on a warning
give me strength at least give me a light
give me anything even sympathy
there's a chance you could be right

if i listen close i can hear them singers
voices in your body coming through on the radio

the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
through the borderline

the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
through the borderline

if i listen close i can hear them singers
voices in your body coming through on the radio

the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
through the borderline
the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
gonna move up to the borderline
the union of the snake is on the climb
moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
through the borderline

i've been now sauntering
out and down the path sometime
come on, it takes me nowhere, which i know
faces everywhere pulling grins and signs in things
telling me not there, man, it's no go
i need a reason
i can't think without one now
too much learning got to show
call it treason
maybe catch her, don't know how
too many things, too much to know
i'll bring my timing in, seagulls gather on the wind
lady screaming, lady leave me out
cause sometimes people stare
sitting down, electric chair
steaming crowds they gather and they shout

don't know why this evil bothers me
take another chance boy, carry the fight
you can take him if you're fast
so why is he trying to follow me?
didn't i say if you're holding on
you'd be laughing at the last
how many reasons do they need?
i get along fine with them friends of mine
but you have to make a choice
i might just believe this time
you're singing out of tune but the beat's in time
and it's us who makes the noise

i'm talking for free, i can't stop myself
it's a new religion
i've something to see, i can't help myself
it's a new religion

okay, my reasoning might be clouded by the sun
but someone sees the departmental lie
you know this peacetime jabbing fist in stabbing knife
only get one look before you die

don't know why this evil bothers me
take another chance boy, carry the fight
you can take him if you're fast
so why is he trying to follow me?
didn't i say if you're holding on
you'd be laughing at the last

and it's us who makes the noise

i'm talking for free, i can't stop myself
it's a new religion
i've something to see, i can't help myself
it's a new religion

got to take pay the saints 'n sinners
in regulation hats 'n scarves 'n things
walking in formation down the lane
they carry their cross, make a church bell ring
army majors pull a mean cool truth
they're lying in a swimming pool
searching for the undeniable truth that
a man is just a fool

don't know why this evil bothers me
take another chance boy, carry the fight
you can take him if you're fast
so why is he trying to follow me?
didn't i say if you're holding on
you'd be laughing at the last
how many reasons do they need?

cause i've got my own way, i can find my own way, cause i've got my own way

number one
public figure what a pain
just puts another rattle in your brain
take another green but it's not the same
so now you're on the sand lane everyday
dancing with the bulls in any old way
running like a fox to keep up with me

cause i've got my own way, i can find my own way, cause i've got my own way
cause i've got my own way, i can find my own way, cause i've got my own way

i'm on 45 between 6th and broadway,
7up between 6th and broadway

cause i've got my own way, i can find my own way, cause i've got my own way
cause i've got my own way, i can find my own way, cause i've got my own way

i knew when i first saw you on the showroom floor
you were made for me
i took you home and dressed you up in polyester
princess of my dreams
emotionless and cold as ice
all of the things i like
the way you look
the way you move
the sound you're making
in ultra-chrome, latex and steel

i plug you in
dim the lights
electric barbarella
your perfect skin
plastic kiss
electric barbarella
try to resist
then we touch
hallucinate and tranquilize

she's so fine
she's all mine

our private life is subject to investigation
no time to waste
people say they heard about our deviation
but you never looked so good
wear the fake fur and fake pearls for me
and put on your mystery
the way i feel you know
i'll never keep you waiting
in ultra-chrome, latex and steel


princess of my dreams
princess of my dreams
major domo plasticomo barbarella
(she's so fine)
pro-genetic you electric barbarella
(she's all mine)
my pretty pretty pretty pretty barbarella

all the paper gods in the sky of gray
all the fools in town are ruling today, today

bow to the paper gods in a world that is paper thin
the fools in town are ruling now
bleeding from paper cuts, money for head shots
fools leading (today)
who needs it?

hey girl, want it all the talking men declares
go running to be first in line for what? nobody cares
the next thing you must have, find peace with matching bag
it's nothing to be glad about, or sad when you forget about it
and while the race is on, the rats will run the streets
the slaver in a sweatshop, putting trainers on your feet
i'm walking through the rain, oblivious to pain
to shelter from the blame without a reason to complain about it
oh, oh, oh, don't complain about it
oh, oh, oh, don't complain about it
oh, oh, oh, forget about it
oh, oh, oh, oh

she's staring out in underwear, from your computer screen
it's all on sale for dirty cash, we can wash it clean
so hang it out online, confess and you'll feel fine
and if you got the time to spare we want to know
which name you're wearing
and when the final curtain finally comes down
we'll all be in the party room, no wiser as to how
the total human race became a basket case
it's nothing to lose face about it
it's really not a place to doubt it

bow to the paper gods in a world that is paper thin
the fools in town are ruling now
bleeding from paper cuts, money for head shots
fools leading (today)
who needs it?


paper gods falling down
paper house, paper town
paper gods falling down
paper world just falling down
paper gods falling down
paper house, paper town
paper gods falling down
paper world just falling down
falling down, falling down
falling down, falling down
falling down, falling down

bow to the paper gods in a world that is paper thin
the fools in town are ruling now
bleeding from paper cuts, they go for the money shots
the fools leading (today)
who needs them?

all the paper gods in the sky of gray
