i can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
and i've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
can you feel it coming in the air tonight? oh lord, oh lord

well, if you told me you were drowning
i would not lend a hand
i've seen your face before, my friend
but i don't know if you know who i am
well, i was there and i saw what you did
i saw it with my own two eyes
so you can wipe off that grin, i know where you've been
it's all been a pack of lies
and i can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
well, i’ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
i can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
and i've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord

well, i remember!
i remember, don't worry
how could i ever forget?
it's the first time, the last time we ever met
but i know the reason why you keep your silence up
no, you don't fool me
well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
it's no stranger to you and me

and i can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
i can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

i can feel it coming in the air tonight! oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life! oh lord!
i can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord!
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life! oh lord, oh lord!
i can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord!
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life! oh lord, oh lord!
i can feel it in the air tonight... 

she calls out to the man on the street
"sir, can you help me?
it's cold and i've nowhere to sleep
is there somewhere you can tell me?"
he walks on, doesn't look back
he pretends he can't hear her
starts to whistle as he crosses the street
seems embarrassed to be there

oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
you and me in paradise
oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
you and me in paradise

think about it

she calls out to the man on the street
he can see she's been crying
she's got blisters on the soles of her feet
she can't walk, but she's trying

oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
you and me in paradise
oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
you and me in paradise
just think about it

oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
oh lord, there must be something you can say

you can tell from the lines on her face
you can see that she's been there
probably been moved on from every place
'cause she didn't fit in there

oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
you and me in paradise
oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
you and me in paradise

just think about it
mhm
think about it
it's just another day
for you and me in paradise
it's just another day
for you and me in paradise
(para-, paradise)
paradise
uh, just think about it
paradise
just think about it
(para-, paradise)
uh, in paradise
mhm, paradise

and there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
ooh, take a look at me now
well, there's just an empty space
and you coming back to me is against the odds

i wish i could just make you turn around
turn around and see me cry
there's so much i need to say to you, so many reasons why
you're the only one who really knew me at all
so take a look at me now
well, there's just an empty space
and there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
now, take a look at me now
‘cause there's just an empty space
but to wait for you is all i can do
and that's what i've got to face
take a good look at me now

i can't see but i feel it and it helps to keep me warm

so, i... i don't mind
no, i... i don't mind

seems so long i've been waiting, still don't know what for
there's no point in escaping, i don't worry anymore
i can't come out to find you, i don't like to go outside
they can turn off my feelings like they're turning off the light

but, i... i don't mind
no, i... i don't mind
oh, i... i don't mind
no, i... i don't mind

so take, take me home
'cause i don't remember, take, take me home
'cause i don't remember, take, take me home, oh lord
'cause i've been a prisoner all my life, and i can say to you

take that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life
working when it's daylight, and sleeping when it's night
i've got no far horizons, i don't wish upon a star
they don't think that i listen, oh, but i know who they are

and, i... i don't mind
no, i... i don't mind
oh, i... i don't mind

que pueden saber (que pueden saber)
si nos queremos
mañana y hoy

te hará pensar (te hará pensar)
mas la soledad tendrás que aguantar
entenderán
lo sé
lo haremos muy juntos

que tú vivirás
estarás dentro de mí hoy
y por siempre amor
tú en mi corazón (sí, en mi corazón)
no importa qué dirán (no sufras más)

i need love, love
ooh, ease my mind
and i need to find time
someone to call mine;

my mama said, "you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait"
she said, "love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take"
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
just trust in a good time
no matter how long it takes

how many heartaches must i stand
before i find the love to let me live again
right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
when i feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone

i remember mama said, "you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait"
she said, "love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take"
how long must i wait
how much more must i take
before loneliness
will cause my heart, heart to break
no, i can't bear to live my life alone
i grow impatient for a love to call my own
but when i feel that i, i can't go on
well these precious words keep me hanging on

i remember mama said, "you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait"
she said, "love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take"
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
just trust in a good time
no matter how long it takes
now break!

now love, love don't come easy
but i keep on waiting
anticipating for that soft voice
to talk to me at night
for some tender arms
hold me tight
i keep waiting
ooh, till that day
but it ain't easy (love don't come easy)
no, you know it ain't easy
my mama said
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said "love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take"
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said "love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take" 

they came at night leaving fear behind
shadows were on the ground
nobody knew where to find him
no evidence was found
"i'm never coming back"
they heard him cry
and i believe him
well he never meant to do anything wrong
it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

billy, billy don't you lose my number
because you're not anywhere
that i can find you
oh now billy, billy don't you lose my number
because you're not anywhere that i can find you, oh no

searching through the day and into the night
they wouldn't stop till they found him
they didn't know him and they didn't understand
they never asked him why
"get out of my way"
they heard him shout
then a blinding light
ooh all i could see was him running down the street
out of the shadows and into the night

don't give up
keep running, keep hiding
don't give up
billy, if you know you're right
don't give up
you know that i am on your side
don't give up
oh billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life


they came at night leaving fear behind
shadows were on the ground
nobody knew where to find him
no evidence was found
"i'm never coming back"
they heard him cry
and i believe him
he never meant to do anything wrong
it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

now billy, billy don't you lose my number
because you're not anywhere
that i can find you, oh
now billy, billy don't you lose my number
because you're not anywhere that i can find you, oh 

whatever you do, i'll do it too
show me everything and tell me how
it all means something
and yet nothing to me
i can see there's so much to learn
it's all so close and yet so far
i see myself as people see me
oh, i just know there's something bigger out there

i want to know, can you show me
i want to know about these strangers like me
tell me more, please show me
something's familiar about these strangers like me

every gesture, every move that she makes
makes me feel like never before
why do i have
this growing need to be beside her
ooo, these emotions i never knew
of some other world far beyond this place
beyond the trees, above the clouds
i see before me a new horizon
i want to know, can you show me
i want to know about these strangers like me
tell me more, please show me
something's familiar about these strangers like me

come with me now to see my world
where there's beauty beyond your dreams
can you feel the things i feel
right now, with you
take my hand
there's a world i need to know

i want to know, can you show me
i want to know about these strangers like me
tell me more, please show me
something's familiar about these strangers like me

...i want to know 

put your faith in what you most believe in
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these lives we see
a paradise untouched by man
within this world blessed with love
a simple
life, they live in peace
softly tread the sand below your feet now
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these
lives we see
beneath the shelter of the trees
only love can enter here
a simple life, they live in peace
raise your head up, lift high the load
take strength from those that need you
build high the walls, build strong the beams
a new life is waiting but danger's no stranger here
no words describe a mother's tears
no words can heal a broken heart
a dream is gone but where there's hope
somewhere, something is calling for you
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these lives we see 

you know i never meant to see you again
but i only passed by as a friend, yeah
all this time i stayed out of sight
i started wonderin' why

now i... ooh, now i wish it would rain down... down on me
ooh, yes i wish it would rain... rain down on me now
ooh, yes, i wish it would rain down... down on me
ooh, yes, i wish it would rain on me

you said you didn't need me in your life
oh, i guess you were right, yeah
ooh, i never meant to cause you no pain
but it looks like i did it again, yeah

now i... now i know i wish it would rain down... down on me
ooh, yes, i wish it would rain... rain down on me now
ooh, but i wish it would rain down... down on me
ooh, yes, i wish it would rain on me

though your hurt is gone, mine's hangin' on inside
and i know... it's eating me through... it's eating me through every night and day
i'm just waitin' on your sign
'cause i know, i know... i never meant to cause you no pain
and i realize i let you down, oh, yeah
but i know in my heart of hearts
i know i'm never gonna hold you again, no no
now i... well now i know i wish it would rain down... down on me
oh, you know i wish it would rain... rain down on me now
ooh, yes, i wish it would rain down... down on me
yes, you know i wish it would rain down... rain down over me

just rain down over me
just let it rain down, let it rain down
let it rain down, oh, yeah
let it rain down, rain down over me
just let it rain down, just let it rain down
let it rain down
just let it rain 

when i'm feelin' blue, all i have to do
is take a look at you, then i'm not so blue
when you're close to me, i can feel your heartbeat
i can hear you breathing near my ear

wouldn't you agree
baby, you and me
got a groovy kind of love

anytime you want to you can turn me onto
anything you want to, anytime at all
when i kiss your lips, ooh, i start to shiver
can't control the quivering inside

wouldn't you agree
baby, you and me
got a groovy kind of love

when i'm feelin' blue, all i have to do
is take a look at you, then i'm not so blue
when i'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
my whole world could shatter, i don't care
wouldn't you agree
baby, you and me
got a groovy kind of love

we got a groovy kind of love
we got a groovy kind of love
oh, oh-oh-oh
we got a groovy kind of love 

all of my life, i've been searching
for the words to say how i feel
i'd spend my time thinking too much
and leave too little to say what i mean
but i try to understand the best i can
all of my life
all of my life, i've been saying sorry
for the things i know i should have done
all the things i could have said come back to me
sometimes i wish that it had just begun
seems i'm always that little too late
all of my life

set 'em up, i'll take a drink with you
pull up a chair, i think i'll stay
set 'em up, cos i'm going nowhere
there's too much i need to remember, and there's too much i need to say

all of my life, i've been looking
but it's hard to find the way
just reaching past the goal in front of me
while what's important just slips away
and it doesn't come back, but i'll be looking
all of my life

all of my life, there have been regrets
that i didn't do all i could
playing records upstairs, while he watched tv
i didn't spend the time i should
and that's a memory i will live with
all of my life

(sorry)
well, you know
you can run, and you can hide
but i'm not leaving less you come with me
we've had our problems but i'm on your side
you're all i need, please believe me
you can run, and you can hide
but i'm not leaving 'til it's all over
we've had our problems but i'm on your side
you're all i need, let me show you

they say you can't take it with you
when you go
and i believe it
but taking what i've got
or being here with you, you know
i'd rather leave it

we had a life, we had a love
but you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
well that was then and this is now
and i want you back
how many times i'm gonna say i'm sorry?
