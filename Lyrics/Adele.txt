hello, it's me
i was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
to go over everything
they say that time's supposed to heal ya, but i ain't done much healing
hello, can you hear me?
i'm in california dreaming about who we used to be
when we were younger and free
i've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

there's such a difference between us
and a million miles

hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times
to tell you i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call, you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least, i can say that i've tried
to tell you i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

hello, how are you?
it's so typical of me to talk about myself, i'm sorry
i hope that you're well
did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

it's no secret that the both of us
are running out of time

so hello from the other side (other side)
i must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
to tell you i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call, you never seem to be home
hello from the outside (outside)
at least, i can say that i've tried (i've tried)
to tell you i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
ooh, anymore
(highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
ooh, anymore
(highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
ooh, anymore
(highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
anymore

hello from the other side (other side)
i must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
to tell you i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call, you never seem to be home
hello from the outside (outside)
at least, i can say that i've tried (i've tried)
to tell you i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

there ain't no gold in this river
that i've been washin' my hands in forever
i know there is hope in these waters
but i can't bring myself to swim
when i am drowning in this silence
baby, let me in

go easy on me, baby
i was still a child
didn't get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me

there ain't no room for things to change
when we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
you can't deny how hard i have tried
i changed who i was to put you both first
but now i give up

go easy on mе, baby
i was still a child
didn't get the chance to
feel thе world around me
had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me

i had good intentions
and the highest hopes
but i know right now
it probably doesn't even show

go easy on me, baby
i was still a child
i didn't get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me

i heard that you're settled down
that you found a girl and you're married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things i didn't give to you
old friend, why are you so shy?
ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

i hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days

i hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

nothing compares, no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
'cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
but if by chance you're here alone
can i have a moment before i go?
'cause i've been by myself all night long
hoping you're someone i used to know

you look like a movie
you sound like a song
my god, this reminds me
of when we were young

let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song

i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that you'd be here
and i swear you'd moved overseas
that's what you said when you left me

you still look like a movie
you still sound like a song
my god, this reminds me
of when we were young

let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song

(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)

it's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
to when you were there, to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'cause i still care, do you still care?

it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
my god, this reminds me
of when we were young

(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)

let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
oh, i'm so mad i'm getting old, it makes me reckless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
when we were young

there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
finally, i can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and i'll lay your shit bare
see how i'll leave with every piece of you
don't underestimate the things that i will do
there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
the scars of your love, they leave me breathless
i can't help feeling

we could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

baby, i have no story to be told
but i've heard one on you, now i'm gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(you're gonna wish you never had met me) the scars of your love remind me of us
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) they keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(you're gonna wish you never had met me) the scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) i can't help feeling

we could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
could've had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you played it with a beating

throw your soul through every open door (ooh woah, oh)
count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
turn my sorrow into treasured gold (ooh woah, oh)
you'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(you're gonna wish you never had met me)
we could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
we could've had it all, yeah (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
it all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

we could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
but you played it, you played it, you played it
you played it to the beat

i will leave my heart at the door
i won't say a word
they've all been said before, you know
so why don't we just play pretend
like we're not scared of what is coming next
or scared of having nothing left?

look, don't get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again?

i don't need your honesty
it's already in your eyes
and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
no one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that mattered
tell me, who do i run to?

look, don't get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again?

let this be our lesson in love
let this be the way we remember us
i don't want to be cruel or vicious
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again?

i let it fall, my heart
and as it fell, you rose to claim it
it was dark, and i was over
until you kissed my lips and you saved me
my hands, they were strong
but my knees were far too weak
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet

but there's a side to you
that i never knew, never knew
all the things you'd say
they were never true, never true
and the games you'd play
you would always win, always win

but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well, it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screamin' out your name
your name

when i lay with you
i could stay there, close my eyes
feel you here forever
you and me together, nothing is better

'cause there's a side to you
that i never knew, never knew
all the things you'd say
they were never true, never true
and the games you'd play
you would always win, always win

but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well, it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screamin' out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when it fell, somethin' died
'cause i knew that that was the last time
the last time

sometimes, i wake up by the door
that heart you caught must be waitin' for you
even now, when we're already over
i can't help myself from lookin' for you

i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well, it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screamin' out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when it fell, somethin' died
'cause i knew that that was the last time
the last time

oh
oh, no
let it burn
oh
let it burn
let it burn

just the guitar?
okay, cool

this was all you, none of it me
you put your hands on, on my body and told me
mmm, told me you were ready
for the big one, for the big jump
i'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
mmm, that was what you told me

i'm giving you up
i've forgiven it all
you set me free

send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more
send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more

i was too strong, you were trembling
you couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
mmm, baby, i'm still rising
i was running, you were walking
you couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
mmm, there's only one way down

i'm giving you up
i've forgiven it all
you set me free, oh

send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more
send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more

if you're ready, if you're ready
if you're ready, i am ready
if you're ready, if you're ready
we both know we ain't kids no more
no, we ain't kids no more

i'm giving you up
i've forgiven it all
you set me free

send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more
send my love to your new lover
treat her better
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more

if you're ready, if you're ready
(send my love to your new lover)
if you're ready, are you ready?
(treat her better)
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more
if you're ready, if you're ready
(send my love to your new lover)
if you're ready, are you ready?
(treat her better)
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
we both know we ain't kids no more

i built a house for a love to grow
i was so young that it was hard to know
i'm as lost now as i was back then
always make a mess of everything
it's about time that i face myself
all i do is bleed into someone else
painting walls with all my secret tears
filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

but oh my, oh my
i'll never learn if i never leap
i'll always yearn if i never speak

to be loved and love at the highest count
means to lose all the things i can't live without
let it be known that i will choose to lose
it's a sacrifice, but i can't live a lie
let it be known, let it be known that i tried

i'm so afraid, but i'm open wide
i'll be the one to catch myself this time
tryna learn to lean into it all
ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
looking back, i don't regret a thing
yeah, i took some bad turns that i am owning
i'll stand still and let the storm pass by
keep my heart safe till the time feels right

but oh my, oh my
i'll never learn if i never leap
i'll always yearn if i never speak

to be loved and love at the highest count
means to lose all the things i can't live without
let it be known that i will choose to lose
it's a sacrifice, but i can't live a lie
let it be known

let it be known that i cried for you
even started lying to you
what a thing to do
all because i wanted

to be loved and love at the highest count
means to lose all the things i can't live without
let it be known, known, known
that i will choose, i will lose
it's a sacrifice, but i can't live a lie
let it be known
let it be known that i tried, that i tried
let it be known that i tried

if you're not the one for me
then how come i can bring you to your knees?
if you're not the one for me
why do i hate the idea of being free?
and if i'm not the one for you
you've gotta stop holding me the way you do
oh honey, if i’m not the one for you
why have we been through what we have been through?

it's so cold out here in your wilderness
i want you to be my keeper
but not if you are so reckless

if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
say that our love ain't water under the bridge

what are you waiting for?
you never seem to make it through the door
and who are you hiding from?
it ain't no life to live like you're on the run
have i ever asked for much?
the only thing that i want is your love

if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
say that our love ain't water under the bridge

it's so cold in your wilderness
i want you to be my keeper
but not if you are so reckless

if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge

say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say that our love ain't water under the bridge (say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say that our love ain't water under the bridge (say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
say it ain't so, say it ain't so
say that our love ain't water under the bridge

when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i will never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

i'd go hungry, i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
know there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love


the storms are raging on the rollin' sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet

i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
to make you feel my love

i've made up my mind
don't need to think it over
if i'm wrong, i am right
don't need to look no further
this ain't lust, i know this is love, but
if i tell the world, i'll never say enough
'cause it was not said to you
and that's exactly what i need to do if i end up with you

should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste, even if i knew my place?
should i leave it there?
should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?

i build myself up and fly around in circles
waiting as my heart drops
and my back begins to tingle
finally, could this be it, or?

should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste, even if i knew my place?
should i leave it there?
should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere? yeah

should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste, even if i knew my place?
should i leave it there?
should i give up, or should i just keep on chasing pavements?
should i just keep on chasing pavements?
oh, oh

should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste, even if i knew my place?
should i leave it there?
should i give up, or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?

this is the end
hold your breath and count to ten
feel the earth move, and then
hear my heart burst again
for this is the end
i've drowned and dreamt this moment
so overdue, i owe them
swept away, i'm stolen

let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
face it all together
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
face it all together
at skyfall
at skyfall

skyfall is where we start
a thousand miles and poles apart
where worlds collide and days are dark
you may have my number
you can take my name
but you'll never have my heart

let the sky fall (let the skyfall)
when it crumbles (when it crumbles)
we will stand tall (we will stand tall)
face it all together
let the sky fall (let the skyfall)
when it crumbles (when it crumbles)
we will stand tall (we will stand tall)
face it all together
at skyfall
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall

where you go i go
what you see i see
i know i'd never be me
without the security
of your loving arms
keeping me from harm
put your hand in my hand
and we'll stand

let the sky fall (let the skyfall)
when it crumbles (when it crumbles)
we will stand tall (we will stand tall)
face it all together
let the sky fall (let the skyfall)
when it crumbles (when it crumbles)
we will stand tall (we will stand tall)
face it all together
at skyfall
let the sky fall
we will stand tall
at skyfall

my little love
i see your eyes widen like an ocean
when you look at me so full of my emotions
i'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
i know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

tell me you love me
i love you a million percent

i don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
so i ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
i feel so bad to be here when i'm so guilty
i'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе

oi, i feel like you don't love me
why do you feel likе that?
do you like me?
you know mummy doesn't like anyone else like i like you, right?

i'm holdin' on (barely)
mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
i'm holdin' on (catch me)
mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
like how?
just, like, hang on, my fingers are trapped
like, um, i feel a bit confused
why?
i don't know
and i feel like i don't really know what i'm doing
oh, at all?
at all
and that would make me go...

my little love
tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
when you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
i wanted you to have everything i never had
i'm so sorry if what i've done makes you feel sad

i love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
you're half me and you're half daddy
oh

i'm holdin' on (barely)
mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
i'm holdin' on (catch me)
mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

i'm having a bad day, i'm having a very anxious day
i feel very paranoid, i feel very stressed
um, i have a hangover, which never helps, but
i feel like today is the first day since i left him that i feel lonely
and i never feel lonely, i love being on my own
i always preferred being on my own than being with people
and i feel like maybe i've been, like, overcompensating
and being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
and i feel like today, i'm home and i wanna be at home
i just wanna watch tv and curl up in a ball and
be in my sweats and stuff like that, but i just feel really lonely
i feel a bit frightened that i might feel like this a lot

how can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
how come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
we're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
by puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
when i was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
soaking it all up for fun, but now i only soak up wine
they say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
and yet i don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

you better believe i'm tryin' (tryin', tryin')
to keep climbin' (climbin', climbin')
but the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

so i hope i learn to get over myself
stop tryin' to be somebody else
so we can love each other for free
everybody wants somethin', you just want me

why am i obsessin' about the things i can't control?
why am i seekin' approval from people i don't even know?
in these crazy times, i hope to find somethin' i can cling on to
'cause i need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

you better believe for you, i've cried (i've cried, i've cried)
high tides (high tides, high tides)
'cause i want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh

so i hope i learn to get over myself
stop tryin' to be somebody else
oh, i just want to love you, love you for free
everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

listen, i know how low i can go, i give as good as i get
you get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all i've got left
oh, i hope in time (hope in time)
we both will find (we both find), peace of mind
sometimes, the road less traveled is a road best left behind

well, i hope i learn to get over myself
stop tryin' to be somebody else
oh, i just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

you better believe i'm tryin' (tryin', tryin')
to keep climbin' (climbin', climbin')
but the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser

the only regret i have
i wish that it was just at a different time
a most turbulent period of my life
why would i put that on you?
that's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
but because of that period of time
even though it was so much fun
i didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
there were just memories in a big storm

i only wanted to have fun
learning to fly, learning to run
i let my heart decide the way
when i was young
deep down, i must have always known
that this would be inevitable
to earn my stripes, i'd have to pay
and bare my soul

i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes, i just feel it's only me
who can't stand the reflection that they see
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky, not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air, i miss my friends
i miss my mother, i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago

when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they can't look me in the eye
it's like they're scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they don't recognize me now
in the light of day

i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes, i just feel it's only me
who never became who they thought they'd be
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky, not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air, i miss my friends
i miss my mother, i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago

a million years ago

hold on
you are still strong
love will soon come
just hold, hold on

oh, what have i done yet again?
have i not learned anything?
i don't want to live in chaos
it's like a ride that i want to get off
it's hard to hold on to who i am
when i'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
i am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win

(hold on)
let time be patient
(you are still strong)
let pain be gracious
(love will soon come)
just hold, hold on

i swear to god, i am such a mess
the harder that i try, i regress
i'm my own worst enemy
right now, i truly hate bein' me
every day feels like the road i'm on
might just open up and swallow me whole
how do i feel so mighty small
when i'm struggling to feel at all?

just hold on (hold on)
let time be patient
you are still strong (you are still strong)
let pain be gracious (love will soon come)
just hold on (you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
hold on (you, just hold on, just hold on)

sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get
(just hold on, just hold on)
and the emptiness actually lets us forget
(just hold on, just hold on)
sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret
(just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

so just hold on, ooh
let time be patient and (you are still strong)
let pain be gracious
love will soon come, baby
if you just hold on

hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (hold on)
just let time be patient
'cause you're still strong, you're still strong (you are still strong)
just be gracious
love will soon come
if you just hold on
(you, just hold on, you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
just be patient, just be patient
(you, just hold on, you, just just hold on)
(you, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

take your eyes off of me so i can leave
i'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
this is never ending, we have been here before
but i can't stay this time 'cause i don't love you anymore

please stay where you are, don't come any closer
don't try to change my mind, i'm being cruel to be kind

i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby, we're already defeated
ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me

you have given me something that i can't live without
you mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
but i don't want to carry on like everything is fine
the longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight

please don't fall apart, i can't face your breaking heart
i'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby, we're already defeated
ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me

we're not the only ones
i don't regret a thing
every word i've said
you know i'll always mean
it is the world to me
that you are in my life
but i want to live and not just survive


that's why i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby, we're already defeated
'cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me
and i-i-i-i-i don't think you can save me

close enough to start a war
all that i have is on the floor
god only knows what we're fighting for
all that i say, you always say more

i can't keep up with your turning tables
under your thumb, i can't breathe

so i won't let you close enough to hurt me
no, i won't rescue you to just desert me
i can't give you the heart you think you gave me
it's time to say goodbye to turning tables
to turning tables

under haunted skies, i see you, ooh
where love is lost, your ghost is found
i braved a hundred storms to leave you
as hard as you try, no, i will never be knocked down

i can't keep up with your turning tables
under your thumb, i can't breathe

so i won't let you close enough to hurt me
no, i won't rescue you to just desert me
i can't give you the heart you think you gave me
it's time to say goodbye to turning tables
turning tables

next time, i'll be braver
i'll be my own saviour
when the thunder calls for me
next time, i'll be braver
i'll be my own saviour
standing on my own two feet

i won't let you close enough to hurt me
no, i won't rescue you to just desert me
i can't give you the heart you think you gave me
it's time to say goodbye to turning tables
to turning tables

turning tables, yeah
turn, no, no-oh, mmm

i want every single piece of you
i want your heaven and your oceans too
treat me soft but touch me cruel
i wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
bring the floor up to my knees
let me fall into your gravity
then kiss me back to life to see
your body standing over me

baby, don't let the lights go down
baby, don't let the lights go down
baby, don't let the lights go down
lights go down, lights go down
lights go down, lights go down
down, down, down

i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light
i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light

i love the way your body moves
towards me from across the room
brushing past my every groove
no one has me like you do, baby
bring your heart, i'll bring my soul
but be delicate with my ego
i wanna step into your great unknown
with you and me setting the tone

baby, don't let the lights go down
baby, don't let the lights go down
baby, don't let the lights go down
lights go down, lights go down
lights go down, lights go down
down, down, down

i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light
i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light

we play so dirty in the dark
'cause we are living worlds apart
it only makes it harder, baby
it only makes it harder, baby
harder baby, harder baby

i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light
i miss you when the lights go out
it illuminates all of my doubts
pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
baby, give me light

i miss you, i miss you
i miss you, i miss you
i miss you, i miss you
i miss you, i miss you
