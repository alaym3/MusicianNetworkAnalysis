why do all the monsters come out at night?
why do we sleep where we want to hide?
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?

another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, i know this beat too well
tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one i see
but i know what's missing when i'm swimmin'
in my lonely luxury

i'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
why do we sleep where we want to hide?
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?
why am i a sucker for all your lies?
strung out like laundry on every line
why do i come back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?

i'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
i swear everything look worse at night, i think i'm overthinking
i don't care who i might hurt along the way, i'm fuckin' sinking
into every word, i don't care if you're lyin' when i'm drinking, so
tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
and you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
i'm under it, i made my bed and i'm still wonderin'

i'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
why do we sleep where we want to hide?
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?
why am i a sucker for all your lies?
strung out like laundry on every line
why do i come back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?

thinkin' about you, you're in my head
even without you, i still feel dead
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?
dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
even without you, i still feel dead
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?

i'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
why do we sleep where we want to hide? (hide)
why do i run back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life?
why am i a sucker for all your lies?
strung out like laundry on every line
why do i come back to you, like i don't mind if you fuck up my life? (fuck up my life)

like i don't mind if you fuck up my life

i got your picture, i'm coming with you, dear maria, count me in
there's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and i'm the pen

when the lights go off, i want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
the way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader
'cause you know it's what you're good at, the low road for the fast track
make every second last

'cause i got your picture, i'm coming with you, dear maria, count me in
there's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and i'm the pen
make it count when i'm the one who's selling you out
'cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home-team
i'll be the narrator, telling another tale of the american dream
i see your name in lights, we can make you a star
girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard

'cause i got your picture, i'm coming with you, dear maria, count me in
there's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and i'm the pen
make it count when i'm the one who's selling you out
'cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd, woah-oh-oh!

haha!

take a breath, don't it sound so easy? never had a doubt, now i'm going crazy
watching from the floor
take a breath, and let the rest come easy, never settle down, 'cause the cash flow leaves me
always wanting more

'cause i got your picture, i'm coming with you, dear maria, count me in
there's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and i'm the pen
make it count when i'm the one who's selling you out
'cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

'cause i got your picture, i'm coming with you, dear maria, count me in
there's a story at the bottom of this bottle...

he woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
started making his way past 2 in the morning
he hasn't been sober for days
leaning now into the breeze
remembering sunday, he falls to his knees
they had breakfast together
but two eggs don't last
like the feeling of what he needs

now this place seems familiar to him
she pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
she led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
left him dying to get in

forgive me, i'm trying to find
my calling, i'm calling at night
i don't mean to be a bother
but have you seen this girl?
she's been running through my dreams
and it's driving me crazy, it seems
i'm gonna ask her to marry me

and even though she doesn't believe in love
he's determined to call her bluff
who could deny these butterflies?
they're filling his gut
waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
he pleads, though he tries
but he's only denied
now he's dying to get inside

forgive me, i'm trying to find
my calling, i'm calling at night
i don't mean to be a bother
but have you seen this girl?
she's been running through my dreams
and it's driving me crazy, it seems
i'm gonna ask her to marry me

the neighbors said she moved away
funny how it rained all day
i didn't think much of it then
but it's starting to all make sense
oh, i can see now that all of these clouds
are following me in my desperate endeavor
to find my whoever, wherever she may be

i'm not coming back (forgive me)
i've done something so terrible
i'm terrified to speak (i'm not calling, i'm not calling)
but you'd expect that from me
i'm mixed up, i'll be blunt, now the rain is just (you're driving me crazy, i'm)
washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
keeping an eye on the world
from so many thousands of feet off the ground
i'm over you now, i'm at home in the clouds
and towering over your head

well i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home

my ship went down
in a sea of sound
when i woke up alone
i had everything
a handful of moments
i wish i could change
and a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
in a city of fools
i was careful and cool
but they tore me apart like a hurricane
a handful of moments i wish i could change but i was carried away

give me therapy
i'm a walking travesty
but i'm smiling at everything
therapy, you were never a friend to me
and you can keep all your misery

my lungs gave out
as i faced the crowd
i think that keeping this up could be dangerous
i'm flesh and bone
i'm a rolling stone
and the experts say i'm delirious

give me therapy
i'm a walking travesty
but i'm smiling at everything
therapy, you were never a friend to me
you can take back your misery

arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to
they're better off without you (they're better off without you)
arrogant boy cause a scene like you're supposed to
they'll fall asleep without you
you're lucky if your memory remains

give me therapy
i'm a walking travesty
but i'm smiling at everything
therapy, you were never a friend to me
you can take back your misery
therapy, i'm a walking travesty
but i'm smiling at everything
therapy, you were never a friend to me
you can choke on your misery

i heard that you've been self-medicating
in the quiet of your room
your sweet suburban tomb
and if you need a friend
i'll help you stitch up your wounds

i've heard that you've been having some trouble
finding your place in the world
i know how much that hurts
but if you need a friend
then please, just say the word

you've come this far
you're all cleaned up
you've made a mess again
there's no more trying
it's time to sort yourself out

hold on tight
this ride is a wild one
make no mistake, the day will come
when you can't cover up what you've done
now don't lose your fight, kid
it only takes a little push to pull on through
with so much left to do
you'll be missing out
and we'll be missing you
come on!

and never for a second blame yourself

on a fault line, late night
underneath the stars we came alive
and singing to the sky just felt right
i won't forget the good times
while the punks started picking fights
with the skater kids under city lights
remember how we laughed 'til we cried
i won't forget the good times

i never want to leave this sunset town
but one day the time may come
and i'll take you at your word
and carry on
i'll hate the goodbye
but i won't forget the good times
i won't forget the good times

we were bare-knuckled, tight lip
middle fingers up, ego trip
devil may care but we didn't mind
i won't forget the good times
we're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
chasing girls who didn't know love yet
as the bonfire moon came down
i won't forget the good times

i never want to leave this sunset town
but one day the time may come
and i'll take you at your word
and carry on
i'll hate the goodbye
but i won't forget the good times
i won't forget the good times

when we laughed
when we cried
those were the days
we owned the nights
locked away
lost in time
i found the nerve
to say that

i never want to leave this sunset town
but one day the time may come
and i'll take you at your word
and carry on
i'll hate the goodbye
but i won't forget the good times
i won't forget the good times
i never want to leave this sunset town
but one day the time may come
and i'll take you at your word
and carry on
i'll hate the goodbye
but i won't forget the good times
i won't forget the good times

i don't believe in saints
they never make mistakes
i know it's not my place
who am i to tell you that you need to change?
her closet's such a mess
filled up with all the skeletons she's kept
nobody's perfect i confess
but she's perfect enough without ever dressing up, yeah

dirty laundry is piling in her room
she's got her secrets, yeah i've got mine too
i don't care about what you did
only care about what we do
dirty laundry
looks good on you

now here's some honesty
sometimes i trip over your history
wish i could change my mind
but it's the things i shouldn't see that always catch my eye

dirty laundry is piling in her room
she's got her secrets, yeah i've got mine too
i don't care about what you did
only care about what we do
dirty laundry
looks good on you (looks good on you)


dirty laundry is piling in her room
she's got her secrets, yeah i've got mine too
i don't care about what you did
only care about what we do
dirty laundry
looks good on you
dirty laundry
looks good on you
dirty laundry
looks good on you

it looks good on you

just a couple kids on a summer street
chasing around to a flicker beat
making mistakes that were made for us
we brushed them off like paper cuts

you said you're sick and tired of it, it
but i need you morning, night, and day
i miss you every single way-ay-ay
we said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

you were my last young renegade heartache
it only took one night
caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
we had to say goodbye

underneath the lights of a motorway
that's where i go to keep your ghost away
we used to be such a burning flame
now we're just smoke in the summer rain

you said you're sick and tired of it, it
but i need you morning, night, and day
i miss you every single way-ay-ay
we said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

you were my last young renegade heartache
it only took one night
caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
we had to say goodbye
i want to know that you're somewhere out there
somewhere down this road
you were my last young renegade heartache
how could i let you, how could i let you go?

you were the best thing that ever happened to me
and i'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

you were my last young renegade heartache
it only took one night
caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
we had to say goodbye
i want to know that you're somewhere out there
somewhere down this road
you were my last young renegade heartache
how could i let you, how could i let you
don't want to let you, i'll never let you go

manage me, i'm a mess
turn a page, i'm a book half unread
i wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
i wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
but i'm stuck in this fucking rut
waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
and i'm over
getting older

if i could just find the time
then i would never let another day go by
i'm over
getting old

maybe it's not my weekend
but it's gonna be my year
and i'm so sick of watching
while the minutes pass as i go nowhere
and this is my reaction
to everything i fear
'cause i've been going crazy
i don't want to waste another minute here

make believe that i impress
that every word by design turns a head
i wanna feel reckless, i wanna live it up, just because
i wanna feel weightless, 'cause that would be enough

if i could just find the time
then i would never let another day go by
i'm over
getting old

maybe it's not my weekend
but it's gonna be my year
and i'm so sick of watching
while the minutes pass as i go nowhere
and this is my reaction
to everything i fear
'cause i've been going crazy
i don't want to waste another minute here

this could be all i've waited for
(i've waited, i've waited for)
and this could be everything
i don't wanna dream anymore
maybe it's not my weekend
but it's gonna be my year
and i've been going crazy
i'm stuck in here

maybe it's not my weekend
but it's gonna be my year
and i'm so sick of watching
while the minutes pass as i go nowhere
and this is my reaction
to everything i fear
'cause i've been going crazy
i don't want to waste another minute here

i can't take another hollow point conversation
it's getting hard to fake
the sound of you, an outlasting vibration
there's something i can't shake

the sweetness of you on my tongue
i breathed you in, you filled my lungs
a bitter taste, surrender waste
another weakness

you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
take one down for the young and easy (young and easy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
you get me out of my head
i fill this space in your bed
high on the beat of a breakdown (breakdown)
'cause you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy)
and i don't wanna give it up

you caught me in a moment of redemption
there's nothing to explain
you had me on the edge of indiscretion
you said you feel the same

the sweetness of you on my tongue
i breathed you in, you filled my lungs
a bitter taste, surrender waste
another weakness

you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
take one down for the young and easy (young and easy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
you get me out of my head
i fill this space in your bed
high on the beat of a breakdown (breakdown)
'cause you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy)
and i don't wanna give it up
drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

(the sweetness of you on my tongue
i breathed you in, you filled my lungs
a bitter taste, surrender waste
another weakness)

you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
take one down for the young and easy (young and easy, yeah)
you get me out of my head

high on the beat of a breakdown (breakdown)
you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy)
and i don't wanna give it up

(drugs and candy)
no, i don't wanna give it up
(drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
you get me out of my head
high on the beat of a breakdown
and i don't wanna give it up
(drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

here we are at the end of the road
a road that's quietly caving in
come too far to pretend that we don't
we don't miss where we started
looking back, i see a setting sun
and watch my shadow fade into the floor
i am left standing on the edge
wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

they left us alone, the kids in the dark
to burn out forever, or light up a spark
we come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
so let the world sing, "what a shame! hey!
what a shame! hey!" beautiful scars on critical veins
come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

the kids in the dark
the kids in the dark

here we are at the top of the hill
a hill that's quietly crumbling
been a while since you dressed for the kill
the kill that sent me tumbling
looking up, i see a falling star
and watch its fire burn into the floor
and i am left standing on the edge
wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

they left us alone, the kids in the dark
to burn out forever, or light up a spark
we come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
so let the world sing, "what a shame! hey!
what a shame! hey!" beautiful scars on critical veins
come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa (the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
whoa, whoa

they left us alone, the kids in the dark
to burn out forever, or light up a spark
we come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
so let the world sing, "what a shame! hey!
what a shame! hey!" beautiful scars on critical veins
come together, state of the art
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
we'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

i woke up on a tuesday
felt like a friday night to me
never wanna leave this bed
tell me that you got nowhere to be

if i said, "i want your body", would you hold it against me?
seven in the morning, wanna listen to britney
everything you wanna, baby, that's okay with me now
(we don't sleep, but we like sleeping in)
closing up the curtains while you call out of work now
turning off my phone while you take off your shirt now
waste another day, 'nother night, 'nother weekend
we don't sleep, but we like sleeping in

everyday's a holiday
we stay hot when it's cold outside, y'know
haven't left your place in days
postmates and dirty laundry

just like that (woo)
there you go, making it hard to stay on track
we got shit to do, you got work
but we fall right back (woo)
into bed, like it's all just a game
and we can't help that, no, we can't help that
so we fall right back
just like that

if i said, "i want your body", would you hold it against me?
seven in the morning, wanna listen to britney
everything you wanna, baby, that's okay with me now

i'm a liar, i'm a cynic
i'm a sinner, i'm a saint
i'm a loser, i'm a critic
i'm the ghost of my mistakes
and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want
what are you after?
some kind of disaster, yeah

i woke up from a never-ending dream
i shut my eyes at 17
i lost every moment in between
i felt the sun rise up and swallow me, yeah

and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want

i'm a liar, i'm a cynic
i'm a sinner, i'm a saint
i'm a loser, i'm a critic
i'm the ghost of my mistakes
and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want
so what are you after?
some kind of disaster (some kind of disaster)

i crashed down from a high that felt so real
i never knew how much it would hurt to feel
you gotta hurt sometimes to learn to heal
you gotta get back up and learn to deal, yeah

and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want

i'm a liar, i'm a cynic
i'm a sinner, i'm a saint
i'm a loser, i'm a critic
i'm the ghost of my mistakes
and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want
so what are you after?
some kind of disaster (some kind of disaster)

well, i've sung this song a thousand times
i wore the crown, i sold the lie
i lived the life and paid for every crime, yeah
it's all downhill 'til it's a climb
through blood and tears, but i don't mind
i'll just keep singing on and on and on

and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want

'cause i'm a liar, i'm a cynic
i'm a sinner, i'm a saint
i'm a loser, i'm a critic
i'm the ghost of my mistakes
and it's all my fault that i'm still the one you want

so what are you after?
some kind of disaster

once in a lifetime
once in a lifetime

i wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it
i wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage
i wanna drive this car right over the edge
of every bad idea, i didn't have yet
i look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic
dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic
i never meant to be hypocritical
this fucking crazy ride's left me cynical

and just like that, i know there's no turning back
we already made this bed and i can't even sleep in it

once in a lifetime, never the right time
take it fast and kill me slow
try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'til i hit an all-time low
once in a lifetime, never the right time
to throw out everything we had
try to forget you, gotta pretend to
i hope a heart only breaks this bad
once in a lifetime

i try to run, try to hide, just forget about it
i tell myself every night, i could live without it
i wanna say goodbye to the loneliness
but every time i do, i make another mess

and just like that, i know there's no looking back
we already made this bed and i can't even sleep in it

once in a lifetime, never the right time
take it fast and kill me slow
try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'til i hit an all-time low
once in a lifetime, never the right time
to throw out everything we had
try to forget you, gotta pretend to
i hope a heart only breaks this bad
once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime

and just like that, i know there's no turning back
we already made this bed and i can't even sleep in it

once in a lifetime, never the right time
take it fast and kill me slow
try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'til i hit an all-time low
once in a lifetime, never the right time

i hope a heart only breaks this bad

once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (i hope a heart only breaks this bad)
once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime

lazy lover, find a place for me again
you felt it once before, i know you did
i can see it
whiskey princess, drink me under, pull me in
you had me at "come over, boy, i need a friend"
i understand

backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the sweat away to your radio
backseat serenade, little hand grenade
oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the pain away to your radio

you take me over, i throw you up against the wall
we've seen it all before but this one's different
it's deliberate
you send me reeling, calling out to you for more
the value of this moment lives in metaphor
yeah, through it all

backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the sweat away to your radio
backseat serenade, little hand grenade
oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the pain away to your radio


backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the sweat away to your radio
backseat serenade, little hand grenade
oh, aren't you sick of sleeping alone?
you're salty like a summer day
kiss the pain away to your radio

oh, god, i'm sick of sleeping alone

i woke up in a stranger's bed
with pins and needles in my head
and the clock ticking off the wall
oh yeah, oh yeah
i don't even know myself
i wish i could be someone else
but i don't have a clue at all
oh yeah

i'm sinking, you're wading
i'm thinking something's gotta give

oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give
oh, pull me out of this sinking town
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give

maybe i'm a fucking waste
filling up the empty space
i've been here way too long
oh yeah, oh yeah
i'm feeling like a nervous wreck
living on the last paycheck
i'm the cliché in a song
and everybody's singing along

i'm sinking, you're wading
i'm thinking something's gotta give

oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give
oh, pull me out of this sinking town
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give

someone please come pull me out
from the shadow of my doubt
wake me up, i'm falling

oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give
oh, pull me out of this sinking town
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give
i'm sinking, you're waiting
i'm thinking something's gotta give
oh, pull me out of this sinking town
i'm dying to live, something's gotta give

sippin' cherry cola, starin' at the poster on the wall
what's the point of going out when you could just give me a call?
sittin' on your sofa, reminiscing over 23
you touch yourself the way i used to, now that's just a memory

weekend wonderful
fade-away youth
summer symphony
what could i do?

we were getaway green
in a world of black and white
getaway green
like the costa mesa traffic lights
keep on, keep on, keep on
tellin' me i'm what you need
like getaway green, getaway green

i know i'm not supposed to color in the lines when it comes to you
undefined and out of mind 'til you get lost and lonely too
i guess i get the message, we don't have to stress this anymore
if it happens, then it happens, happy to have you at all

weekend wonderful
fade away youth
summer symphony
what could i do?

we were getaway green
in a world of black and white
getaway green
like the costa mesa traffic lights
keep on, keep on, keep on
tellin' me i'm what you need
like getaway green, getaway green

do you wanna know how the story ends?
hazy and spun out, just more than friends
weekend wonderful a dizzy dream
a colorful lie, we made a hell of a team

we were getaway green
in a world of black and white
getaway green
like the costa mesa traffic lights
keep on, keep on, keep on
tellin' me i'm what you need
like getaway green, getaway green

like getaway green
getaway (getaway) green

all these people are passed out
on the floor in my hotel room
i don't know half of them
but they all wanna know me
and it's four in the morning
i'm just trying to fix myself
what the hell did i do?
i’m the life of the party
i’m the life of the party

somewhere in between
who i used to be
and who i’ll be tomorrow
when the champagne blows my mind
thrills don’t come for free
the price you pay for dreams
in a sea of strangers
i can’t find me anymore, anymore
i can’t find me anymore

i keep thinking about you
how you level me out sometimes
when i'm out of my head
and i don't wanna face it
you said it's all for a reason
what the fuck is the reason now?
coming down, bring me back
i'm the life of the party
i’m the life of the party

somewhere in between
who i used to be
and who i’ll be tomorrow
when the champagne blows my mind
thrills don’t come for free
the price you pay for dreams
in a sea of strangers
i can’t find me anymore, anymore
i can’t find me anymore, anymore
i can’t find me anymore

now it's four in the morning
i'm trying to fix myself
what the hell did i do?
i'm the life of the party
it's so hard to imagine
who i'd be if i walked away
never know what it's like
to be the life of the party
i'm the life of the party
i'm the life of the party

somewhere in between
who i used to be
and who i’ll be tomorrow
when the champagne blows my mind
thrills don’t come for free
the price you pay for dreams
in a sea of strangers
i can’t find me anymore, anymore
i can’t find me anymore, anymore
in a sea of strangers, i can’t find me anymore

i think the whole world's crazy
i don't want to leave my bedroom
there's a devil on my shoulder
and a monster in the television
set me up for failure
all i wanted was some options
but my only choice is leaving
like time is not a crocodile

but i don't mind
i don't mind

everything is fine and nothing matters
weather's always nice inside my head
i turn my music up so loud
tired of bullshit, drown it out
everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
if i don't care

pull the curtains back
i think my neighborhood's on fire again
the kids are not alright it seems
at least they went outside this time
the gunshot has gone off
but i am swimming in a footrace
there's no finish line in sight
and they already gave the first place medal

i don't mind
i don't mind

everything is fine and nothing matters
weather's always nice inside my head
i turn my music up so loud
tired of bullshit, drown it out
everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
and it makes it all ok if i don't care
(if i don't care)

everything's alright (i don't mind)
everything is fine (i don't mind)
everything's alright (i don't mind)

everything is fine and nothing matters
(nothing really matters at all)
weather's always nice inside my head
i turn my music up so loud
tired of bullshit, drown it out
everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
i slept through another day
and it makes it all ok if i don't care

i got a lot of things on my mind right now
a million ways to think about you
i can't say i expected anything different
'cause the way you complicate me's simple, yeah

ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
she didn't stutter, my chest flutters
cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer
ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
i'm superstitious, the kid's vicious
bubblegum smile, taste the cherry on her lips

you know i want you in the worst way
i need you like cake on my birthday
the way you operate is so sweet
i need you like cake on my birthday
ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba

i got a lot of long nights in my life right now
and a lot of spare time to waste with you
i can't say i expected something so visceral
but the way we complicate it's simple, oh yeah

ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
she didn't stutter, my chest flutters
cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer
ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
i'm superstitious, the kid's vicious
bubblegum smile, taste the cherry on her lips

you know i want you in the worst way
i need you like cake on my birthday
the way you operate is so sweet
i need you like cake on my birthday

cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer
ba da da da da da da da da
cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer

you know i want you in the worst way
i need you like cake on my birthday
the way you operate is so sweet
i need you like cake on my birthday

ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
i need you like cake on my birthday
ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
i need you like cake on my birthday
