you bring out feelings in me i never show
nobody has made me feel this way before
i'm a good girl, but i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad-ad-ad
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad

and they say bad girls ain't no good
good girls ain't no fun
i still can't find a nigga that touch that
i don't know one
and i ain't searching for it
never trust but i'm working on it
fell in love with that ride game
swimming pool, you surfing on it
like 'yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
they still think you a church girl
we linking up on your days off
and i still give you that work girl
like work, twerk
do it like that video
wanted that for a long time
cool with it, i get it though
first year we both fronted
we had feelings we didn't show
second year we couldn't hide it
funny part they didn't know
how could something that's so wrong feel so right?
but who to tell you this wrong, though? this your life
word up
you bring out feelings in me i never show
nobody has made me feel this way before
i'm a good girl, but i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad-ad-ad
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad

we just fucking up the city, going hard every night
niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
cause i broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
but you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
so they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
i'm loving your style the way you preserve it
just look at my eyes and see what's inside
you know that it's pride, you say that i'm worth it
but said i ain't ready, really i'm ready
really i'm ready, i'm ready like never before
i'mma just give you a key to my heart
you'll be the first that i let in the door
i used to hear that you flirt with them guys
they never would score
all you was hearing about me and the women
ain't trust them before
you know what you're doing, fuck what they said
you know what we on
when we in bed, it's like we on stage
and i got the mic so let me perform, sing it
you bring out feelings in me i never show
nobody has made me feel this way before
i'm a good girl, but i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad-ad-ad
i wanna be bad for you
i wanna be bad 

ayo, this the one? we all get caught in our own sins. sometimes i have to remind myself, that on my worst day, i live like somebody on their greatest—and so do you. don't let your demons take you to hell. introduce 'em to heaven!

some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
the things we do just to make it through
but nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

look, i got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
and niggas doin' life, they ain't never comin' home
they said i wouldn't make it or never see the throne
and my baby mama hate me ‘cause she said i did her wrong
‘cause i left, to chase my dream, get it any means
i said that i'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
that back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
i said fuck them other niggas, i go get it with my team
if we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
i used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
now it's g5 flights, fuck a depart time
it was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
‘cause i was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
every night we strappin' like we was in iraq to fight
‘cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
whoa, i got to make it home to my son
on them papers with a firm hold on his gun
before i snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
in boilin' water, in the world of no order
in the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
i'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!
some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
the things we do just to make it through
but nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

yeah, i used to pop a lot of shit, now i keep it moderate
these niggas know i been iced out, hoppin' outta shit
right now i'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
a nice university, one of these black colleges
far as the hood go, i acknowledge it
but whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
luckily, i can tell the difference
my man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
jealous instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
we dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
without workin' for it, not often you find riches
some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
d-block, finish that and cop more dope
i'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
if you got enough cigars we can all smoke
ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
so we could never be equal
never bite the hand that'll feed you
never fear a man if he bleed too
some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
you can't see the devil, he's see-through
some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
the things we do just to make it through
but nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life 

woo! woo!
