if i should stay
i would only be in your way
so i'll go but i know
i'll think of you every step of the way

and i will always love you
i will always love you
you
my darling, you

bittersweet memories
that is all i'm taking with me
so good-bye
please don't cry
we both know i'm not what you, you need

and i will always love you
i will always love you
you


i hope life treats you kind
and i hope you have all you've dreamed of
and i'm wishing you joy and happiness
but above all this, i wish you love

and i will always love you
i will always love you
i will always love you
i will always love you
i will always love you
i, i will always love you

you
darling, i love you
i'll always
i'll always love you

share my life, take me for what i am
'cause i'll never change all my colors for you
take my love, i'll never ask for too much
just all that you are and everything that you do

i don't really need to look very much further
i don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
i won't hold it back again, this passion inside
can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

but don't make me close one more door
i don't wanna hurt anymore
stay in my arms if you dare
or must i imagine you there
don't walk away from me
i have nothing, nothing, nothing
if i don't have you, you, you, you, you

you see through, right to the heart of me
you break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
i never knew love like i've known it with you
will a memory survive, one i can hold on to

i don't really need to look very much further
i don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
i won't hold it back again, this passion inside
i can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
your love, i'll remember forever

but don't make me close one more door
i don't wanna hurt anymore
stay in my arms if you dare
or must i imagine you there
don't walk away from me
i have nothing, nothing, nothing
don't make me close one more door
i don't wanna hurt anymore
stay in my arms if you dare
or must i imagine you there
don't walk away from me, no
don't walk away from me

don't you dare walk away from me
i have nothing, nothing, nothing
if i don't have you, you
if i don't have you, oh you

i believe the children are our future
teach them well and let them lead the way
show them all the beauty they possess inside
give them a sense of pride to make it easier
let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
everybody's searching for a hero
people need someone to look up to
i never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
a lonely place to be
and so i learned to depend on me

i decided long ago
never to walk in anyone's shadows
if i fail, if i succeed
at least i'll live as i believe
no matter what they take from me
they can't take away my dignity

because the greatest love of all
is happening to me
i found the greatest love of all
inside of me
the greatest love of all
is easy to achieve
learning to love yourself
it is the greatest love of all

i believe the children are our future
teach them well and let them lead the way
show them all the beauty they possess inside
give them a sense of pride to make it easier
let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

i decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
if i fail, if i succeed
at least i'll live as i believe
no matter what they take from me
they can't take away my dignity

because the greatest love of all
is happening to me
i found the greatest love of all
inside of me
the greatest love of all
is easy to achieve
learning to love yourself
it is the greatest love of all

and if, by chance, that special place
that you've been dreaming of
leads you to a lonely place
find your strength in love

huh
yeah
woo!
hey yeah
huh
ooh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i want to dance

clock strikes upon the hour
and the sun begins to fade
still enough time to figure out
how to chase my blues away
i've done alright up 'til now
it's the light of day that shows me how
and when the night falls
the loneliness calls

oh, i wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah! i wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
oh, i wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah! i wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me

i've been in love and lost to my senses
spinning through the town
sooner or later, the fever ends
and i wind up feeling down
i need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last
so when the night falls
my lonely heart calls

oh, i wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody

i ain't gon' to take it, i ain't gon' take it no more
i ain't gon' to take it, boy
i ain't gon' to take it no more
everything that you said was a lie
don't lie to me

i know it's been some time
but there's something on my mind
you see
i haven't been the same
since that cold november day
we said we needed space
but all we found was an empty place
and the only thing
i learned
is that i need you desperately

so here i am
and can you please tell me

where do broken hearts go?
can they find their way home
back to the open arms
of a love that's waiting there?
and if somebody loves you
won't they always love you?
i look in your eyes
and i know that you still care, for me
ooh baby

i've been around enough to know
that dreams don't turn to gold
and that there is no easy way
no, you just can't run away
and what we have is so much more
than we ever had before
and no matter how i try
you're always on my mind

so here i am
and can you please tell me

where do broken hearts go?
can they find their way home
back to the open arms
of a love that's waiting there?
and if somebody loves you
won't they always love you?
i look in your eyes
and i know that you still care, for me

and now that i am here with you
i'll never let you go
i look into your eyes
and now i know, now i know

where do broken hearts go?
can they find their way home
back to the open arms
of a love that's waiting there?
and if somebody loves you
won't they always love you?
i look in your eyes
and i know that you still care, for me

each day i live
i want to be
a day to give
the best of me
i'm only one
but not alone
my finest day
is yet unknown
i broke my heart
fought every gain
to taste the sweet
i face the pain
i rise and fall
yet through it all
this much remains

i want one moment in time
when i'm more than i thought i could be
when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
and the answers are all up to me
give me one moment in time
when i'm racing with destiny
then in that one moment of time
i will feel
i will feel eternity

i've lived to be
the very best
i want it all
no time for less
i've laid the plans
now lay the chance
here in my hands

i want one moment in time
when i'm more than i thought i could be
when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
and the answers are all up to me
give me one moment in time
when i'm racing with destiny
then in that one moment of time
i will feel
i will feel eternity

you're a winner for a lifetime
if you seize that one moment in time
make it shine

i want one moment in time
when i'm more than i thought i could be
when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
and the answers are all up to me
give me one moment in time
when i'm racing with destiny
then in that one moment of time
i will feel
i will feel eternity

i will be
i will be
i will be free, yeah
i will be
i will be free

i don't know why i like it
i just do

i've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
i keep your photo right beside my bed
livin' in a world of fantasies
i can't get you out of my head
i've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
why you wanna make me feel so good?
i got a love of my own, babe
i shouldn't get so hung up on you

i remember the way that we touched
i wish i didn't like it so much

i get so emotional, baby
every time i think of you
i get so emotional, baby
ain't it shocking what love can do?
ain't it shocking what love can do?
ain't it shocking what love can do?

i gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
i gotta watch you walk out
i like the animal way you move
and when you talk
i just watch your mouth

i remember the way that we touched
i wish i didn't like it so much

i get so emotional, baby
every time i think of you
i get so emotional, baby
ain't it shocking what love can do?
i get so emotional, baby
every time i think of you
i get so emotional, baby
ain't it shocking what love can do?
ain't it shocking what love can do?
ain't it shocking what love can do?

see i remember the way that we touched
i wish i didn't like it so much

i get so emotional, baby
everytime i think of you
i get so emotional, baby
ain't it shocking what love can do?

i used to cry myself to sleep at night
but that was all before he came
i thought love had to hurt to turn out right
but now he's here
it's not the same, it's not the same

he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need

and in the morning when i kiss his eyes
he takes me down and rocks me slow
and in the evening
when the moon is high
he holds me close and won't let go
he won't let go

he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need
he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need
he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need

everyone falls in love sometime
sometimes it's wrong
and sometimes it's right
for every win
someone must fail
but there comes a point when
when we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

shoop, shoop, shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop (yeah)
shoo be doop shoop shoop
(all you got to say is shoo be doop)
shoo be doop shoop shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo be doop)
shoo be doop shoop shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop
shoo be doo

sometimes you'll laugh
sometimes you'll cry
life never tells us
the when's or why's
when you've got friends to wish you well
you'll find a point when
you will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

shoop, shoop, shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo shoo shoo huh)
shoo be doop shoop shoop
shoo be doop shoop shoop (sho0 be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (say shoop say shoo be say shoo be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (say shoo-hoo say sho)
shoo be doo (be doo oh)

hearts are often broken
when there are words unspoken
in your soul there's
answers to your prayers
if you're searching for
a place you know
a familiar face
somewhere to go
you should look inside yourself
you're halfway there

sometimes you'll laugh
sometimes you'll cry
life never tells us
the when's or why's
when you've got friends to wish you well
you'll find a point when
you will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

shoop, shoop, shoop (shoo be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo-hoo-hoo be)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (shoo be doop doop doop hoo hoo hoo)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (do do shoo be shoo be feels alright)
shoo be doop shoop shoop (you can say oh)
shoo be doo

remember when we held on in the rain
the night we almost lost it
once again we can take the night into tomorrow
living on feelings
touching you i feel it all again

didn't we almost have it all
when love was all we had worth giving?
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend
loving you makes life worth living
didn't we almost have it all?
the night we hold on 'til the morning
you know you'll never love that way again
didn't we almost have it all?

the way you used to touch me felt so fine
we kept our hearts together down the line
a moment in the soul can last forever
comfort and keep us
help me bring the feeling back again

didn't we almost have it all
when love was all we had worth giving?
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend
loving you makes life worth living
didn't we almost have it all?
the night we hold on 'til the morning
you know you'll never love that way again
didn't we almost have it all?

didn't we have the best of times
when love was young and new?
couldn't we reach inside and find
the world of me and you?
we'll never lose it again
because once you know what love is
you never let it end

didn't we almost have it all
when love was all we had worth giving?
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend
loving you makes life worth living
didn't we almost have it all?
the night we hold on 'til the morning
you know you'll never love that way again
didn't we almost have it all?
didn't we almost have it all?
