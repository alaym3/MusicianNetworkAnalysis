and when they ask me, “who could ask for more?”

i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

traded in my sorrow for some joy that i borrowed
from back in the day
threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
i got something to say
i'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
the future will be
and did i forget to mention that i found a new direction
and it leads back to me?

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

the mistakes that i've made have given me the strength
to really believe
and no matter how i take it, there's no way i'm gonna fake it
'cause it's gotta be real
i've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'cause the truth's given me
a new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
do you like what you see?

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same

tera husn hai rehmat ya ghazab
tere ishq ibaadat ya khata
tu kahe to tere sang sang zindagi
ya guzaroon aaj ki raat raat
tu kahe to din
tu keh de to shaam
tu jo kahe woh sach
jo tu kahe wohi mera naam naam

kar le chiggy wiggy mere sang soniye

your feet move just like a dancer
your soul beats just like a drum
tomorrow has all the answers
today says we've just begun

don't you feel the sun on your face?
hopeful hearts of the human race
shining down from above

we're golden
burn like the stars
stay golden
straight from the heart
we're the voice that'll never give in
getting knocked down, back up again
we're golden, golden
that's who we are

live your life like you're stealing
every little moment in time
infinity goes on forever
lay your life on the line

don't you feel the sun on your face?
hopeful hearts of the human race
wrapped in the arms of love

we're golden
burn like the stars
stay golden
straight from the heart
we're the voice that'll never give in
getting knocked down, back up again
we're golden, golden
that's who we are

we're not young, and we're not old
we're the stories not yet told
won't be bought and can't be sold
we are golden

we're golden
burn like the stars
stay golden
straight from the heart
we're the voice that'll never give in
getting knocked down, back up again
we're golden, golden
that's who we are
