that's my house, i'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
and let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—i pay that
i love your mom and everything
but see, i ain't the only one who laid down
she wanna rib you up to start a custody war
my lawyers stay down
she never got a chance to hear my side of the story
we was divided

all you, do is defend that lady when i call you, yeah

forever never seems that long until you're grown
and notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong

become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
i pray so much about it, need some knee pads
it happened for a reason, one can't be mad

she said, "pardon me, are you balling?"
i said "darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
oh, so you're one them freaks

but game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
a quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat

yuh
uh-huh

even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie
and sometimes, "y"
nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(y'all know)
it's him and i: aquemini

yeah

now is the time to get on—like spike lee said, "get on the bus"
go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
is you on that dust or corn starch? familiar with that smack, man?
the music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
riding round old national on eighteens without no gat, man
i'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
me and my nigga, we roll together like batman and robin
we prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
but now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
in volkswagens and bonnevilles, chevrolets and coupe de villes
if you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (real)
you can go on and chill out and still build
let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill
and pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

yeah
yuh, yuh (yeah)

even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie
and sometimes, "y"
nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
and nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
it's him and i: aquemini

twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
live from "home of the brave," with dirty dollars
beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball impalas
street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
you know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
but, see, the catch is you can get caught
know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
it's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
it's looking bad—
need some hope like the words "maybe," "if," or "probably"
more than a hobby
when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
i'm sorry, y'all, i often drift—i'm talking gift
so when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
of course, you know i feel like the bearer of bad news
don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
now, question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
is every nigga with golds for the fall?
naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
it's outkast, "aquemini": another black experience

okay

even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie
and sometimes, "y"
nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
it's him and i: aquemini

the name is big boi, daddy fat sax, the nigga that like them cadillacs
i stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
better know that, some say we pro-black, but we professional
we missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
g—get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
you 'ear that? you can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (quit)
because "aquemini" is aquarius and the gemini running shit
like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

my mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
meet the twin, andré ben', welcome to the lion's den
original skin, many men comprehend
i extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
sin all depends on what you believing in
faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since mc ren
alien can blend right on in with your kin
look again, 'cause i swear, i spot one every now and then
it's happening again, wish i could tell you when
"andré, this is andré, y'all are just gon' have to make amends"

even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie
and sometimes, "y"
nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
and nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
it's him and i: aquemini

master: finally, igor! we've done it, we've done it!
igor: yes, master! yes, master!
master: igor, we've done it!
both: uh-oh
(*woman screaming*)

check it
well it's the m-i-crooked letter, ain't no one better
and when i'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'cause i'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
bend corners like i was a curve, i struck a nerve
and now you 'bout to see this southern playa serve
i heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
then i heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
you got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but i'm not worried
'cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
so go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
it tickles to see you try to be like mr. pickles
daddy fat sax, b-i-g b-o-i
it's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
and i try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
giving the shout-out to my uncle darnell locked up in prison

now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"
now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"

now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
to the female gender, ain't nothing better
let me know when it's wet enough to enter
if not i'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
if or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
they alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
like sounds of blackness when i practice what i preach ain't no lie
i'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
now breaker, breaker 10-4 can i get some reply?
now everybody say

now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"
now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"

every day i sit while my nigga be in school
thinking about the second album at the dungeon shooting pool
like e-s to the p-n, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
honey, i'm home but i'm not married
carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
and now i'm sitting at the end of the month i just made it
like you made the b team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
you heard the atliens, so back the hell up off me

softly as if i played piano in the dark
found a way to channel my anger now to embark
the world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
god works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
the job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
no drugs or alcohol, so i can get the signal clear as day
put my glock away, i got a stronger weapon
that never runs out of ammunition, so i'm ready for war, okay

now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"
now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o-yea-yer"

one, two
one, two, three, yeah!

inslumnational, underground
thunder pounds when i stomp the ground (whoo!)
like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
you can't stop the train
who want some don't come unprepared
i'll be there, but when i leave there
bet i'll be a household name
weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
so now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
in a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
hit somersaults without the net
but this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 anno domini, anything goes
be what you wanna be as long as you know
consequences are given for livin'
the fence is too high to jump in jail
too low to dig, i might just touch hell—hot!
get a life, now they on sale
then i might cast you a spell
look at what came in the mail
a scale and some arm & hammer
soul-gold grill and a baby mama
black cadillac and a pack of pampers
stack of questions with no answers
cure for cancer, cure for aids
make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
get back home, things are wrong
well not really, it was bad all along
before you left adds up to a ball of power
thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
believe there's always more, ha!

don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
bombs over baghdad!
yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
bombs over baghdad!
don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
bombs over baghdad!
yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
bombs over baghdad!

uno, dos, tres, it's on
did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
like that there boy and will still stay street
big things happen every time we meet
like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
outkast bumpin' up and down the street
slant back cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 mcs freestyling to the beat
'cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
should've held back, but you throwed the punch
supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
no d to the u to the g for you
got a son on the way by the name of bamboo
got a little baby girl, four-year—jordan
never turned my back on my kids, for them
should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
before you re-up, get a laptop
make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
record number four, but we on a roll
hold up, slow up, stop, "control"
like janet, planet, stankonia's on ya
moving like floyd, comin' straight to florida
lock all your windows, then block the corridors
pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
like a three-piece fish before i cut your daughter
yo quiero taco bell, then i hit the border
pitty-pat rappers trying to get to five
i'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
when you come to atl, boy, you better not hide
'cause the dungeon family gon' ride, ha!

don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
bombs over baghdad!
yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
bombs over baghdad!
don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
bombs over baghdad!
yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
bombs over baghdad!

dickie shorts, lincoln's clean
leanin', checking out the scene
gangsta boys, bigga's lit
ridin' out, talkin' shit
nigga, where you wanna go?
you know the club don't close 'til four
let's party 'til we can't no more
watch out, here come the folk—"damn"
oh, lord


as the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of charles
a lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of niggaville, usa
via atlanta, georgia
a lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
me? well, i've never been there
well, perhaps, once, but i was so engulfed in the ol' e', i never made it to the door
you speak of hardcore
while the dj sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
competing with "set it off" in the right
but it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!"
and the crowd goes wild, as if holyfield has just won the fight
but in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
two niggas done started busting—"wham! wham!"
and one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, "now, who else wanna fuck with hollywood court?"
it's just my interpretation of the situation

damn, damn, damn, james
damn, damn, damn, james
damn, damn, damn, james
damn, damn, damn, james

yes! when i first met my spottieottiedopalicious angel
i can remember that damn thing like yesterday
the way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
i walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
felt like i chiefed a whole o of that presidential
my heart was beating so damn fast
never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
one moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
now, that's a beautiful thang
that's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
might not always be sufficient
but the united parcel service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
so now, you back in the trap
just that: trapped!
go'n' and marinate on that for a minute

da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja
da, da, da, ja, ja, ja

one for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
a couple of years ago on headland and delowe
was the start of something good
where me and my nigga rode the marta through the hood
just tryna find that hookup
now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (yuh)
watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
had my pencil, and plus, my paper
we caught the 86 lithonia, headed to decatur
writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
like, "freeze!" we making the crowd move, but we not making no g's, and that's a no-no

check it, a-one-two, a-one
"two dope niggas in the cadillac," they call us
went from "player's ball" to ballers
putting the south up on the map was like little rock to banging
niggas say, "motherfuck that playin'," they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"outkast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me
i'm out this bitch

your momma and your cousin, too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you

back in the day, when i was younger, hunger
looking to fill me belly with that rallys, bullshit
pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
full as a tick, i was stoned like them white boys
smoking them white golds before them blunts got crunk
chunky asses, passes getting throwed like hail marys
and they looking like halle berrys
so, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
we's just chilling, i'm the rabid villain, and i'm so high
smoking freely, me, lil b, reek, mone and shug

where i live at, them rats know, "momma, i want to sing
but, momma, i want to trick (trick), and momma, i'm sucking dicks, now"
we moving on up in the world like elevators
me and the crew, we pimps like '82
me and you like tony! toni! tone! (yeah, yeah)
like this, east point and we gone

me and you
your momma and your cousin, too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin, too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors

got stopped at the mall the other day
heard a call from the other way that i just came from ("ayy")
some nigga was saying something
talking 'bout smoke something
"hey, man, you remember me from school?" "no, not really"
but he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
and he kept asking me, "what kinda car you drive?
i know you paid, i know y'all got beaucoup hoes
from all them songs that y'all done made"
and i replied that i'd been going through the same things that he has
true, i've got more fans than the average man
but not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
i live by the beat like you live check-to-check
if it don't move your feet, then, i don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
from virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

me and you
your momma and your cousin, too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin, too

i met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
to stimulate then activate the left and right brain
said, "baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
you focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'"
that's one to live or either that's one to die to
i try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
andré, got to her station, here's my destination she got off the bus the conversation lingered in my head for hours took a shower kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit it
but i'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
but anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
cause i thought it would be jammin'
but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
wrote and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shit's creek, "it's weak" is the last quote
that i wanna hear when i'm goin' down
when all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
when the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down

somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
was it the bitch that fucked the goodie and the dungeon crew?
let's say her name was suzy skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
making a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
had to hate you, playa
i'm dicking the ho down—never said i paid her
straight laid her, slayed the bitch like darth vader, made her
from college park and fayette all the way down to decatur
like jada, her wig was sharp and sporty—that was shawty
safe as a snake on eggs in a bimmer 840
it's foggy, i went to the crib to call her but she lost me
my baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
but i still wanna cut her, though—maybe she had to work?
i caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
she was fine as fuck; i wanted to sex the ho up
she said, "let's hit the parking lot so i can sick your duck"
i said, "cool, i really wanted to cut you but this'll do
i gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"
she said she understood and everything was kosher
i gave her a lil' wil cd and a fuckin' poster
it's like that, now

it's like that, now
you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
it's about four or five cats off in my 'lac now
we just shoot game in the form of story raps now (yeah)
it's like that now, t's like that now

now suzy skrew had a partner named sasha... thumper
i remember her number like the summer
when her and suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
well, it was more like spend the night
three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights
we chilling like a villain, and a nigga feeling right
in the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
we on our back staring at the stars above (aww, man)
talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up (mm)
i said, "what you wanna be?" she said, "alive"
it made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
i coulda died, time went on, i got grown
rhyme got strong, mind got blown
i came back home to find lil' sasha was gone
her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong (man)
i kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
that i would one day see her standing in the front row
but two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
with a needle in her arm, baby two months due
sasha thumper

it's like that now
you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
it's about four or five cats off in my 'lac now
we just shoot game in the form of story raps now
it's like that now, it's like that now
it's like that now
you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
it's about four or five cats off in my 'lac now
we just shoot game in the form of story raps now
it's like that now, it's like that now

grandmama: keisha, keisha! cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!

skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
you can hump them, lift them, bend them
give them something to remember
yell out "timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
take a deep breath and exhale

but let me listen to the story you tell

each other, like we brothers from another mother
kind of like mel gibson and danny glover

'cause i'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
i'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe

yeah, yeah

oh, yes, i love her like egyptian
want a description? my royal highness
so many plusses when i bust that there can’t be no minus
went from yelling crickets and crows
bitches and hoes to queen thangs
over the years i been up on my toes and yes i seen thangs
like kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, i’m going off
and coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
with these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
when they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
coming around my crew looking jazzy, wanna pretend
like you ms. goody four-shoes, even bo knew that you got poked
like acupuncture patients
while our nation is a boat, straight sinking
i hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
they fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
i’m willing to go the extra kilometer
just to see my señorita get her pillow
on the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
house and doctor was the games we used to play
but now it’s real jazzy belle

see what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
having the very best of life: lobster, steak and perignon
smoking an ounce of weed
and every single day was personal freaknik
tricking these hoes in polo clothes, life as you conceived it
but your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
i see your weapon and it’s depressing
they're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
steadily calling me antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
i wanted to hit that ass but me and the goodie we got danky
so thank thee, for running that southernplayalistic game
you was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
it’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2pac up
i’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
see, i gotta be feeding my daughter
teach her to be that natural woman
'cause you’ll be waiting to exhale while you other hoes be dumb
and dumber, yeah, you know what i’m saying

see me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'lac northstar
windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
in this dog-eat-dog world

this is uh… a lil'… tune that we composed back on the first album
i know a lot of y'all, uh, playas out there thought we wasn't gon' come back at y'all with this thang here, but… it go a lil' some' like this!

"baby, did you hear that?" "yeah, baby, i heard it too"
look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
mama earth is dying and crying because of you
raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
i'm on the telephone dialing the dungeon ("hello?")
this dre, bring the mp and the sp
meet me at the center of the earth and travel carefully
baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
mama earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
omega nigga i.f.o.s are landing in decatur
hope i'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
from niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done
"who said good folks is not supposed to die?"

the sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
for some tickets to the playoffs, but the hornets, they won
nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, i gotta protect my family
i drove the biggest thing in the house cause i knew they'd try to ram me
but i'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way i know how
look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
him coming now, fuck that money now
i ask my honey how she feeling and is jordan okay? "yeah, yeah, she chillin'"
we should be at the dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
approaching the final exit, i'm thinking i see four horsies
but i don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
i put that on my dope boys from a-town to california
all the weed smell like ammonia but at the dungeon i know they're smoking
writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
fuck abortion, i got in the booth to run the final portion
the beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

"who said good folks is not supposed to die?"
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well
all's well, nothing's well

always asking "gimme some," living life like a bum
times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
nigga, you supposed to be grown
i agree, i try to be the man i'm 'posed to be
but negativity is all you seem to ever see
i admit, i've done some dumb shit, and i'm probably gon' do some mo'
you shouldn't hold that against me though
(why not?) why not? my music's all that i got
but some time must be invested for this to be manifested
i know you know but i'm gon' say this to you, i
get high but i don't get too high
so what's the limit 'posed to be?
that must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three
you need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
damn, what up with all these questions?
you act as though you know something i don't, do you have any suggestions?
cause every job i get is cruel and demeaning
sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
but i'm also sick and tired of struggling
i never ever thought i'd to have resort to drug smuggling
naw, that ain't what i'm about
cee-lo will just continue traveling his route
without any doubt or fear
i know the lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here

told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking starters
in the middle school, i was a bigger fool
i wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought i was cool
i used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, i call them my uncles
they taught me how to smoke herb, i followed them when they ran numbers
so in a sense, i was rosemary's baby
and then i learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
hell, i treat 'em all like hoes, see i pimped 'em
bitch never had my money so i never whipped 'em
see all the playas came and all the playas went
a playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
you need to git up, git out, git something
smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
yeah i said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a braves hat

i'm true to organized cause they raised me
i'm also down with laface cause l.a. reid, yeah, he pays me
and it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets

a lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
i'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
it's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
i got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
i'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
i'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
i had jamaica's best and when i light it up, i hear a voice in my head
(you got to git up, git out and git something)
now i know it's on, my day is finally started
back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 sedan deville, steady bouncing
out the point to campbellton road
the valley of the southside flow
everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
keep your eyes peeled for the cobra unit
cause they known for jumping out of black chevy trucks and through the fog
here come the red dogs, i'm busting out around the corner in my hog
dipping from the area, i'm scared
so one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause i have no time for jail
fuck clampett cops, fuck elgin bell
and crooked ass jackson, got the whole country
thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, big gipp, goodie mo
outkast, a vision from the past
hootie hoo!
my white owls are burning kind of slow

you need to git up, git out and git something

cause you and i got to do for you and i

y'all telling me that i need to get out and vote, huh, why?
ain't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why
i got to register? i thinking of better shit to do with my time
never smelled aroma of diploma, but i write the deep ass rhymes
so let me take y'all way
back to when a nigga stayed in southwest atlanta, ay
y'all could not tell me nothing, thought i hit that bottom rock
at age 13, start working at the loading dock
they laying my mama off of work, general motors tripping
but i come home banked like hank, from licking and dipping
doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
i dips, over to east point still actin' a fool
wasting my time in the school, i'd rather be shooting pool
cool is how i played the tenth grade
i thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
instead of being in class, i'd rather be up in some ass
not thinking about them six courses that i need to pass
graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
damn, that's fucked up, i should've listened when my mama told me
that, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
figured she was talking yang yang so i payed her no attention
and kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
the doper that i get, the more i'm feeling broke as shit
huh, but that don't matter though, i am an o-u-t-kast
so get up off your ass

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i

you need to...
you need to...
you need to...
you need to...

i met you in a club in atlanta, georgia
said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
you looked at me like, "yeah, nigga, right"
but you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
powder—how's about them oranges?
moved away from home to school with big plans
by day, studied the history of music
by night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
to get your pants was a mission impo–ssible
we were both the same age, but i
suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in
the same book of life, so i'd page you when
i felt you that were getting off of work
or either when you're on your way to school
we started hanging like ernie and bert
and in my idle head, i'm thinking, "cool"
just when i think i'm going down your shirt
you're hiking up your skirt now
the events that followed had me volley
if your hometown would be heaven or hell
the angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
therefore, hard to tell
you'd drop me off by the dungeon
never came in, but i knew that you were wondering
"now, are these niggas in this house up to something?
selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?"
w-w-well, yes and no
yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
cook it in the basement, then move it at a show
then grab the microphone, and everybody yelled, "ho!"
meanwhile, the video starts playing
bet, college radio, and a van
packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
and one in they ear—you know what i'm saying, but
i kept your number in my old phone
got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
so it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
but i promised i would call you when i got home, but
when i got home, i never did
by the time i did, heard that you'd had a kid
by some nigga in decatur who replied, "see you later"
when he got the good news—that's life, shit
now, i'm nineteen with a cadillac
my nigga had a lex with the gold pack
got a plaque, but i'm living with my pop-pop
so i got a glock and a lojack
yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
and never said much, 'cause half of what he saw
was so far from that place you wanna be
that words only fucked it up more; follow me
are you starting to gather what i'm getting at?
now if i'm losing you, tell me, then i'll double back
but keep in mind: at the time, "keep it real" was the phrase
silly when said now, but those were the days
when spring break and daytona
and freakniks made you wanna
drop out of college and never go back
move to the south, but that ain't a kodak
moment, on went myself and big bo—
well, you knew hm as "'twan"
that's right—you were around before this shit begun
well 'twan had a daughter and
sorta was made to mature before the first tour
we hit the road like jack
laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
girls used to say, "y'all talk funny. y'all from the islands?"
and i'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling
"no, i'm from atlanta, baby, he from savannah, maybe
we should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we
gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes"
she's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
fifteen-love, fit like glove
description is like fifteen doves
in a jacuzzi catching the holy ghost
making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
enough about me, how's about you? how's the lil' kid?
she was about two the last time we spoke
i hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'cause i'd start the second album off on another note; now—
that note threw some niggas in the hood off
but see, i'd balled out, and 'fore i'd fall out
i'd slow my lac down to a nice speed
the brain was that fried egg, i might need
new direction was apparent
i was a child looking at the floor, staring
so changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
yes, i was on the rise, yeast was the street
to make bread, never primary concern
just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
i'd meet muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
and macaroni niggas: "impastas"
so on a trip to new york on some beeswax
i get invited to a club where emcees at
and on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
similar to the turban that i covered up my dreads with
which i was rocking at the time
when i was going through them phases trying to find
anything that seemed real in the world
still searching, but i started liking this girl
now, you know her as erykah "on & on" badu
call tyrone on the phone, "why you
do that girl like that, boy? you ought to be ashamed"
the song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name
were young, in love; in short, we had fun
no regrets, no abortion, had a son
by the name of seven
and he's five; by the time i do this mix, he'll probably be six
you do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts
y'all stand against the wall blindfolded; we throw the darts
to poke you in the heart and take you from the start
to when luxury transportation meant a marta card
or either when your girlfriend that went to mays' mama
or her daddy let her borrow the benz, because she smart
or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
and he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
you fix it up, you trick it out
you give it rims, you give it bump
you give it all your time because that's all you can think about
and that's as far as i got
(*music fades*)

"and that's as far as i got, and where i wanted to go, knowing, the whole summer, that's all you could think about. even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up, you need a jump, like you need and you want to grow, and you change all the time. so that rabbit that you thought about that whole summer—the next summer, you didn't want that rabbit no more. you wanted something bigger and better."
"so the summer passed and now the rabbit's old?"
"right... right, so now you want a cadillac..."
