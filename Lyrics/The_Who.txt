out here in the fields, i fight for my meals
i get my back into my living
i don't need to fight to prove i'm right
i don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


don't cry, don't raise your eye
it's only teenage wasteland

sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
the exodus is here, the happy ones are near
let's get together before we get much older

teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
teenage wasteland
they're all wasted

who are you?
who, who, who, who?
who are you?
who, who, who, who?
who are you?
who, who, who, who?
who are you?
who, who, who, who?

i woke up in a soho doorway
a policeman knew my name
he said "you can go sleep at home tonight
if you can get up and walk away"
i staggered back to the underground
and the breeze blew back my hair
i remember throwing punches around
and preaching from my chair

well, who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
tell me who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
because i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)

i took the tube back out of town
back to the rolling pin
i felt a little like a dying clown
with a streak of rin tin tin
i stretched back and i hiccupped
and looked back on my busy day
eleven hours in the tin pan
god, there's got to be another way

well, who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
oh, who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
come on tell me who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
oh, who the fuck are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)

who are you?
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh

who are you?
who, who, who, who?
who are you?
who, who, who, who?
who are you?
who, who, who, who?

who, who, who, who?

i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
come on tell me who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
because i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)

i know there's a place you walked
where love falls from the trees
my heart is like a broken cup
i only feel right on my knees
i spit out like a sewer hole
yet still receive your kiss
how can i measure up to anyone now
after such a love as this?

well, who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
tell me whoa are you(who are you? who, who, who, who?)
oh, i really want to know (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
tell me, tell me, who are you? (who are you? who, who, who, who?)

oh, tell me who are you (who are you? who, who, who, who?)
i really wanna know
oh, i really wanna know
come on tell me, who are you, you, you, you?
who are you?

no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man, to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
no one knows what it's like
to be hated, to be fated
to telling only lies

but my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance that's never free

no one knows what it's like
to feel these feelings like i do
and i blame you
no one bites back as hard
on their anger, none of my pain and woe
can show through

but my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance that's never free

when my fist clenches, crack it open
before i use it and lose my cool
when i smile, tell me some bad news
before i laugh and act like a fool
and if i swallow anything evil
put your finger down my throat
and if i shiver, please give me a blanket
keep me warm, let me wear your coat

no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man, to be the sad man
behind blue eyes

we'll be fighting in the streets
with our children at our feet
and the morals that they worship will be gone
and the men who spurred us on
sit in judgment of all wrong
they decide and the shotgun sings the song

i'll tip my hat to the new constitution
take a bow for the new revolution
smile and grin at the change all around
pick up my guitar and play
just like yesterday
then i'll get on my knees and pray
we don't get fooled again

change, it had to come
we knew it all along
we were liberated from the fold, that's all
and the world looks just the same
and history ain't changed
'cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

i'll tip my hat to the new constitution
take a bow for the new revolution
smile and grin at the change all around
pick up my guitar and play
just like yesterday
then i'll get on my knees and pray
we don't get fooled again
no, no

i'll move myself and my family aside
if we happen to be left half-alive
i'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
for i know that the hypnotized never lie
do you?


yeah
there's nothing in the street
looks any different to me
and the slogans are effaced, by-the-bye
and the parting on the left
is now the parting on the right
and the beards have all grown longer overnight

i'll tip my hat to the new constitution
take a bow for the new revolution
smile and grin at the change all around
pick up my guitar and play
just like yesterday
then i'll get on my knees and pray
we don't get fooled again
don't get fooled again
no, no


yeah
meet the new boss
same as the old boss

ever since i was a young boy, i've played the silver ball
from soho down to brighton, i must've played 'em all
but i ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

he stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

he's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
a pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

how do you think he does it? i don't know!
what makes him so good?

ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
don't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell
always gets the replay, never seen him fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

i thought i was the bally table king
but i just handed my pinball crown to him

even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
his disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
he's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

athena, i had no idea how much i would need her

my heart starts palpitating when i think my guess was wrong
but i think i will get along

before the memory claimed
how long would children remain
how long could children remain

happy jack wasn't old, but he was a man
he lived in the sand at the isle of man.
the kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
so they rode on his head in their furry donkey

the kids couldn't hurt jack
they tried, tried, tried
they dropped things on his back
they lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

but they couldn't stop jack, or the waters lapping
and they couldn't prevent jack from feeling happy
but they couldn't stop jack, or the waters lapping
and they couldn't prevent jack from feeling happy


the kids couldn't hurt jack
they tried, tried, tried

why should i care?
why should i care?

girls of fifteen
sexually knowing
the ushers are sniffing
eau de cologning
the seats are seductive
celibate sitting
pretty girls digging
prettier women
magically bored on a quiet street corner
free frustration in our minds and our toes
quiet storm water, m-m-my generation
uppers and downers, either way blood flows

(inside outside) leave me alone
(inside outside) nowhere is home
(inside outside) where have i been?
out of my brain on the 5:15
out of my brain on the train
out of my brain on the train

on a raft in the quarry
slowly sinking
back of a lorry
holy hitching
dreadfully sorry
apple scrumping
born in the war
birthday punching
he man drag in a glittering ballroom
greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
tightly undone, know what they're showing
sadly ecstatic that their heros are news

(inside outside) leave me alone
(inside outside) nowhere is home
(inside outside) where have i been?
out of my brain on the 5:15
out of my brain on the train
out of my brain on the train

why should i care?
why should i care?

i'm free, i'm free
and freedom tastes of reality
i'm free, i'm free
and i'm waiting for you to follow me

if i told you what it takes
to reach the highest high
you'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
but you've been told many times before
messiahs pointed to the door
and no one had the guts to leave the temple!

i'm free, i'm free
and freedom tastes of reality
i'm free, i'm free
and i'm waiting for you to follow me

how can we follow?
how can we follow?
