words like violence break the silence
come crashing in into my little world
painful to me, pierce right through me
can't you understand? oh, my little girl

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm


vows are spoken to be broken
feelings are intense, words are trivial
pleasures remain, so does the pain
words are meaningless and forgettable

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm


all i ever wanted
all i ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm
all i ever wanted
all i ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm


enjoy the silence

you've been kept down
you've been pushed 'round
you've been lied to
you've been fed truths
who's making your decisions?
you or your religion
your government, your countries
you patriotic junkies

where's the revolution?
come on, people
you're letting me down
where's the revolution?
come on, people
you're letting me down

you've been pissed on
for too long
your rights abused
your views refused
they manipulate and threaten
with terror as a weapon
scare you till you're stupefied
wear you down until you're on their side

where's the revolution?
come on, people
you're letting me down
where's the revolution?
come on, people

you had something to hide
should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
now you're not satisfied
with what you're being put through

it's just time to pay the price
for not listening to advice
and deciding in your youth
on the policy of truth

things could be so different now
it used to be so civilised
you will always wonder how
it could have been if you'd only lied

it's too late to change events
it's time to face the consequence
for delivering the proof
in the policy of truth

never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before

now you're standing there tongue-tied
you'd better learn your lesson well
hide what you have to hide
and tell what you have to tell

you'll see your problems multiplied
if you continually decide
to faithfully pursue
the policy of truth

never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before


never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before

there'll be times when my crimes
will seem almost unforgivable
i give in to sin
because you have to make this life livable
but when you think i've had enough from your sea of love
i'll take more than another riverful
yes, and i'll make it all worthwhile
i'll make your heart smile

strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
strangelove, that's how my love goes
strangelove, will you give it to me?

will you take the pain i will give to you
again and again and will you return it?

there'll be days when i'll stray
i may appear to be constantly out of reach
i give in to sin
because i like to practice what i preach
i'm not trying to say i'll have it all my way
i'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
oh, and i'll make it all worthwhile
i'll make your heart smile

pain, will you return it?
i'll say it again: pain
pain, will you return it?
i'll say it again: pain
pain, will you return it?
i'll say it again: pain
pain, will you return it?
i won't say it again

strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
strangelove, that's how my love goes
strangelove, will you give it to me?
strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
strangelove, that's how my love goes
strangelove, will you give it to me?
strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
strangelove, that's how my love goes
strangelove, will you give it to me?

i give in
again and again
i give in
will you give it to me?
i give in
i'll say it again
i give in
i give in
again and again
i give in
that's how my love goes
i give in
i'll say it again
i give in

when i'm with you baby
i go out of my head
and i just can't get enough
and i just can't get enough
all the things you do to me
and everything you said
i just can't get enough
i just can't get enough

we slip and slide as we fall in love
and i just can't seem to get enough of

we walk together
we're walking down the street
and i just can't get enough
and i just can't get enough
every time i think of you
i know we have to meet
and i just can't get enough
and i just can't get enough

it's getting hotter, it's a burning love
and i just can't seem to get enough of


i just can't get enough

and when it rains
you're shining down for me
and i just can't get enough
and i just can't get enough
just like a rainbow
you know you set me free
and i just can't get enough
and i just can't get enough

you're like an angel and you give me your love
and i just can't seem to get enough of

i'm taking a ride with my best friend
i hope he never lets me down again
he knows where he's taking me
taking me where i want to be

we're flying high
we're watching the world pass us by
never want to come down
never want to put my feet back down on the ground

as long as i remember who's wearing the trousers
i hope he never lets me down again

never want to come down
never want to put my feet back down on the ground

i've felt better
i've been up all night
i can feel it coming
the morning light
the air is so cold here
it's so hard to breathe
we better take cover
will you cover me?

way up here with the northern lights
beyond you and me
i dreamt of us in another life
one we've never reached

you know we're sinking
we could fade away
i'm not going down
not today
the air is so cold here
too cold to see
we have to take cover
cover me

way up here with the northern lights
beyond these broken bars
i pictured us in another life
where we're all super stars

the handshake seals the contract
from the contract, there's no turning back
the turning point of a career
in korea being insincere
the holiday was fun-packed
the contract still intact

the grabbing hands grab all they can
all for themselves, after all
the grabbing hands grab all they can
all for themselves, after all
it's a competitive world
everything counts in large amounts

the graph on the wall
tells the story of it all
picture it now, see just how
the lies and deceit gained a little more power
confidence taken in
by a suntan and a grin

the grabbing hands grab all they can
all for themselves, after all
the grabbing hands grab all they can
all for themselves, after all
it's a competitive world
everything counts in large amounts

precious and fragile things
need special handling
my god, what have we done to you?
we always tried to share
the tenderest of care
now look what we have put you through

things get damaged, things get broken
i thought we'd manage
but words left unspoken left us so brittle
there was so little left to give

angels with silver wings
shouldn't know suffering
i wish i could take the pain for you
if god has a master plan
that only he understands
i hope it's your eyes he's seeing through

things get damaged, things get broken
i thought we'd manage
but words left unspoken left us so brittle
there was so little left to give


i pray you learn to trust
have faith in both of us
and keep room in your hearts for two

things get damaged, things get broken
i thought we'd manage
but words left unspoken left us so brittle
there was so little left to give

people are people, so why should it be
you and i should get along so awfully?
people are people, so why should it be
you and i should get along so awfully?

so we're different colours and we're different creeds
and different people have different needs
it's obvious you hate me, though i've done nothing wrong
i've never even met you, so what could i have done?

i can't understand
what makes a man
hate another man
help me understand

people are people, so why should it be
you and i should get along so awfully?
people are people, so why should it be

(help me understand)
(help me understand, help me understand)

now you're punching and you're kicking and you're shouting at me
i'm relying on your common decency
so far it hasn't surfaced, but i'm sure it exists
it just takes a while to travel from your head to your fists

i can't understand
what makes a man
hate another man
help me understand

girl of sixteen, whole life ahead of her
slashed her wrists, bored with life
didn't succeed, thank the lord
for small mercies

fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again
sixteen candles burn in her mind
she takes the blame, it's always the same
she goes down on her knees and prays

i don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
but i think that god's got a sick sense of humour
and when i die, i expect to find him laughing


i don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
but i think that god's got a sick sense of humour
and when i die, i expect to find him laughing

girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything
found new life in jesus christ
hit by a car, ended up
on a life support machine


summer's day as she passed away
birds were singing in the summer sky
then came the rain and once again
a tear fell from her mother's eye

i don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
but i think that god's got a sick sense of humour
and when i die, i expect to find him laughing
i don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
but i think that god's got a sick sense of humour
and when i die, i expect to find him laughing

my little girl, drive anywhere
do what you want, i don't care
tonight i'm in the hands of fate
i hand myself over on a plate now

oh, little girl, there are times when i feel
i'd rather not be the one behind the wheel
come, pull my strings
watch me move, i do anything, please


sweet little girl, i prefer
you behind the wheel and me the passenger
drive, i'm yours to keep
do what you want, i'm going cheap tonight


you're behind the wheel tonight
you're behind the wheel tonight
you're behind the wheel tonight
you're behind the wheel tonight
you're behind the wheel tonight

we are not there yet
we have not evolved
we have no respect
we have lost control
we're going backwards
ignoring the realities
going backwards
are you counting all the casualties?

we are not there yet
where we need to be
we are still in debt
to our insanities
we're going backwards
turning back our history
going backwards
piling on the misery

we can track it all with satellites
see it all in plain sight
watch men die in real time
but we have nothing inside
we feel nothing inside

we are not there yet
we have lost our soul
the course has been set
we're digging our own hole
we're going backwards
armed with new technology
going backwards
to a caveman mentality

we can emulate on consoles
killings we can control
with senses that have been dulled
because there's nothing inside
we feel nothing inside

we feel nothing inside
(we feel nothing, nothing inside)
we feel nothing inside
(we feel nothing, nothing inside)
we feel nothing inside
(we feel nothing, nothing inside)
we feel nothing inside
(we feel nothing, nothing inside)
we feel nothing inside
(we feel nothing, nothing inside)
because there's nothing inside

let me take you on a trip
around the world and back
and you won't have to move, you just sit still
now let your mind do the walking
and let my body do the talking
let me show you the world in my eyes


i'll take you to the highest mountain
to the depths of the deepest sea
and we won't need a map, believe me
now let my body do the moving
and let my hands do the soothing
let me show you the world in my eyes

that's all there is
nothing more than you can feel now
that's all there is


let me put you on a ship
on a long, long trip
your lips close to my lips
all the islands in the ocean
all the heavens in motion
let me show you the world in my eyes

that's all there is
nothing more than you can touch now
that's all there is


let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes
let me show you the world in my eyes

i'm not going down on my knees, begging you to adore me
can't you see it's misery and torture for me?
when i'm misunderstood
try as hard as you can, i've tried as hard as i could
to make you see
how important it is for me

here is a plea from my heart to you
nobody knows me as well as you do
you know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
that takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

understand me, understand me
understand me, understand me

some people have to be permanently together
lovers devoted to each other forever
now i've got things to do
and i've said before that i know you have too
when i'm not there
in spirit, i'll be there

here is a plea from my heart to you
nobody knows me as well as you do
you know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
that takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

understand me, understand me
understand me, understand me


here is a plea from my heart to you
nobody knows me as well as you do
you know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
that takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

here is a plea from my heart to you
nobody knows me as well as you do
you know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
that takes hold of my tongue in situations like these


here is a plea from my heart to you
nobody knows me as well as you do
you know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
that takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

come with me into the trees
we'll lay on the grass and let the hours pass
take my hand, come back to the land
let's get away just for one day

let me see you stripped down to the bone
let me see you stripped down to the bone


metropolis has nothing on this
you're breathing in fumes, i taste when we kiss
take my hand, come back to the land
where everything's ours for a few hours

let me see you stripped down to the bone
let me see you stripped down to the bone

let me hear you make decisions without your television
let me hear you speaking just for me


let me see you stripped down to the bone
(let me hear you speaking just for me)
let me see you stripped down to the bone
(let me hear you crying just for me)
let me see you stripped down to the bone
(let me hear you speaking just for me)

i'm gonna take my time
i have all the time in the world
to make you mine
it is written in the stars above
the gods decree
you'll be right here by my side
right next to me
you can run but you cannot hide

don't say you want me
don't say you need me
don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
i know you can't be
'cause it's no good

i'll be fine
i'll be waiting patiently
till you see the signs
and come running to my open arms
when will you realise?
do we have to wait till our worlds collide?
open up your eyes
you can't turn back the tide

don't say you want me
don't say you need me
don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
i know you can't be
'cause it's no good


i'm going to take my time
i have all the time in the world
to make you mine
it is written in the stars above

don't say you want me

don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
i know you can't be
'cause it's no good

don't say you need me
don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
i know you can't be
'cause it's no good

i want somebody to share, share the rest of my life
share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details
someone who'll stand by my side and give me support
and in return, she'll get my support
she will listen to me when i want to speak
about the world we live in and life in general
though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
she'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
to my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
but at the end of it all, she will understand me

i want somebody who cares for me passionately
with every thought and with every breath
someone who'll help me see things in a different light
all the things i detest i will almost like
i don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
i'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
but when i'm asleep i want somebody
who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
though things like this make me sick
in a case like this, i'll get away with it
