she’s been out for a week or a little more
again and again and again counting all these hours at night
a single cloud was passing by
hiding the moon behind the white
she always said
years been fast in a row, but i didn’t count
from time to time it felt like we have chosen different roads
oh the future is gonna be a new estate for you and me
at least, at least in your eyes
(oh, i sway)

down to the upper side, i can see ghosts how
long until the morning glows
read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies

oh

she’s been out for a second change
in a land where milk and honey flows
through our veins
what does an old picture tell?
i thought i’ve always stayed the same
at least in your eyes
down to the upper side, i can see ghosts how
long until the morning glows
read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies
down to the upper side, i can see ghosts how
long until the morning glows
read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies

huh

love can't hold us
same way as it can’t leave us alone
it’s easy, one more step and my head is gone
serena, all i need and all i want you to
believe me all i need and all i want you to
(oh, i sway)

down to the upper side, i can see ghosts how
long until the morning glows
read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies
down to the upper side, i can see ghosts how
long until the morning glows
read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies

oh, oh
can’t read it in your eyes
in the dead of the night
i can't read it in your eyes
i believe in my own lies 

the same hoping
we're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
my body is bitter cold
my mind is overthrown
since the world is full of roles that we play
and as long as we do there's no time to regret
all the ways how you and i had come together

bright lies shine on
illusions past ages ago
from a distance
see my self existing
pretend to feel your undertow
you see bright lies, they shine on
illusions past ages ago
from a distance
see my self existing
pretend to feel your undertow

ophelia, i leave my broken bones in the desert
ophelia, i leave my broken bones in the desert
the same hoping

my mind is overthrown

you wouldn't tell if you go there

still the world is full of roles we play
oh, maybe love is enough
still the world is full of roles we play
oh, maybe love is enough 

fakes names uncovered before the dawn
it is you, the skies are open
we grow (grow up) and be the grown-ups
we deny, we deny to bring it on

'cause we don't say no
wherever we go (go)
whenever we doubt
we're steady apart
'cause we don't say no
whenever we start
whenever we fall
we're steady apart

wild stare at the dust bowls
time is a gift, praying for the fog to lift
full joy for my trussed soul
i get high, say bye-bye

lately (lately) i fell through the mirror
we deny, we deny to push it on
at times (at times) i swim till i shiver
we deny, we deny to push it on
'cause we don't say no

i talked a lot, oh i thought a lot
about what we came here for

better not set your lungs on fire
on the dance floor, we move and we talk
until we can’t no more
(wanna freeze the time)
why do i sigh? what do i deny?
i’ll build a wall a thousand feet high
around my bed to keep the bloom
out of my head, asking myself
:
where do we go after all?
what do you hope for most of all?

when i’m shivering in the morning dust again
then i sliver stale bread and give it to the doves
they are fluttering around me at the old marketplace
and then i worship somehow when we’re thinking out loud

what's the chapel of mine?
i begged you as we walked the brown meadows
all the colours were much more intense 'cause it had rained before

and the chapels i know are warm and inside
are multi-entwined aisles i need to define
so that i could see its tortuous structures
i thought that you
could lead me through

i thought that you
could lead me through 

just like the cliffs at seaside
i lay head against the search of todays work
the warm colours you've spread
through my house and my rooms
were deceased too
you'd ask me not to drown deep
i'm feeling just too close to you
and fear
and we're thinking of life's stories
the fever keeps around
and me and you
this is for days to come
with no one else to blame
sorry for this mess to rearrange
this is for days to come
you hold it in your hands
desolation leads me again and again
i'm gonna need some rest now
to put some sense into this mess
all around me

a believer in hollowness and fever
i can see her
i can feel her
always find a place to hide
i could heal her
oh  fever
always find a place to hide 

here's to our feelings, and our yearning
why do we breathe in, i'll never learn it
here's to the dolphins, but they're bleeding
you want a meaning, but i will keep it
for the lovers in the nighttime
they move, they move like fireflies
i wanna move too, i wanna move you

here's to the living, it is always worth it
from a distance, alarm's alerting
i'm on a sonde around my solar system
it feels so true, yet i can't tell you what it is that is missing
all the stars in the blackened sky
they move, they move like fireflies
i wanna move too, i wanna move you
oh, i wanna move with you

you make my soul heat up
say do you miss me?
you make my soul heat up
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
i want a truth, otherwise i'm gonna panic
you got the key to shape the law of statics
i'm often scared when in the rookery
that before i slip, i would be eaten by a beast
while the lovers in the nighttime
they move, they move like fireflies
i wanna move too, i wanna move you
oh, i wanna move with you

uh, down by the poolside in at the deep end
you know this love is our shrine
down by the poolside in at the deep end
i think about you

you make my soul heat up
say do you miss me?
you make my soul heat up
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

down by the poolside in at the deep end
you know this love is our shrine
down by the poolside in at the deep end
i think about you
down by the poolside in at the deep end
you know this love is our shrine
down by the poolside in at the deep end
i think about you, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da 

they put me in a cage to see what happens when
you put one in a cell without an escape plan
if i lose my mind before the first attempt
oh, i'll never be free again
the walls are made of glass and they're hard as stone
come on, take some pictures with your high-end phones
give me all your love and share it with your friends
oh, i'll never be free again

oh, i have all these dark dreams
they come down like concrete
for your entertainment
i'll name it to tame it

so turn the lights off
i barely understand
what i know is all quicksand
as the rain blows through the curtains
i'm turnin' to set my eyes on you
woke up next to you
i'll name it to tame it

i hear a million voices laughing indiscreet
it's how they enjoy the blood spilled on the screen
hey man, i've washed my face, i've kept my costume clean
oh, i'm not a part of the scene
but all i thought i knew has been turned upside down
i don't have a clue what it means to drown
and what i mean to you i never figure out
all the noise in here got way too loud
(oh) i have all these dark dreams
they come down like concrete
for your entertainment (uh)
i'll name it to tame it

so turn the lights off
i barely understand
what i know is all quicksand
as the rain blows through the curtains
i'm turnin' to set my eyes on you
woke up next to you
to set my eyes on you
woke up next to you

we close a deal
in the ink-blue dawn
all is revealed now
we can't be harmed
soon i am leavin'
soon i'll be gone
i don't need reasons
to be alone

speak to me
unknown and open
maybe some day
i'll fade into the answers then
i'm gonna feel it in the sun and i'm gonna see it
when my spirits are on the run
now with pills of 100 milligram

once in a lifetime i'll flip the coin
'cause the way that we'll go
is a way that we already know
are you waiting, are you waiting, are you waiting?

you're gonna leave when the mornin' comes
and i'm gonna see it when my spirits are on the run
now with pills of 100 milligram
picturesque waves slowly erase
my mind is the low tide
in your dreams i pulled you out to sea
it's nothing to deny

once in a lifetime i'll flip the coin
'cause the way that we go is a way that we already know
are you waiting, are you waiting, are you waiting?
and nothing stays
once in a lifetime i'll flip the coin
'cause the way that we go is a way that we already know
are you waiting, are you waiting, are you waiting?
and nothing stays
by the seaside
there was you
there was me
and i understood you're my island in a dark sea

once in a lifetime i'll flip the coin
'cause the way that we go is a way that we already know
are you waiting, are you waiting, are you waiting?
nothing stays
once in a lifetime
i'll flip the coin
'cause wherever we go
there's a place that we already know
are you waiting, are you waiting, are you waiting?

i'll fade into the answers some day
fade into the answers some day
i'll fade into the answers some day
speak to me unknown and open
i'll fade into the answers some day
fade into the, the answers some day
i'll fade into the answers some day
are you waiting, waiting for me? 

i'll
never let you go
now we flow in a way
that i'd say is just terrible
i
won't lift my head today
what a time to be fine
and to try to feel miserable

misinterpretations
in every breath i take
another day on earth to try
to make a sense of other lives
don't know why we're heading west
i'm gonna fall and i'll shake it loose
in the end when i
look back i think i'll say
it was worth a try

how long
how long
can i fake it?
how long
how long
until they hate me?
more of what i can not grasp
more of what i can not grasp
i'll
never let it show
where we go? i don't know
but i think we've been here before
i
won't lift my head today
what a time to be fine
and to try to feel miserable

misinterpretations
in every breath i take-

how long
how long
can i fake it?
how long
how long
until they hate me?
more of what i can not grasp

tell why should i believe
in what my eyes can't see
no one's handed me the key
yet i'm breakin' free
takin' a step back in time
throwin' up thoughts i thought were mine
again i'm above water
but i can not breath
let the ritual begin
'cause it's time to bleed
takin' a step back in time
throwin' up thoughts i thought were mine
how long
how long
can i fake it?
how long
how long
until they hate me?
more of what i can not grasp

how long
how long
can i fake it?
more of what i can not grasp
more of what i can not grasp
how long
can i fake it?
how long
until they hate me?
more of what i can not grasp 

you might guess i'm thinking
but i'm only blinking
can't be your corner stone
i'm more like crumbling stone
you're in the hospital
ana wants you to leave soon
so why should i stay here?
so why should i stay here?

king thinking blinking
king thinking sinking
i'm coming home
king thinking blinking
i'm coming home
king thinking sinking
blinking

this life's like an escape room
five ghosts are in the same room
give the monster somethin' to eat
now we are common like a trap beat

try solving riddles in china
gettin' free like the hill myna
don't wanna be cruel but i warn ya
all this inspires my mania
and you are still on my mind
i'm sure you'll get through this time
i'm sure you'll be alright
how can i stay close?
and you are still on my mind
i'm sure you'll get through this time
i'm sure you'll be alright

your straight ahead path ascends and grows
it's a truth that your dad spoke
sense in the winds, fume in the mist
children unter the cherry tree
if it all goes to plan
they got oodles of time
and the glimmering dawn looked incredible
there are sticks and stones in our seeking hands

autumn leaves, our damaged gold
småland, your words are engraved in the stones
it's the constant in our life
even when the times are bursting the lines
once again at the eastern shore
you shouldn’t come around furthermore
autumn leaves, our damaged gold
and everything flows and nothing stands still

the lights in constant motion
approaching the north-western ocean
seven winds of the seven seas
from shore to shore
from west to east
she wears her new dress
and she got me loosing my sins
now gambling seven days a week
from shore to shore
from west to east

clear water, it alters
hits me even stronger, but i don’t bother
it's about how to evolve it further
black river murderer
sticking to words, but the words they don’t know me
and fixing the graves, but the graves they won't make it
and the glimmering dawn looked incredible
there are sticks and stones in our seeking hands

autumn leaves, our damaged gold

gonna have a ride on a dolphin's back
ocean's foam in my face or it's dust or sand
the winter is gonna count no more
unless we keep on thinking like before
get out let freedom ring
and let us do our most emotional thing

oh, when dolphins come, when dolphins come
to take your hope, take your hope
when dolphins come, when dolphins come
to take your hope, take your hope

down the river, boy
it takes a long ride, but i take it slow
down with me, down the river, boy
it takes a long ride, but i take it slow
down with me

we finally arrived at a privileged point
yet i don't know where to belong

oh, when dolphins come, when dolphins come
to take your hope, take your hope

though your heart falls into nineteen holes
and it took some years at all
lights are going out somewhere

woah
a little breath can bring thunder
they say it ain't true
i'm moving close to the edge, ah
i wanna see a place of wonder
and if i can't find it up here
i'll just seek somewhere else (whoo)

i went right down
where am i now?

night of a storm
knife is sharp, you're calm
don't you know where to hide us?
i cannot deal with my indistinct fears
don't you know where to hide us?

nothing's for certain
rain's blowin' in the curtain
it feels like i have finally lost control
and i see the lightning
our distance is rising
it feels like i have finally lost control
i went right down
where am i now? 

let's smile emotionlessly
i put myself to the test
i’ll beat the truth out of me
very soon you'll see
got many letters yet
flames in every word i read
i'm gonna cast another me

i could be alone with me
i could drive to the sea
i’m already wondering
what else there's gonna be
everything is about me
it's very clear to see
i'm the king of convenience
i'm still gonna be (outta' hand)
(ahh ahh ahh)
(ahh ahh ahh) very soon you'll see
(ahh ahh ahh) another me
(ahh ahh ahh) i'll beat the truth out of me

why the hell we’re here together?
i don’t know (sing it)
(ahh ahh ahh)
why the hell are we here together?
i don't know
you don’t know
still tryin' to figure out
what my water does in a drought
i'll beat the truth out of me
very soon you'll see
it’s finally happening
everything i've ever dreamed of
the moon circles around the sun

i could be alone with me
i could drive to the sea
i'm already wondering
what else there's gonna be
everything is about me
it's very clear to see
i'm the king of convenience
i'm still gonna be (outta' hand)

when you were hidin' in the nest
what did i do to make you feel some hope
when it was time to leave the heights
we tried to stay close but then we lost it all

we fade
we fade
the birth of worlds
the birth of worlds

say you're tumblin' down
i want you to know you are not on your own
one day we'll put our stones on the shore
we both used to think we won't end up completely unknown

we fade
we fade
the birth of worlds
the birth of worlds

the apple of my eye turns red
explosions in the sky, signs you've send
we are alone, we are alone
and always will be
i don't believe in life after death
there isn't such a thing as regret
i'll get along, i'll get along
hope you can see
the apple of my eye turns red
explosions in the sky, signs you've send
we are alone, we are alone
and always will be
i don't believe in life after death
there isn't such a thing as regret
i'll get along, i'll get along
hope you can see
the apple of my eye turns red

i'll get along, i'll get along
hope you can see
ooh (ooh)
ooh (ooh)
ooh
ooh (ooh) 

the first signs were the ashes laying down
on the rooftop of our house
and on the inside we didn't make a sound
the fear we used to drown

all we are is true
i can read it in your eyes as we're catching fire
now we're out of time
we could try out all the things we've never tried

love, tell me what you'd like
to do with me tonight
before the meteor arrives
oh and would you take my hand
before everything will come to an end?
(will come to an end)

on a tuesday we first spoke about
certainly we won't get out
it was a wednesday afternoon that i found out
'bout your stairway to the clouds
all we are is true
i can read it in your eyes as we're catching fire
now we're out of time
we could try out all the things we've never tried

love, tell me what you'd like
to do with me tonight
before the meteor arrives
oh and would you take my hand
before everything will come to an end?

we see it getting closer
through your telescope
a blue shadow's approaching
as we're observing the night
oh, take my hand before everything will come to an end
oh, take my hand before everything will come to an end
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
take, take, take my hand
love, tell me what you'd like
to do with me tonight
before the meteor arrives
oh and would you take my hand
before everything will come to an end?
before everything will come to an end 

we're up all night, chase new heights
there's not a single face we have to hide
what we are feels so easy
i'm fallin' into you
it ain't nothing new
the mirror of our youth

do you sleep or do you pray?
i got lost in yesterday
oh, i wanna fall into your arms
where i could hide till kingdom comes

in five years, keep it real
the chance that we both
will be lying here is small as the mosquito
tasting the sweat on our skin
the sounds of violins
announcing the spring

we're up all night, chase new heights
there's not a single face we have to hide
what we are feels so easy
i'm fallin' into you
but it ain't nothing new
the mirror of our youth
do you sleep or do you pray?
i got lost in yesterday
oh, i wanna fall into your arms
where i could hide till kingdom comes

those worlds i've been went down
they've finally turned to dust
i'll remember, mark my words
that i painted in the dust
oh, i wanna fall

do you sleep or do you pray?
i got lost in yesterday
oh, i wanna fall into your arms
where i could hide till kingdom comes
you want me to feel okay
i feel bad because i ain't
oh, i wanna fall into your arms
where i could hide till kingdom come

we try it, we try it, we try it
we try it, we try it, we try it
we try it, we try it, we try it
we try it, we try it, we try it
we try it, we try it, we try it
i followed you down the path
to the sinkholes of our past
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
yeah, we will try to fill them up
maybe it will be enough
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
i followed you down the path
to the sinkholes of our past
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
yeah, we will try to fill them up
and maybe it will be enough
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
i followed you down the path
to the sinkholes of our past
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
yeah, we will try to fill them up
and maybe it will be enough
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
i followed you down the path
to the sinkholes of our past
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it
yeah, we will try to fill them up
and maybe it will be enough
we try it, we try it, we try it, we try it 

turned to stone
swimming deep beneath the foam
insensibly i'll roam
first a glint, soon a shining light
far from beyond

i'll paint it big next i'll shoot and squash it
i don't know what the hell is going on
but i'm not alone
i take a deep breath i'm moving forward
they watch my spirit bow down
and came for the showdown

head by head but far away
they can't freeze the time
they cannot steal our fire
call me up i'll calm you down
you pull me in, i'll pull you out
'cause we don't have to
do it on our own

the sadness drink
you took too much of it
as we grew older
shoulder to shoulder
and when you fall give me a call because
some like digging holes
we'll just fly above
head by head but far away
they can't freeze the time
they cannot steal our fire
call me up i'll calm you down
you pull me in, i'll pull you out
'cause we don't have to
do it on our own

i paint it big next i'll shoot and squash it
i don't know what the hell is going on
but i'm not alone
you know my thoughts right
before the curtain drops
here comes the showdown
i'll never let you down

head by head but far away
they can't freeze the time
they cannot steal our fire
call me up i'll calm you down
you pull me in, i'll pull you out
'cause we don't have to
do it on our own
in my mind's eye, like you've said
they can't freeze the time
they cannot feel our fire
call me up i'll calm you down
you pull me in, i'll pull you out
'cause we don't have to
do it all again
my mind used to hide
but those times are over
but those times are over
my mind used to hide
but those times are over
and those times are over
my mind used to hide
but those times are over
but those times are over, oooh
my mind used to hide
but those times are over
but those times are over, mmmhh
my mind used to hide
but those times are over
but those times are over, mmhhhh 

i'm gonna tame the violence
put him to sleep someday
lock him up in a chest
he shall not slip away
can you hear the silence?
the'll keep an eye on him
'cause if he got out
we would go down again

no one in the world
no one knows what to do

no time for the big fights
silly words only make it worse
go out today, yeah, i would say
"no"

i'm gonna tame the violence
put him to sleep someday
but before i do
i will be with you
i wanna break the silence
but it's so beautiful
guess i'll keep things
like they've been before
no one in the world
no one knows what to do

no time for the big fights
silly words only make it worse
but today, yeah, i would say
"no"
five shots and nothing at all
silly words only make it worse
today is the the day that i would say
"no"

no one in the world
no one knows what to do
no one in the world
no one in the world, do you?
no one in the world
no one knows what to do
no one in the world
no one in the world, do you?

no time for the big fights
silly words only make it worse
today is the the day that i would say
"no"
five shots and nothing at all
silly words only make it worse
today is the the day that i would say
"no"
no one in the world
no one knows what to do
no one in the world
no one in the world, do you?
no one in the world
no one knows what to do
no one in the world
no one in the world, do you?
