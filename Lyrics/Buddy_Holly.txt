every day, it's a-getting faster
everyone said, "go ahead and ask her"
love like yours will surely come my way
a-hey, a-hey-hey

every day seems a little longer
every way, love's a little stronger
come what may
do you ever long for true love from me

every day, it's a-getting closer
going faster than a rollercoaster
love like yours will surely come my way
a-hey, a-hey-hey

every day seems a little longer

going faster than a rollercoaster
love like yours will surely come my way
a-hey, a-hey-hey

love like yours will surely come my way 

well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
you say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
because that'll be the day when i die

well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
all your hugs and kisses and your money too
well, you know you love me baby
until you tell me, maybe
that someday, well i'll be through

well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry

yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
you say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
because that'll be the day when i die

well, when cupid shot his dart
he shot it at your heart
so if we ever part and i leave you
you sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
that someday, well i'll be blue
well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
you say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
because that'll be the day when i die

well, that'll be the day, hoo-hoo
that'll be the day, hoo-hoo
that'll be the day, hoo-hoo

they mustn't show
but soon these tears
are bound to flow
cause it's raining
raining in my heart

a lot of people (mm-hmm), take it for a game
once you get it (mm-hmm), you're in an awful fix (mm-hmm)
after you've had it (mm-hmm) you'll never want to quit

your sweet loving (mm-hmm) is better than a kiss (yay-ee-yay)
when you leave me (mm-hmm) sweet kisses i miss
