so many doors, so many closed to us
oh, baby, my heart's open
you know that i stay open
lost in the night, standing outside the club
oh, baby, my heart's open
you know that i stay open for you

baby, i can read the stars
and i see how they shine for you
don't cave yourself up in the darkness
so many better things to do
wish you could see your true colours
don't be afraid to play your cards
the sky is open, you should follow
we all work the way we are

it's the same with me and you and everybody
all hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
so many doors, so many closed to us
