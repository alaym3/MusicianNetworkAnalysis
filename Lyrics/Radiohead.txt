when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special
but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here
oh, oh

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run
run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special
but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here 

karma police, arrest this man
he talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
he's like a detuned radio

karma police, arrest this girl
her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
and we have crashed her party

this is what you'll get
this is what you'll get
this is what you'll get
when you mess with us

karma police, i've given all i can
it's not enough, i've given all i can
but we're still on the payroll

this is what you'll get
this is what you'll get
this is what you'll get
when you mess with us
for a minute there
i lost myself, i lost myself
phew, for a minute there
i lost myself, i lost myself
for a minute there
i lost myself, i lost myself
phew, for a minute there
i lost myself, i lost myself 

a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache with

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden
no alarms and no surprises
(get me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises
(get me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises, please
(get me out of here) 

please, could you stop the noise?
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices
in my head

what's that?
(i may be paranoid, but not an android)
what's that?
(i may be paranoid, but not an android)

when i am king
you will be first against the wall
with your opinion
which is of no consequence at all

what's that?
(i may be paranoid, but no android)
what's that?
(i may be paranoid, but no android)

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing, gucci little piggy
you don't remember, you don't remember
why don't you remember my name?
off with his head, man, off with his head, man
why don't you remember my name?
i guess he does
rain down, rain down
come on, rain down on me
from a great height
from a great height, height
rain down, rain down
come on, rain down on me
from a great height
from a great height, height
that's it, sir, you're leaving (rain down)
the crackle of pigskin (rain down)
the dust and the screaming (come on, rain down)
the yuppies networking (on me)
the panic, the vomit (from a great height)
the panic, the vomit (from a great height)
god loves his children
god loves his children, yeah 

wake from your sleep
the drying of your tears
today we escape, we escape

pack and get dressed
before your father hears us
before all hell breaks loose

breathe, keep breathing
don't lose your nerve
breathe, keep breathing
i can't do this alone

sing us a song
a song to keep us warm
there's such a chill
such a chill

and you can laugh a spineless laugh
we hope your rules and wisdom choke you
now we are one in everlasting peace
we hope that you choke, that you choke
we hope that you choke
that you choke
we hope that you choke
that you choke 

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in a fake plastic earth
that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns
he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears
she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love
but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time 

dreamers
they never learn
they never learn
beyond the point
of no return
of no return
then it's too late
the damage is done
the damage is done

this goes
beyond me
beyond you
a white room
by a window
where the sun comes
through
we are
just happy to serve
just happy to serve
you

i'll drown my beliefs
to have your babies
i'll dress like your niece
and wash your swollen feet

just don't leave
don't leave

i'm not living
i'm just killing time
your tiny hands
your crazy kitten smile

just don't leave
don't leave

and true love waits
in haunted attics
and true love lives
on lollipops and crisps
just don't leave
don't leave 

i'm the next act
waiting in the wings
i'm an animal
trapped in your hot car
i am all the days
that you choose to ignore

you are all i need
you're all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the reeds

i'm a moth
who just wants to share your light
i'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night
i only stick with you
because there are no others

you are all i need
you're all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the reeds
it's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
it's all right,  it's all right,  it's all right
it's all wrong,  it's all right
it's all right,  it's all right 

that there, that's not me
i go where i please
i walk through walls
i float down the liffey

i'm not here
this isn't happening
i'm not here
i'm not here

in a little while
i'll be gone
the moment's already passed
yeah, it's gone

and i'm not here
this isn't happening
i'm not here
i'm not here

strobe lights and blown speakers
fireworks and hurricanes
i'm not here
this isn't happening
i'm not here
i'm not here 

in the deepest ocean
the bottom of the sea
your eyes
they turn me
why should i stay here?
why should i stay?

i'd be crazy not to follow
follow where you lead
your eyes
they turn me
turn me on to phantoms (way out)
i follow to the edge (way out)
of the earth (way out)
and fall off
yeah, everybody leaves (way out)
if they get the chance (way out)
and this (way out)
is my chance

i get eaten by the worms
and weird fishes
picked over by the worms
and weird fishes
weird fishes
weird fishes

yeah, i...
i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape
and i...
i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape 

two jumps in a week, i bet you
think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop
you'd kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never, ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love
they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the ones who'll spit at you
you will be the one screaming out
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry


oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
the best thing that you've ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you've ever had
the best thing you've had has gone away

so don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry 

transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people clinging on to bottles
and when it comes it's so, so disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental
it always ends up drivel

one day i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around
let down again
let down again
let down again

you know, you know where you are with
you know where you are with
floor collapsing
floating, bouncing back

and one day
i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
(you know where you are)
hysterical and useless
(you know where you are)
hysterical and
(you know where you are)

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around 

stay in the shadows
cheer at the gallows
this is a round-up
this is a low-flying panic attack
sing the song on the jukebox that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live

red crosses on wooden doors
if you float, you burn
loose talk around tables
abandon all reason
avoid all eye contact
do not react
shoot the messengers
this is a low-flying panic attack
sing the song of sixpence that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live
we know where you live 

don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen

you paint yourself white
and fill up with noise
but there'll be something missing

now that you've found it, it's gone
now that you feel it, you don't
you've gone off the rails

so don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
you'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking 

(kid a, kid a)
(kid a, kid a)

everything

yesterday i woke up sucking a lemon
yesterday i woke up sucking a lemon

there are two colours in my head
there are two colours in my head
what, what is that you tried to say?

tried to say, tried to say
tried to say, tried to say

then into your life, there comes a darkness
there's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
and all we trapped rag doll cloth people
we are helpless to resist
into our darkest hour

but it was just a laugh, just a laugh
just a laugh, just a laugh
even at this angle
and so we crumble
a ten ton head, made of wet sand
oh, this dread circumference
you've gotta be kidding me
the grass grows over me
your face in the glass, in the glass
it was just a laugh, just a laugh
it's whatever you say it is
in split infinity

then into your life, there comes a darkness
and a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
into your darkest hour
when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet darling
when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet darling
sweet times
sweet darling
sweet times 

reckoner
can't take it with you
dancing for your pleasure

you are not to blame for
bittersweet distractors
dare not speak its name

dedicated to all hu–
all human beings

because we separate
like ripples on a blank shore
because we separate (in rainbows)
like ripples on a blank shore (in rainbows)

reckoner
take me with you

dedicated to all hu–
all human beings 

this dance, this dance
is like a weapon, is like a weapon
of self-defence, of self-defence
against the present, against the present
the present tense
no, i won't get heavy, don't get heavy
keep it light and keep it moving
i am doing no harm
as my world comes crashing down
i'll be dancing, freaking out
deaf, dumb, and blind

in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost

i won't turn around or the penny drops
won't stop now, won't slack off
or all this love will be in vain
to stop from falling down a mine
it's no one's business but mine
where all this love has been in vain

in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost
