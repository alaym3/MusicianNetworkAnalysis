on bended knee is no way to be free
lifting up an empty cup i ask silently
that all my destinations will accept the one that's me
so i can breathe

circles they grow and they swallow people whole
half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul
and so it goes

don't come closer or i'll have to go
holding me like gravity are places that pull
if ever there was someone to keep me at home
it would be you

everyone i come across in cages they bought
they think of me and my wandering but i'm never what they thought
got my indignation but i'm pure in all my thoughts
i'm alive

wind in my hair, i feel part of everywhere
underneath my being is a road that disappeared
late at night i hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
overhead
leave it to me as i find a way to be
consider me a satellite forever orbiting
i knew all the rules but the rules do not know me
guaranteed
 

it's a mystery to me
we have a greed, with which we have agreed
you think you have to want more than you need
until you have it all, you won't be free

society, you're a crazy breed
i hope you're not lonely without me

when you want more than you have, you think you need
and when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
i think i need to find a bigger place
'cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

society, you're a crazy breed
i hope you're not lonely without me
society, crazy indeed
i hope you're not lonely without me

there's those thinking more or less less is more
but if less is more how you keeping score?
means for every point you make your level drops
kinda like you're starting from the top
and you can't do that
society, you're a crazy breed
i hope you're not lonely without me
society, crazy, indeed
i hope you're not lonely without me
society, have mercy on me
i hope you're not angry if i disagree
society, crazy, indeed
i hope you're not lonely, without me 

i know (i know) you belong
to somebody new
but tonight
you belong to me
although (although) we're apart
you're a part of my heart
but tonight
you belong to me
way down by the stream
how sweet it will seem
once more just to dream in
the moonlight
my honey i know with the dawn
that you will be gone
but tonight
you belong to me
but tonight
you belong to me 

can't climb to heaven on the cross
one liar's promise drained the blood from my heart
came a message in the dark
offered the hand of a disembodied man
while i still had the chance

now it's gone, gone
and i am who i am
who i was i will never be again
running out of sand

i stare at my reflection to the bone
blurred eyes look back at me
full of blame and sympathy
so, so close
right roads not taken, the future's forsaken
dropped like a fossil or stone

now it's gone, gone
and i am who i am
who i was i will never come again
running out of sand
a drunk octopus wants to fight
fearful of dreams, there'll be no sleep tonight
fine at dinner, dead by dessert
victim or witness, we're gonna get hurt
a fragile existence with echoes of wrath
i can't stop the bleeding nor the tears from thine eye
there's another us around somewhere with much better lives
with god as our witness but he wonâ€™t testify

oh now it's gone, gone
and i am who i am
who i was i'll never have the chance
running out of sand
running out of sand
running out of sand 

when i walk beside her
i am the better man
when i look to leave her
i always stagger back again
once i built an ivory tower
so i could worship from above
when i climb down to be set free
she took me in again

there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world

when she comes to greet me
she is mercy at my feet
and i, i see her inner charm
she just throws it back at me
once i dug an early grave
to find a better land
she just smiled and laughed at me
and took her rules back again
there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
oh, there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world

when i go to cross that river
she is comfort by my side
when i try to understand
she just opens up her hands

ah, ah
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
ahhhhhh

there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
once i stood to lose her
when i saw what i had done
bowed down and threw away the hours
of her garden and her sun
so i tried to warn her
i turned to see her weep
forty days and forty nights
and it's still coming down on me

there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
oh, there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
oh, there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
oh, there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
oh, there's a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world
(theres a big)
(a big hard sun)
(beating on the big people)
(in a big hard world)
(theres a big)
(a big hard sun)
(beating on the big people)
(in a big hard world) 

such is the way of the world
you can never know
just where to put all your faith
and how will it grow?

gonna rise up
burning black holes in dark memories
gonna rise up
turning mistakes into gold

such is the passage of time
too fast to fold
suddenly swallowed by signs
lo and behold

gonna rise up
find my direction magnetically
gonna rise up
throw down my ace in the hole 

you are the hole in my head
i am the pain in your neck
you are the lump in my throat
i am the aching in your heart
we are tangled
we are stolen
we are living where things are hidden
you are something in my eye
and i am
the shiver down your spine
you are
on the lick of my lips
and i am
on the tip of your tongue
we are tangled
we are stolen
we are buried up to our necks in sand
we are luck
we are fate
we are the feeling you get in the golden state
we are love
we are hate
we are the feeling i get when you walk away?
walk away
well you are the dream in my nightmare
i am that falling sensation
you are
not needles and pills
i am
your hangover morning
we are tangled
we are stolen
we are living where things are hidden
we are luck
we are fate
we are the feeling you get in the golden state
we are love
we are hate
we are the feeling i get when you walk away
walk away
walk away
you are
the hole in my head
you are
the pain in your neck
you are
the lump in my throat
i am
the aching in your heart 

have no fear
for when i'm alone
i'll be better off
than i was before
i've got this life
i'll be around to grow
who i was before
i cannot recall

long nights allow
me to feel i'm falling
i am falling
the lights go out
let me feel i'm falling
i am falling safely to
the ground
ah

i'll take this soul
that's inside me now
like a brand new friend
i'll forever know
i've got this life
and the will to show
i will always be
better than before
long nights allow
me to feel i'm falling
i am falling
the lights go out
let me feel i'm falling
i am falling safely to
the ground
ah 

i'll grow when you grow
let me loosen up the blindfold
i'll fly when you cry
lift us out of this landslide
wherever you go
whenever we part
i'll keep on healing all the scars
that we've collected from the start
i'd rather this than live without you
for every wish upon a star
that goes unanswered in the dark
there is a dream i've dreamt about you
and from afar, i lie awake
close my eyes to find i wouldn't be the same
i'll shine when you shine
painted pictures on my mind
sun sets on this ocean
never once on my devotion
however you are
or far that you fall
i'll keep on healing all the scars
that we've collected from the start
i'd rather this than live without you
for every wish upon a star
that goes unanswered in the dark
there is a dream i've dreamt about you
and from afar, i lie awake
close my eyes to find i'd never be the same
without you
without you 

don't let anyone say that it's just a game
for i've seen other teams, and it's never the same
when you're born in chicago, you're blessed and you're healed
the first time you walk into wrigley field
our heroes with pinstripes and heroes in blue
give us the chance to feel like heroes too
whether we'll win and if we should lose
we know someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
we are one with the cubs
with the cubs we're in love
hold our heads high as the underdogs
we are not fairweather, but foul weather fans
like brothers in arms, in the streets and the stands
there's magic in the ivy and the old scoreboard
the same one i stared at as a kid keeping score
in a world full of greed, i could never want more
and someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
well, someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
and here's to the men and the legends we've known
teaching us faith and giving us hope
united we stand, and united we'll fall
down to our knees the day we win it all
yeah ernie banks said, "oh, let's play two!"
i think he meant two hundred years
in the same ballpark, our diamond, our jewel
the home of our joy and our fears
keeping traditions, and wishes made new
the place where our grandfathers' fathers they grew
the spiritual feeling if i ever knew
and if you ain't been, i am sorry for you
and when the day comes for that last winning run
and i'm crying and covered in beer
i look to the sky and know i was right today
someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way
yeah, someday we'll go all the way 

comes the morning when i can feel
that there's nothing left to be concealed
moving on, a scene surreal
know my heart will never, never be far from here

sure as i'm breathing, sure as i'm sad
i'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
i leave here believing more than i had
and there's a reason i'll be, reason i'll be back

as i walk the hemisphere
i got my wish to up and disappear
i've been wounded, i've been healed
now for landing i've been, landing i've been cleared

sure as i'm breathing, sure as i'm sad
i'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
i leave here believing more than i had
this love has got no ceiling 

be it no concern, point of no return
go forward in reverse
this i will recall
everytime i fall

setting forth in the universe
setting forth in the universe

out here realigned
a planet out of sight
nature drunk and high
 

take leave, the conscious mind
found myself to be so inclined
why sleep in discontent?
oh, the price of companionship

my shadow runs with me
underneath the big wide sun
my shadow comes with me as we leave it all
we leave it all far behind

ah, empty pockets will
allow a greater sense of wealth
why contain yourself
like any other book on a shelf?

my shadow lays with me
underneath the big wide sun
my shadow stays with me as we leave it all
we leave it all far behind

subtle voices in the wind
hear the truth they're telling
a world begins where the road ends
watch me leave it all behind
far behind
far behind 

i should have known there was someone else
down below i always kept it to myself
now i believe in nothing, not today
as i move myself out of your sight
i'll be sleeping by myself tonight
i could never go to no one else
the hurt don't show but who knows time will tell
i believe in nothing but the pain
and i can't see this turning out right
i'll be sleeping by myself tonight
forever be sad and lonely
forever never be the same
i close my eyes
wait for a sign
am i just waiting in vain?
oh, i believe in love and disaster
sometimes the two are just the same
i'm beginning to see what's left of me
is gonna have to be free to survive
i'll be sleeping by myself
i'll be sleeping by myself
i'll be sleeping by myself tonight 

won't be the last
won't be the first
find a way to where the sky meets the earth

it's alright and all wrong
for me it begins at the end of the road
we come and go
 

 

i speak for a man who gave for this land
took a bullet in the back for his pay
spilled his blood in the dirt and the dust
and he's come back to say
that what he has seen is hard to believe
and it does no good to just pray
oh he asks of us to stand and we must
end this war today

with his mind, he's saying, no more!
with his heart, he's saying, no more!
with his life, he's saying, no more war!
with his eyes, he's saying, no more!
with his body, he's saying, no more!
with his voice, he's saying, no more war!
no more war!

yeah, nothing's too good for a veteran
yeah, this is what they say
so nothing is what they will get
in this new american way
the lies that were told to get us to go
were criminal let us be straight
let's get to the point where our voices are heard
behind the white house gates

with our minds, we're saying, no more!
with our hearts, we're saying, no more!
with our lives, we're saying, no more war!
with our eyes, we're saying, no more!
with our bodies, we're saying, no more!
with our voices, we're saying, no more war!
no more war!

no more innocents dying
no more terrorizing
no more eulogizing
no more
no more evangelizing
no more
no more presidents lying
no more war

with our minds, we're saying, no more!
with our hearts, we're saying, no more!
with our lives, we're saying, no more war!
no more war!
no more war!
no more war!
no more war!
no more war!
no more war! 

i wanna shake, i wanna wind down
i wanna leave this mind and shout
i've lived all these lives
like an ocean in disguise
i won't live forever
oh, you can't keep me here
i wanna race with the sundown
i want a last breath that i don't let out
forgive every being
the bad feelings, it's just me
i won't wait for answers
oh, you can't keep me here
oh
oh
i wanna rise and say goodnight
i wanna take a look on the other side
i've lived all these lives
it's been wonderful tonight
i won't live forever
oh, you can't keep me here, oh
oh
oh
ee-hoo 

more than you know
more than you know
lately i find
you're on my mind
more than you know
whether i'm right
whether i'm wrong
i need you so
more than you know
more than you know
loving you
the way that i do
there's nothing i can do about it
and the little bit of love
that i get may be all that you can give
but i can't live without it
oh, how i cry
oh, how i cry
if you got tired and said goodbye
more than i'd show
more than you'd ever, ever know
more than you know
more than you'd ever, ever know
more than you know 

and i wished for so long, cannot stay
all the precious moments, cannot stay
it's not like wings have fallen, cannot stay
but still something's missing, cannot stay
will i walk the long road? cannot stay
there's no need to say goodbye
all the friends and family
all the memories going 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
i have wished for so long
how i wish for you today
will i walk the long road? cannot stay
there's no need to say goodbye
all the friends and family
all the memories going 'round, 'round, 'round
i have wished for so long
how i wish for you today
how i've wished for so long
how i wish for you today
we all walk the long road
