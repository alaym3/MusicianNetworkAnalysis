his wicked sense of humour
suggests exciting sex
his fingers, they focus on her
touches, he's venus as a boy


he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty

he's exploring the taste of her
arousal, so accurate
he sets off the beauty in her
he's venus, venus as a boy


he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty

pedalling through
the dark currents
i find an accurate copy
a blueprint of the pleasure in me

(swirling black lilies totally ripe)
a secret code carved
a secret code carved (swirling black lilies totally ripe)

he offers a handshake
crooked five fingers
they form a pattern
yet to be matched

on the surface simplicity (swirling black lilies totally ripe)
but the darkest pit in me
and it's pagan poetry (swirling black lilies totally ripe)
pagan poetry

morse coding signals (signals)
they pulsate (they wake me up)
they wake me up
(pulsate) from my hibernating

on the surface simplicity (swirling black lilies totally ripe)
but the darkest pit in me
and it's pagan poetry (swirling black lilies totally ripe)
pagan poetry
(swirling black lilies totally ripe)

i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him, i
(she loves him, she loves him)
this time (she loves him, she loves him)
i'm gonna keep it to myself (she loves him, she loves him)
(she loves him, she loves him)
this time (she loves him, she loves him)
i'm gonna keep me all to myself (she loves him, she loves him)
(she loves him, she loves him)
(she loves him, she loves him)
but he makes me want to hand myself over (she loves him, she loves him)
(she loves him, she loves him)

our love was my womb
but our bond has broken
my shield is gone
my protection is taken
i am one wound
my pulsating body
suffering being

my heart is enormous lake
black with potion
i am blind
drowning in this ocean

my soul torn apart
my spirit is broken
into the fabric of all
he is woven

you fear my limitless emotions
i am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
did i love you too much?
devotion bent me broken
so i rebelled
destroyed the icon

i did it for love
i honoured my feelings
you betrayed your own heart
corrupted that organ

family was always
our sacred mutual mission
which you abandoned

you have nothing to give
your heart is hollow
i'm drowned in sorrows
no hope in sight of ever recover
eternal pain and horrors

i am a glowing shiny rocket
returning home
as i enter the atmosphere
i burn off layer by layer

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates

moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is

who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?

show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
and i have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh

what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
like milking a stone
to get you to say it

who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?

we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
oh, show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around

it's become a habit
a way to start the day

i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

it's early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks

and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?

i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

all these accidents that happen
follow the dot
coincidence makes sense
only with you
you don't have to speak
i feel

emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
the riddle gets solved
and you push me up to

this state of emergency
how beautiful to be
state of emergency
is where i want to be

all that no one sees
you see what's inside of me
every nerve that hurts
you heal deep inside of me, ooh
you don't have to speak
i feel

emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
confuse
can the riddle get solved?
and you push me up to

this state of emergency
how beautiful to be
state of emergency
is where i want to be

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream

leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay

i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one-way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near

leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay

i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way

maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i smell declarations of solitude
maybe he will come out of this

vietnam vet comes after the war
lands in my house
this wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this

once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached its peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know how to handle them
should i throw oil on one of these moods
but which one?
the joy peak
humor peak
frustration peak
anything peak
for clarity

maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity

maybe he will come out of this
or he will feel solitaire
somehow i'm not too bothered
i'd just like to know

shh, shh

it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until

you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!

you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die

till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?

it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until

you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell

gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!

till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing

he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song

this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?

his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?

cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs

the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song

so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from

and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you

split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite

if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you

didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate

i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

stand up
you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me

you're alright
there's nothing wrong
self-sufficience, please!
and get to work

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me, army of me

you're on your own now
we won't save you
your rescue squad
is too exhausted

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me

and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me, army of me

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn

the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn

he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn

the devil collects it
with a grin
our love, our love
in a ball of yarn

he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love

he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible

and there is no map

they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying

and there is no map

human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour
human behaviour, human, human

and there is no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all

human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human

there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human
human

if travel is searching
and home what's been found
i'm not stopping

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'll bring back the goods
but i don't know when

i thought i could organise freedom
how scandinavian of me
you sussed it out, didn't you?

you could smell it
so you left me on my own
to complete the mission
now i'm leaving it all behind

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter

who would have known
that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly
restoring my blisses?
who would have known
that a boy like him
after sharing my core
would stay going nowhere?

who would have known
a beauty this immense?
who would have known
a saintly trance?
who would have known
miraculous breath?
to inhale a beard
loaded with courage

who would have known
that a boy like him
possessed of magical
sensitivity?
who would approach a girl like me
who caresses, cradles his head
in her bosom?

he slides inside
half awake, half asleep
we faint back
into sleephood
when i wake up
the second time
in his arms, gorgeousness
he's still inside me

who would have known?
who, who would have known?
a train of pearls
cabin by cabin
is shot precisely
across an ocean

from a mouth
from a
from the mouth
of a girl like me
to a boy
to a boy
to a boy

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death

you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death

if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal

we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies

after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death

i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?

after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death

love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
safe, safe from...
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

your flirts, it finds me out
teases the crack in me
smittens me with hope

possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

as much as i definitely enjoy solitude
i wouldn't mind perhaps
spending little time with you
sometimes, sometimes

possibly maybe
probably love (possibly maybe)
possibly maybe
probably love (possibly)

uncertainty excites me, baby
who knows what's going to happen?
lottery or car crash
or you'll join a cult

probably maybe (possibly maybe)
possibly love
this is probably maybe (possibly maybe)
possibly love, possibly

mon petit vulcan
your eruptions and disasters
i keep calm
admiring your lava
i keep calm

possibly maybe
probably love (possibly)
possibly maybe
probably love

electric shocks
i love them!
with you, dozen a day
but after a while i wonder
where's that love you promised me? where is it?

possibly maybe
probably love (possibly)
possibly, possibly, possibly maybe
probably love (possibly)

how can you offer me love like that?
my heart's burned
how can you offer me love like that?
i'm exhausted, leave me alone

possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembrance of you
