you see, what i can't understand
is how somebody have a life-time friend
who they've been through thick and thin with
and they just fall out over the simplest shit, man
but that same person will be in a relationship with a triflin ass mo'fucka
but they keep taking them back!
shit is crazy...

the karma of fucking over a good person
is the asshole you end up wit'
get a taste of your own medicine
funny, you the one who end up sick
always took you back, even though it made my friends upset
told me i should blow you off, haven’t got that wind up yet
know how many days i hurt? many nights i’ve been up stressed?
thought that we had been in love, maybe i just been obsessed
when you crossed me, you lost me
now if i was guardin' derrick rose
i would be more understandin' but you ain't derrick rose
you was my number one, but uuuhmm, you ain't derrick rose
you try to make a point again, you ain’t derrick rose
you just on some bullshit, bitch, you ain’t derrick rose
i’m a lover and a fighter, fight for what i love
but you made something of bitches i think nuttin' of
ask myself why i fight when it’s long been over
god gives the hardest battles to the strongest soldiers
so i fight for us, long as there's reason to
you wanted to give up on us long as there is season two
cool, you’re gonna need me one day
and if it’s sunday, that one day gon' be monday
that’s how fast things change sometimes
niggas play the tough role, i ving rhames sometimes
like, like, like i don't want that bitch back
i mean, i want her, but i don’t want the bitch back
she say she want him, but she don’t want that nigga back
that nigga act like i ain’t had a nigga back

you’re gonna need me someday
you’re gonna want me back in your heart

so much pain in this sample
so much pain in some of our hearts
i just want a pain-free heart
i don't ask for much
fab, what's good though
let's talk to her real quick...

let me start with ‘i love you’, and i think we got the power to grow
woulda gave up, but ain’t no coward in joe
funny thing about it all, you checked my twitter every hour or so
and then you bring this fake shit to our reality show
spent however many years looking for devotion, it’s weird
your feelings but i put 'em into motion
i dictate the what’s and why’s (what else?), the how and when
you ain’t learn to separate your now from then
i keep my distance, when i’m near my head is hurting
exhausted every road to friendship, but it's never working
me, i met the sweetest girl, you know y'all met in person
bottom line, i made you then made a better version
tried to give you good advice, but you ain’t heed it
must’ve figured you ain’t need it, but all i can do is seed it
told you you gon' fuck around and end up sick
you chose dick from this nigga off the new york knicks
my nig... you so spiteful, that ain’t the way we act
that cock was inserted in you, how could it pay me back?
i know you said when we were over you'd start aiming bigger
but you can’t have anonymity with famous niggas
know you thinking my happiness is a front
how would you ever know? happiness is what you wanted
so unidentifiable when that harm'll never let up (why?)
you fucked me real good, karma fucked you better

you’re gonna need me someday
you’re gonna want me back in your heart

you never miss a good thing till it leave you
finally i realize i don’t need you
you want me back, you know you’re gonna need me back
gotta have me back, yeah
heartbroken when you left my world
boy, you know you should’ve kept this girl, i was there for you
now i don’t know what you gonna do without me, baby
that was the last thing i said to you
i notice you know its dead end with you

you’re gonna want me back, you’re gonna want me back
you’re gonna want me back
you’re gonna need me one day
you’re gonna want me back in your heart

and baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah
don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
she like, "yeah, yeah"
one touch, one touch, she gon' give me all the love
she's ready, so ready
she ready, so i'm ready
i feel it coming on strong, you're so heavy
and she ready, i'm ready

yeah, i hear if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready
call you when i get there, you just get your shit wetty
oops, i mean your shit ready, can't believe i said that
least you know where my head at, now shawty, where your head at?
she gon' dive in head first, school me like the board of ed'
she do it, then we do it so she can say she thought ahead
laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed
talk nasty for your boy, silent treatment for the feds
no cup for the thirsty, she bad as controversy
skin-tone like hershey, body lord have mercy
yeah, if this thing were a car, it'd be a lamborghini mercy
maybe i'm too fast, girl say she-she

and baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah

feel that? (i feel that) that's that love comin' down
for the brain, i'm dumbin' down, we on swole when she come around (yeah, woo!)

but is you ready though? (sing, sing)

and baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah

and she ready, i'm ready (she ready, and i'm ready)

yeah, y'all ain't ready

sometimes i like slim, sometimes i like thick
sometimes i combine them and i like thim slick
thim slick probably went over your head
couldn't lay up, i just went over for head
made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
now she on the balcony pint over the ledge
been a few days, but i sent over some bread
it can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
not to save hoes or rescue anybody
but a nigga know what stress do to the body
and i done seen you in your best shoes but zanotti's
shit be looking like fresh shoes on bugatti's
and i don't know who invented high heels
but i swear we all owe him one
and if you do know that man, girl
i be like ''where you know him from?''
you so slick, so small, curvy
teeth all pearly, hair all curly
was a tom boy, now you all girly
never look tired, but you wake up all early
hit the gym, keep it toned up
progress pic, holding your phone up
aw shit, waist getting smaller
niggas on instagram like ''damn, i need to call her''

that body perfect in my eyes
no matter what they say, everything looking just fine
you got that blessing in disguise
you wouldn't know it, girl you got me
(thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(thim slick girls could get every dime) girl you got me
(thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(thim slick girls could get every dime)  girl you got me

she like ''hold up, let me throw on something light'' (damn)
bitch really went and threw on something tight (haha)
came downstairs in her superwoman tights like
''dida dida, dida dida dida''
damn, i ain't know you was holding like that
i ain't know brown skin kelly rowland like that
never knew you had it with your sneaky ass
she said ''i never seen you looking with your peaking ass''
34, 24, 36
finally got a selfie after taking thirty pics
36, 24, 40
d-cups, caption, double cup shorty
and it's angles to this shit, angles to this shit
gotta hold her phone up and put the angle on the pics
and then they poke it out and put an angle on that hip
having thirsty niggas come from every angle at that bitch
lord, heard when they thinner you get deeper in her
they say when they thicker they make you cum quicker
(thim slick girls get me every time
thim slick girls could get every dime)
that ass in the gym, squat life
gotta show 'em love in the era of the shot life
this is all from my mama, this is not knife
niggas love her shit, give a fuck about likes

that body perfect in my eyes
no matter what they say, everything looking just fine
you got that blessing in disguise
you wouldn't know it, girl you got me
(thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(thim slick girls could get every dime) girl you got me
(thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(thim slick girls could get every dime)  girl you got me

a thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
the debris of beauty flickers
in the sadness of a smile
it’s the perfection of your imperfection

beauty's when you just got out the shower
hair still dripping, wrapped up in a towel
beauty's when you ready in a hour
them long legs, i call 'em the twin towers
you put that arch in it, put your hand on your hip
put your hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
beauty’s when the strut compliments sass
you know ya booty look good with ya confident ass (shit)
straight up, but the rest swerve
you know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
that's real beauty, no makeup shit
the girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with
wait until i'm looking then you throw it at me
go down on me, then you look up at me
awhh man, that shit right there
probably give your ex nightmares

miss brooklyn new york
i'll give you whatever to get to your heart
know your worth baby girl, love
this soul tape shit
never make shift, all naturale
put it down
young ralph, let's get it

beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
killing the scene, this type of love will make you complete
now roll the weed and get the munchies, she be the cuisine
when im her jeans i'm still in tune with the inner being
her inner thoughts, her worst fears she give to me
beauty is loyalty to the fullest
'cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
for she i get super deep, maybe speed up
before i pull out and sex is a weapon
but beauty don’t need a bullet
beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
may you be guarded by god, me and grandmamas angels
it's god given, never complicated
a lot of niggas talking, i don’t have the heart to say it
the heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
i pray you know your worth
when niggas don't notice your beauty, truly

you see, beauty isn't a rush
it's a process, sometimes it's slow
yeah, i mean there's beauty in everything, ya know
you just gotta recognize it
shoutout to the people who do
and i feel sorry for the people who don't

nigga, don't tell me what niggas say about me
tell me why they feel comfortable telling you...

the saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scattered shorties
no respect from the neglect, they call they daddy corey
i'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
it's levels to this shit, it's different categories (yea)
can't be like them niggas out here looking fat and gaudy
they ain't never won no rings but be mad at horry
talking 'bout, ”man that nigga don't deserve that shit”
like ”i was really in these streets, i used to serve that shit”
we started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
get it while the gettings good after that preserve that shit
my ex texted me last night, but i curve that shit
coulda end up hitting it, be too late to swerve that shit (err!)
that's a young mistake, lord knows i made me some (word)
i love getting brain, that never made me dumb
all that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb (yea)
only feelings caught is bitch you been shoulda gave me some
i knew niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs (feel me)
drink the whole fucking juice and never saved me some (feel me)
i know how young niggas feel, i had to live through shit
see the world as constipated, nobody gon give you shit
i learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
but hoes gon be hoes, they just ain't admitting to it
where i been? getting to it, going through and getting through it
running round killing shit and telling cops i didn't do it (niicee)
that's why they call me ”young og”
and i'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue od
i flew my shorty in from cali and she brung og
she got me chilling in my city but my lungs ot
and fuck them niggas online, reply why?
broke niggas talking cause it's free wifi

i hear you; you know the problem with you lil niggas?
you think you know everything about the damn world, and you don't know shit
well i see you got yourself a lil business goin'
well that's good, that's good when you make that paper
but when you makin' paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
you gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
there are two types of niggas in this world: there are niggas with guns and niggas with butter
now what are guns? the guns, that's the real estate
that's stocks and bonds, artwork, you know shit that appreciates with value
what's the butter? cars, clothes, jewelry - all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it
that is what it's all about - guns and butter baby!
lil dumb motherfuckers 

"you hate me? keep on sayin that shit girl"
"yeah, that's right, i hate yo ass! you make, me, sick! i can't stand yo' black ass!
you act like a little boy instead of a grown ass man. i hate you!"
"we'll you know what? i hate yo ass too, do somethin'!"
"gimme the keys to my car, jody, you ain't goin nowhere!"
get up off me girl! see there you go again, bringin yo' ass downstairs, showin' off in front of these fuckin neighbors! get yo' ass back upstairs!
fuck you and these neighbors, i hate you
i hate your ass too
i love you i love you so much, jody!
i love you too, baby!

we all have situationships: good sex, bad relationships
had dinner dates, had vacation trips
now the respect is lost, the admiration dips
and all we do is fucking argue
yeah that's it, fuck and argue
why have somebody lying with me every night
if they just gon' be lying to me every night?
i'm trying, but i'm never right, buying shit you never liked
two wrongs just make us wrong, why even be together, right?
we used to be lovers, now we used to each other
keep accusing each other of us using the other
and what's crazy is soon as you fall back, they crawl back
saying they sorry and want it all back
how do i get myself in these situations
good thing i know

yeah.. somebody gon' be mad if they hear me saying that i'm single
'cause lately i been feeling like, i'm single
how does together feel so alone?
like i'm a stranger in my own home
like i'm single, guess i'm single, single, i'm single

titles ain't shit, if the story don't match it
now you got a itch looking for a way to scratch it
flirting online hoping shorty don't catch it
in the strip club, you do it for the ratchets
meanwhile, discussing turn into fussing, name calling and cussing
the person you put your trust in
you tryna take back something you already said
that's like giving cpr to something already dead
and it is what it is or it is what it isn't
the comfort to us, is no longer sufficient
but, i hit it well in public i didn't yell
we got everybody fooled, but i think the kids could tell
that this situation ain't the best it ain't the worst
it's been times that i felt like this, it ain't my first
that alone got me like try harder, or why bother
one thing i know

yeah.. somebody gon' be mad if they hear me saying that i'm single
'cause lately i been feeling like, i'm single
how does together feel so alone?
like i'm a stranger in my own home
like i'm single, guess i'm single
single, single, i'm single

but if i'm a star, she is the sky

you make me better, you make me better (hey! hey!)
you make me better, you make me better (hey! hey!)
you make me better, you make me better (hey! hey! hey!)

cause on the side of every great man
you could find a woman like a soldier holdin him down

she treats me like a don, watches for the hit
checks where i go, even watches who i'm with
the right when i'm wrong, so i never slip
show me how to move, that's why i never trip
and baby girl you so major they should front page ya (front page ya)
god bless the parents who made ya (who made ya)
middle finger anybody who hate the (who hate the)
way we burn it up

shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond

i turn my dark secrets into bright ideas
i used to cry for help, i learned to wipe my tears
i was scared to embrace, but now i fight my fears
these hoes say i'm too much, it's only right i share
pressure makes diamonds, i was made to shine
when life gave me lemons, i made lemonade with mines
what's beef? beef is when you make mistakes
like less burgers with ya buddies and more steaks for snakes
my story just gets better when you get to the end
so when i'm at my worst, i know it's not the end
i came from the dirt, made the cut and blew
so when you put me in that right light
what i do?

shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond

i'm shining religiously, jesus pieces and crosses
i paid for all of my toys, i don't owe any santa clauses
i never finished school or completed no college courses
was taught to be a winner, but i learned more from my losses
losses like, when you go is your friends gon' miss you?
was it cause you beneficial or you been official?
condo at the top, one floor down from heaven yo
hating is beneath me, i say that's the devil yo
i'm tryna keep the faith, hanging in with hope
went to my jeweler, brought myself two angels on the ropes
i came from the dirt, made the cut and blew
so when you put me in that right light
what i do?

shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond

could say i always was the truth but that be lying a little
you can't spell believe without a "lie" in the middle
i always say it first, niggas trying to ditto
but i got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle
mind of a general, heart of a solider
that just mean i call the shots, but ain't afraid to take the shots
niggas gave it all they got, still couldn't take my spot
don't get ya shorty got and have to live out takens plot
i ain't give a fuck, now i would give whatever
you only live once, but legacies live forever
i came from the dirt made the cut and blew
so when you put me in that right light
what i do?

shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
shine bright like a diamond
