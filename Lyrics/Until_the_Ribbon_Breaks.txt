my love

maybe in another life
if we get another life
maybe in that life...
maybe in another time

where is your guilt from
is it just imaginary?
it's your hope that i feel sorry for
the one you bury
the pressure breaks the levee
you've got a nerve...or you're just nervous
i might try to change your world
i pray for change, hail mary
i'd like to thank you for your fear
i've used it well, i trust nobody here
but i'm not the same as you

you're just a goldfish swimming in a bowl
stay up on the surface, nobody will know that you
you're just as scared as them
you don't know where to go
you're just a lighthouse nobody can see

this is my birdsong, this is my call
this is a mirror, hang it on the wall
and you will see...nothing
i have the heart, i just couldn't put my mind to it
and maybe you're the other way around
you see the picture, you just can't connect the sound
i broke the silence, you forgot the glue
i tried my best because i'm not the same as you, no

you're just a goldfish swimming in a bowl
stay up on the surface, nobody will know that you
you're just as scared as them
you don't know where to go
you're just a lighthouse nobody can see
do you ever pray for me?

ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
if this is what you want
then good luck, and be gone
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
if this is what you need
then good luck, and godspeed (yeah)

ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
you're not the same as me
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
no you're not the same as me
you're just a lighthouse nobody can see
(do you ever pray for me?)
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
ooooh ooh oh oooh oooh
(you're not the same)
(you're not the same)

it's still a whisper through a megaphone
it's not your volume, it's your tone
those olive eyes are good enough to pick in winter time
so did i say too much, if that's my crime?
i will zip shut my mouth, won't forget about you
just one more whisper, to see me through
lets hush, hush, hush
so persia if you like me, then what's the fuss?

oh persia, persia
if i can't be your prince
then i whisper, i'd like to leave you in my fingerprints
persia, persia
i might not be the one
i still whisper, until you tell me that we're done

we're not really done, i'm just a gentleman
let's go shopping for a future, i'll pick you one
those people talking, just puppets on a rope
i've cleaned my conscience, no need for soap
i just knew it when you walked in, i'll never win
i whisper too loud, and that's my sin
lets hush, hush, hush
so persia if you like me, then what's the fuss?

oh persia, persia
if i can't be your prince
then i whisper, i'd like to leave you in my fingerprints
persia, persia
i might not be the one
i still whisper, until you tell me that we're done

oh persia, oh no
oh persia, oh no
oh persia, oh no

true love, i saw a poster for it
i queued up, but someone else had bought it
i tried to trade, offer my regrets
he said you have to give it all, and nothing less
i said i'd try for you, please let me try for you
and this is far beyond what i thought i'd ever do
please let me try for you

oh persia, persia
if i can't be your prince
then i whisper, i'd like to leave you in my fingerprints
persia, persia
i might not be the one
i still whisper, until you tell me that we're done

i'd like to try for you
(oh no, oh persia, oh no)
just let me try for you
(oh persia, oh no)
(oh persia, oh no)

i got this new game, i call it kurt
escape from new york, meet me in the dirt
i mean no harm, maybe just a little
these are the end of times, meet me in the middle
politics, we never vote
cause you won't hang yourself if you don't choose a rope, no
we're just a silhouette, just some hired hands
if money talks then i don't understand

you know it, she knows it
we're burning in the sweet sunshine
we know it, he knows it
baby, it's the end of times

lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, do it like a winner (winner)
the church steals, rapes, kills and they call you a sinner (sinner)
set fire to 'em, i'm finna
attack 'em like a dog off the leash in a kennel
fight for the people forever
will it ever change? no, never
the devil got control of the winner

we don’t make waves, we can barely make bubbles, they love it
chuckle out loud when their voice gets smothered
get with big clips and full leaf dusters
bust into class and the mass start busting
guns in our clutches can't be trusted
the war machine will remain uninterrupted
man'll go nuts trying to tackle the subject
clutch to the drugs like the hand from a mother

you know it, she knows it
we're burning in the sweet sunshine
we know it, he knows it
baby, it's the end of times

i wrote a song for the party, but i got the words wrong
it was the end of the world
it was a birthday song
so come, pick a tune, sing along, sing along

you know it, she knows it
we're burning in the sweet sunshine
we know it, he knows it
baby, it's the end of times

sitting ducks on razor blades
just waiting to be swallowed by the soup, mhm
the repetition of a bad dream
a loop within a loop within a loop

here comes the feeling
but not the words
it's like a love song in reverse
i just don't love you
but don't know how to say
it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
can't find the words to say goodbye
(goodbye)

hot tongue, cold shoulder
who am i to turn my back on you?
why bring this back to life?
why raise the dead?
why hold this gun up to my head? mhm

here comes the feeling
but not the words
it's like a love song in reverse
i just don't love you
but don't know how to say
it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
can't find the words to say goodbye

no words, no words
no words, no words
no words, no words
can't find the words to say goodbye

i don't know the language
i can't find the rhythm
i don't know the way to say i tried
i don't know the language
i can't find the rhythm
i don't know the way to say goodbye, bye
(woo!)

it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
it gets stuck in my
it gets stuck in my teeth
can't find the words, can't find the words
can't find the words to say goodbye
can't find the words, can't find the words
can't find the words to say goodbye

i no longer go to 7th street
in the spring, we moved out west
i miss the cocktails at the concorde
but every wave must have a crest
there is an image that i-i cannot shake
the wind blowing through your hair
a part of you still moving, but all of you not there
i wonder how they think of you now
which picture they've had framed
and if it's easier at dinner to not bring up your name

orca, orca, orca
there's nothing quite as black and white as you

of course there are two oceans: the shallow and the true
the one outside the window, and the one inside of you
such eyes you had, not colour
but space to see the truth
i think i knew that you were dying
i just didn't want the proof

orca, orca, orca
there's nothing quite as black and white as you
orca, orca, orca
there's nothing quite as black and white as you

you were dressed in your shirt
with your back to the wall
like you made up your mind
like you knew

we all make our own way
into blue
we all make our own way
into blue
there's nothing quite, as black and white, as you
i wonder if you feel that too
there's nothing quite, as black and white, as you
we all make our own way into blue
orca, orca, orca, orca

you were dressed in your shirt
with your back to the wall
like you made up your mind
like you knew

we all make our own way
into blue
we all make our own way
into blue
we all make our own way
into blue
we all make our own way
into blue

i dreamt that i had lost you
i woke up with a tear
i think you left it on my pillowcase
the last time you were here
and we came from nowhere
we came from nothing
and we could go back there
if that's what it takes
but i made a promise
that i'd try to keep you
until the ribbon breaks
until the ribbon breaks

i wonder why i came home
more read letters through my door
oh but you just came from nowhere
we've been sleepin' on the floor
i don't feel homesick anymore

so who am i to cheat time?
i've been trying to guess the ending
and you'll do just fine
so use me 'til i'm broken
like your favorite old tape
we could just play out through the summer
until the ribbon breaks
so who am i to cheat time?
i've been trying to guess the ending
and you'll do just fine
so use me 'til i'm broken
like your favorite old tape
we could just play out through the summer
until the ribbon breaks
so who am i to cheat time?
i've been trying to guess the ending
and you'll do just fine
so use me 'til i'm broken
like your favorite old tape
we could just play out through the summer
until the ribbon breaks

be ab—be able to s—one last
i think that a grieving process
it's important to have a bo—
to able to see the person one last time

both knees, i saw you grazing at the floor
nosebleeds, there's always more to your one more
sheer delight as you unwind, as you unwind
i think i saw some self belief through gritted teeth tonight

fall over, we don't need another drink
fall over, this goes more quickly than you think
a sugar cube in water; is that all you think this is?
your life in your fingertips

and what was that you said?

so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
just one match to burn this whole thing down
so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
just one match to burn this whole thing down

stop signs, they're blood red, you're colourblind
your lifeline weaves and snakes around your every whim
not rehabilitation, call it learnin' how to swim
we're just learnin' how to swim

and what was that you said?

so lonely, uh, so lonely, so lonely
just one match to burn this whole thing down
so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
just one match to burn down

everything you promised
is swept up by the wind
and i could try to love you
but where do i begin?

and what was that you said?

so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
so lonely, so lonely, we are so lonely
just one match to burn, burn down
and everything you promised
is swept up by the wind
and i could try to love you
but where do i begin?

now let's get it all in perspective

hey bobby, why do you like (until the ribbon breaks)?
because it makes me happy

oh no, just woke up with a cigarette in my teacup
half monkey, half man
big dreams, small plan
so welcome to the pirate bay, all free, no catch
no thieves round here, you can leave your door on the latch
we had a pretty good year, let's move on to the next
there's a time for reflecting
(now let's get it all in perspective)

oh no, the road to damascus is closed for repair
life's still a ball cinderella, you can see it everywhere
nobody ever really dies no, i'm not a medicine man
i don't believe in heaven, i do believe in holograms
love, everybody needs you
it's a short life, just a preview
but there's a time for reflecting
(now let's get it all in perspective)

this is for silver lining finding
shit is fine b, keep this in mind in moments that's defining
keep your calm amidst the sirens
i know that there are tyrants that are tireless
but sun don't even mind em, they're just the minus
there are pluses in abundance, life is wondrous
find your comfort in your moral compass
do not be left in the dust with all the dunces
worried that the world is crumbling
it's always crumbling, that's its primary basic function
it cannot be any better, it cannot be any worse
it can only be the way it is, that's the way it works
that goes for everybody on the earth
you think you irked because you from the dirt
there are people from the dirt that aren't irked
its either percocets or find the perks
instead of steady wilding whining about your wallet or your purse
life's a blessing, everyone alive is more than blessed enough
unless you're jealous of someone else's stuff
which of course makes you a sucker

i've been knee-deep in trouble, trying to stay afloat
pressure, pressure, noose 'round the throat
quick storm comin', you better stay indoors
secrets, secrets, buried in the floor
oh baby wants a new life, that's what she might get
pressure, pressure, a noose 'round my neck
send me down a rope, lost out to sea
trouble now coming, coming for me

maybe in another life, if we get another life
maybe in that life, i could learn to love you
maybe in another time, if there is another time
maybe in that time, i could learn to love you

there's a riot in the town, a wolf at the door
pressure, pressure, poison at the core
quick storm coming, god save the queen
wake up from your dreams
there's a riot in the town, smoke in your lungs
pressure, pressure, blocking out the sun
send me down a rope, lost out to sea
trouble now coming, coming for me

maybe in another life, if we get another life
maybe in that life, i could learn to love you
maybe in another time, if there is another time
maybe in that time, i could learn to love you

(feels so good)

maybe in another life, if we get another life
maybe in that life, i could learn to love you
maybe in another time, if there is another time
maybe in that time, i could learn to love you

i was born with my back to the stars
turn me over, i'd like to see
here comes the morning to end our dream
turn me over, i'd like to see
i was born with my back to the stars
please see that they tell my truth
please see that they tell my truth

so who's your favorite superhero?
or did we lose the fear?
or maybe we just don't need saving
but while we're here
could you tell me when the lights come on?
this does not feel like home
if it's something that i paid for
it should be something that i own

so don't we look pretty with nowhere to go?
it's cool to be lonely, didn't you know?
i think i'll marry a stranger that i met online
it's not that it's not love, it's just a sign of the times
of the time

if only we could learn some patience
i'll take a course
or maybe we should split the money
go straight for divorce
could you tell me when we fall in love?
or just write it down
let me know if you find my feelings
just if you see them around

so don't we look pretty with nowhere to go?
it's cool to be lonely, didn't you know?
i think i'll marry a stranger that i met online
it's not that it's not love, it's just a sign of the times
of the time

oh, i need a feeling, i need a fix
to take me on driving, we could sleep in the stakes
it's too much, too easy, long for the chase
i long for the gaps and the words, i long for the space

so don't we look pretty with nowhere to go?
it's cool to be lonely, didn't you know?
i think i'll marry a stranger that i met online
it's not that it's not love, it's just a sign of the times
of the time

reflections in the swimming pool
the red against the blue (yeah)
the way we give it meaning
the way the light gets through

the wind against the starboard side
and the creaking of the wheel
the way we lean into it
as if it tells us how we feel

meru, meru, meru

next time you see a mountain
know it can't see you
you're looking in a mirror
meru

some strength amongst the chaos
well, that's all it is about
i try not to dream of people, no
it's best to live without their weight

my mind made up
no more wrapped up in the blue, no
my mind made up
just looking out to you, meru
(my mind made up)
no more courage in the bottle
i got people i can't let down
(my mind made up)
there's something coming in the water
i'd like to be around

next time you see a mountain
know it can't see you
you're looking in the mirror
you're looking in the mirror
you're looking in the mirror

low came the punches
i will not move
when i look upon the mountain
i can see all that we've been through
low came the punches
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)
i will not move
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)
when i look upon the mountain
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)
i can see all that we've been through
meru
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)
(i'm still alive, i'm still alive)

i was born with my back to the stars
turn me over, i'd like to see
here comes the morning, to end this dream
turn me over, i'd like to see

and you, what have you done for me
you've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes

if i died with my back to the stars
would you see that they'd tell my truth?
that i did what i could, that i tried to be kind
you can ask my girl for the proof
she's a picture, you're a picture
and you fill up both of my eyes
oh i see you, just know i see you
in the pink of summer sky


april showers, good may
warm june, it's july soon
here come the months, i watch them go
will you still love me when it snows?

well, i didn't work today
petrichor
the dust, the mud, the sweat
washed up off the floor
and all is forgiven, all is replaced
this is the cherry lipstick smeared across your face
and it's not wrong, it's not wrong, it's not wrong
it's moving on
the second verse is in the song

all is forgiven
all is replaced
all is forgiven
all is replaced

and i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all again
petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
come feel it all again

goodbye seems remiss of me to say
everything potentially, always, always
we may be broken up
but kindness fades
and anyway, anyway
i did not let go
forever tangled in the rope
we blame each other
that's just another way to cope

all is forgiven
all is replaced

i was ready again to love

and i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all again
petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
come feel it all again
i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all, i feel it all
i feel it all again
petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
come feel it all again

we may not meet again
wrong way on the street again
you can find me in the deep again
petrichor
we may not meet again
wrong way on the street again
you can find me in the deep again
petrichor, petrichor, petrichor

the lights are on, but you're not home
your mind is not your own
your heart sweats, your body shakes
another kiss is what it takes
you can't sleep, you can't eat
there's no doubt, you're in deep
your throat is tight, you can't breathe
another kiss is all you need

whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah, you do
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love

you see the signs, but you can't read
you're running at a different speed
your heart beats in double time
another kiss and you'll be mine
a one-track mind, you can't be saved
oblivion is all you crave
if there's some left for you
you don't mind if you do

whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah, you do
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love

your lights are on, but you're not home
your will is not your own
your heart sweats your teeth grind
another kiss and you'll be mine

whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah, you do
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love
you might as well face it, you're addicted to love

come on now, kiddo
we'll be alright
me and you can count the lightning
in the middle of the night
let them count the thunder
we'll sit upon the roof
we can sit in silence
and pretend that we are bulletproof

let them count the thunder
tonight's for you and i
let's sit and count the lightning
as it tears across the sky

let's sit and count the lightning
as it tears across the sky
as if we've been here always, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i

come on now, kiddo
they'll always call
we were always stronger
with our back against the wall

let them count the thunder
tonight's for you and i
let's sit and count the lightning
as it tears across the sky

let's sit and count the lightning
as it tears across the sky
as if we've been here always, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i

let's sit and count the lightning
as it tears across the sky
as if we've been here always, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i
you and i, you and i, you and i

oh i was half cut from a full cup
losing money like the races are fixed
and i don't like champagne
the party's the same
the talk is just as dry as the drinks
but that was last year
this is my best man's speech
this is where i make a joke of my past
you've got to ride on your luck, not give a fuck
when they tell you that you came in last
oh oh

oh oh oh oh
i just found my spark
oh oh oh oh
give me a fire to start

so now i'm half cut from a full cup
asking you to fill my glass
i can't be held to a word
can't be tied to a place
give me summer; give me the sun on my face
this is a new year
this is my best man's speech
this is where i make a toast to my friends
you've got to ride on your luck, not give a fuck
when they tell you that your dream's got to end
oh oh

oh oh oh oh
i just found my spark
oh oh oh oh
give me a fire to start

and if we're here for the night
pass me a light
give me a fire to start
give me a fire to start
and if we're here for the night
pass me a light
give me a fire to start

i just found my spark

oh oh oh oh
i just found my spark
oh oh oh oh
give me a fire to start

and if we're here for the night
pass me a light
give me a fire to start
give me a fire to start
and if we're here for the night
pass me a light
give me a fire to start
