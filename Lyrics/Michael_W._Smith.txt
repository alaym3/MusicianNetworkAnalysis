packing up the dreams god planted
in the fertile soil of you
can't believe the hopes he's granted
means a chapter in your life is through
but we'll keep you close as always
it won't even seem you've gone
'cause our hearts in big and small ways
will keep the love that keeps us strong
and friends are friends forever
if the lord's the lord of them
and a friend will not say never
'cause the welcome will not end
though it's hard to let you go
in the father's hands we know
that a lifetime's not too long
to live as friends
with the faith and love god's given
springing from the hope we know
we will pray the joy you'll live in
is the strength that now you show
but we'll keep you close as always
it won't even seem you've gone
'cause our hearts in big and small ways
will keep the love that keeps us strong
and friends are friends forever
if the lord's the lord of them
and a friend will not say never
'cause the welcome will not end
though it's hard to let you go
in the father's hands we know
that a lifetime's not too long
to live as friends 

the word says
"for the spirit of heaviness
put on the garment of praise"

i was lost when you found me here
you pulled me close and held me near
and i'm a fool, but still you love
i'll be your fool for the king of love
you gave me wings so i could fly
and gave me a song to color the sky
and all i have is all from you
and all i want is all of you

it's grace, your grace (your grace)
i'm nothing without you
your grace, your grace
shines on me

and there've been days when i've walked away
too much to carry, nothing left to say
forgive me, lord, when i'm weak and lost
for you traded heaven for a wooden cross
and all these years you've carried me
you've been my eyes when i could not see
and beauty grows in the driving rain
your oil of gladness in the times of pain
your grace, your grace
i'm nothing without you
your grace, your grace
shines on me
oh it's your grace
your grace, your grace
i'm nothing without you
your grace, your grace
shines on me (oh yeah)

jesus, the only one who could ever save
worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
we live for you, we live for you

and holy, there is no one like you
there is none beside you, open up my eyes in wonder and
show me who you are and fill me with your heart
and lead me in your love to those around me
and holy, there is no one like you
there is none beside you, open up my eyes in wonder and
show me who you are and fill me with your heart
and lead me in your love to those around me


i will build my life upon your love, it is a firm foundation
i will put my trust in you alone and i will not be shaken
i will build my life upon your love, it is a firm foundation
and i will put my trust in you alone and i will not be shaken

and holy, there is no one like you
there is none beside you, open up my eyes in wonder and
show me who you are and fill me with your heart
and lead me in your love to those around me
and holy, there is no one like you
there is none beside you, open up my eyes in wonder and
show me who you are and fill me with your heart
and lead me in your love to those around me
i will build my life upon your love, it is a firm foundation
and i will put my trust in you alone and i will not be shaken...

and i will build my life upon your love, it is a firm foundation
and i will put my trust in you alone and i will not be shaken
