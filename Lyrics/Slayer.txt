ah

auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your life's worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down, screaming out to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'till you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood's running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free


angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death

trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance
the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away

raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now, i shall reign in blood

how i've waited for you to come
i've been here all alone
now that you've arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i won't keep you long
i'll keep you forever (forever, forever, forever)

graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
provoking images, delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptation's lost all control

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same


graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

dance with the dead in my dreams (hello? hello, mr. gein?)
listen to their hallowed screams (mr. gein?)
the dead have taken my soul (let me out of here, mr. gein)
temptation's lost all control (mr. gein? i don't want to play anymore, mr. gein)
dance with the dead in my dreams (mr. gein, this isn't fun anymore)
listen to their hallowed screams (i don't wanna play anymore, mr. gein)
the dead have taken my soul (mr. gein? i want out of here, mr. gein)
temptation's lost all control (let me out now)

an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
judgement day, the second coming arrives
before you see the light, you must die

forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive sabbath

on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven


the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
a force that has lived all eternity
the never ending search for a truth never told
the loss of all hope and your dignity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven

razor's edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated, eviscerated
time's perpetuated

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane


inert flesh
a bloody tomb
a decorated splatter brightens the room
an execution, a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

aaaaaaahhhhh


blasting our way through the boundaries of hell
no one can stop us tonight
we take on the world with hatred inside
mayhem, the reason we fight
surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
then we return from the dead
attacking once more now with twice as much strength
we conquer, then move on ahead

evil
my words defy
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds


satan, our master in evil mayhem
guides us with every first step
our axes are growing with power and fury
soon there'll be nothing else left
midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
evil is at our command
we clash with god's angels and conquer new souls
consuming all that we can

evil
aah, haha
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds

arrogance, violence, world in disarray
dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
ain't got the time, i don't want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

my songs relive the atrocities of war
can't take society any fuckin' more
intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
i leave it all on the road, living on the stage
this is my life where i kill it every day
so take your shot, bottom's up, this is no lie
i'll be beating this guitar till the day i die

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride


i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
ain't got the time, i don't want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see
we're killing ourselves a little more every day

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy
i'll instigate, i'll free your mind
i'll show you what i've known all this time

god hates us all, god hates us all
you know it's true, god hates this place
you know it's true, he hates this race

homicide, suicide
hate heals, you should try it sometime
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered

god hates us all, god hates us all
god hates us all, god hates us all
yeah, he fuckin' hates me


pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
global chaos feeding on hysteria
cutthroat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back, fair game
drug abuse, self-abuse, searching for the next high
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
i'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow

man-made virus infecting the world
self-destruct, human time bomb
what if there is no god? would you think the fucking same?
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up, can't ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy
i hate everyone equally
you can't tear that out of me
no segregation, separation
just me in my world of enemies

i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow
i'll never be the one to bear the cross
disciple

i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place
i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place
i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place
i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place

funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind

chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty, beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call


my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity
do you wanna die?!

the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death

join us 
welcome back


existing on damnation's edge
the priest had never known
to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown
angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord

the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
there's no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits

the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam
lonely children of the night
there's seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls

priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
satanic law prevails, your life is through

pray to the moon, when it is round
death with you shall then abound
for what you seek for can't be found
in sea or sky or underground


now i have you deep inside
my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where you'll live your last
warriors from hell's domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest

the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
there's no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits

propaganda death ensemble
burial to be
corpses rotting through the night
in blood-laced misery
scorched earth, the policy
the reason for the siege
the pendulum, it shaves the blade
the strafing air blood raid

infiltration push reserves
encircle the front lines
supreme art of strategy
playing on the minds
bombard till submission
take all to their graves
indication of triumph:
the numbers that are dead

sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victory's really massacre
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill


sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victory's really survival
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill

be dead, fiend from above
when darkness falls
descend onto my sights
your fallen walls
spearhead break through the lines
flanked all around
soldiers of attrition
forward their ground

regime prophetic age
old in its time
flowing veins run on through
deep in the rhine
center of the web
all battles scored
what is our war crimes?
(era forevermore...
war)


propaganda war ensemble
burial to be
bones, shining by the night
in blood-laced misery
campaign of elimination
twisted psychology
when victory is to survive
and death is defeat

sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when the end is a slaughter
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill

you go to the church, you kiss the cross
you will be saved at any cost
you have your own reality, christianity
you spend your life just kissing ass
a trait that's grown as time has passed
you think the world will end today
you praise the lord, that's all you say

jesus saves
listen to you pray
you think you'll see the pearly gates when death takes you away

for all respect, you cannot lust
in an invisible man you place your trust
indirect dependency
eternal attempt at amnesty
he will decide who lives and dies
depopulate, satanic rise
you will be an accessory
irreverence and blasphemy


jesus saves
no need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
it seems you've lost your way


jesus saves
no words of praise, no promised land to take you to
there is no other way

eternal, the kiss i breathe
siphon your blood to me
feel my wounds of your god
forever rape mortality
i smell of death, i reek of hate, i will live forever
lost child, pay the dead
bleeding screams of silence
in my veins, your eternity

i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

first breath born, come alive, learn to kill
bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
dark side has no rival test, your faith in blood
night hides the hunting packs, a feeding frenzy

i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

i am the first, not the last
condemned by a single kiss
betrayed eternally
i'll rip inside your soul
contaminating the world
defying god and son
black heart that brings your death
living in infamy


drink the flesh of life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years

i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth
blame god's chosen children
as you die, i'm immortal
faithless, no religion
stalking prey is my confession
captive blood, enslavement
pain and hunger drives your madness
drink flesh, life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years

disease spreading death, entire population dies
dead before you're born, massive suicide
vicious game of fear, it's all extermination now
poison in your veins, global genocide
slaughter governs law, the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm, seeking homicide
beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard, man has gone insane

world painted blood, no sanctuary
world painted blood, no sanctuary

tip the human scale, follow revelations' plan
it must come to pass, secret shadows lie
blueprint haunting dreams, in which manipulation wins
speak no hidden fears, religion neutralized
emerged from the dark, sadist mercenary ride
realm not of this world, godless messengers
sickless, mindless hate becomes evolutions cure
planets usher in, alignment god has died

world painted blood, no sanctuary
world painted blood, no sanctuary

god send death
watch it bleed
justified
manufactured lives born in hell
angels fall
wings on fire
crucified
terrorizing man, burn the world
reflecting eyes
sickle swings
wave of blood
suicidal mind from the start
endless pain
open wounds
slit the throat
radiation child seeks the throne

strafing down
demigods
certain death
coming from the stars, lord of all
dark rift rise
flourish life
perish man
we destroy ourselves, cease to live
children's blood
feed the dead of sea of flesh
catastrophic fall
rest in hell
flaming corpse
screaming eyes
watch it die
walk among the dead, pick your grave


like a disease spreading death
erasing your existence
like a disease spreading death
erasing your existence
like a disease spreading death
erasing your existence
like a disease spreading death
erasing your existence

satan's hand begins the end
and frees the world forever
gomorrah's dream to live in sin
has reached its critical mass
man himself has become god
and laughs at his destruction
in which we trust a secret government
is now in total collapse

disease spreading death, entire population dies
dead before you're born, massive suicide
vicious game of fear, it's all extermination now
poison in your veins, global genocide
slaughter governs law, the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm, seeking homicide
beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard, man has gone insane

world painted blood, no sanctuary
world painted blood, no sanctuary

signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague
signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague
signs of disease, rivers red, blood
welcoming our death!

murder at your every footstep
a child's toy, sudden death
sniper blazes you through your knees
falling down, can you feel the heat?
burn

ambushed by the spray of lead
count the bullet holes in your head
offspring sent out to cry
living mandatory suicide

suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide


holes burn deep in your chest
raked by machine gun fire
screaming soul sent out to die
living mandatory suicide

suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide

lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain shears through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane
fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath
a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
blood's cheap, it's everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line
aaaaaaahhhh

waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table of hell
a figure in white, unknown by man
approaching the altar of death
high priest awaiting, dagger in hand
spilling the pure virgin blood
satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
answer his every command

death will come easy, just close your eyes
dream of the friends, you'll see
heavenly failure, losing again
move on to a new form of life

altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead


altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead

enter to the realm of satan!


blood turning black, the change has begun
feeling the hatred of all damned in hell
flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
eyes dripping blood, realization of death
transforming of five toes to two
learn the sacred words of praise, hail satan


a gift of powers disposed upon you
use them when you feel the need
master the forces and powers of satan
controlling the creature's instinct
drawn to the castles that float in the sky
learn to resist the temptation
watching the angels sift through the heavens
endlessly searching for salvation

i have witnessed your death
i've seen it many times
your tortured screams
your decrepit little mind
a father's son
with pathetic eyes that bleed
twins in the end
begin and let the brothers fall

i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will watch you die again for him

god won't touch what i've done
he cries upon my feet
a privileged pain
beneath buried are your dead
on splintered bones i walk
sifting through the blood
besieged in fear
await the coming of the god

i will watch you die again for him

blood is raining downward
the stain reflects the sun
conquer divide within
terrorize the mind
i've seen the end, it's yours
rosary in hand
your selfish flesh, it melts
spilling from the sky

i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will watch you die

this is god's war
god's war
this is god's war
god's war

war of holy principles
i'm seeking god's help in your destruction
slit the throat of heathen man
and let his blood dilute the water
bury your dead

fuck your god, erase his name
a lady weeps, insane with sorrow
i'll take his towers from the world
you're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed

this is god's war
god's war
this is god's war
god's war
fucking holy war


be optimistic, happy, and calm
show no fear or anxiety
smile at the face of god
and your reward will be eternity
holy warriors
your patience will be justified
everything is for him
you must not comfort the animal before you kill it
strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
strike above the neck and at all extremities
for it's a point of no return for almighty god
god will give victory to his faithful servants
when you reach ground zero, you will have killed the enemy
the great satan

cursed, black, magic night
we've been struck down
down in this hell
spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light
the force of evil light

cast under his spell
blinding my eyes
twisting my mind
fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satan's might
a force of satan's might

fighting the curse
break it, i must
laughing in sorrow
crying in lust


my strength slips fast, soon i must fall
victim of fortune, my sources grow small
life slips away as demons come forth
death takes my hand and captures my soul

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
the only way to exit
is going piece by piece

you have no choice of life or death
my face you will not see
i'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
dismembered destiny

as soon as life has left your corpse
i'll make you part of me
no emotion
death is all i see

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
the only way to exit
is going piece by piece

bones and blood lie on the ground
rotten limbs lie dead
decapitated bodies found
on my wall, your head

on your trail, i close the gap
one more life that soon won't be
no emotion
flesh is all i need

i'll send you to your maker
confront the god you seek
a flash of red upon your chest
safety out of reach

you have no choice of life or death
my face you will not see
i'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
dismembered destiny

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
there's only one way out of here
piece by piece

night will come and i will follow
for my victims, no tomorrow
make it fast, your time of sorrow
on his trail, i'll make you follow

quarters for the criminally insane
the sentence read for life i must remain
the path i chose has led me to my grave
to try again, i'd have no other way

quarters for the criminally insane
escape, for me, has fast become a game
soon to be, i'll leave without a trace
endangered species, end the human race


branded in pain, marked criminally insane
locked away and kept restrained
disapprobation, but what have i done
i have yet only just begun to take your fucking lives

night will come and i will follow
for my victims, no tomorrow
make it fast, your time of sorrow
on his trail, i'll make you follow
