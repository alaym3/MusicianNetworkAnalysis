and i won't leave until i'm done
so that's why you've got to try
you got to breathe and have some fun
though i'm not paid i play this game
and i won't stop until i'm done

but what i really want to know is
are you going to go my way?
and i got to, got to know

i don't know why we always cry
this we must leave and get undone
we must engage and rearrange
and turn this planet back to one
so tell me why we got to die
and kill each other one by one
we've got to hug and rub-a-dub
we've got to dance and be in love

but what i really want to know is
are you going to go my way?
and i got to, got to know
are you going to go my way?
because baby i got to know, yeah 

i've been searching for you
i heard a cry within my soul
i've never had a yearning quite like this before
know that you are walking right through my door

all of my life
where have you been
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
and if that day comes
i know we could win
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?

a sacred gift of heaven
for better worse, wherever
and i would never let somebody break you down
until you cried, never

all of my life
where have you been
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
and if that day comes
i know we could win
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
at every time i've always known
that you were there
upon your throne
a lonely queen without her king
i longed for you
my love forever


all of my life
where have you been
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
and if that day comes
i know we could win
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
all of my life
where have you been
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
and if that day comes
i know we could win
i wonder if i'll ever see you again?
all of my life

i wonder if i'll ever see you again
and if that day comes
i know we could win
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again
i wonder if i'll ever see you again 

you are the flame in my heart
you light my way in the dark, you are the ultimate star
you lift me up from above
your unconditional love takes me to paradise

i belong to you
and you... you belong to me too
you make my life complete
you make me feel so sweet

you make me feel so divine
your soul and mind are entwined before you i was blind
but since i've opened my eyes
and with you there's no disguise, so i could open up my mind
i always loved you from the start
but i could not figure out, that i had to do it everyday
so i put away the fight
now i'm going to live my life, giving you the most in every way

i belong to you

and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last
i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance

brooklyn's bad boy back again
feet hit the ground running and my back's to the wind
angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds
no i'm not rapping i'm just thinking out loud
my karma's my armor, my charm and wit
is like a leather bomber, i'm warm and shit
and i did bad for good but when you're trapped in the hood
you do worse for less, homie earth's a test
only god can judge me, my heart isn't ugly
but the thoughts that i drop is heavy, try to budge me
momma loved me, pop left me
still the homies call me lucky lefty
i'm flashy and deadly, deceptively smart
i make hustling heaven and pimping an art
long as i know that i'm blessed and i'm loved in depth
i can walk through water and not get wet, i'm that fresh!

i walked away but i was wrong
you're the one that keeps me strong
you're the fire that keeps me warm
how will i get through this storm?
