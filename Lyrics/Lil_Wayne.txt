all of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
she know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
we break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
so she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
you'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
she say, "what's wrong?" he say, "nothin', keep restin'," she say, "what's missin'?" "how you know somethin' missin'?"
he scratch his head, she say, "get back in bed," and she gave him some head
boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "ooh"

i see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
i be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, "don't be so obvious!"
mona lisa, long hair, don't care
she handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
she tell 'em, "ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there

i know a bitch named liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
so he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and i be all ears
and then i go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then i call liz, and she say he comin' over
i say, "good girl, just remember what i told you," she gave me the salute, i say, "girl, you're a soldier"
we're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
she open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started french kissin' so he didn't see moi
and then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
turn that shit down, and i scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
"nigga, turn around, i ain't here to fuck around, i ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
you know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
and then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
you'll be dead after we get what we're after, if liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
i got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga

c5

don't cry, donâ€™t go
won't lie, i fuckin' love you, woah

why yâ€™all staring into the clouds
am i rising or they comin' down?
i see death around the corner
and the u-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
what do i do now? who gon' find me, how?
nowhere to turn but around and round
just another nigga that done lost his head
no, a fucking king that forgot his crown
i am not number one, it's true
i'm number 9-27-82
color blind even if i may be blue
a lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
but iâ€™m hungry, so hungry
need my family tree next to a money tree
with a bunch of leaves in the garden of eden
with a bunch of eves, no fruit punch for me
i sip from the fountain of youth
so if i die young, blame the juice
bury me in new orleans
tombstone reads: "donâ€™t cry, stay tuned."
bring me back to life
got to lose a life just to have a life
but if heaven's as good as advertised
i want a triple extension on my motherfuckinâ€™ afterlife
rest in paradise

don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), donâ€™t go (why, oh why?)
won't lie, i fuckin' love you, woah
don't cry (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
won't lie (don't cry, don't cry)
i fuckin' love you, woah (don't cry, don't cry)

talent is god-given, be grateful
fame is not a given, be humble
and conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
stay in your own lane, seat buckled
and sometimes when there is no music
we toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
that woman carried the future
and tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
don't call it a comeback
it was dark, now the sun back
hit me hard, but i punched back
the wheels fell off, i rode the hubcap
is it suicide or it's do or die?
it's newer days and it's bluer skies
i told myself, "it's just you and i"
then the breeze came and it blew my mind
lord knows who i'm there for
i give my last breath of air for
mama tell me to be careful
voice in my head give me an earful
but i got mind control over my control
i lost control but knew i'd find control
i let god control what i cannot control
can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
won't lie (don't cry), i fuckin' love you, woah
(triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
won't lie, i fuckin' love you, woah (don't cry)

don't cry, stay tuned
and triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
rest in paradise

yeah, i put my shades on

i live it up like these are my last days
if time is money, i'm an hour past paid
ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
yeah, i put it down like my hands hurting
i'm on a natural high, but i land perfect
some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
but i put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
so love or hate me, i stay hate-free
they say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
i got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
all hail weezy, call it bad weather
i stick to the script, i memorize the lines
cause life is a movie that i've seen too many times

when you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
but now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
but you canâ€™t have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself, so when you got older
it seems like you came back ten times over
now youâ€™re sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldnâ€™t never figure out
how to love, how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
now you in a corner tryna put it together
how to love, how to love
for a second you were here, now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love, had a love

you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasnâ€™t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
but i admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby, so donâ€™t be mad, nobody else trippin'
you see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

you see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldnâ€™t never figure out
how to love, how to love
see, you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love, how to love

see, i just want you to know that you deserve the best
youâ€™re beautiful, youâ€™re beautiful
yeah, and i want you to know
youâ€™re far from the usual, far from the usual

you see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldnâ€™t never figure out
how to love, how to love
see, you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love, how to love
see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldnâ€™t never figure out
how to love, how to love, yeah
you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
now you in this corner, tryna put it together
how to love, how to love
