and i got to keep it real now
'cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
but that just ain't me (hey!)

and forget about game, i'ma spit the truth (what?)
i won't stop 'til i get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!)
so gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
i left the jag and i took the rolls
if they ain't cutting, then i put 'em on foot patrol (let's go!)
how you like me now?
when my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)
ludacris fill cups like double d's (yeah!)
me and ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
we want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say

shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(yeah!) yeah!
i got so caught up, i forgot she told me
(yeah!) yeah!

deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
but you know that it's over (know it's over), we knew it was through
let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

i'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that i need to move on
on the other side, i wanna break down and cry, ooh
i'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that i need to move on
on the other side, i wanna break down and cry, yeah

when you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
and everything in your past, you wanna let it go

i've been there, done it, fucked around
after all that, this is what i found
nobody wants to be alone
if you're touched by the words in this song
then maybe...

you got it, you got it bad
when you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
you got it, you got it bad
if you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
you don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
you got it bad when you're out with someone
but you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
you got it bad

when you say that you love them and you really know
everything that used to matter don't matter no more
like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
flowers, cards and candy (i do it just 'cause i'm)
said i'm fortunate to have you, girl
i want you to know i really adore you
all my people who know what's going on
look at your mate, help me sing my song
tell her: "i'm your man, you're my girl
i'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
ladies say: "i'm your girl, you're my man
promise to love you the best i can"

see, i've been there, done it, fucked around
after all that, this is what i found
everyone of y'all are just like me
it's too bad that you can't see
that you got it bad

you got it, you got it bad
when you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
you got it, you got it bad
if you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
you don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
you got it bad when you're out with someone
but you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
you got it bad


you got it, you got it bad
when you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
you got it, you got it bad
if you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
you don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
you got it bad when you're out with someone
but you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...

before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
the one i used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
you used to say it'll be okay
suggest little nice things i should do
and when i'd go home at night and lay my head down
all i seemed to think about was you
and how...

now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
knowin' it should've been you
and what's sad is that i love her, but i'm fallin' for you
what should i do?
should i, tell my baby bye-bye?
should i, do exactly what i feel inside?
'cause i, i don't wanna go, don't need to stay
but i really need to get it together

at this point, the situation's out of control
i never meant to hurt her, but i gotta let her go (gotta let her go)
and if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
i tried, i tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
