she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
i said, "don't mind, but what do you mean, i am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round?"
she said i am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
she told me her name was billie jean
as she caused a scene
then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
who will dance on the floor in the round

people always told me, "be careful of what you do
don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (hee-hee)
and mother always told me, "be careful of who you love
and be careful of what you do (oh-oh)
'cause the lie becomes the truth" (oh-oh)
hey-ay

billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one (oh, baby)
but the kid is not my son, hoo!
she says i am the one (oh, baby)
but the kid is not my son (hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
hoo!

for forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
but who can stand when she's in demand?
her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
so take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(don't think twice) do think twice! (a-hoo!)
she told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(ooh, hee-hee-hee)

people always told me, "be careful of what you do
and don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(don't break no hearts!) (hee-hee)
but she came and stood right by me
just the smell of sweet perfume (ha-oh)
this happened much too soon (ha-oh, ha-ooh)
she called me to her room (ha-oh, hoo!)
hey-ay

billie jean is not my lover (hoo!)
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (hoo!)
billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one (oh baby)
but the kid is not my son (oh, no, no)
she says i am the one (oh baby)
but the kid is not my son (no, hee-hee!)

ah, hee-hee-hee!
hee! hoo!

she says i am the one, but the kid is not my son
no-no-no, hoo! (ouw!)
billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one
(you know what you did to me, baby)
but the kid is not my son
no-no-no, no-no-no-no (no-no-no, no-no-no)
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son (no-no-no-no)

she says i am the one
you know what you did
she says he is my son
breakin' my heart, babe
she says i am the one
billie jean is not my lover
billie jean is not my lover
billie jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)
billie jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)
(don't call me billie jean)
billie jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)
(hoo! she's not at the scene)
billie jean is not (hee! aaow! ooh!)
billie jean is

ow!
cha!
shoo-cha-choo-cha!

it's close to midnight
something evil's lurking in the dark
under the moonlight
you see a sight that almost stops your heart
you try to scream
but terror takes the sound before you make it
you start to freeze
as horror looks you right between the eyes
you're paralyzed

'cause this is thriller, thriller night
and no one's gonna save you
from the beast about to strike
you know it's thriller, thriller night
you're fighting for your life inside a killer
thriller tonight, yeah
ooh

you hear the door slam
and realize there's nowhere left to run
you feel the cold hand
and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
you close your eyes
and hope that this is just imagination (girl)
but all the while
you hear a creature creeping up behind
you're out of time

'cause this is thriller, thriller night
there ain't no second chance
against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
thriller (ooh), thriller night
you're fighting for your life
inside a killer, thriller tonight

night creatures call
and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
there's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
they're open wide
this is the end of your life, ooh

they're out to get you
there's demons closing in on every side (ooh)
they will possess you
unless you change that number on your dial
now is the time
for you and i to cuddle close together, yeah
all through the night
i'll save you from the terror on the screen
i'll make you see

that this is thriller, thriller night
'cause i can thrill you more
than any ghoul would ever dare try
thriller (ooh), thriller night
so let me hold you tight
and share a killer, thriller, chiller

and share a killer, thriller

i'm gonna thrill you tonight
darkness falls across the land
the midnight hour is close at hand
creatures crawl in search of blood
to terrorize y'all's neighborhood (i'm gonna thrill you tonight)
and whosoever shall be found
without the soul for getting down
must stand and face the hounds of hell
and rot inside a corpse's shell
i'm gonna thrill you tonight

and grisly ghouls from every tomb
are closing in to seal your doom
and though you fight to stay alive
your body starts to shiver (i'm gonna thrill you tonight)
for no mere mortal can resist
the evil of the thriller!

i'm gonna make a change
for once in my life
gonna feel real good
gonna make a difference
gonna make it right
as i turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
this wind is blowin' my mind
i see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
who am i to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
a summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
and one man's soul
they follow each other on the wind, ya know
'cause they got nowhere to go
that's why i want you to know

i'm starting with the man in the mirror
i'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change
na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

i've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
it's time that i realize
there are some with no home
not a nickel to loan
could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
a willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
and a washed-out dream
they follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'cause they got no place to be
that's why i'm starting with me

i'm starting with the man in the mirror (who?)
i'm asking him to change his ways (who?)
and no message could have been any clearer

looking out, across the nighttime
the city winks a sleepless eye

sweet seducing sighs

you'll never make me stay
so take your weight off of me
i know your every move
so won't you just let me be?
i've been here times before
but i was too blind to see
that you seduce every man
this time you won't seduce me

she's saying "that's okay
hey baby, do what you please
i have the stuff that you want
i am the thing that you need."
she looked me deep in the eyes
she's touching me so to start
she says "there's no turning back."
she trapped me in her heart

dirty diana, no
dirty diana, no
dirty diana, no
dirty diana, let me be!
oh no, oh no, oh no

she likes the boys in the band
she knows when they come to town
every musician's fan
after the curtain comes down
she waits at backstage doors
for those who have prestige
who promise fortune and fame
a life that's so carefree

she's saying "that's okay
hey baby, do what you want
i'll be your night-loving thing
i'll be the freak you can taunt
and i don't care what you say
i want to go too far
i'll be your everything
if you make me a star."

she said "i have to go home
'cause i'm real tired, you see
but i hate sleeping alone
why don't you come with me?"
i said "my baby's at home
she's probably worried tonight
i didn't call on the phone
to say that i'm alright."

diana walked up to me
she said, "i'm all yours tonight."
at that, i ran to the phone
saying, "baby, i'm alright."
i said "but unlock the door
'cause i forgot the key."
she said "he's not coming back
because he's sleeping with me."

hee!

but, if you're thinking about my baby
it don't matter if you're black or white
ooh!

they print my message in the saturday sun
i had to tell 'em i ain't second to none
and i told 'em about equality
and it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
hoo!

but, if you're thinking about my baby
it don't matter if you're black or white
hoo!

i am tired of this devil
i am tired of this stuff
i am tired of this business
so when the going gets rough
i ain't scared of your brother
i ain't scared of no sheets
i ain't scared of nobody
girl, when the going gets mean

protection for gangs, clubs and nations
causing grief in human relations
it's a turf war on a global scale
i'd rather hear both sides of the tale
see, it's not about races
just places, faces
where your blood comes from is where your space is
i've seen the bright get duller
i'm not going to spend my life being a color

don't tell me you agree with me
when i saw you kicking dirt in my eye
hee-hee!

but, if you're thinking about my baby
it don't matter if you're black or white

think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...

there's a place in your heart
and i know that it is love
and this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
and if you really try
you'll find there's no need to cry
in this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

there are ways to get there
if you care enough for the living
make a little space
make a better place

heal the world
make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me

if you want to know why
there's a love that cannot lie
love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
if we try, we shall see
in this bliss, we cannot feel
fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

then it feels that always
love's enough for us growing
so make a better world
to make a better world

heal the world
make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me

and the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
and the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
then why do we keep strangling life?
would this earth crucify its soul?
though it's plain to see
this world is heavenly
be god's glow

we could fly so high
let our spirits never die
in my heart, i feel you are all my brothers
create a world with no fear
together, we'll cry happy tears
see the nations turn their swords into
ploughshares

we could really get there
if you cared enough for the living
make a little space
to make a better place

heal the world
make it a better place
for you and for me
and the entire human race
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place
for you and for me
heal the world
make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me
heal the world (heal the world)
make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me

there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me
there are people dying
if you care enough for the living
make a better place for you and for me

make a better place (you and for me)
make a better place (you and for me)
make a better place (you and for me)
(you and for me)
heal the world we live in (you and for me)
save it for our children (you and for me)

another day has gone, i'm still all alone
how could this be? you're not here with me
you never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

every day i sit and ask myself, "how did love slip away?"
something whispers in my ear and says

that you are not alone, i am here with you
though you're far away, i am here to stay
but you are not alone, i am here with you
though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

'lone, 'lone
why, 'lone

just the other night, i thought i heard you cry
asking me to come and hold you in my arms
i can hear your prayers, your burdens i will bear
but first i need your hand, then forever can begin

every day i sit and ask myself, "how did love slip away?"
something whispers in my ear and says

that you are not alone, i am here with you
though you're far away, i am here to stay
but you are not alone, i am here with you
though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

oh, whisper three words and i'll come runnin'
and girl you know that i'll be there
i'll be there

that you are not alone, i am here with you
though you're far away, i am here to stay
but you are not alone, i am here with you
though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
that you are not alone, i am here with you
(you are not alone, i am here with you)
though you're far away, i am here to stay
(though you're far away, you and me)
but you are not alone, i am here with you
(you are always in my heart)
though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
for you are not alone (not alone, oh)

you are not alone, you are not alone
say it again
you are not alone, you are not alone
not alone, not alone
if you just reach out for me, girl
in the morning, in the evening
not alone, not alone
you and me, not alone, oh!
together, together
not not being alone!
not not being alone!
you believe in me!

i don't know, bet you wanna try
every time you see

do you remember when we fell in love?
we were young and innocent then
do you remember how it all began?
it just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

do you remember, back in the fall?
we'd be together all day long
do you remember us holding hands?
in each other's eyes, we'd stare
tell me

do you remember the time?
when we fell in love
do you remember the time?
when we first met, girl
do you remember the time?
(oh, i)
when we fell in love
do you remember the time?

do you remember how we used to talk?
you know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
do you remember all the things we said?
like, "i love you so, i'll never let you go"

do you remember, back in the spring?
every morning, birds would sing
do you remember those special times?
they'll just go on and on
in the back of my mind

do you remember the time?
(oh, i)
when we fell in love
do you remember the time?
when we first met, girl
do you remember the time?
(oh, i)
when we fell in love
do you remember the time?

those sweet memories
will always be dear to me
and girl no matter what was said
i will never forget what we had
now baby
