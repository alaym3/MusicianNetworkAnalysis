"it's alright! it's alright!"
"it's alright! it's alright!"
i'm in love without the tears of regret
open fire cos i love it to death
sky high, with a heartache of stone
you'll never see me cos i'm always alone
how to love without a trace of dissent
i'll buy the toys if you can pay for the rent
flying high with the public in hand
i'm in love with the promised land
i'm in love with a malicious intent
you've been taken but you don't know it yet
a truer love has never yet to be found
i see the sunset through the eyes of a clown

"it's alright! it's alright!"
what we are looking at
is good and evil, right and wrong

"congregation, please be seated, and open your prayer guides to the book of revelations, psalm 69
69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69
"i feel like my heart has been touched by christ"
"i feel like my heart has been touched by christ"

"liar! blasphemer!"

"praise jesus!"
"liar! blasphemer!"
"praise jesus!"

"and now it's time for us to give a little love back to god"

drinking the blood of jesus
drinking it right from his veins
learning to swim in the ocean
learning to prowl in his name
the body of christ looked unto me
a preacher with cock in his hand
he wants you to suck off the holy ghost
and swallow the sins of man

"hallelujah! hallelujah! amen!"
"hallelujah! hallelujah! amen!"
psalm 69
"praise the lord!"
"i feel like my heart has been touched by christ"

the invisible piss of the holy ghost
comes down like acid rain
they're making a profit off terminal guilt
the scavengers go on parade
the fathers who write that eternity
is used to fight the sword
have filled you up with the devil's cock
and he'll cum in the name of the lord

"hallelujah! hallelujah! amen!"
"hallelujah! hallelujah! amen!"
"liar!"
"liar!"
"liar!"
"liar!"
"god damn bitch"
the way to succeed and the way to suck eggs
"stop it!"

and other things that go bump in the night
'cuz to me every day is halloween
i have given up hiding and started to fight
i have started to fight

well any time, any place, anywhere that i go
all the people seem to stop and stare
they say 'why are you dressed like it's halloween?
you look so absurd, you look so obscene

oh, why can't i live a life for me?
why should i take the abuse that's served?
why can't they see they're just like me
it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

well, i let their teeny minds think
that they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
and i dress this way just to keep them at bay
'cuz halloween is every day

why should i take the abuse that's served?

why should i take the abuse that's served?
why can't they see they're just like me
i'm not the one that's so absurd
why hide it? why fight it?
hurt feelings, best to stop feeling hurt
denials, reprisals
it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...

stronger than reason

the only truth i know
is the look in your eyes
the look in your eyes
just like a car crash
just like a knife
my favorite weapon
is the look in your eyes
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
there's a ton locked in your empty eyes
get out of my life
i'm chewing on glass
and eating my fingers
i'm not the one
who's run out of lies
lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of lies
you've run out of time
cutting my face
and walking on splinters
i lost my soul
to the look in your eyes
your eyes
you ran out of lies
you ran out of lies
you ran out of lies
you ran out of time
stigmata
oh, you have empty eyes, yes
oh, you have empty eyes, yes
oh, you have empty eyes, yes

oh, you have empty eyes, yes
oh, you have empty eyes
they tell me nothing, nothing but lies, yes

i've got something to say to you
i'll back it up with my fist
sick and tired of dealing with assholes
that's why i resist

we're not snowflakes
we are the antifa

right wing is in freefall
skinheads taking a dive
antifa is coming for you
they won't survive

we're not snowflakes
we are the antifa

brown shirt little snowflakes
never want to admit
terrified of the red and black flag
antifa's the shit

we're not snowflakes
we are the antifa

will these dreams still follow me
out of dark obscurity?
can't you see it up in the sky
as it kicks you in the face and sucks you dry
you never had the answers
and now you tell me the facts of life
i really couldn't be bothered with you
get out of my face and watch me die
burning inside! burning inside!
absolution and a frozen room
are the dreams of men below
i try to grab it but the touch is hot
the mirror collapses, but the image can not
i'm scared of the darkness in light
i scare myself because i know i'm right
i see the evil in your savage eye
as it cuts right through the sky
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
calling a mantra with a blade in the skin
for the demons within
i feel the pain is the death and decay
but the lesson never fades away
too little shadows, turn them away
you throw the man through the window pane
another slave and a victim of fate
another lesson in hate
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!
burning inside! burning inside!

face to face
blood to blood
the mountain
you tumbled from

and in the land of rape and honey
you pray

step by step
you climb the mountain
you pray

fist to fist
eye to eye
the rulers of the wasteland

and in the land of rape and honey
you pray

step by step
you climb the mountain
you pray


head to head
chest to chest
which country is the very best?

and in the land of rape and honey
you pray

step by step
you climb the mountain
you pray

well i started out younger at things that people start younger at
and a thousand days and nights of getting overexposed
then someone asks, "how do you sleep at night?"
with the borrowed dreams from a broken past
you keep runnin' away don't matter how fast or long
you always wind up there
another thousand pile-ups in the ugly name of morality
fucking ugly, some creepy guy keeps asking
"how the fuck do you sleep at night?"
with a frozen dream and a borrowed hope that died

filth pig, filth pig
filth pig
i sleep with both eyes open
filth pig, filth pig
filth pig
i keep chasing this tail but the tail gets bigger go figure
a thousand more stories keep the fires and flames alive
so how the fuck do i dream at night?
with the memories of a borrowed death, the guilty past

filth pig, filth pig
filth pig
he sleeps with both eyes open
filth pig
filth pig, filth pig
filth pig
he sleeps alright 'cause he's a
filth pig, filth pig
filth pig

this is the way nightmares begin
how stupid are the people of the country?
err i don't know what i said
argh i don't remember
i don't remember
i don't remember
err maybe that's what i said
how stupid
we should go for waterboarding
and we should go tougher
chop off heads
get these terrorists
get these terrorists
this is the twilight zone
i remember waking up on november 9, 2016
and feeling a little bit nauseous
it felt like descending into a bottomless pit on a high speed rail
careening head first into the unknown
twilight zone
we will make american great again

disgusted and depressed
we know the world is just a mess
distortion of reality
the truth is under arrest

this is the twilight zone
the world went on much as it had been going on
crisis
twilight zone
we will make american great again

confusion and consent
has always been their intent
destruction of society
unless we dissent

this is the twilight zone
the world went on much as it had been going on
crisis
we're in the twilight zone
twilight zone

but there's no better word than stupid
firing up the crazies
how stupid
this is the twilight zone

where do we go from here?
where do we go from here?
where do we go from here?

"they live without hope"

staring in the face of condemnation
laughter fills the sky instead of rain

live my life alone in resignation
arms outstretched for those who cannot see

scarecrow

crucified and left in isolation
pictures of our lost morality

scarecrow
scarecrow

"they live without hope"
"they live without hope"

eyeless stares invite this whole damnation
rotting corpse of inhumanity

scarecrow
scarecrow

"they live without hope"
"they live without hope"
"they live without hope"
"they live without hope"

pushed me off the thirteenth floor
you watched as my head hit the floor
you watched as i rolled round and round
you watched as i came tumbling down
you watched as i rolled down the stairs
you never wished me fare thee well!
you watched as i got on my feet
i ran towards her and she started to plead, no!

ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
you did it again, you did it again
you did it again and again and again, ho, ho!

far below original sin
far below the state i'm in
far below malicious crimes
far below her for the time
far below, far below
far below is the place you'll go, ho!

ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
you did it again, you did it again
you did it again and again and again, ho, ho!

oh, went through the window, quiet as a mouse
no sound was stirring throughout the house
i'd heard a noise that made me startle
but i kept on walking down the corridor
yes, the corridor, yes, the corridor
and there you were with a man once more, no!

ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
ain't got time for what you feel
you did it again, you did it again
you did it again and again and again
you did it again, you did it again
you did it again and again and again, ho, ho!
ho, ho!
ho, ho!

well, i walked a mile today
in someone else's pair of shoes
i came home tired and disgusted
just walking home from hatred avenue
what you want, what you feel
you will never forget
what you know, what you trust
you should always suspect
what you say, what you do
it makes you regret
what you think, what you see
you should always resent
well, i heard some news today
i guess we're going to war
we don't know who we're fighting
we don't know what we're fighting for
what you want, what you feel
you will never forget
what you know, what you trust
you should always suspect
what you say, what you do
it makes you regret
what you think, what you see
you should always resent
it's like the nazis back in '39
like the romans on the verge of decline
like the russians back in '68
how is this supposed to make america great?
well i guess the truth is hiding
beyond the walls of the usa
this is exciting
don't have to listen to anything you say
what you want, what you feel
you will never forget
what you know, what you trust
you should always suspect
what you say, what you do
it makes you regret
what you think, what you see
you should always resent
it's like the nazis back in '39
like the romans on the verge of decline
like the russians back in '68
how is this supposed to make america great?
what you want, what you feel
you will never forget
what you know, what you trust
you should always suspect
what you say, what you do
it makes you regret
what you think, what you see
you should always resent
well, i guess i don't know what to expect
well, i guess that's all we got

"victims of a system that makes men torture"
"hate of men will pass"
"the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed"
"we all want to help one another. human beings are like that."
"let us all unite!"
"i don't want to be an emperor. that's not my business."
"you, the people, have the power!"
" i should like to help everyone if possible; jew, gentile, black man, white."
"we want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. we don't want to hate and despise one another."
"the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone"
"we have lost the way"
polarized, divisive drowning in strife
technically i still exist, but not in my mind
wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat
fire up, freak out, let it go
angry man
septic tank
orange
toxic lies
rejection of reality
cuts through like a knife
wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat
fire up, freak out, let it go
silence of majority
silver linings prevail
golden dreams remember
remember to exhale
wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat
fire up, freak out, let it go
hey!
what he say?!
vomiting conspiracies
god damn the racist blind
anti social impotence ignites
