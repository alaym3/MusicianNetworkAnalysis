but i can't help falling in love with you

shall i stay? would it be a sin
if i can't help falling in love with you?

some things are meant to be

take my hand, take my whole life, too
for i can't help falling in love with you

everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock

shifty henry said to bugs, "for heaven's sake

we're caught in a trap, i can't walk out
because i love you too much, baby
why can't you see, what you're doin' to me
when you don't believe a word i say?

we can't go on together
with suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds

so, if an old friend i know, stops by to say hello
would i still see suspicion in your eyes?
here we go again, asking where i've been
you can't see the tears are real, i'm cryin'
(yes, i'm cryin')

we can't go on together
with suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds

oh, let our love survive
i'll dry the tears from your eyes
let's don't let a good thing die
when, honey, you know i've never lied to you

we're caught in a trap, i can't walk out
because i love you too much, baby

well, since my baby left me
well, i found a new place to dwell
well, it's down at the end of lonely street
at heartbreak hotel

where i'll be, i'll be so lonely, baby
well, i'm so lonely
i'll be so lonely, i could die

although it's always crowded
you still can find some room
for broken-hearted lovers
to cry there in their gloom

they'll be, they'll be so lonely, baby
they'll be so lonely
they're so lonely, they could die

now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
and the desk clerk's dressed in black
well, they've been so long on lonely street
they'll never, never look back

and they get so, they get so lonely, baby
well, they are so lonely
they're so lonely, they could die

well, now, if your baby leaves you
and you got a tale to tell
well, just take a walk down lonely street
to heartbreak hotel

where you will be, you will be, you'll be so lonely, baby
well, you will be lonely
you'll be so lonely, you could die

although it's always crowded
you still can find some room
for broken-hearted lovers
to cry there in their gloom

where they get so, they get so lonely, baby
well, they're so lonely
they'll be so lonely, they could die

are you lonesome tonight? do you miss me tonight?
are you sorry we drifted apart?
does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
when i kissed you and called you sweetheart?

do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
is your heart filled with pain? shall i come back again?
tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

i wonder if you are lonesome tonight
you know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
act one was where we met
i loved you at first glance
you read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two
you seemed to change, you acted strange
and why, i've never known
honey, you lied when you said you loved me
and i had no cause to doubt you
but i'd rather go on hearing your lies
than to go on living without you
now the stage is bare and i'm standing there
with emptiness all around
and if you won't come back to me
then they can bring the curtain down

is your heart filled with pain? shall i come back again?
tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

as the snow flies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
a poor little baby child is born
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
and his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
it's another hungry mouth to feed
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)

people, don't you understand
a child needs a helping hand
or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
take a look at you and me
are we too blind to see
do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way?

well, the world turns
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
and his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)

then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away
he buys a gun, he steals a car
tries to run, but he don't get far

and his mama cries
as a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
and as her young man dies (in the ghetto)
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)

and his mama cries
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
(in the ghetto)

well, it's one for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go

but don't you step on my blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes

well, you can knock me down, step in my face
slander my name all over the place
do anything that you wanna do
but uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes

and don't you step on my blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
let's go, cat!

ah, walk the dog

you can burn my house, steal my car
drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
do anything that you want to do
but uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

and don't you step on my blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes
rock it

yeah!

well, it's one for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go

but don't you step on my blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
blue, blue, blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

oh, my love, my darling
i've hungered
for your touch
a long, lonely time
time goes by
so slowly
and time can do so much
are you, still mine?
i need your love, i need your love
god speed your love to me

lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
i'll be coming home, wait for me

my love, my darling
i've hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time
i need your love, i need your love
god speed your love, to me

there must be lights burning brighter somewhere
got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
if i can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

there must be peace and understanding sometime
strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
if i can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear

we're lost in a cloud with too much rain
we're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
but as long as a man has the strength to dream
he can redeem his soul and fly (he can fly)

deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
still, i am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
and while i can think, while i can talk, while i can stand, while i can walk
while i can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

let it come true right now
oh, yeah

you know i can be found
sitting home all alone
if you can't come around
at least please telephone

don't be cruel to a heart that's true

baby, if i made you mad
for something i might have said
please, let's forget my past
the future looks bright ahead

don't be cruel to a heart that's true

i don't want no other love
baby, it's just you i'm thinkin' of

don't stop thinking of me
don't make me feel this way
c'mon over here and love me
you know what i want you to say

don't be cruel to a heart that's true

why should we be apart?
i really love you, baby, cross my heart

let's walk up to the preacher
and let us say "i do"
then you'll know you'll have me
and i'll know that i'll have you

don't be cruel to a heart that's true

i don't want no other love
baby, it's just you i'm thinkin' of

don't be cruel to a heart that's true
don't be cruel to a heart that's true

i don't want no other love
baby, it's just you i'm thinkin' of

lord almighty
i feel my temperature rising
higher higher
it's burning through to my soul
girl, girl, girl, girl
you're gonna set me on fire
my brain is flaming
i don't know which way to go

your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love

ooh, ooh, ooh
i feel my temperature rising
help me, i'm flaming
i must be a hundred and nine
burning, burning, burning
and nothing can cool me
i just might turn into smoke
but i feel fine

'cause your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
and you light my morning sky
with burning love

it's coming closer
the flames are now licking my body
won't you help me
i feel like i'm slipping away
it's hard to breathe
and my chest is a-heaving
lord, have mercy
i'm burning a hole where i lay

your kisses lift me higher
like the sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love
with burning love
(ah, ah, burning love)

i'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

i'll have a blue christmas without you
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'll be so blue just thinking about you
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
decorations of red on a green christmas tree
(ahh, ahh)
won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(ooh)

and when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
that's when those blue memories start callin'

(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have

little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time

you were always on my mind
(you were always on my mind)
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine

if i made you feel second best
girl, i'm so sorry i was blind

you were always on my mind
(you were always on my mind)
you were always on my mind

tell me
tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me
give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time

you were always on my mind
(you were always on my mind)
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have
maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have

you can shake an apple off an apple tree
shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
uh-uh-uh
no-sir-ee, uh, uh
i'm going to stick like glue
stick, because i'm
stuck on you

i'm going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
uh-uh-uh
yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
i'm going to stick like glue
stick, because i'm
stuck on you

hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
ain't gonna do you no good at all
'cause once i catch you and the kissing starts
a team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
that's how love is going to keep us tied
uh-uh-uh
oh yeah, uh, uh
i'm gonna stick like glue
stick, because i'm
stuck on you

hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
ain't gonna do you no good at all
'cause once i catch you and the kissing starts
a team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
that's how love is going to keep us tied
uh-uh-uh
yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
i'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
because i'm stuck on you
i'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
because i'm stuck on you
i'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
because i'm stuck on you

i can't stop loving you
i said  i've made up my mind, yes i did
to live in memory
of such an lone-, lonely time

and i can't stop wanting you
i said it's useless to say, yes i did
so i'll just live my life
in dreams of yesterday

those happy hours
all that we once knew
though long ago
they still make me blue

they say that time
it heals a broken heart
but time has stood still
since we've been apart

i can't stop loving you
so i've made up my mind, yes i did
to live in memory
of such an lone-, lonely time

and i can't stop wanting you
i said it's useless to say, yes i did
so i'll just live my life
in dreams of yesterday

you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise

you fooled me with your kisses
you cheated and you schemed
heaven knows how you lied to me
you're not the way you seemed

you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise

i thought that i was in heaven
but i was sure surprised
heaven help me, i didn't see
the devil in your eyes

you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise


you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise

and now the end is near
so i face the final curtain
my friend, i'll say it clear
i'll state my case of which i'm certain

i've lived a life that's full
i've traveled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way

regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
and saw it through without exception

i planned each charted course
each careful step along the byway
oh, and more, much more than this
i did it my way

yes, there were times, i'm sure you knew
when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and i stood tall
and did it my way

i've loved, i've laughed and cried
i've had my fill, my share of losing
and now as tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that
and may i say, not in a shy way
oh, no, no not me
i did it my way

for what is a man, what has he got
if not himself, then he has not
to say the words he truly feels
and not the words of one who kneels
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way

uh, well, a-bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
i'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
my friends say i'm actin' wild as a bug
i'm in love, i'm all shook up
mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
i can't seem to stand on my own two feet
who do you thank when you have such luck?
i'm in love, i'm all shook up
mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
i'm a little mixed up, but i feel fine
when i'm near the girl that i love best
my heart beats so it scares me to death

when she touched my hand, what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
i'm in love, i'm all shook up
mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

my tongue gets tied when i try to speak
my insides shake like a leaf on a tree
there's only one cure for this body of mine
that's to have that girl that i love so fine

she touched my hand, what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
i'm in love, i'm all shook up
mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

mm, ooh, yeah, yeah
i'm all shook up
