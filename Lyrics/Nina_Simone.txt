southern trees
bearing strange fruit
blood on the leaves
and blood at the roots
black bodies
swinging in the southern breeze
strange fruit hangin'
from the poplar trees
pastoral scene
of the gallant south
them big, bulging eyes
and the twisted mouth
scent of magnolia
clean and fresh
then, the sudden smell
of burnin' flesh
here is a fruit
for the crows to pluck
for the rain to gather
for the wind to suck
for the sun to rot
for the leaves to drop
here is
strange and bitter crop 

baby, do you understand me now
sometimes i feel a little bit mad
don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
when everything goes wrong, you see some bad

but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

baby, sometimes i'm so carefree
with a joy that's hard to hide
and sometimes it seems that all i have to do is worry
and then you're bound to see my other side

but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

if i seem edgy, i want you to know
that i never mean to take it out on you
life has its problems and i get my share
and that's one thing i never mean to do 'cause i love you
oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, don't you know i'm a human?
i have faults, like any other one
sometimes i find myself alone regretting some foolish thing
some simple thing that i've done

i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
yes, i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
yes, i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 

my skin is black
my arms are long
my hair is woolly
my back is strong
strong enough to take the pain
inflicted again and again
what do they call me?
my name is aunt sarah
my name is aunt sarah
aunt sarah
my skin is yellow
my hair is long
between two worlds
i do belong
but my father was rich and white
he forced my mother late one night
and what do they call me?
my name is saffronia
my name is saffronia
my skin is tan
my hair is fine
my hips invite you
my mouth like wine
whose little girl am i?
anyone who has money to buy
what do they call me?
my name is sweet thing
my name is sweet thing
my skin is brown
my manner is tough
i'll kill the first mother i see!
my life has been rough
i'm awfully bitter these days
because my parents were slaves
what do they call me?
my name is peaches! 

the name of this tune is mississippi goddam
and i mean every word of it

alabama's gotten me so upset
tennessee made me lose my rest
and everybody knows about mississippi, goddamn
can't you see it
can't you feel it
it's all in the air
i can't stand the pressure much longer
somebody say a prayer

alabama's gotten me so upset
tennessee made me lose my rest
and everybody knows about mississippi, goddamn
(this is a show tune, but the show hasn't been written for it, yet)

hound dogs on my trail
school children sitting in jail
black cat cross my path
i think every day's gonna be my last
lord have mercy on this land of mine
we all gonna get it in due time
i don't belong here
i don't belong there
i've even stopped believing in prayer
don't tell me, i'll tell you
me and my people just about due
i've been there so i know
they keep on saying "go slow!"

but that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
washing the windows
"too slow"
picking the cotton
"too slow"
you're just plain rotten
"too slow"
you're too damn lazy
"too slow"
the thinking's crazy
"too slow"
where am i going
what am i doing
i don't know
i don't know
just try to do your very best
stand up, be counted with all the rest
for everybody knows about mississippi, goddamn
(i bet you thought i was kidding, didn't you)

picket lines, school boycotts
they try to say it's a communist plot
all i want is equality
for my sister, my brother, my people, and me
yes, you lied to me all these years
you told me to wash and clean my ears
and talk real fine just like a lady
and you'd stop calling me sister sadie
oh but this whole country is full of lies
you're all gonna die and die like flies
i don't trust you any more
you keep on saying "go slow!"
"go slow!"

but that's just the trouble
"too slow"
desegregation
"too slow"
mass participation
"too slow"
reunification
"too slow"
do things gradually
"too slow"
but bring more tragedy
"too slow"
why don't you see it
why don't you feel it
i don't know
i don't know
you don't have to live next to me
just give me my equality
everybody knows about mississippi
everybody knows about alabama
everybody knows about mississippi, goddamn

that's it! 

i ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
ain't got no money, ain't got no class
ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweater
ain't got no perfume, ain't got no bed
ain't got no man
ain't got no mother, ain't got no culture
ain't got no friends, ain't got no schoolin'
ain't got no love, ain't got no name
ain't got no ticket, ain't got no token
ain't got no god
hey, what have i got?
why am i alive, anyway?
yeah, what have i got
nobody can take away?
got my hair, got my head
got my brains, got my ears
got my eyes, got my nose
got my mouth, i got my smile
i got my tongue, got my chin
got my neck, got my boobies
got my heart, got my soul
got my back, i got my sex
i got my arms, got my hands
got my fingers, got my legs
got my feet, got my toes
got my liver, got my blood
i've got life, i've got my freedom
i've got life
i've got the life
and i'm going to keep it
i've got the life 

i wish i knew how it would feel to be free
i wish i could break all the chains holding me
i wish i could say all the things that i should say
say 'em loud, say 'em clear
for the whole round world to hear
i wish i could share all the love that's in my heart
remove all the bars that keep us apart
i wish you could know what it means to be me
then you'd see and agree
that every man should be free
i wish i could give all i'm longing to give
i wish i could live like i'm longing to live
i wish i could do all the things that i can do
though i'm way overdue, i'd be starting anew
well, i wish i could be like a bird in the sky
how sweet it would be if i found i could fly
oh, i'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
and then i'd sing 'cause i'd know, yeah
then i'd sing 'cause i'd know, yeah
then i'd sing 'cause i'd know
i'd know how it feels
i'd know how it feels to be free, yeah, yeah
oh, i'd know how it feels
yes, i'd know, i'd know how it feels
how it feels to be free, lord, lord, lord, yeah 

stars, they come and go, they come fast, they come slow
they go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
and all you see is glory, but it gets lonely there
when there's no one there to share, you can shake it away
if you'll hear a story

people lust for fame like athletes in a game
they break their collarbones and come up swinging
some of them are crowned, some of them are downed
some are lost and never found
but most have seen it all
they live their lives in sad cafés and music halls
and they always have a story
some make it when they're young
before the world has done its dirty job
and later on someone will say, "you've had your day
now you must make way" (don't they always?)
but you'll never know the pain of using a name you never owned
the years of forgetting what you know too well
that you who gave the crown have been let down, you try to make amends
without defending, perhaps
pretending
you never saw the eyes of young men at twenty-five
who followed as you walked and asked for autographs
kissed you on the cheek and you never could believe they really loved you, never
some make it when they're old
perhaps they have a soul they aren't afraid to bare
perhaps there's nothing there
but anyway that isn't what i meant to say, i meant to tell about a story
since we all have stories
but i can't remember it anyway
so i'll tell about the mood that's in the united states today
and permeating even switzerland
it goes
but i'll continue anyway until i get it together
some women have a body men would want to see
and so they put it on display, some people play a fine guitar
i could listen to them play all day
but anyway, i'm trying to tell my story
janis ian told it very well
janis joplin told it even better
billie holiday even told it even better
we always, we always, we always have a story
the latest story that​ i know is the one that i'm supposed to go out with
and the latest story that i know is the one that i'm supposed to go out with
and the latest story that i know is the one that i'm supposed to go out with
and the latest story that i know is the one that i'm supposed to go out with
feelings
nothing more than feelings
feelings
nothing more than feelings
feelings are bluff, you know that? 

my baby don't care for shows

beat-up little seagull
on a marble stair
tryin' to find the ocean
lookin' everywhere
hard times in the city
in a hard town by the sea
ain't nowhere to run to
there ain't nothin' here for free
hooker on the corner
waiting for a train
drunk lying on the sidewalk
sleeping in the rain
and the people hide their faces
and they hide their eyes
'cause the city's dyin'
and they don't know why
oh, baltimore
ain't it hard just to live?
oh, baltimore
ain't it hard just to live?
just to live
get my sister sandy
and my little brother ray
buy a big old wagon
to haul us all away
live out in the country
where the mountain's high
never gonna come back here
'til the day i die
oh, baltimore
ain't it hard just to live?
oh, baltimore
ain't it hard just to live?
just to live 

do what you gotta do
come on back, see me when you can

man, i can understand how it might be
kinda hard to love a girl like me
i don't blame you much for wanting to be free
i just wanted you to know
i've loved you better that your own kin did
from the very start
it's my own fault what happens to my heart
you see i've always known you'd go

so you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
though it may mean that i'll never kiss those sweet lips again
pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
come on back and see me when you can

now i know it'll make you feel sad
and make you feel so bad
they say you don't treat me me like you should
they got ways to make you feel no good
i guess they got no way to know
i've had my eyes wide open from the start
and man you never lied to me
the part of you that they'll never see
is the part you've shown to me
so you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
though it may mean that i'll never kiss those sweet lips again
pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
come on back and see me when you can 

say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
you won't believe me but i love you only
i'd rather be lonley than happy with somebody else
you might find the night time the right time for kissing
night time is my time for just reminiscing
regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
there'll be no one unless that someone is you
i intended to be independently blue
i want your love, don't wanna borrow
have it today to give back tomorrow
your love is my love
there's no love for nobody else
say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
you won't believe me but i love you only
i'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
you might find the night time the right time for kissing
night time is my time for just reminiscing
regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
there'll be no one unless that someone is you
i intended to be independently blue
say i want your love, don't wanna borrow
have it today to give back tomorrow
your love is my love
my love is your love
there's no love for nobody else 

love me, love me, love me, say you do
let me fly away with you
for my love is like the wind
and wild is the wind

give me more than one caress
satisfy this hungriness
let the wind blow through your heart
for wild is the wind

you touch me
i hear the sound of mandolins
you kiss me
with your kiss, my life begins
you're spring to me
all things to me

don't you know your life itself
like a leaf clings to a tree
oh my darling, cling to me
for we're creatures of the wind
and wild is the wind
so wild is the wind
you touch me
i hear the sound of mandolins
you kiss me
with your kiss, my life begins
now that you're spring to me
all things to me

don't you know your life itself
like a leaf clings to a tree
oh my darling, cling to me
for we're creatures of the wind
and wild is the wind
so wild is the wind

wild is the wind
wild is the wind
wild is the wind

young, gifted and black
oh what a lovely precious dream
to be young, gifted and black
open your heart to what i mean
in the whole world you know
there's a million boys and girls
who are young, gifted and black
and that's a fact
you are young, gifted and black
we must begin to tell our young
there's a world waiting for you
yours is a quest that's just begun
when you're feeling really low
yeah, there's a great truth that you should know
when you're young, gifted and black
your soul's intact
how to be young, gifted and black
oh how i long to know the truth
there are times when i look back
and i am haunted by my youth
oh but my joy of today
is that we can all be proud to say
to be young, gifted and black
is where it's at
is where it's at
is where it's at 

i lost myself on a cool damp night
gave myself in that misty light
was hypnotized by a strange delight
under a lilac tree
i made wine from the lilac tree
put my heart in its recipe
it makes me see what i want to see
be what i want to be
when i think more than i want to think
do things i never should do
i drink much more than i ought to drink
because it brings me back you
lilac wine is sweet and heady like my love
lilac wine, i feel unsteady like my love
listen to me, i cannot see clearly
isn't that he coming to me nearly here?
lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
lilac wine, i feel unsteady, where's my love?
listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
isn't that he, or am i goin' crazy, dear?
lilac wine, i feel i'm ready for my love
feel i'm ready for my love 

black is the color of my true love's hair
his face so soft and wondrous fair
the purest eyes
and the strongest hands
i love the ground on where he stands
i love the ground on where he stands

black is the color of my true love's hair
of my true love's hair
of my true love's hair

oh i love my lover
and well he knows
yes i love the ground on where he goes
and still i hope that the time will come
still i pray that the time will come
when he and i will be as one

black is the color of my true love's hair
of my true love's hair
of my true love's hair
