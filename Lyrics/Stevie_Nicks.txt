just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo-whoo-whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

and the days go by
like a strand in the wind
in the web that is my own
i begin again
said to my friend, baby (everything stops)
nothin' else mattered
he was no more
(he was no more)
than a baby then
well, he seemed broken hearted
somethin' within him
but the moment
that i first laid
eyes on him
all alone on the edge of seventeen

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well, i went today
maybe i will go again
tomorrow, yeah, yeah
well, the music there
well it was hauntingly familiar
when i see you doin'
what i try to do for me
with their words of a poet
and a voice from a choir
and a melody
nothin' else mattered

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

the clouds never expect it
when it rains
but the sea changes color
but the sea
does not change
so with the slow graceful flow
of age
i went forth with an age old
desire to please
on the edge of seventeen

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well then suddenly
there was no one left standing
in the hall, yeah, yeah
in a flood of tears
that no one really ever heard fall at all
when i went searchin' for an answer
up the stairs and down the hall
not to find an answer
just to hear the call
of a nightbird singin', come away
(come away)
(come away)

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well, i hear you (well, i hear you)
in the morning (in the morning)
and i hear you (and i hear you)
at nightfall (at nightfall)
sometimes to be near you
is to be unable to hear you
my love
i'm a few years older than you, my love
(i'm a few years older than you)

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
(just like the white winged dove)
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

baby, you'll come knocking on my front door
same old line you used to use before
i said yeah, well what am supposed to do?
i didn't know what i was getting into

so you've had a little trouble in town
now you're keeping some demons down
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around

it's hard to think about what you've wanted
it's hard to think about what you've lost
this doesn't have to be the big get even
this doesn't have to be anything at all

i know you really wanna tell me goodbye
i know you really wanna be your own girl

baby, you could never look me in the eye
yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around


people running 'round loose in the world
ain't got nothing better to do
make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
you need someone looking after you

i know you really wanna tell me goodbye
i know you really wanna be your own girl

baby, you could never look me in the eye
yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around

stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around

no one looked as i walked by
just an invitation would have been just fine
said no to him again and again
first, he took my heart, then he ran
no one knows how i feel
what i say, unless you read between my lines
one man walked away from me
first he took my hand
take me home

stand back, stand back
in the middle of my room, i did not hear from you
it's alright, it's alright
to be standing in a line (standing in a line)
to be standing in a line
i would cry

la la la la la la la la la
la la
la la la la la

do not turn away my friend
like a willow, i can bend
no man calls my name
no man came
so, i walked on down, away from you
maybe your attention was more than you could do
one man did not call
he asked me for my love, and that was all

stand back, stand back
in the middle of my room, i did not hear from you
it's alright, it's alright
to be standing in a line (standing in a line)
to be standing in a line
i would cry

la la la la la la la la la
la la
la la la la la la la
doo-doo, doo-doo
la la la la la la la la la
la la la la
la la la la la, wo-ah

so, i walked, walked down the line, away from you
maybe your attention was more than i could do
one man did not call
well, he asked me for my love, that was all

stand back, stand back
in the middle of my room, i did not hear from you
it's alright, it's alright
to be standing in a line (standing in a line)
to be standing in a line
i would cry

need a little, need a little sympathy
well, i need a little sympathy (cry)
well, i need a little sympathy
well, you could be standing in (stand back)
well, you could be standing in (stand back)
well, you could be standing in (stand back)
take me home
take me home (stand back)
won't you take me home?
well, i need a little sympathy (stand back)
well, you could be standing in (stand back)
why don't you take me home?
why don't you take me home? (stand back)
take me home (alright)
take me home (alright)

is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
shatter with words impossible to follow
you're saying i'm fragile, try not to be
i search only for something i can't see
i have my own life
and i am stronger than you know

but i carry this feeling
when you walked into my house
that you won't be walking out the door
still i carry this feeling
when you walked into my house
that you won't be walking out the door

lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace

you in the moonlight
with your sleepy eyes
could you ever love a man like me
and you were right
when i walked into your house
i knew i'd never want to leave

sometimes i'm a strong man
sometimes cold and scared
and sometimes i cry
but that time i saw you
i knew with you to light my nights
somehow i'd get by
first time i saw you
i knew with you to light my nights
somehow i would get by

lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace
lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace

you can ride high atop your pony
i know you won't fall
'cause the whole thing's phoney
you can fly, swingin' from your trapeze
scaring all the people
but you never scare me
bella donna
and we fight for the northern star
no speed limit
this is the fast lane
it's just the way that it is here
and you say
"i never thought it could"
bella donna
we fight for the northern star
and the lady's feeling
like the moon that she loved
don't you know that the stars are
a part of us
and the lady's feeling
just like the moon that she loved
and you say
"i never thought it could"
bella donna
come in out of the darkness
you are in love with
and i'm ready to sail
it's just a feeling
sort of captures your soul
bella donna
and the woman may be awestruck
and the woman may truly care
but the woman is so tired
so the woman disappears
come in out of the darkness
bella donna, my soul
don't change, baby, please don't change
and you say
and your face becomes thin
you never thought it could
come in out of the darkness
bella donna
you are a love wind
and i'm ready to sail
it's just a feeling

has anyone ever written anything for you?
in all your darkest hours
have you ever heard me sing?
listen to me now
you know i'd rather be alone
than be without you
don't you know

has anyone ever given anything to you?
in your darkest hours
did you ever give it back?
well i have
i have given that to you
if it's all i ever do
this is your song

and the rain comes down
there's no pain and there's no doubt
it was easy to say
i believed in you everyday
if not for me then
do it for the world

has anyone ever written anything for you?
in your darkest sorrow
did you ever hear me sing?
listen to me now
you know i'd rather be alone
than be without you
don't you know
so, if not for me, then
do it for yourself
if not for me then
do it for the world

i can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
yes, i see your expression when the phone rings
we both know there's something happening here
there's no sense in dancing 'round the subject
a wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
well, don't turn now there's nothing here to fear

you can talk to me
talk to me
you can talk to me
you can set your secrets free, baby

dusty words lying under carpets
seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets
locked inside
hidden deep from view
is it all that hard?
is it all that tough?
well, i've shown you all my cards
well, isn't that enough?
you can hide your hurt
but there's something you can do

you can talk to me
you can talk to me
when you're down now
you can talk to me
t-t-talk to me

though we lay face to face
and cheek to cheek
our voices stray
from the common ground
where they could meet
the walls run high
to veil a swelling tear
(tear, tear, tear)
well, let the walls burn down
set your secret free
you can break their bounds
'cause you're safe with me
you can lose your doubt
'cause you'll find no danger here

you can talk to me
talk to me
when you're down now
you can talk to me
you can set your secrets free, baby

well, i can see
that expression when the phone rings
and i can see
that we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
is it all that hard?
is it all that tough?
well, now you've taken all my dreams
isn't that enough?

well, i can see you, baby
well, i can see you, baby
talk to me, yeah
well, i can see
that expression when the phone rings

somewhere out in the back of your mind (somewhere)
comes your real life and the life that you know
it seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
it seemed to be the only thing left out in the light
she had trusted many...
but been unfamiliar with...
almost everyone but you

well maybe i'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself...
i have known this much longer than i've known you

she had trusted many...
and then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
that she could sense for miles...
she dreamed of her wanton luxury
and she laughed and she cried... and she tried to taunt him
and he hated to be separated...
from that picture... no...

well maybe i'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself...
i have known this much longer than i've known you

long nets of white cloud my memory...
long nets of white cloud my memory...
ooh... there is magic... all around you...
every time you walk in the room...

well maybe i'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself...
i have known this much longer than i've known you
well maybe i'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself...
i have known this much longer than i've known you

something in my heart died last night
just one more chip off an already broken heart
i think the heart broke long ago
that's when i needed you
when i needed you most
that's when i needed you
when i needed you most
i run around like a spirit in flight
fearlessness is fearlessness
i will not forget this night
dare my wild heart
dare my wild heart

where is the reason?
don't blame it on me
blame it on my wild heart
as do the seasons
you fought from the beginning
long before i knew it
there was a danger
and the danger was to fall in love

in dark sorrow, they gaze down into the darkest heart
if i leave you
you say not even you can tear us apart, whoa
say you're leaving
you say you don't even know how to start
how to start, how to start
well, believe it then, and don't blame it on my soul
blame it on my wild heart, ooh
on my wild heart, ooh

fire on fire, rain on my face
fever goes higher, what can you do?
wild in the darkest places in your mind
that's where i needed you (where i needed you)
where i needed you most
that's where i needed you (i needed you)
where i needed you most

where is the reason?
well don't blame it on me
blame it on my wild heart
there is a reason why even the angels don't give it up at all
(blame it on me, blame it on me)
where are the children?
well, are they hopelessly enchanted?
blame it on the angels
(blame it on me, blame it on me)
where are the reasons?
don't blame it on us (blame it on me)
blame it on our wild heart
wild heart, wild heart, wild heart
on my wild heart
on my wild heart

even in the darkest places of your mind
even in the darkest places of your mind
whoa, are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
wild in the darkest places of your mind
darkest places of your mind
no, don't blame it on me, baby
blame it on my wild heart
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
blame it on my wild heart
blame it on my wild heart (baby, baby, baby, baby)
blame it on my wild heart (baby, baby)
blame it on my wild, wild, wild
wild heart
blame it on my wild heart
even in the darkest places of your mind

temptation falls in your path
"no hesitation, why?" you ask
you have another waiting at home

and, yes, she matters to you
kind of woman that'll haunt you
she matters to you
kind of woman that'll haunt you
she matters to you

you didn't mean to meet her you cry
oh, but the sun goes down every night
she came to you when you were alone

and, yes, she matters to you
kind of woman that'll haunt you
oh, kind of woman that'll haunt you
she matters to you

i promised myself a long time ago
no, it would be difficult to let you go
if not at least within
the touch of my fingers
it was close to being
in heaven

kind of woman that'll haunt you
heaven
kind of woman that'll haunt you
to being in heaven
kind of woman that'll haunt you
to be
heaven
i know, i know

do you always trust your first, initial feeling?
special knowledge holds true, bears believing
i turned around and the water was closing all around
like a glove
like the love, that had finally, finally found me
and i knew
in the crystalline knowledge of you
drove me through the mountain
through the crystal-like clear water fountain
drove me like a magnet
to the sea
to the sea
to the sea, yeah

how the faces of love changed turning the pages
and i have changed
oh but you, you remain ageless
i turned around and the water was closing all around
like a glove
like the love
that had finally, finally found me
and i knew
in the crystalline knowledge of you
drove me through the mountain
through the crystal-like clear water fountain
drove me like a magnet
to the sea
to the sea, yeah
to the sea, yeah
yeah, yeah

i turned around and the water was closing around me
i turned around and the water was closing around me
sea
sea
doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo
i turned around and the water was closing around me
ah, ah
ah, ah
oooh, oooh
around me like a glove, around me
ah
around me, all around me
around me
i turned around and the water was closing around me

before you i thought i'd lost
they called the game but not for us
drowned in thought and caught in a stare
talking to ghosts who were not there

then you took my hand
transformation began
commotion where it once was still
fireworks explode
front row tickets to the show
this hand i will never let it go

a crooked trail i've come across
who can know what's meant for us
so if i get caught, what's fair is fair
every single cloud will fall from the air

then you took my hand
transformation began
commotion where it once was still
fireworks explode
front row tickets to the show
this hand i will never let it go
your hand i will never let it go

your hand i will never let it go
your hand i will never let it go
your hand i will never let it go
your hand i will never let it go

i can't wait
how will i love you?
(i can't wait, i can't wait)

sometime she talks to him
sometimes while she's only dreaming
then when she wakes up
somehow, well, she still believes him

yes, i know you
though we've been out of touch
yes, i know you
to be continued, it's too much, well

i can't wait, i can't wait
well, if i'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, well
i can't wait, i can't wait
and i've got to know when i can see you again, well
(i can't wait, i can't wait)
well, yes, i know you
though we've been out of touch
(i can't wait, i can't wait, i can't wait)
what can i do when i'm crazy for you

she wonders how many more hours
her heart will feel broken
in secret she says she needs to see him
but no words are spoken

well, she dances around in a circle
well, she's got that feeling now
blame it on something at first sight
put the blame on me if you want to
to be continued

i can't wait, i can't wait
if i'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, now baby
i can't wait, i can't wait
and i've got to know when i can see you again, well
(i can't wait, i can't wait, i can't wait)
what can i do when i'm crazy for you, baby?
(i can't wait, i can't wait, i can't wait)
if i'm wasting my time, make up your mind, baby

how will i love you?
how will i love you?

i can't wait, i can't wait
if i'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
i can't wait, i can't wait
and i've got to know when i can see you again, well
(i can't wait, i can't wait, i can't wait)
wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
(i can't wait, i can't wait, i can't wait)
how will i love you?
how will i love you?

and the summer became the fall
i was not ready for the winter
it makes no difference at all
'cause i wear boots all summer long
my eye makeup, dark, and it's careless
same circles around my eyes
sometimes the real color of my skin
my eyes, without any shadow

and when i call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
the ones who sing at night
the ones who sing at night
the ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
with their capes pulled around them tight
crying for the night
cry for the nightbird tonight

the winter's really here now
and the blankets that i love
sometimes i am surrounded by too much love

and when i call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
it's the ones who sing at night
it's the ones who sing at night
the ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
with their capes pulled around them tight
crying for the night
cry for the nightbird tonight


and when i call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
it's the ones who sing at night
it's the ones who sing at night
the ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
with their capes pulled around them tight
crying for the night
cry for the nightbird tonight
and when i call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
it's the ones who sing at night
the ones who sing at night

and the darkened eyes, through the net of the lace
in the darkness, it's hard to see her face
pulls back the net
and you feel the touch  of her fingers
and you see she turns the eyes
and you see the eyes of a nightbird
the ones you dream of
finally the night bird
finally the night bird
tonight

when the lights go down in the california town
people are in for the evening
i jump into my car and i throw in my guitar
my heartbeat in time with my breathing
driving over kanan, singing to my soul
there's people out there turning music into gold
ah, my buddy jim bass, he's a-working pumping gas
and he makes two-fifty for an hour
he's got rhythm in his hands as he's tapping on the cans
sings rock and roll in the shower
driving over kanan, singing to his soul
there's people out there turning music into gold
ah, california girls are the greatest in the world
each one a song in the making
singing right to me, i can hear the melody

well i never thought i'd make it
here in hollywood
i never thought i'd ever want to stay
what i seem to touch these days
has turned to gold
what i seem to want
well you know i'll find a way

for me, it's the only life
that i've ever known
and love is only one
fine star away
even though the living
is sometimes laced with lies
it's alright
the feeling remains
even after the glitter fades

the loneliness of a one night stand
is hard to take
we all chase something
and maybe this is a dream
the timeless face of a rock and roll woman
while her heart breaks
oh you know, the dream keeps coming
even when you forget to feel

for me, it's the only life
that i've ever known
and love is only one
fine star away
even though the living
is sometimes laced with lies
it's alright
the feeling remains
even after the glitter fades


for me it's the only life
that i've ever known
and love is only one fine star away
even though the living
is sometimes laced with lies
it's alright
the feeling remains
even after the glitter fades
oh you know the feeling remains
even after the glitter fades
oh the feeling remain
even after the glitter fades

outside the rain
and the heart skips a beat
are you lonely?
creature of the night
it's been almost a week
could you love me only?
look at me, for a very long time
long enough to know
love is a word i've been trying to find
words don't matter
they don't matter at all
so you're still lonely
you say that it's been forever
maybe you never knew me
maybe you thought that
i'd never change
but you know i'm changing
you're wrong
and it's been like dying
no love's that hard to find
and i'm tired of
and i'm tired of trying
and i'm tired of trying
(it's only a dream)
maybe it's only a dream
(it's only a dream)
i don't want to feel that
(it's only a dream)
well it's one more link in the chain, i know
(it's only a dream)
i don't believe that
(it's only a dream)
(it's only a dream)
outside the rain
and the heart skips a beat
so you're lonely
creature of the night
it's been almost a week
would you love me only?
look in my eyes
touch my face
baby, there's no one
that can take my place
look in my eyes
touch my face
baby, there's no one that
can ever replace that heartache
take away that heartache
love is a word that some entertain
if you find it
you have won the game
somebody said
"outside the rain"

i got to sing, i got to dance
