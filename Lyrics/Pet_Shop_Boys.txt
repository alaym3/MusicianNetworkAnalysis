sometimes you're better off dead
there's a gun in your hand, and it's pointing at your head
you think you're mad, too unstable
kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
in a restaurant in a west end town
call the police, there's a madman around
running down underground to a dive bar
in a west end town

in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
west end girls

too many shadows, whispering voices
faces on posters, too many choices
if, when, why, what?
how much have you got?
have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
and which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(how much do you need?)
in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
west end girls
west end girls

(how much do you need?)

in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
ooh, west end town, a dead end world
east end boys, west end girls
west end girls

you've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
just you wait 'til i get you home
we've got no future, we've got no past
here today, built to last
in every city, in every nation
from lake geneva to the finland station
(how far have you been?)
in a west end town, a dead end world
the east end boys and west end girls
a west end town, a dead end world
east end boys, west end girls
west end girls
west end girls

west end girls
(how far have you been?)
girls
east end boys
and west end girls
and west end girls
(...forever)
and west end girls
(how far have you been?)
east end boys
the west end girls
the west end boys
and west end girls
the west end girls
the west end boys
the west end girls 

"twenty seconds and counting
t minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal"

when i look back upon my life
it's always with a sense of shame
i've always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common, too

it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to
it's a sin

at school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
they didn't quite succeed
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common, too
it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to
it's a sin

father, forgive me
i tried not to do it
turned over a new leaf
then tore right through it
whatever you taught me
i didn't believe it
father, you fought me
'cause i didn't care
and i still don't understand

so i look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
i've always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common, too
it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to
it's a sin

it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could

little things i should have said and done
i never took the time

you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine

if i made you feel second best
i'm so sorry i was blind

you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
tell me
tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me
one more chance to keep you satisfied
satisfied


little things i should have said and done
i never took the time

i came across a cache of old photos
and invitations to teenage parties
"dress in white" one said, with quotations
from someone's wife, a famous writer
in the nineteen-twenties

when you're young you find inspiration
in anyone who's ever gone
and opened up a closing door
she said, "we were never feeling bored

'cause we were never being boring
we had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
we dressed up and fought, then thought: "make amends"
and we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end"

when i went i left from the station
with a haversack and some trepidation
someone said, "if you're not careful
you'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
in the nineteen-seventies"
but i sat back and looking forward
my shoes were high and i had scored
i'd bolted through a closing door
i would never find myself feeling bored

'cause we were never being boring
we had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
we dressed up and fought, then thought: "make amends"
and we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end
we were always hoping that, looking back
you could always rely on a friend

now i sit with different faces
in rented rooms and foreign places
all the people i was kissing
some are here and some are missing
in the nineteen-nineties

i never dreamt that i would get to be
the creature that i always meant to be
but i thought in spite of dreams
you'd be sitting somewhere here with me
'cause we were never being boring
we had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
we dressed up and fought, then thought: "make amends"
and we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end
we were always hoping that, looking back
you could always rely on a friend

and we were never being boring
we had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
we dressed up and fought, then thought: "make amends"
and we were never being boring
we were never being bored
'cause we were never being boring
we were never being bored 

lost in the high street, where the dogs run
roaming suburban boys
mother's got her hairdo to be done
she says they're too old for toys
stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
in this suburban hell
and in the distance a police car
to break the suburban spell

let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia

break the window by the town hall
listen, a siren screams
there in the distance like a roll call
of all the suburban dreams

let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
i only wanted something else to do but hang around
i only wanted something else to do but hang around
i only wanted something else to do but hang around
i only wanted something else to do but hang around


it's on the front page of the papers:
"this is their hour of need"
where's a policeman when you need one
to blame the colour tv?

let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia

take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide
in suburbia
in suburbia
in suburbia
in suburbia
in suburbia

(all day, all day)


i don't know why, i don't know how
i thought i loved you, but i'm not sure now
i've seen you look at strangers too many times
the love you want is of a different kind

remember when we felt the sun?
a love like paradise, how hot it burned
a threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
and when you walked, you always turned every head

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
domino dancing
(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)

i thought that when we fought i was to blame
but now i know you play a different game
i've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
add another number to the score

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
domino dancing
(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)

when you look around you wonder
do you play to win?
or are you just a bad loser?


(all day, all day)
(all day, all day)

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)
(all day, all day)
(all day, all day)

i don't know why, i don't know how
i thought i loved you, but i'm not sure now
i hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
and now a storm is breaking within my heart

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
domino dancing
(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)
(all day, all day)
(all day, all day)


(all day, all day)
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)
(all day, all day)
(all day, all day)

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
(domino dancing)
(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day)
domino dancing

(all day, all day)
watch them all fall down
(all day, all day) 

remember those days, the early nineties
we both applied for places at the same university
ended up in london where we needed to be
to follow our obsession with the music scene

wherever we went
whatever we did
we knew the songs

they called us the pop kids
cause we loved the pop hits
and quoted the best bits
so we were the pop kids
i loved you
i loved you
they called us the pop kids

i studied history while you did biology
to you the human body didn't hold any mystery
we were young but imagined we were so sophisticated
telling everyone we knew that rock was overrated
we stayed out 'til late
five nights a week
and felt so chic

they called us the pop kids
cause we loved the pop hits
and quoted the best bits
so we were the pop kids
i loved you
i loved you
they called us the pop kids
the pop kids
the pop kids
the pop kids
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
remember those days?
it was a wet wednesday night
we worried that no one would be going out
how wrong we were
when we turned the corner there was already a queue stretching down the street
we swept straight in and you said

oh, i like it here
oh, i love it
oh, i like it here
oh, i love it
oh, i like it here
oh, i love it
oh, i like it here
oh, i am never going home
i loved you
they called us the pop kids
cause we loved the pop hits
and quoted the best bits
so we were the pop kids
i loved you 

house

i get out of bed at half past ten
phone up a friend who's a party animal
turn on the news and drink some tea
maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

one day i'll read or learn to drive a car
if you pass the test you can beat the rest
but i don't like to compete or talk street, street, street
i can pick up the best from the party animal

i could leave you, say goodbye
or i could love you, if i try
and i could
and left to my own devices, i probably would
left to my own devices, i probably would

pick up a brochure about the sun
learn to ignore what the photographer saw
i was always told that you should join a club
stick with the gang if you want to belong
i was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
in a world of my own at the back of the garden
i didn't want to compete or play out on the street
for in a secret life i was a roundhead general

i could leave you, say goodbye
or i could love you, if i try
and i could
and left to my own devices, i probably would
left to my own devices, i probably would
oh, i would

i was faced with a choice at a difficult age
would i write a book or should i take to the stage?
but in the back of my head i heard distant feet
ché guevara and debussy to a disco beat

it's not a crime when you look the way you do
the way i like to picture you
when i get home it's late at night
i pour a drink and watch the fight
turn off the tv, look at a book
pick up the phone, fix some food
maybe i'll sit up all night and day
waiting for the minute i hear you say

i could leave you, say goodbye
or i could love you, if i try
and i could
and left to my own devices, i probably would

come on, baby, say goodbye
or i could love you, if i try
and i could
and left to my own devices, i probably would
left to my own devices, i probably would
come on, baby
left to my own devices, i probably would


out of bed at half past ten
the party animal phones a friend
picks up news about the sun
and the working day has just begun

sticks with the gang at the back of the street
pass the test and you don't compete

drive the car if you're with me
ché guevara's drinking tea
he reads about a new device
and takes to the stage in a secret life


left to my own devices, i probably would
if i was left to my own devices, i possibly would
if i was left to my own devices, i probably would
if i was left to my own devices, i probably would

i could leave you, say goodbye
or i could love you, if i try
and i could
and left to my own devices, i probably would
left to my own devices, i probably would

come on, baby
left to my own devices, i probably would 

"you dress me up
i'm your puppet
you buy me things
i love it
you bring me food
i need it
you give me love
i feed it"

and look at the two of us in sympathy
with everything we see
i never want anything, it's easy
you buy whatever i need

but look at my hopes, look at my dreams
the currency we've spent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent

you phone me in the evening on hearsay
and bought me caviar
you took me to a restaurant off broadway
to tell me who you are
we never ever argue, we never calculate
the currency we've spent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent

"i'm your puppet
i love it"

and look at the two of us in sympathy
and sometimes ecstasy
words mean so little, and money less
when you're lying next to me

but look at my hopes, look at my dreams
the currency we've spent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent

look at my hopes, look at my dreams
the currency we've spent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent

look at my hopes, look at my dreams
the currency we've spent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent
i love you, you pay my rent

(it's easy, it's so easy)
you pay my rent
(it's easy, it's so easy)
you pay my rent
(it's easy, it's so easy)
i love you
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)
(it's easy, it's so easy)

when the sun doesn't shine
and a boy needs a girl
it's about getting out of a rut
you need luck
but you're stuck and you don't know how

a big bucks hollywood star

a super car to get far
(don't have to live)
a life of power and wealth

a house in beverly hills
(don't have to have)
your daddy paying the bills
(don't have to live)
a life of power and wealth
(don't have to be)
beautiful but it helps
you need more

a gulfstream jet to fly you door to door
somewhere chic on another shore
you need more

a chauffeur driven limousine on call

(don't have to be)
a big bucks hollywood star
(don't have to drive)
a super car to go far
(don't have to live)
a life of power and wealth
(don't have to be)
beautiful but it helps

beautiful but it helps
beautiful but it helps 

you've got me all wrong, i'm not that guy
i'm just the singer of the song in my mind's eye
if i thought what you think, i wouldn't even be here
i've just dropped in for a drink before i disappear

you've got me all wrong, i'm not on your grapevine
when i came along, you were just in my eye-line
i'm not one to stare, i'm not that committed
but i'm always aware of what isn't permitted

autumn is here and they're burning the heather
sheepdogs are running hell for leather
seasons are changing, time's moving along
give me a drink and i'll be gone

you've got me all wrong, there's no one i'm missing
i'm quite happy to be alone, there are no lips i'm kissing
the truth must be the truth, unvarnished in its telling
otherwise it's just hype
you hope people won't notice you're peddling

autumn is here and they're burning the heather
sheepdogs are running hell for leather
seasons are changing, time's moving along
give me a drink and i'll be gone
where did i come from?
where do i go?
time is so heartless
you don't want to know

i set out in the dark, waking from a nightmare
hoping i could find the middle of nowhere
i'm a stranger in this town, but that's as far as it goes
and where i am bound, no one knows

autumn is here and they're burning the heather
sheepdogs are running hell for leather
seasons are changing, time's moving along
give me a drink and i'll be gone

you've got me all wrong, that's what i'm sensing
i'm not one of those bread-heads
always pounds, shillings, and pence-ing
there's a few things i need, but i've money for paying
and if you've enough room, i'll consider staying 

i've been taking my time for a long time
putting my feet up a lot
speaking english as a foreign language
any words that i haven't forgot
i've been thinking how i can't be bothered
to wash the dishes or remake the bed
what's the point when i could doss instead?

i've been hanging out with various riff-raff
somewhere on the goldhawk road
i don't think it's gonna be much longer
'til i'm mugging up on the penal code
love is a bourgeois construct
so i've given up the bourgeoisie
like all their aspirations, it's a fantasy

when you walked out you did me a favour
you made me see reality
that love is a bourgeois construct
it's a blatant fallacy
you won't see me with a bunch of roses
promising fidelity
love doesn't mean a thing to me
talking tough and feeling bitter
but better now it's clear to me
that love is a bourgeois construct
so i've given up the bourgeoisie

while the bankers all get their bonuses
i'll just get along with what i've got
watching the weeds in the garden
putting my feet up a lot
i'll explore the outer limits of boredom
moaning periodically
just a full-time lonely layabout, that's me

when you walked out you did me a favour
it's absolutely clear to me
that love is a bourgeois construct
just like they said at university
i'll be taking my time for a long time
with all the schadenfreude it's cost
calculating what you've lost

now i'm digging through my student paperbacks
flicking through karl marx again
searching for the soul of england
drinking tea like tony benn
love is just a bourgeois construct
so i'm giving up the bourgeoisie
until you come back to me
talking tough and feeling bitter
but better now it's clear to me
that love is a bourgeois construct
so i've given up the bourgeoisie 

i heard there's a dreamland
in another world far away
they say it's a free land
and they welcome everyone to stay
you got to take me
you got to make me
remember how to dream today
i'm so tired of my homeland
when i fall asleep, you lead the way

dreamland, i iove you
i dream of you all night and day
dreamland, i need you
i close my eyes and you lead the way
dreamland (hey, hey)
dreamland (hey, hey)

we're falling for pleasure
in a garden where the sun still shines
and staying forever
leaving all our worries behind
it's a kind of amnesia
where all problems seem to disappear
and you don't need a visa
you can come and go and still be here
dreamland, i iove you
i dream of you all night and day
dreamland, i need you
i close my eyes and you lead the way
dreamland, i love you
dreamland (hey)

dreamland is a free land
kiss me, hold me, take my hand
sleep is a river
that leads us to a better land
dreamland

i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up (dreamland)
i don't wanna wake up
dreamland is a free land
kiss me, hold me, take my hand
sleep is a river
that leads us to a better land

dreamland, i iove you
i dream of you all night and day
dreamland, i need you
i close my eyes and you lead the way
dreamland, i love you
i dream of you all night and day
dreamland, i need you
i close my eyes and you lead the way
dreamland 

i've had enough of scheming
and messing around with jerks
my car is parked outside
i'm afraid it doesn't work
i'm looking for a partner
someone who gets things fixed
ask yourself this question:
do you want to be rich?

i've got the brains, you've got the looks
let's make lots of money
you've got the brawn, i've got the brains
let's make lots of money

you have got the brawn, you got the brains
you want money

you can tell i'm educated
i studied at the sorbonne
doctored in mathematics
i could have been a don
i can program a computer
choose the perfect time
if you've got the inclination
i have got the crime
oh, there's a lot of opportunities
if you know when to take them
you know, there's a lot of opportunities
if there aren't, you can make them

i've got the brains, you've got the looks
let's make lots of money
you've got the brawn, i've got the brains
let's make lots of money
let's make lots of... money


money
(money...)

you can see i'm single-minded
i know what i could be
how'd you feel about it?
come and take a walk with me
i'm looking for a partner
regardless of expense
think about it seriously
you know it makes sense
let's make
(got the brains, got the looks)
let's make lots of money
(money)
(let's make)
you've got the brawn, i've got the brains
(ooh)
let's make lots of money
(money)

i've got the brains, you've got the looks
(got the brains, got the looks)
let's make lots of money
(ooh money)

money
"all the love that we had
and the love that we hide
who will bury us
when we die?" 

i see you after many years
on an elevated train
rattling above the streets of a city
where men don't wait in vain
i think, my, you may have changed
but you're such a handsome thing
do you still hang around that old arcade
to see what luck will bring?

(will of the wisp)
the u1 is such a party train
(will-o-the-wisp)
from uhland to warschauerstraße
(will-o-the-wisp)
emerging from below past nollendorfplatz
(will-o-the-wisp)
in search of love and laughter
(will-o-the-wisp)

oh (will-o-the-wisp)
oh (will-o-the-wisp)
oh (will-o-the-wisp)
oh
you were always such a free spirit
a bright-eyed eager chap
a will-o-the-wisp and charming with it
in your battered leather cap
(will-o-the-wisp)
but maybe you've gone respectable
with a wife and job and all that
working for the local government
and living in a rented flat?

(will-o-the-wisp)
the u1 is such a party train
(will-o-the-wisp)
from uhland to warschauerstraße
(will-o-the-wisp)
emerging from below past nollendorfplatz
(will-o-the-wisp)
in search of love and laughter
(will-o-the-wisp)

and you, my former will-o-the-wisp
will you recognize me today?
give me a smile for old time's sake
before you run away
(will-o-the-wisp)
you were always such a free spirit
(will-o-the-wisp)
aren't you getting bored?
(will-o-the-wisp)
a will-o-the-wisp and charming with it
(will-o-the-wisp)
who loved to be adored
(will-o-the-wisp)
the u1 is such a party train
(will-o-the-wisp)
from uhland to warschauerstraße
(will-o-the-wisp)
emerging from below past nollendorfplatz
(will-o-the-wisp)
in search of love and laughter
(will-o-the-wisp)
you were always such a free spirit
(will-o-the-wisp)
who came and went so much
(will-o-the-wisp)
a will-o-the-wisp and charming with it
i'm still longing for your touch
(will-o-the-wisp)
