i got a feeling called the blues, oh lord
since my baby said goodbye
lord, i don't know what i'll do
all i do is sat and sigh, "oh lord"
the last long day she said goodbye
well, lord, i thought i would cry
she'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
lord, i love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
such a beautiful dream
i hate to think it's all over; i've lost my heart it seems
i've grown so used to you somehow
but i'm nobody's sugar daddy now
and i'm lonesome, i got the lovesick blues

well i'm in love, i'm in love with a beautiful gal
that's what's the matter with me
well i'm in love, i'm in love with a beautiful gal
but she don't care about me
lord, i tried and i tried to keep her satisfied
but she just wouldn't stay
so now that she is leaving this is all i can say

i got a feeling called the blues oh lord
since my baby said goodbye
lord, i don't know what i'll do
all i do is sat and sigh, "oh lord"
the last long day she said goodbye
well, lord, i thought i would cry
she'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
lord, i love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
such a beautiful dream
i hate to think it's all over; i've lost my heart it seems
i've grown so used to you somehow
but i'm nobody's sugar daddy now
and i'm lonesome, i got the lovesick blues

i wandered so aimless life filled with sin
i wouldn't let my dear savior in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
praise the lord i saw the light

i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light

just like a blind man i wandered along
worries and fears i claimed for my own
then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
praise the lord i saw the light

i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light

i was a fool to wander and a-stray
straight is the gate and narrow the way
now i have traded the wrong for the right
praise the lord i saw the light

i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light

hear that lonesome whippoorwill
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
i'm so lonesome i could cry

i've never seen a night so long
when time goes crawling by
the moon just went behind the clouds
to hide its face and cry

did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves begin to die?
like me, he's lost the will to live
i'm so lonesome i could cry

the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as i wonder where you are
i'm so lonesome i could cry

your cheatin' heart will make you weep
you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
but sleep won't come the whole night through
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

when tears come down like falling rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you'll walk the floor the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

your cheatin' heart will pine someday
and crave the love you threw away
the time will come when you'll be blue
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

when tears come down like falling rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you'll walk the floor the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

precious lord, take my hand
lead me on
let me stand
i'm tired, i am weak i am worn
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand precious lord, lead me home

when my way grows drear precious lord linger near
when my life is almost gone
hear my cry
hear my call
hold my hand lest i fall
take my hand precious lord, lead me home

when the darkness appears and the night draws near
and the day is past and gone
at the river i stand
guide my feet
hold my hand
take my hand precious lord, lead me home

precious lord, take my hand
lead me on
let me stand
i am tired, i am weak, i am worn
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand precious lord, lead me home

i'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
for a life of sin, i have paid the cost
when i pass by, all the people say
"just another boy down the lost highway"

just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
and a woman's lies make a life like mine
oh, the day we met, i went astray
i started rollin' down that lost highway

i was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
and now i'm lost, too late to pray
lord, i've paid the cost on the lost highway

now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
on this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
take my advice or you'll curse the day
you started rollin' down that lost highway

kaw-liga was a wooden indian standing by the door
he fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store
kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show
so she could never answer "yes" or "no"
he always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
the maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
kaw-liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign
because his heart is made of knotty pine
poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss
poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed
is it any wonder, that his face is red?
kaw-liga, that poor old wooden head
kaw-liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere
his heart was set on the indian maiden with the coal black hair
kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show
so she could never answer "yes" or "no"
and then one day, a wealthy customer bought the indian maid
and took her, oh, so far away but old kaw-liga stayed
kaw-liga just stands there as lonely as can be
and wishes he was still an old pine tree
poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss
poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed
is it any wonder, that his face is red?
kaw-liga, that poor old wooden head

comb your hair and paint and powder
you act proud and i'll act prouder
you sing loud and i'll sing louder
tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
you're my gal and i'm your feller
dress up in your frock of yeller
i'll look swell but you'll look sweller
settin' the woods on fire
we'll take in all the honky tonks
tonight we're having fun
we'll show the folks a brand new dance
that never has been done
i don't care who thinks we're silly
you'll be daffy i'll be dilly
we'll order up two bowls of chili
settin' the woods on fire
i'll gas up my hot rod stoker
we'll get hotter than a poker
you'll be broke but i'll be broker
tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
we'll sit close to one another
up one street and down the other
we'll have a time, oh brother
settin' the woods on fire
we'll put aside a little time
to fix a flat or two
my tires and tubes are doin' fine
but the air is showin' through
you clap hands and i'll start bowin'
we'll do all the law's allowin'
tomorrow i'll be right back plowin'
settin' the woods on fire

i tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
yet you're afraid each thing i do is just some evil scheme
a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
why can't i free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
and so my heart is paying now for things i didn't do
in anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
why can't i free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
you'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
you know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
why can't i free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
there was a time when i believed that you belonged to me
but now i know your heart is shackled to a memory
the more i learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
why can't i free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

i went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
but i got to the river so lonesome i wanted to die, oh lord
and then i jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry
she's long gone, and now i'm lonesome blue
i had me a woman who couldn't be true
she made me for my money and she made me blue
a man needs a woman that he can lean on
but my leanin' post is done left and gone
she's long gone, and now i'm lonesome blue
i'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice
and when i find me that river, lord i'm gonna pay the price, oh lord
i'm goin' down in it three times, but lord i'm only comin' up twice
she's long gone, and now i'm lonesome blue
she told me on sunday she was checkin' me out
long about monday she was nowhere about
and here it is tuesday, ain't had no news
i got them gone but not forgotten blues
she's long gone, and now i'm lonesome blue

i can settle down and be doin' just fine
'til i hear an old train rollin' down the line
then i hurry straight home and pack
and if i didn't go, i believe i'd blow my stack
i love you baby, but you gotta understand
when the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man
some folks might say that i'm no good
that i wouldn't settle down if i could
but when that open road starts to callin' me
there's somethin' o'er the hill that i gotta see
sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
when the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man
i love to see the towns a-passin' by
and to ride these rails 'neath god's blue sky
let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
cause that's the life i believe, he meant for me
and when i'm gone and at my grave you stand
just say god's called home your ramblin' man

there's a place near to me, where i'm longing to be
with my friends at the old country church
there with mother we went and our sundays we spent
with our friends at the old country church
precious years of memories
oh, what joy they bring to me
how i long once more to be
with my friends at the old country church
how i wish that today all the people would pray
like we prayed in that old country church
if they'd only confess, jesus surely would bless
as he did in that old country church
precious years of memories
oh, what joy they bring to me
how i long once more to be
with my friends at the old country church

the news is out all over town
that you've been seen a-runnin' 'round
i know that i should leave, but then
i just can't go, you win again

this heart of mine could never see
what everybody knew but me
just trusting you was my great sin
what can i do? you win again

i'm sorry for your victim now
'cause soon his head like mine will bow
he'll give his heart but all in vain
and someday say you win again

you have no heart, you have no shame
you take true love and give the blame
i guess that i should not complain
i love you, still you win again

all day i've faced the barren waste
with out the taste of water... cool, water
ole dan and i, with throats burned dry
and souls that cry
for water... cool, clear water
the nights are cool and i'm a fool
each star's a pool of water... cool, clear water
and with the dawn i'll wake and yawn
and carry on
to water... cool, clear water
the shadows sway and seem to say
tonight we pray for water.... cool, clear water
and way up there he'll hear our prayer
and show us where
there's water... cool, clear water
keep a-movin' dan. don't you listen to him dan
he's the devil, not a man
he spreads the burnin' sand with water
say dan can't you see that big green tree
where the water's runnin' free
it's waiting there for you and me
and water.... cool, clear water
dan's feet are sore he's yearnin' for
just one thing more than water.... cool, clear water
like me i guess he'd like to rest
where there's no quest
for water... cool, clear water

we met in the springtime
when blossoms unfold
the pastures were green
and the meadows were gold

our love was in flower
as summer grew on
her love, like the leaves
now has withered and gone

the roses have faded
there's frost at my door
the birds in the morning
don't sing anymore

the grass in the valley
is starting to die
and out in the darkness
the whip-poor-wills cry

alone and forsaken
by fate and by man
oh, lord if you hear me
please hold my hand
oh, please understand

oh, where has she gone to
oh, where can she be?
she may have forsaken
some other like me

she promised to honor
to love and obey
each vow was a plaything
that she threw away

the darkness is falling
the sky has turned gray
a hound in the distance
is starting to bay

i wonder, i wonder
what she's thinking of?
forsaken, forgotten
without any love

people steal, they cheat and lie
for wealth and what it will buy
don't they know on the judgement day
that their gold and silver will melt away

i'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
and know that my poor soul was saved
than to live in this world in a house of gold
and deny my god and doom my soul

jesus said, come on to me
i'll break sin's chains and set you free
i'll carry you to a home on high
where you'll never, never die

what good is gold and silver, too
when your heart's not good and true
sinner hear me when i say
fall down on your knees and pray

jesus died there on the cross
so this world would not be lost
sinner hear now what i say
for someday you'll have to pay

what good is gold and silver too
if your heart's not good and true
sinner, hear me when i say
fall down on your knees and pray
