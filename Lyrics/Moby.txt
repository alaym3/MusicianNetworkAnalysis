hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

when i wake i'm going out of my mind
going out of my mind

hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

extreme ways are back again
extreme places i didn't know
i broke everything new again
everything that i'd owned
i threw it out the window, came along
extreme ways i know will part
the colors of my sea
some perfect colored me
extreme ways that help me
they help me out late at night
extreme places i had gone
that never seen any light
dirty basements, dirty noise
dirty places coming through
extreme worlds alone
did you ever like it then?

i would stand in line for this
there's always room in life for this

oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
like it always does, always does

extreme sounds that told me
they held me down every night
i didn't have much to say
i didn't give up the light
i closed my eyes and closed myself
and closed my world and never open up to anything
that could cut me at all
i had to close down everything
i had to close down my mind
too many things could cut me
too much can make me blind
i've seen so much in so many places
so many heartaches, so many faces
so many dirty things
you couldn't even believe

i would stand in line for this
there's always room in life for this

oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
like it always does, always does

where were you when i was lonesome?
locked away with freezing cold
someone flying only stolen
i can't tell this light so old

i don't want to swim the ocean
i don't want to fight the tide
i don't want to swim forever
when it's cold i'd like to die

what was that my sweet sweet nothing?
i can't hear you through the fog
if i holler let me go
if i falter let me know

i don't want to swim the ocean
i don't want to fight the tide
i don't want to swim forever
when it's cold i'd like to die
i don't want to swim the ocean
i don't want to fight the tide
i don't want to swim forever
when it's cold i'd like to die

i don't want to swim the ocean
i don't want to figh the tide

apportioned like madness in season
bracing all like a breaking of reason
with every night lost and every day torn
with a drama feeling calmer and it's a comma in the storm
speakers are crying like a forest in the rain
i was so alone with my thoughts and my pain
and the darkness closed like a mouth on a wire
and night, i'll never be free

ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way
ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way

i can't stand on my own anymore
i can't stand in the stain of the broken and poor
i can't break what i held and it never was true
in the mirror what i said was a lie to you
and me and everything i see and everything i could
tried so hard to be good
for myself, for you, for the hidden and divine
for everything but i can fail just so many times

ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way
ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way

i can't stop when i feel like stopping
at 5 a.m. just cry, shoot, copping
a perfect life was enough for you
and ever enough to see me through
for all my lies that were spoken in ways
and the way we lived as an affront to the days
it was an affront to the things that we cared about
an affront to everything that we cared about

ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way
ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way
ooh, in this darkness
please light my way
light my way
oooh

sometimes i feel like a motherless child
sometimes i feel like a motherless child
sometimes i feel like a motherless child
so far from home

this was life and this was safer
all was strange and always stranger
a latent hate but so much later
i'm never safe from all this danger
the demon's eyes and demon satyr
i was bait but what would bait her?
don't know my needs, don't know my ways, sir
i hide my face, no way to face her
this was loss, this was name
this was my truth, this was no game
this was not hope, this was not sane
and from these broken places made
that was loss and this was later
i wanted less but nothing greater
i couldn't leave, i couldn't stay, sir
like a motherless child

sometimes i feel like a motherless child

where the sun done gone

he was searching
blindly night and day
this life, there must be more
breaking beauty, just to stay awake
his heart was like a stone
ooh, ooh, his heart was like a stone

and on the last day
he walked out in the sun
he only just discovered the sun
on the last day
and on the last day
when all his work was done
he only just discovered the sun
on the last day

all this rapture
right here all along
in scraps he tore away
all this color
in his final breath
exhaled dark and grey
ooh, ooh, exhaled dark and grey

and on the last day
he walked out in the sun
he only just discovered the sun
on the last day
and on the last day

caution cities
raised by no one
caution waits, we never find hope
caution lifts, we did this wrong
caution has the way and i don't feel this anymore

caution for the world you said was over
caution where we were
caution where we were
o-o-oh

for a long time we stayed down
and all we said was sleep alone
watch the city fall, the skies so low
watch the sunlight, watch it go
watch the storm rise
watch the storm fall
watch the storm rise
and watch the storm fall
