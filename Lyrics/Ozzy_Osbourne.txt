all aboard! ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!
ay (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)

crazy, but that's how it goes
millions of people living as foes
maybe it's not too late
to learn how to love and forget how to hate

mental wounds not healing
life's a bitter shame

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(let's go!)

i've listened to preachers, i've listened to fools
i've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
one person conditioned to rule and control
the media sells it and you live the role

mental wounds still screaming
driving me insane

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

i know that things are going wrong for me
you gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah!


heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
inheriting troubles, i'm mentally numb
crazy, i just cannot bear
i'm living with something that just isn't fair

mental wounds not healing
who and what's to blame?

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

mr. crowley, what went on in your head?
oh, mr. crowley, did you talk to the dead?
your life style to me, seemed so tragic
with the thrill of it all
you fooled all the people with magic
yeah, you waited on satan's call

mr. charming, did you think you were pure?
mr. alarming, in nocturnal rapport
uncovering things that were sacred
manifest on this earth
conceived in the eye of a secret
and they scattered the afterbirth


mr. crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
mr. crowley, it's symbolic, of course
approaching a time that is classic
i hear that maiden's call
approaching a time that is drastic
standing with their backs to the wall


was it polemically sent?
i wanna know what you meant
i wanna know, i wanna know what you meant, yeah

i was unprepared for fame then everybody knew my name
no more lonely nights, it's all for you
i have traveled many miles, i've seen tears and i've seen smiles
just remember that it's all for you

don't forget me as the colours fade
when the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
okay

yes, i've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
and the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man
i've made mama cry, don't know why i'm still alive
yes, the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man

many times, i lost control, they tried to kill my rock 'n' roll
just remember i'm still here for you
i don't wanna say goodbye, when i do, you'll be alright
after all, i did it all for you

don't forget me as the colours fade
when the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
okay

yes, i've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
and the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man
i've made mama cry, don't know why i'm still alive
yes, the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man


yes, i've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
and the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man
i've made mama cry, don't know why i'm still alive
yes, the truth is i don't wanna die an ordinary man

times have changed and times are strange
here i come, but i ain't the same
mama, i'm coming home
time's gone by, it seems to be
you could have been a better friend to me
mama, i'm coming home

you took me in and you drove me out
yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
lost and found and turned around
by the fire in your eyes

you made me cry, you told me lies
but i can't stand to say goodbye
mama, i'm coming home
i could be right, i could be wrong
it hurts so bad, it's been so long
mama, i'm coming home

selfish love, yeah we're both alone
the ride before the fall, yeah
but i'm gonna take this heart of stone
i've just got to have it all

i've seen your face a hundred times
every day we've been apart
i don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'cause mama, mama, i'm coming home
i'm coming home


you took me in and you drove me out
yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
lost and found and turned around
by the fire in your eyes

i've seen your face a thousand times
every day we've been apart
i don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'cause mama, mama i'm coming home
i'm coming home
i'm coming home
i'm coming home

today, i woke up and i hate myself
death doesn't answer when i cry for help
no high could save me from the depths of hell
i'll drown my mind until i'm someone else

don't take care of me, be scared of me
my misery owns me
i don't wanna be my enemy
my misery owns me now

under the graveyard
we're all rotting bones
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
everything you are
can't take it when you go
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
i ain't livin' this lie no more
ain't livin' this lie no more
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
it's cold in the graveyard
we all die alone

cover my eyes so i can't see clear
one sip away from everything i fear
ashes to ashes, watch me disappear
closer to home because the end is near

don't take care of me, be scared of me
my misery owns me
i don't wanna be my enemy
my misery owns me now

under the graveyard
we're all rotting bones
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
everything you are
can't take it when you go
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
i ain't livin' this lie no more
ain't livin' this lie no more
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
it's cold in the graveyard
we all die alone

(i'm waiting for you)
(you, you, you, you)

under the graveyard
we're all rotting bones
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
everything you are
can't take it when you go
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
i ain't livin' this lie no more
ain't livin' this lie no more
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
it's cold in the graveyard
we all die alone
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

gazing through the window at the world outside
wondering will mother earth survive
hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
after all there's only just the two of us
and here we are still fighting for our lives
watching all of history repeat itself time after time

i'm just a dreamer, i dream my life away
i'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

i watch the sun go down like everyone of us
i'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
a better place for those who will come after us this time

i'm just a dreamer, i dream my life away, oh yeah
i'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

your higher power may be god or jesus christ
it doesn't really matter much to me
without each other's help there ain't no hope for us
i'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah, yeah, yeah


if only we could all just find serenity
it would be nice if we could live as one
when will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

i'm just a dreamer, i dream my life away, today
i'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days, okay
i'm just a dreamer who's searching for the way, today
i'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

the light in the window is a crack in the sky
a stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
a levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
the man in the dark will bring another attack
your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger? yeah

no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)

another day passes as the night closes in
the red light goes on to say it's time to begin
i see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
i close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)

going forward in reverse
still, these were our first
it's just a hand in the bush
a hand in the bush


so now that it's over can't we just say goodbye?
i'd like to move on and make the most of the night
maybe a kiss before i leave you this way
your lips are so cold, i don't know what else to say
i never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
believe me when i say to you in love i think i'm falling here

no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)
no more tears (tears, tears)

it's just a hand in the bush
(in the bush, in the bush, in the bush)

wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle and drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows
evil thoughts and evil doings
cold, alone you hang in ruins
thought that you'd escape the reaper
you can't escape the master keeper

'cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
what you saw can be hell on this earth, hell on this earth

now you live inside a bottle
the reaper's traveling at full throttle
it's catching you but you don't see
the reaper's you and the reaper is me

breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
where to hide, suicide is the only way out
don't you know what it's really about

ah, now people, you really know where it's at
ah, ah you got it, fox
get the flaps out, satan, satan, satan, ha ha ha

wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle, drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows
take me away, oh, oh, tomorrow
it's never gettin' fixed, no flaps, nobody, no flaps, nothing?

it's a raid
oh, no
hide everything

i hear them breathing on my telephone
i know i'm never alone
i been to places you should never go
god's really satan and he's waiting for you out there

hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days
i'm never coming out (woo, woo)
wide awake, i feel my heart accelerate
i'm never coming down (woo, woo)
mama said, "you can't kill what's already dead"
and all the feds are waiting for me somewhere
hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days
i'm never coming out (woo, woo)
everybody wants me, everybody wants me

outside my window, there's a silhouette
my rifle's right beside my bed
hold on, i'm runnin' out of cigarettes
fuck

hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days
i'm never coming out (woo, woo) (woah)
wide awake, i feel my heart accelerate
i'm never coming down (woo, woo) (down)
mama said, "you can't kill what's already dead"
and all the feds are waiting for me somewhere
hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days
i'm never coming out (woo, woo)
everybody wants me, everybody wants me

(i've been locked)
you're missing your fucking head (yeah)
everything i am (everything i am)
everything i want to be (louder)
everything i am (get louder)
won't you come along with me? (come along with me)
attack
(yeah)
i want to see you go fucking animal (like a grade-a psycho)
go fucking crazy, hahaha (woah)
woah, who fuckin' is this?
knew it was fuckin' motherfuckers
it's a raid

hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days
i'm never coming out (woo, woo)
wide awake, i feel my heart accelerate
i'm never coming down (woo, woo)
mama said, "you can't kill what's already dead"
and all the feds are waiting for me somewhere
hideaway, i've been locked up for seven days (seven days)
i'm never coming out (shit)

i see the police, shit
don't pull that fifty fuckin' round, fuckin' dodge
get out and fuckin' run
run, run, run, run, run, run
attack
it's a raid, everybody out
fire (woah)
fuck you all

screams break the silence
waking from the dead of night
vengeance is boiling
he's returned to kill the light

then when he's found who he's looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
ha ha ha ha ha

years spent in torment
buried in a nameless grave
now he has risen
miracles would have to save

those that the beast is looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon

they cursed and buried him along with shame
and thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
in empty burning hell - unholy one
but he's returned to prove them wrong (so wrong)
ooh, yeah baby


howling in shadows
living in a lunar spell
he finds his heaven
spewing from the mouth of hell

those that the beast is looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon
oh oh yeah, bark at the moon

out on the streets i'm stalking the night
i can hear my heavy breathing
paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
something there i can't believe in
voices are calling from inside my head
i can hear them, i can hear them
vanishing memories of things that were said
they can't try to hurt me now

but a shot in the dark
one step away from you
just a shot in the dark
always creeping up on you
all right

taught by the powers that preach over me
i can hear their empty reasons
i wouldn't listen, i learned how to fight
i opened up my mind to treason
but just like the wounded, and when it's too late
they'll remember, they'll surrender
never a care for the people who hate
underestimate me now

but a shot in the dark
one step away from you
just a shot in the dark
nothing that you can do
just a shot in the dark
always creeping up on you
all right

but just like the wounded, and when it's too late
they'll remember, they'll surrender
never a care for the people who hate
underestimate me now

but a shot in the dark
one step away from you
just a shot in the dark
nothing that you can do
just a shot in the dark
always creeping up on you
all right

just a shot in the dark 

ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah, ah
alright now
come on now

you're flying higher than a kite tonight
you've took the hit and now you feel alright
your dance be dead so we must celebrate
i'll make you scream, i'll make you defecate

straight to hell tonight
we're going straight to hell
straight to hell tonight

i'll make you lie, i'll make you steal and kill
i'll make you crawl until your final thrill
enjoy the ride, i'll plant my bitter seed
you'll kill yourself and i will watch you bleed

straight to hell tonight
we're going straight to hell
straight to hell tonight
ah, ah, ah
straight to hell tonight
ah, ah, ah
we're going straight to hell
straight to hell tonight

ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah, ah
something is missing
and you don't know why
deeper in the darkness you will hide

alright now
alright now

ah, ah, ah
straight to hell tonight
ah, ah, ah
we're going straight to hell
straight to hell tonight
ah, ah, ah
straight to hell tonight
we're going straight to hell
straight to hell tonight

screaming at the window
watch me die another day
hopeless situation
endless price i have to pay

sanity, now it's beyond me
there's no choice

diary of a madman
walk the line again today
entries of confusion
dear diary, i'm here to stay

manic depression befriends me
hear his voice
sanity, now it's beyond me
there's no choice


a sickened mind and spirit
the mirror tells me lies
could i mistake myself for someone
who lives behind my eyes?
will he escape my soul
or will he live in me?
is he trying to get out
or trying to enter me?


voices in the darkness
scream away my mental health
can i ask a question
to help me save me from myself?

enemies fill up the pages
are they me?
monday till sunday in stages
set me free, oh

there are no unlockable doors
there are no unwinnable wars
there are no unrightable wrongs
or unsingable songs
there are no unbeatable odds
there are no believable gods
there are no unnameable names
shall i say it again, yeah
there are no impossible dreams
there are no invisible seams
each night when day is through
i don't ask much

i just want you 

there are no uncriminal crimes
there are no unrhymable rhymes
there are no identical twins
or forgivable sins
there are no incurable ills
there are no unkillable thrills
one thing and you know it's true
i don't ask much


i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
i used to go to bed so high and wired
yeah - yeah, yeah, yeah
i think i'll buy myself some plastic water
i guess i should have married lennon's daughter
yeah - yeah, yeah, yeah
there are no unachievable goals
there are no unsaveable souls
no legitimate kings or queens
do you know what i mean? yeah
there are no undisputable truths
and there ain't no fountain of youth
each night when day is through
i don't ask much


yeah, yeah, yeah
i just want you 
hey, yeah
i just want you
yeah, yeah, yeah
i just want you
hey
i just want you 

oh no, oh no
here we go now
oh no, oh now
here we go now

got a crazy feeling i don't understand
got to get away from here
feeling like i should have kept my feet on the ground
waiting for the sun to appear

mamma's going to worry
i've been a bad, bad boy
no use saying sorry
it's something that i enjoy

because you can't see what my eyes see
(i can see it, i can see it)
and you can't be inside of me
flying high again
i can see through mountains, watch me disappear
i can even touch the sky
swallowing colours of the sound i hear
am i just a crazy guy (you bet)

mamma's going to worry
i've been a bad, bad boy
no use saying sorry
it's something that i enjoy

if you could be inside my head
you'd see that black and white is red
flying high again
flying high again
flying high again
flying high again
come on and join me

flying high again
flying high again
flying high again
flying high again
come on and join me

oh no, oh no
here we go now
oh no, oh now
here we go now

daddy thinks i'm lazy he don't understand
never saw inside my head
people think i'm crazy but i'm in demand
never heard a thing i said

mamma's going to worry
i've been a bad, bad boy
no use saying sorry
it's something that i enjoy

flying high again
flying high again
flying high again
flying high again

yesterday has been and gone
tomorrow will i find the sun or will it rain?
everybody's having fun except me, i'm the lonely one
i live in shame

i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

i've been the king, i've been the clown
now, broken wings can't hold me down
i'm free again
the jester with the broken crown
it won't be me, this time around, to love in vain

i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

and i feel the time is right, although i know
that you just might say to me:
"what you gonna do
what you gonna do"
but i have to take this chance
goodbye to friends and to romance
and to all of you
and to all of you
come on, now


i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

and the weather's lookin' fine and i think the sun
will shine again
and i feel i've cleared my mind
all the past is left behind again

i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

i'm living on an endless road
around the world for rock and roll
sometimes it feels so tough
but i still ain't had enough
i keep saying that it's getting too much
but i know i'm a liar

feeling all right in the noise and the light
but that's what lights my fire

hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
hellraiser, and i'll make it come true
hellraiser, i'll put a spell on you

walking out on another stage
another town, another place
sometimes i don't feel right
nerves wound up too damn tight
people keep telling me it's bad for my health
but kicking back don't make it

out of control, i play the ultimate role
but that's what lights my fire

hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
hellraiser, and i'll make it come true
hellraiser, i'll put a spell on you


i'm living on an endless road
around the world for rock and roll

hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
hellraiser, and i'll make it come true
hellraiser, i'll put a spell on you

over the mountain, take me across the sky
something in my vision, something deep inside
where did i wander, where do you think i wandered to
i've seen life's magic astral plane i travel through

i heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
i told them i had ridden shooting stars
and said i'd show them how

over and over, always tried to get away
living in a daydream, only place i had to stay
fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
people around me talking to the walls inside

i heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
i told them i had ridden shooting stars
and said i'd show them how

don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me
you don't need a ticket to fly with me, i'm free, yeah

over and under, in between the ups and downs
mind on a carpet, magic ride goes around and round
over the mountain, kissing silver inlaid clouds
watching my body disappear into the crowd

don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me
you don't need a ticket to fly with me, i'm free, yeah

people look to me and say
is the end near, when is the final day
what's the future of mankind
how do i know, i got left behind

everyone goes through changes
looking to find the truth
don't look to me for answers
don't ask me, i don't know (know...)

how am i supposed to know
hidden meanings that will never show
fools and prophets from the past
life's a stage and we're all in the cast

ya gotta believe in someone
asking me who is right
asking me who to follow
don't ask me, i don't know (know)
i don't know, i don't know (know), i don't know

nobody ever told me i found out for myself
ya gotta believe in foolish miracles
it's not how you play the game
it's if you win or lose you can choose
don't confuse win or lose, it's up to you
it's up to you, it's up to you, it's up to you
go, go, go


people look to me and say
is the end near, when is the final day
what's the future of mankind
how do i know, i got left behind, i'm lost

everyone goes through changes
looking to find the truth
don't look to me for answers
don't ask me, i don't know

their colours are blinding me again (i don't belong here)
the skyline is bleeding black and red (how did they get here?)
how long, how long have they been living in my head?
how long, how long? we bite our tongues and play pretend

they want us, they need us
they might just try to eat us
they'll greet us, deceive us
say, "take us to your leader"

everybody wants them until we meet them
everybody wants them, it's the end
scary little green men, do you believe in
scary little green men? it's the end

they're hiding amongst us everywhere (they don't belong here)
they're silent, they may be violent, i don't care (i don't belong here)
how long, how long have they been living in my head?
how long, how long? we bite our tongues and play pretend

they want us, they need us
they might just try to eat us
they'll greet us, deceive us
say, "take us to your leader"

everybody wants them until we meet them
everybody wants them, it's the end
scary little green men, do you believe in
scary little green men? it's the end

men on the moon, won't you tell us the truth?
is there anyone out there?
feeding us lies as we look to the sky
is there anyone out there now?

take me to your leader
we come in peace
i'm human safe

everybody wants them until we meet them
everybody wants them, it's the end
scary little green men do you believe in
scary little green men? it's the end

men on the moon, won't you tell us the truth?
is there anyone out there?
feeding us lies as we look to the sky
is there anyone out there now?

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
scary little green men, do you believe in
scary little green men? it's the end
scary little green men, do you believe in
scary little green men? it's the end
huh!
we will not kill, we want to come in peace
don't worry, we are here, friend
that's cool
