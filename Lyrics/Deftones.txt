i watched you change
into a fly
i looked away
you were on fire

and i watched a change in you
it's like you never had wings
now you feel so alive
i've watched you change

i took you home
set you on the glass
i pulled off your wings
then i laughed

and i watched a change in you
it's like you never had wings
now you feel so alive
i've watched you change

it's like you never had wings

i look at the cross
then i look away
give you the gun
blow me away

and i watched a change in you
it's like you never had wings
now you feel so alive
i've watched you change

now you feel alive
you feel alive
you feel alive
i've watched you change
it's like you never had wings

you've changed
you've changed
you've changed
into a fly

here i lay, still and breathless
just like always; still, i want some more
mirrors sideways, who cares what's behind?
just like always, still your passenger
chrome buttons, buckles, and leather surfaces
these and other lucky witnesses
now to calm me, this time, won't you, please?
drive faster

roll the window down
this cool night air is curious
let the whole world look in
who cares who sees anything?
i'm your passenger
i'm your passenger

drop these down, then put them on me
nice, cool seats there to cushion your knees
now to calm me, take me around again
don't pull over, this time, wonâ€™t you, please?
drive faster

roll the window down
this cool night air is curious
let the whole world look in
who cares who sees what tonight?
roll these misty windows down
to catch my breath
and then go and go and go
just drive me home and back again

here i lay
just like always
don't let me go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go
take me to the edge

this town don't feel mine
i'm fast to get away, far

i dressed you in her clothes
so drive me, far

away
away
away

it feels good
to know you're mine
now drive me, far

away
away
away

far (away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care

far (away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care

i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)

far (away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
i don't care where, just far
(away)
away
so far (away)
i don't care where, far
(away)
i don't care just where, far
(away)
i don't care so where far

floating underwater
ever changing picture
hours out from land
in tune with all our dreams
the ocean takes me in
to watch you shake it
watch you wave your powers
tempt with hours of pleasure

take me one more time
take me one more wave
take me for one last ride
i'm out of my head

tonight
tonight
tonight
tonight
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
tonight (we ride)

cruising through the city
after hours with me
fusing all our powers
here's to all our dreams

take me one more time
take me one more wave
take me for one last ride
i'm out of my head

tonight
tonight
tonight
tonight
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
tonight (we ride)

you move like i want to
to see like your eyes do
we are downstairs
where no one can see
new life break away

tonight, i feel like more
tonight, i

you make the water warm
you taste foreign
and i know you can see
the cord break away

'cause tonight i feel like more
tonight i feel like more
feel like more
tonight

you breathed, then you stopped
i breathed, then dried you off

and tonight i feel
feel like more
oh, tonight i feel like
feel like more
tonight i feel like more
feel like more
tonight

hey you, big star
tell me when it's over
(cloud)

hey you, big mood
guide me to shelter
'cause i'm through when the two
hits the six and it's summer
(cloud)

(come) shove it, shove it, shove it
(shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(the sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(aside) shove it aside

i think god is moving its tongue
there's no crowds in the street and no sun
in my own summer

the shade is a tool, a device, a savior
see, i try and look up to the sky
but my eyes burn
(cloud)

(come) shove it, shove it, shove it
(shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(the sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(aside) shove it aside
(come) shove it, shove it, shove it
(shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(the sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(aside) shove it aside

i think god is moving its tongue
there's no crowd in the streets and no sun
in my own summer

(come) shove it, shove it, shove it
(shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(the sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(aside) shove it aside

my knife, it's sharp and chrome
come see inside my bones
all of the fiends are on the block
i'm the new king, i'll take the queen
'cause in here, we're all anemic
in here, anemic and sweet, so

(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and come in
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and lay down
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
now kiss me

i can float here forever in this room
we can't touch the floor
in here, we're all anemic
in here, anemic and sweet, so

(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and come in
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and lay down
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
now kiss me

i could float here forever
you are ever sweet
i could float here forever
anemic and sweet, so

(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and come in
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and lay down
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
get filthy
(go get your knife, go get your knife)
and kiss me

to the edge, until we all get off
i will take you away with me
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

calculate, i'll embrace
hold on, come with me now
run away, outer space with me
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm
time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
i will lead us to the same realm

get set

when the coffin shakes
and the needle breaks
come run away with me
come on, you'll see
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

time will lead us to the same realm
i will lead us to the same realm

i reject
both sides of what i'm being told
i've seen right through
now i watch how wild it gets
i finally achieve
balance, balance, balance, balance
approaching a delayed
rebirth, rebirth, rebirth, rebirth
i'm positive
there's no sense to what i'm being sold
yet here i go
i watch how wild we get
oh, can you taste your life?
balanced, balanced, balanced, balanced
how will you spend your time?
reborn, reborn, reborn, reborn

climbing out of the ashes
turning time inside out
we're miles beyond the sound

we'll start again
taste a lifestyle that never gets old
yet here we go
just watch how wild it gets
i finally achieve
balance, balance, balance, balance
approaching a delayed
rebirth, rebirth, rebirth, rebirth

climbing out of the ashes
we're turning time inside out
we're floating off in the ether
we're miles beyond the sound

we're everywhere
no need to return
i'll show you the way
we're everywhere
no need to return
i can show you where
no need to return
i can show you

climbing out of the ashes
we're turning time inside out
floating off in the ether
we're miles beyond the sound

oh, can you taste your life?
balanced
how will you spend your time?
reborn

a sea of waves we hug the same plank
(saw your end)
just as i'd rehearsed over in my brain
(saw your end)

the waves suck you in and you drown
if like, you should sink down beneath
i'll swim down, would you?
you?

you hang the anchors over my neck
(saw your end)
i liked it at first but the more you laughed
the crazier i came

the waves suck you in then you drown
if like, you'd just stay down with me
i'll swim down with you
is that what you want?
you
is that what you want?

wave
wave
inside

if like, you should stay down beneath
i'll swim down
would you?
is that what you want?
would you?
is that what you want?
with you?
you

escape below
escape below

i'll stick you a little
enough to take your oxygen away
then i'll set you on fire
'cause i'm on fire
and i'm with you alone
i'm so into this whore
afraid, i might lose her
so forget about me
'cause i'll stick you

pushed back the square
now that you've kneed her in the throat
well, there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of all
transpose or stop your life
is what you do

pushed back the square
now that you need her
but you don't, so there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of all
so transpose or stop your life
is what you do
transpose or stop your life
is what you do

pushed back the square
now that you've kneed her in the throat
well, there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of it all

all you are
all you are
all you are
all you are
is meat

i'll never be the same, breaking decency
don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
i've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
that's been stomped away from every single dream
but it's something else that brought us peace
keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
but i think that you made it up, i think that your mind is gone
i think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong!

suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
they fuck in my head!
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck it, you bitch!

you and me are here alone
face flat along the edge of the grass
but i'm not here to preach, i'm just sick of thugs
my parents made me strong to look up that glass
so why should i try? act like i'm a little pissed off
with all that shit that needs to stay back in the shell
your punk ass made it up, now your fuckin' mind is gone
should've never glorified, now you're right!

suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
they fuck in my head!
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck it, you bitch!

shut up, you don't know me
squeal like a pig when you
pickpocket, big fuckin' head!

well, i'll tell you about my blunt stack
what's coming back, jack? we'll turn back
curse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard
i mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga, you quitter
i'm thinking about something naughty and won't tell anybody
so, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
i'd like to think, for who i down this shit
i belong where they be
because we cannot get back those lives

we exist to please, understand?
love hates blacks, shades, and all the players
mr. p.i.g., could i fuckin' see?
shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
and to the jury can't be no turn is all
my skin looks colored, does that mean i'm burnt?
'cause your punk ass made it up, your fuckin' mind was gone
should've never glorified, wrong!

suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck it!
they fuck in my head!
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, suck
suck, suck, suck, you bad boy!

we're surrounded by debris of the past
and it's too late to cause a change in the tides
so we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as i stare

through the haunted maze in your eyes
right through where i'll remain for all time

and time won't change this
this promise we made
yeah, the time won't change this
it's how it'll stay

this is our time, we devour the days ahead
we've been possessed by these changing times
as we slip on through, we promised to meet again somewhere

through the haunted maze in our minds
right through where we shall remain for all time

yeah, time won't change this
this promise we made
and time won't change this
we shall remain

so run
run, right back to school
check it

look back, i sift through all the cliques
roaming' the halls all year, making me sick
while everyone's out trying to make the cut (what)
and when you think you know me right, i switch it up
behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
i hop a fence to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
give me a break about some other mess
what were you? act like it's everything you got

push back the square
now that you need her but you don't
so there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of it all, so

stop that quit, all that quit
who ruined it? you did, now grab a notebook and a pen
start taking notes on me and everyone who's on the top
you think we're on the same page, but i know we're not
i'll be the man, watch your backpacks, pens, and pencils
just like keith, i'm flippin' it, while you just keep it simple
you just can't go on rocking the clothes
coppin' the stance, 'cause really it's everything that you're not

push back the square
now that you need her but you don't
so there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of it all

so transpose
or stop your lies
it's what you do
transpose or stop your lies
so run
so why don't you run, so why don't you run?
so why don't you run back to school?
so why don't you run, so why don't you run?

all you are, now i'm on the next page
all you are, it's time to close the book up
all you are, i'm on the next page
all you are, close the book up now

push back the square
now that you need her but you don't
so there you go
'cause back in school
we are the leaders of all

we are the leaders of all
we are the leaders of all
so why don't you run, so why don't you run?
so why don't you run back to school?
so why don't you run, so why don't you run?

i won't stop following you
now help me pray for
the death of everything new
then we'll fly farther

'cause you're my girl and that's alright
if you sting me, i won't mind

we'll stop to rest on the moon
and we'll make a fire
i'll steal a carcass for you
then feed off the virus

'cause you're my girl and that's alright
if you sting me, i won't mind
'cause you're my girl and that's alright
if you sting me, i won't

you move me like music with your style

let me think, let you think about what?
about girls, and what else?
and money and new clothes, and what do i get?
thirty nights, uh huh
of violence, yeah?
and sugar to love

(ha ha, ha ha, come here)
closer to the lung

closer to the lung
(ha ha, ha ha, so i can, so i can)

i like you when, when you take off your face
put away all your teeth
and take us way underneath
because you could die if you take it alone

i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know i'm alive
you're shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild

i kind of like you when, when you make up the reel
take the phone in your room
stop the tape or resume
well you could try if you think it will load

i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know i'm alive
you're shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild

every time, every time you try
ride, it's a beautiful ride
why, it's a beautiful ride

i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know i'm alive
you're shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild

i get all numb
when she sings that "it's over"
such a strange numb
and it brings my knees to the earth

and god bless you all
for the song you sang us

you're the same numb
when you sing "it's over"
such a strange numb
it could bring back peace to the earth

so god bless you all
for the song you sang us all
for the hearts you break
every time you moan

i get all numb
we're the same numb
and it brings our knees to the earth

so god bless you all
for the song you sang us all
for the hearts you break
every time you moan

and god bless you all
on the earth
