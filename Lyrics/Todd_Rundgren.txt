okay (believe me), wait a minute
gimme– just gimme… gimme…
(anybody fucks up… right)
gimme a break for a second
two, three (four)… one, two, three…
one, ah-two… ah-one, two, three

hello, it's me
i've thought about us for a long, long time
maybe i think too much, but something's wrong
there's something here that doesn't last too long
maybe i shouldn't think of you as mine

seeing you
or seeing anything as much as i do you
i take for granted that you're always there
i take for granted that you just don't care
sometimes i can't help seeing all the way through

it's important to me
that you know you are free
'cause i never want to make you change for me
think of me
you know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile
and spend the night if you think i should

it's important to me (me)
that you know you are free
'cause i never want to make you change for me

think of me
you, you know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile
and spend the night if you think i should

think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me 

it was late last night
i was feeling something wasn't right
there was not another soul in sight
only you, only you
so we walked along
though i knew that there was something wrong
and a feeling hit me, oh so strong
about you

then you gazed up at me
and the answer was plain to see
'cause i saw the light
in your eyes (in your eyes)
in your eyes (in your eyes)

though we had our fling (we had our fling)
i just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)
'til that little bell began to ring (began to ring)
in my head, in my head
but i tried to run (i tried to run)
though i knew it wouldn't help me none (would not help me none)
'cause i couldn't ever love no one
or so i said
but my feelings for you
were just something i never knew
'til i saw the light
in your eyes (in your eyes)
in your eyes (in your eyes)


but i love you best
it's not something that i say in jest
'cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
in my eyes

and i ran out before
but i won't do it anymore
can't you see the light in my eyes (in my eyes)

in my eyes (in my eyes)
in my eyes (in my eyes)
in my eyes (in my eyes)
in my eyes (in my eyes) 

he's coming down the escalator
with a girl from east of here
he wants to make the country greater
we've got nothing left to fear

because the man in the tin foil hat
is sitting on the throne tonight
it kinda feels like coup d'état
but it's gonna be great, tremendous, amazing and all that

'cause the man in the tin foil hat
is tweeting like a teenage girl
he puts the pluto in plutocrat
it's gonna be a yuge yuge yuge new world

he hasn't got the time for losers
unless they do as he commands
he's writing checks to his accusers
with those tiny little hands

because the man in the tin foil hat
is sitting on the throne tonight
it kinda feels like coup d'état
but it's gonna be a yuge yuge yuge new world
'cause the man in the tin foil hat
is gonna drain the swamp tonight
and fill it with up with alternative facts
it's gonna be great, tremendous, amazing and all that

'cause the man in the tin foil hat
is tweeting like a teenage girl
he puts the pluto in plutocrat
it's gonna be a yuge yuge yuge new world

because the man in the tin foil hat
is sitting on the throne tonight
it kinda feels like coup d'état
it's gonna be great, tremendous, amazing and all that 

we can't play this game anymore
but can we still be friends?
things just can't go on like before
but can we still be friends?

we had something to learn
now it's time for the wheel to turn
grains of sand, one by one
before you know it, all gone

let's admit we made a mistake
but can we still be friends?
heartbreak's never easy to take
but can we still be friends?

it's a strange, sad affair
sometimes seems like we just don't care
don't waste time feeling hurt
we've been through hell together

(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la)
(la la lala la la lala la
can we still be friends?)
can we still get together sometime
(la la lala la la lala la
can we still be friends?)
you know life will still go on and on and on

we awoke from our dream
things are not always what they seem
memories linger on
it's like a sweet, sad old song
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la)
(la la la - la la la - la la la) 

alright! everybody now!

i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day

ever since i was a tiny boy
i don't want no candy
i don't need no toy
i took a stick and an old coffee can
i bang on that thing 'til i got
blisters on my hand because

i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
(yes, i do)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(that's right)

when i get older, they think i'm a fool
the teacher told me i should stay after school
she caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
but my licks were so hot, i made the teacher wanna dance
and that's why
i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
(hey, why not?)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(i'm gonna bang now)


i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
(i can bang that sucker)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(listen to this)

every day when i get home from work
i feel so frustrated, the boss is a jerk
and i get my sticks and go out to the shed
and i pound on that drum like it was the boss' head
because

i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
(bang! bang!)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(i can bang that drum)
i don't want to work
(hey! hey! hey! hey!)
i want to bang on the drum all day
(hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(this is why i bang the drum)
i don't want to work
i want to bang on the drum all day
(hey, you wanna take a bang at it?)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!)
i don't want to work
(hey! hey! hey! hey!)
i want to bang on the drum all day
(hey! bang!)
i don't want to play
i just want to bang on the drum all day
(i can do this all day)
i don't want to work... 

do you remember the last time i said
if i ever thought of lying
i'd rather think of dying instead?
and maybe you remember the last time you called me
to say we were through
how it took a million tears
just to prove they all were for you
but those days are through

'cause it wouldn't have made any difference
if you loved me, how could you love me?
when it wouldn't really make any difference
if you really loved me, you just didn't love me

'cause i know of hundreds of times i could be
in the most unfaithful arms that you always picture me
and maybe you remember that
though i can't always show proof i was true
no one else could change my mind
or stop me coming home to you
but those days are through

'cause it wouldn't have made any difference
if you loved me, how could you love me?
when it wouldn't really make any difference
if you really loved me, you just didn't love me
enough to believe me (enough to believe me)
enough not to leave me (enough not to leave me)
enough not to look for a reason to be unhappy with me
and make me regret ever wanting you
but those days are through

'cause it wouldn't have made any difference
if you loved me, how could you love me?
when it wouldn't really make any difference
if you really loved me, you just didn't love me

'cause it wouldn't have made any difference
if you loved me, how could you love me?
when it wouldn't really make any difference... 

pretty bird with feathers falling
pretty as a lady calling
for her pink and midnight lover
as she stares into the water
and a yellow moon is rising
and there can't be no disguising
that the pretty bird is dying
with a silver arrow lying at its side
rivers of blood, oceans of tears
life without death and death without reason
to the whole united nations
to your greatest expectations
to the moment that you realize
as a dark figure slips from out of the shadow

pretty bird closes its eyes
pretty bird dies
another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
of the zen archer

a man in parts forgotten
with an outlook that is rotten
and an attitude to match it
finds relief inside a hatchet
and he halved someone in boulder
justifiability is in
the hands of the beholder
and you just don't know
what people will do next
mountains of pain, valleys of love
death without life and life without meaning
to the promise kept and broken
to the love that's never spoken
just as surely as i'm in your ears
a dark figure slips from out of the shadow
pretty bird closes its eyes
pretty bird dies
another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
of the zen archer 

leroy, boy, is that you?
i thought your post-hangin' days were through
sunk-in eyes and full of sighs
tell no lies, you get wise
i tell you now, we're gonna pull you through
there's only one thing left that we can do

we gotta get you a woman
it's like nothin' else to make you feel sure you're alive
we gotta get you a woman
we better get walkin', we're wastin' time talkin' now

leroy, boy, you're my friend
you say how and i'll say when
come and meet me down the street
take a seat, it's my treat
you may not ever get this chance again
that empty feeling's just about to end

we gotta get you a woman
it's like nothin' else to make you feel sure you're alive
we gotta get you a woman
we better get walkin', we're wastin' time talkin' now
talkin' 'bout life and what it means to you
it don't mean nothin' if it don't run through
i got one thing to say, you know it's true
you got to find some time to get this thing together, 'cause

we gotta get you a woman
it's like nothin' else to make you feel sure you're alive
we gotta get you a woman
we better get walkin', we're wastin' time talkin' now

talkin' 'bout things about that special one
they may be stupid, but they sure are fun
i'll give it to you while we're on the run
because we ain't got time to get this thing together, 'cause
(we got to get together with a)

woman who has been around
one who knows better than to let you down
let's hope there's still one left in this whole town
and that she'll take some time to get this thing together, 'cause
(get this thing together) 'cause
get this thing together, 'cause
we gotta get you a woman
we gotta get you a woman
we gotta get you a woman
and when we're through with you
we'll get me one too 

here we go
comin' at ya

tell everyone that i am sorry, truly sorry
for all of the wrongs i done
i never meant to hurt nobody, no
lord, i never want to do no wrong

but i have lied, i have begged and i have cheated
and i know my ship won't be coming in
as i lay me down to take my rest
i see that it's just dust in the wind

take hold my hand, hold it tighter, ever tighter
you must believe that i love you still
but my strength, it grows weaker, ever weaker
and my body has lost it's will

now i have lied, i have begged and i have cheated
and i know my ship won't be coming in
as i lay me down to take my rest
i see that it's just dust in the wind


oh my lord, i have lost once again
and i got no one to help me find my way
but i never wanted to hurt nobody
and i never wanted to do no wrong

i have lied, i have begged and i have cheated
and i know my ship won't be coming in
as i lay me down to take my rest
i see that it's just dust in the wind

dust in the wind, mama 

here we are again
the start of the end
but there's more
(but there's more)
i only want to see
if you'll give up on me
but there's always more

(there is more) international feel
(and there is more) interplanetary deals
(but there is more) interstellar appeal
(still there is more) universal ideal
(still there is more) international feel
(always more)

i swear something lies
in your ears and your eyes
'cause there's more
('cause there's more)
you hear and you see
yet you do not believe
that there's always more
(there is more) international feel
(and there is more) interplanetary deals
(but there is more) interstellar appeal
(still there is more) universal ideal
(still there is more) international feel

(i know, i know)... 

the visitors were never seen
they missed my monologue between
but i think you know
the letters came, the letters went
the last reply was never sent
but i think you know

i can't explain what's in my brain that tells me where to go
but i think you know
i think you know

for i would draw a diagram
to signify the things i am
but i think you know
and in the end it all boils down
a useless bit of running 'round
'cause i think you know

and love i send to you my friend but never tell you so
but i think you know
i think you know
 

we've been waiting so long
we've been waiting so long
we've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine
shining still to give us the will

can you hear me, the sound of my voice?
i am here to tell you i have made my choice
i've been listening to what's been going down
there's just too much talk and gossip going 'round

you may think that i'm a fool, but i know the answer
words become a tool, anyone can use them
take the golden rule as the best example
eyes that have seen will know what i mean

the time has come to take the bull by the horns
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
we've been so downhearted, we've been so forlorn
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
we get weak and we want to give in
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
but we still need each other if we want to win
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
if you don't know what to do about a world of trouble
you can pull it through if you need to and if
you believe it's true, it will surely happen
shining still, to give us the will

we've been waiting so long
we've been waiting so long
we've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine
shining still to give us the will
bright as the day, to show us the way

somehow, someday
we need just one victory and we're on our way
prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
give us just one victory, it will be all right

we may feel about to fall but we'll go down fighting
you will hear the call if you only listen
underneath it all we are here together
shining still to give us the will
bright as the day, to show us the way
somehow, someday
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
we need just one victory and we're on our way
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory, it will be all right
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
somehow, someday
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory and we're on our way
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory, it will be all right
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
somehow, someday
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory and we're on our way
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory, it will be all right
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
somehow, someday
(hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
give us just one victory and we're on our way...
(we may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line...) 

a million old soldiers will fade away
but a dream goes on forever
i'm left standing here, i've got nothing to say
all is silent within my dream

a thousand true loves will live and die
but a dream lives on forever
the days and the years will go streaking by
but the time has stopped in my dream

we all have our everyday hopes and fears
and you'll find no exception in me
but that doesn't get me through a sea of tears
over life's biggest tragedy

you're so long ago and so far away
but my dream lives on forever
i guess i believe that i'll see you one day
for without it there is no dream

you're so far away and so long ago
but my dream lives on forever
and how much i loved you you'll never know
'til you join me within my dream
and how much i loved you you'll never know
'til you join me within my dream 

i thought i was your super girl
but you had somethin’ else in mind
you promised a place in your world for me
but it's so cold and undefined
if there's somethin’ i’ve overlooked
i just don't know what it could be
i've got to finally close the book on us
not even that you’d do for me

but i will swallow my pride
(what will be will be)
and you’ll roll over  at night
(tell me what you see)
that empty pillow by your side
(that could have been me)
that could have been me

it's like you'll always mean to me
more than i’ll ever mean to you
and when i should’ve broken free
i was willingly your fool
i can see it in your eyes
i should simply walk away
after all i compromised
i know you won't hear me anyway

oh, and i will swallow my pride
(what will be will be)
when you roll over at night
(tell me what you see)
an empty pillow by your side
(that could have been me)
that could have been me
(that could have been me)
oh and i will swallow my pride
(what will be will be)
when you roll over at night
(tell me what you see)
that empty pillow by your side
(that could have been me)
that could have been me
that could have been me

(so i will swallow my pride)
so i will swallow my pride
(when you roll over at night)
(that empty pillow by your side)
that could have been me 

nearly everyone i know claims to have heard your voice
and every time they do, i know i should rejoice
because one day i'm sure you'll break your silence
and speak just to me
but i feel like time's running out
my heart is, my heart is filling with doubt
and god said

i don't dwell upon you, i dwell on something else
i am not really here, so get over your self

i've tried to follow every rule they said you handed down
and spread the sacred testimony all around
but still the others seem to have your ear but never will i
have i displeased you somehow?
can't help, can't help feeling left out
and god said

there's no anger in me, you must mean someone else
'cause it's not me that you see, you're looking at yourself
and i won't give you a prize instead of someone else
'cause i don't play favorites, so get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over get over get over get over

is it my fear, is it my pride, is it my vanity?
should your name just be denied to save my sanity?
what is the price i need to pay to have what others seem to grasp so easily?
pity your servant your slave
who'll kiss, who'll kiss your feet to be saved
save me, save me
save me
god said

you are not serving me, you're serving something else
'cause i don't need to be pleased, just get over yourself
you can't suck up, up to me, i know you all too well
but i don't dwell upon you, so get over yourself
'cause you're not praying to me, you're praying to yourself
and you're not worshiping me, you're worshiping yourself
and you will kill in my name and heaven knows what else
when you can't prove i exist, so get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over yourself
just get over get over get over get over yourself 

see that girl, watch her dance
if i knew her name i wouldn't have to sit on my hands
if my mouth don't work i get some help
and she don't mind if i don't keep my hands to myself

(you're all right)
(you put up such a good clean fight)
(i'm afraid that you lose tonight)

s - l - u - t
she may be a slut but she looks good to me
s - l - u - t
she may be a slut but she looks good to me

you're so clean, so refined
you don't care to get messy just to have a good time
she's got saggy thighs and baggy eyes
but she loves me in a way i can still recognize

(you're all right)
(you put up such a good clean fight)
(i'm afraid that you lose tonight)
s - l - u - t
she may be a slut but she looks good to me

black maria, you scare me so
i feel as though my heart stop dead
you're a liar, this i know
i watch you go around my head

oh, i'm going down slow
you scare me so
oh, you never let go
you scare me so

gay deceiver, my eyes they burned
my insides turned, my brain it rolled
unbeliever, but now i've learned
i took my turn, i come up cold

oh, i'm going down slow
you scare me so
oh, you never let go
you scare me so

if you must kill me
please let me die, lord
(let me die, let me die)

(ooh) black maria, you scare me so
i feel as though my heart stop dead
you're a liar, this i know
i watch you go around my head

oh, i'm going down slow
you scare me so
oh, you never let go
you scare me so

if you must kill me
please let me die 

keep your head and everything will be cool
you didn't have to make me feel like a fool
when i tried to say i feel the way that i do
i want to talk with you
and make it loud and clear
though you don't care to hear but

couldn't i just tell you the way i feel?
i can't keep it bottled up inside
and could we pretend that it's no big deal
and there's really nothing left to hide?

something sure doesn't seem right to me
when you can turn your back whenever you please
and you stroll away and calmly bid me adieu
why can't i talk with you
and put it in your ear
though you don't care to hear but

couldn't i just tell you the way i feel?
i can't keep it bottled up inside
and could we pretend that it's no big deal
and there's really nothing left to hide?
(hear me out, ooh)
why don't you lend me an ear
(hear me out, ooh)
you got no reason to fear
(hear me out, ooh)
i'll make it perfectly clear i love you


i don't come whining with my heart on my sleeve
i'm not a coward, if that's what you believe
and i'm not afraid but not ashamed if it's true
i got to talk with you
and then i'll make it clear
make it clear
make it clear

couldn't i just tell you the way i feel
i can't keep it bottled up inside
and could we pretend that it's no big deal
and there's really nothing left to hide 

the blessing of the turtles, the eggs lay on the lawn
paint a pretty picture for me to sit upon
the calling of the rabbit, the falling of the hare
the hat man then begins to play, a song is everywhere

you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
tell them groucho said, you're just another onionhead
(just another onionhead, just another onionhead)

another virgin mary, another case is shut
have another helping, prime cut of baby's butt
a sip of holy water, a shot of saving grace
another western mystic, the words pore out my face

you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
you want the obvious, you'll get the obvious
i'll shave my skull instead, be just another onionhead
(just another onionhead)

dada dali goodbye, dada dali don't sigh
your soft alarm clocks quake me
so boil your beans and meet me at perignon station
crutch me dali again, lobster telephone friend
stay in your seat, watch what you eat
if you don't get a dead mule then you'll know i'm in heat
dada dali hello, dada dali you're

(just another onionhead, just another onionhead) 

sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel

sometimes i don't know what to feel
everything i thought that i knew starts to look so unreal
there's a ringing in my head
that keeps me awake at night
sometimes i don't know what is right
today i saw a car crush my little dog under it's wheel
it did not even stop
it just sped off and out of sight
sometimes i just feel so afraid
but i know that no one else has it made
so if i just believe in myself
i won't need no help from nobody else
and i can make it alone
and everything will be cool
i got to keep on keepin' on
there's nothing else i can do

sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what to do
someone said the world's going to end and i think it's true
i thought there was some love in the world
but i guess i'm wrong
sometimes i just feel so alone
i don't want to admit to my friends that i feel confused
i wonder what i'd do with myself
if the world was gone
but something makes me stay on my feet
"don't you dare admit to defeat!"
and if i tell myself it's all right
i can comfort myself through the night
and watch another day dawn
and everything will be cool
i got to keep on keepin' on
there's nothing else i can do

sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what, no no
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
sometimes i don't know
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know
i just don't know what to feel
sometimes i don't know what
i just don't know what to feel
