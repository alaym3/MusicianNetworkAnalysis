hold the phone, three years later
stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
now all around the world on the microphone

i'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
they call me boogie night
the stalker that walks awkward
stick figured with a dick bigger than mark wahlberg
coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
hit a fucking  bitch in her  with luggage

i black out or back out
lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
i'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers

i had a huge attitude, started off staticky
mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
i'm not a commodity, i'm an oddity
who oddly enough developed himself a halloween following
it's so big, if i counted up all the freaks who follow me (one, two)
i'd probably owe ozzy osbourne an apology (whoops)
college girls, live in an alcoholic's world
full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
covered in throw-up, and i refuse to grow up
i won't budge, i still tell a grown-up to shut up (shut up!)
i made this rap game suspenseful
cause now i got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (bitch)
they waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood
cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
and as long as i stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
you motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'

won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(it's the ill, that cool? slim shady)
won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(it's the ill, that cool? slim mothafucking shady)
won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
