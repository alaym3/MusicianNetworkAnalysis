always fine lines between us
they say nowadays don't mean much
cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
but my ship set sail and i’m here to tell that
i don’t mean like the others
and i…

i keep searching and i can’t seem to find what i’m wanting
it’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
then i’ve found what i’ve been looking for
found what i’ve been looking for, yeah
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)

should i wait, should i stay to see it
unfold 'cause i’m told, i need it
i’m not frightened to take a step away
but my ship set sail and i’m here to tell that
i don’t mean like the others
and i…

i keep searching and i can’t seem to find what i’m wanting
it’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
then i’ve found what i’ve been looking for
found what i’ve been looking for, yeah
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
i’ve been running round, running round, running round
now i’m down and out, down and out, down and out
scared the magic might fade away

i keep searching and i can’t seem to find what i’m wanting
it’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
then i’ve found what i’ve been looking for
found what i’ve been looking for
i keep searching and i can’t seem to find what i’m wanting
it’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
then i’ve found what i’ve been looking for
found what i’ve been looking for, yeah
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah)
oooooooooh (found what i’ve been looking for, yeah) 

there's something in the water, calling my name
too deep to hear, no idea
the message you sent, well it ain't clear
cause i've fallen in love again, yes i've fallen in love again
with you, with you, with you

i'm holding on to the past, my mother says i'm growing up fast
oh time is gone with a blink
it's time to think and put your worries aside
today is just today and tomorrow never dies
so never live on a regret
take every moment you get and actions speak louder than words
so shout to the sky if your words can not be heard

something in the water, calling my name
too deep to hear, no idea
the message you sent, well it ain't clear
cause i've fallen in love again, yes i've fallen in love again
with you, with you, with you

i'm wondering why my thoughts aren't clear
am i hiding behind a crystal tear
will the time stop before the dime drops
will my foot print make the mark
well i can see the light now as i'm stepping out the dark
there's something in the water, calling my name
too deep to hear, no idea
the message you sent, well it ain't clear
cause i've fallen in love again, yes i've fallen in love again
with you, with you, with you 

oh i love, oh i love, love my freedom
more than happy to be at a table for one
go to a movie with just yours truly
stay out all night or go to sleep early

i do what i want to do
got no one to answer to
live whatever life i choose
i'm free

don't want no one taking up my time
staying on my mind, changing up my life
don't want no one messing up my bed
fucking with my head, it's no lie
but when you look at me like that
i might

oh i like, oh i like singing loudly
in my room out of tune with no one around me
being stupid, acting crazy
work hard all day, i spend the day being lazy
i go where i want to go
living fast or taking it slow
like it out here on my own
i'm free

don't want no one taking up my time
staying on my mind, changing up my life
don't want no one messing up my bed
fucking with my head, it’s no lie
but when you look at me like that
i might

might never walk away
might beg you to stay
might change everything just to keep you close to me

don't want no one taking up my time
staying on my mind, changing up my life
don't want no one messing up my bed
fucking with my head, it’s no lie
but when you look at me like that
i might, i might, i might
when you look at me like that
i might 

i've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, a little bit of love

lately i've been countin' stars
and i'm sorry that i broke your heart
it's somethin' that i didn't want for you
but i'm steppin' on broken glass
and i know this is my final chance
all i'm tryna do is find my path to you

i've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
i've got voices in my head and i can't lie

i've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, i need a little love
just like the air i'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love
lately, i've been wakin' up
in a dreamy state calling your name
stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
now i'm knocking on every door
'cause i heard you moved from twenty-two
has it been that long? i guess time just flew

i've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
i've got voices in my head and i can't lie

i've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, i need a little love
just like the air i'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

i tried to fly but i used my wings too soon
now everything got me thinking of you
i tried a million times to cut you loose
i've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, i need a little love
just like the air i'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
tryna find my way back to you 'cause i'm needin'
a little bit of love
a little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love 

the way you stand there in your three striped shell toes and
the way your hair dances, it's clear you want all eyes on you
it's all eyes on you
and though i know that i won't get no answers, i
i just can't stop from indulging my lean eyes on you
my fool eyes on you

as you dance on the burning coals
i feel the bullet holes
tell myself i've got nothing to lose
though your touch gives me vertigo, i'm like a domino
darling i keep falling back to you

but if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
you pull me closer
you say you miss the way i hold ya
i feel you breathing on my shoulder
why do you stop me getting sober?

you leave your sweet bitter taste under my tongue and
you leave your smoke to seep deep into my lungs
i know how you're taking hold
my love is wasted, somehow you laced it
and i'm on my knees
there's no remedy
as you dance on the burning coals
i feel the bullet holes
tell myself i've got nothing to lose
though your touch gives me vertigo, i'm like a domino
darling i keep falling back to you

but if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
you pull me closer
you say you miss the way i hold ya
i feel you breathing on my shoulder
why do you stop me getting sober?

na na na, na na na
na na na na
na na na, na na na
na na na na

but if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
you pull me closer
you say you miss the way i hold ya
so if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
you pull me closer
you say you miss the way i hold ya
i feel you breathing on my shoulder
(na na na, na na na
na na na na)
why do you stop me getting sober?
(na na na, na na na
na na na na)
why do you stop me getting sober? 

my eyes are delusional
and i'm not thinking the same
but i've been wondering:
is it me you're looking for

well you'll find me standing on these cold streets
hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
will you catch me, save me when i'm falling?
tell me have you ever been here before?

so take my hand and lead the way
find your courage, find your lion
and take your pride and leave the past
set sail for new horizons
so take my hand and lead the way
find your courage and find your lion
and if you hear the angel sings
sweet hallelujah
hallelujah

so many faces telling the story
like once upon a time
blinded by the force of falling in love or
leaving it all behind.. but
the fear of the unknown, and who to follow
leaves me howling at the skies
is there a purpose in what we believe?
well i will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

so take my hand and lead the way
find your courage, find your lion
and take your pride and leave the past
set sail for new horizons
so take my hand and lead the way
find your courage and find your lion
and if you hear the angel sings
sweet hallelujah
hallelujah 

i've walked through hell, and i've battled the storms
i know too well how, it feels when you fall

i'm on this road, and i won't' lose my faith
pack it up, pack it up, 'cause i'm on my way
for so long....

i've been praying, for a brighter day
i've been praying, trying to find my way
cause time moves on and seasons change
nothing ever stays the same
praying, i keep praying

i've over due, just a little bit of luck
i get the taste, but its never enough
i'm on this road
and i won't lose my faith
pack it up, pack it up cause i'm on my way
for so long....

i've been praying for a brighter day
i've been praying trying to find my way
time moves on and seasons change
nothing ever stays the same
praying, i keep praying
on my own, i search high and low
till i find what i've been looking for
i'm in my deep end and i won't be beaten till i find what i've been praying for...

i've been praying, for a brighter day
i've been praying, trying to find my way
cause time moves on and seasons change
nothing ever stays the same
praying, i keep praying

i keep praying
i keep praying
cause time moves on and seasons change
nothing ever stays the same
praying, i keep praying

young man, but wise to the bone
from a youthless man who’s walked a lonely road
and no fear of picking up daddy’s traits
he holds himself together with these barbed wire gates

alone, we stand together we fall
slow, that belief conquers all

so don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
i say, don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire

and watch him grow into a shell of a man
everything is taking shape and going to plan
how quickly though, life can turn around
one step forward, two steps back, he’s lost in the crowd

alone, we stand together we fall
slow, that belief conquers all
so don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
i say, don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire

if you walk in your shadow
led by shepherds then you know
if you walk in your shadow
if you walk in your shadow
led by shepherds then you know
if you walk in your shadow

so don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
i say, don’t let people hold you back
gotta stand tall and aim higher
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire
don’t touch the barbed wire 

they say a king ain’t a king without his rubies and gold
but i know kings with little things and by god does he have it all
it’s not in dimes that defines the way a man should show his love
take the time to read between the lines

because rome wasn’t built in a day
and patience is the only way

this is the age of the lost and the found
and now raise a glass to those who choose to live without
and don’t need no king for a castle or a ticket to the stars
so close your eyes and know how lucky you are
so close your eyes and know how lucky you are

now that we’ve sung and you know you’re not the only one to see behind the truth
the ceremonial dispute of love and hate and war and games
before them white horses come galloping, you’re battling
don’t forget to read between the lines

because rome wasn’t built in a day
and patience is the only way
this is the age of the lost and the found
and now raise a glass to those who choose to live without
and don’t need no king for a castle or a ticket to the stars
so close your eyes and know how lucky you are
so close your eyes and know how lucky you are

this is the age, this is the age
this is the age, this is the age
so close your eyes and know how lucky you are

when monday morning's falling back around
the coffee's cold, it gets me down
i put my hand there on the empty space
here in our bed, i can't replace
i picture your face, hands on my waist
you've gone with no trace
and i can't break the cycle of you in my mind, oh

this is the place that i come to forget you
these are the nights that i drink to regret you
these are the times i know i can't replace you

only you said i could do better
if i can learn how to surrender, when i'm wrong
i stand my ground but i get nowhere
you said i missed the future that's out there, that's out there

i played our game of love and hate
and we won't leave this up to fate

'cause i'm fallin' down on my knees
just to keep me on my feet
and you're breaking me down, i know
so i stand here on my own
yeah, i'm giving it all
'cause i know now what it takes
yeah, i'm giving it all
'cause i'm ready to release the brakes
yeah, i'm ready to release the brakes

now you got me on a mission
chasing the number one position, to the door
we'll go further than the distance
'cause we're more than just an existence
i played our game of love and hate
and we won't leave this up to fate

you got me fallin' down on my knees
just to keep me on my feet
and you're breaking me down, i know
so i stand here on my own
yeah, i'm giving it all

'cause i'm ready to release the brakes
yeah, i'm ready to release the brakes 

i've had a long day of it
walking home hands in pockets, wishing on stars that i can't see
i watch all you city dreamers, left hometown believers
looking down at the ground like me

we're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

but i'm lighting matches
making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
stay in the dark another day
i wanna know, will it all get better?
are we alone? or are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together?

so i lift my eyes up, let conversation light up
it feels like i've known you for time
tell me which piece of you is missing
we all got parts need fixing
it's just the catch of being alive
we're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

but i'm lighting matches
making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
stay in the dark another day
i wanna know, will it all get better?
are we alone? or are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together?

and i-i-i-i won't strike out
and i-i-i-i won't let it burn out
can't make this puzzle with a piece that doesn't fit
there must be something more than this

but i'm lighting matches
making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
stay in the dark another day
i wanna know, will it all get better?
are we alone? or are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together?
nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
are we lost together? 

guess i was born in a hurry, so it says in the stars
sometimes we move like lightning, still get stuck where we are
playing the long game means waiting
don’t have to wait on tomorrow
so imma pick my head up and go on with my days
i see all the hustle-bustle 'bout cashing a wage
spring is as long as the winter when i'm holding out for the summer

so i’m singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, give me patience cos i can’t seem to wait any longer

seems like i get home late and the stars come out
trying to keep my composure but i have no doubt
waiting for you is like a dream, well i can’t piece it together

so i’m singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, give me patience cos i can’t seem to wait any more

all of our lives we’re striving for something and it takes up all our energy
although sometimes we’re bored in the sun but a big dull moment
let’s learn to walk before we can run, let’s learn to walk before we can run
cos we’re singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, give me patience, give me patience
singing lord, singing lord, singing lord, give me patience
cos i don’t want to wait any longer 

i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you

i'm sitting here in this lonely room
no, there's nothing left, there's only me and you
holding onto heaven but the heaven's closed down on me
nothing lasts forever, nothing goes to plan
don't you lose your grip, ain't letting go of my hand
'cause every single second is a second that we can't get back

here we go, going cold in the silence
never know till you hear all the sirens
i should go, but if this is the end of the line then

hold me close and we can lay here one last time
don't slip away, leave me behind
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you
try my best at being brave
but this is more than i can take
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you
one minute you're here, then you're gone the next
turning into strangers like we never met
counting every blessing like a lesson that you told me

here we go, going cold in the silence
never know till you hear all the sirens
i should go, but if this is the end of the line then

hold me close and we can lay here one last time
don't slip away, leave me behind
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you
try my best at being brave
but this is more than i can take
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you
(that's loving you, that's loving you, that's loving you)
don't break the heart that's loving you

here we go, going cold in the silence
never know till you hear all the sirens
i should go, but if this is the end of the line then
hold me close and we can lay here one last time
don't slip away, leave me behind
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you
try my best at being brave
but this is more than i can take
i'm on my knees, i'm begging you
don't break the heart that's loving you

sitting here in this lonely room
no there's nothing left
there's only me and you
holding onto heaven but the heaven's closed down on me 

more than likely, you don't even like me
but i just can't walk on by
struck by lightning while i light my tenth one
remind myself that i'm not high

'cause all these other robots dancing like there's only one design
tell them where the magic can be found
hobbies are a rarity
the pulse, it never lies
i wanna know what's going on inside

but they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
there's something about your coding
they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore
there's something about your coding
and they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore

i take a step back when you walk on over
try to keep myself locked down
i said there's something else about you
can you tell me what it is?
you say "come with me right now"
'cause all these other robots dancing like there's only one design
tell them where the magic can be found
hobbies are a rarity
the pulse, it never lies
i wanna know what's going on inside

but they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
there's something about your coding
they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore
there's something about your coding
and they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore

i'm dead alive, dead alive
oh i'll come alive, come alive
it only takes two minutes
get the coin out, flip it
got to leave it up to fate

but they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
there's something about your coding
they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore
there's something about your coding
and they don't make 'em, make 'em like you anymore
but they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
but they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more
they don't make 'em like you no more, no more
they don't make 'em like you no more 

without your makeup, i'm confused
oh i think you look amazing, but i'm not sure i do
what is it? i'm drunk and i don't see
when it's you that i want
don't know whats good for me
don't know what i've got

what kind of man am i?
drunk on my own supply, i should get over myself
time to get over myself

cause if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
and if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
i'll put my tie at your door
if the ship goes down, i'm going down with it
ship goes down, i'm going down with it
i'm aboard

it's like a badge of honour that you know me well
perhaps you know me better than i know myself
how long will thicker lies keep rolling? roll them dice
how long will you be happy to pay the price
what kind of man am i?
drunk on my own supply, i should get over myself
can't i get over myself

cause if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
and if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
i'll put my tie at your door
if the ship goes down, i'm going down with it
ship goes down, i'm going down with it
i'm aboard

stay with it, stay with it
when the ship goes down
eyes on floor cause i keep seeing ghosts when there ain't none
and when i look around, see no complication
why am i tryna to make one?
on script, this is where i jump ship
but i won't run, oh

but if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
and if it's cool then it's cool
won't fuck around no more
i'll put my tie at your door
if the ship goes down, i'm going down with it
ship goes down, i'm going down with it
i'm aboard
i'll put my tie at your door
if the ship goes down, i'm going down with it
ship goes down, i'm going down with it
i'm aboard and i'm here to stay, i'm here to stay
i'm aboard, oh i'm aboard 

i was made out of nothing
you were made out of gold
from golden i think i'm something
but together we know
won’t you lie with me, lie with me

i was made out to look back, like i didn’t belong
and you were made up to keep up where i have come from
won’t you lie with me, lie with me

sail away, we are the lucky ones
sail away, together we could run
into the deep, for all to see
won’t you sail away, where we can't be
if you lie with me, lie with me

we were made to discover
we've got nothing to lose
this is for one another
i’ve got nothing to prove
won’t you lie with me, lie with me
sail away, we are the lucky ones
sail away, together we could run
into the deep, for all to see
won’t you sail away, where we can't be
if you lie with me, lie with me

i was made out of nothing
you were made out of gold
from golden i think i'm something
but together we know
won’t you lie with me, lie with me

sail away, we are the lucky ones
sail away, together we could run
into the deep, for all to see
won’t you sail away, where we can't be
if you lie with me, lie with me

sail away, we are the lucky ones
sail away, together we could run
into the deep, for all to see
won’t you sail away, where we can't be
won’t you lie with me, lie with me
oh come on lie with me, lie with me
