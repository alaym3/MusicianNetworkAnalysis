outside the family stew
out by the fire breathing
outside we wait till face turns blue
i know the nervous walking
i know the dirty beard hangs
out by the boxcar waiting

you'll never wait so long

here comes your man
here comes your man

big shake on the boxcar moving
big shake to the land that's falling down
is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
a big, big stone fall and break my crown

what a gas it was to see him
walk her every day into a shady place
with her lips she said

cease to resist, giving my goodbye
drive my car into the ocean
you think i'm dead, but i sail away

on a wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave, wave

i've kissed mermaids, rode the el niño
walked the sand with the crustaceans
could find my way to mariana

on a wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave, wave
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation

gouge away
you can gouge away
stay all day
if you want to
mhm, mhm, mhm, hm
hm-hm, mhm, hm

missy aggravation
some sacred questions
you stroke my locks
some marijuana if you got some

gouge away
you can gouge away
stay all day
if you want to
la, la
oh, oh

sleeping on your belly
you break my arms
you spoon my eyes
been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers

gouge away
you can gouge away
stay all day
if you want to
mhm

chained to the pillars
a 3-day party
i break the walls
and kill us all with holy fingers

gouge away (la la)
you can gouge away
stay all day
if you want to

this is a song for carol!

you're into japanese fast food
and i dropped off your japanese lover
and you're going to the beach all day
you're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
you're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

you're looking like you've got some sun
your blistered lips have got a kiss
that tastes a bit like everyone
oh-oh! oh-oh! oh-oh! oh-oh!

your bone's got a little machine
you're the bone machine

i was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
he bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
he bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
yep, yep yep, yep!

i make you pray, you make me hard
your island skin looks mexican
our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

your bone's got a little machine
you're the bone machine

uh-oh, uh-oh! uh-oh, uh-oh!

put this down for the record
it’s more or less un-checkered
wasted days and wasted nights
made me a fucking beggar
no soul, my milk is curdled
i’m the burgermeister of purgatory
look out for that hot plate
guess that’s all you got, great
you put the cock in cocktail, man
well i put the tail in wait!
watch me walk
blowtorch a hole in the armor
and i don’t need the tip

i am in love with your daughter
and though she has no need
i’m the one who’s got some trotters
you’ve many mouths to feed

indie cindy
be in love with me
i beg for you to carry me

mixed messages from sir naff
please authenticate
just to be sure that you’re a sap
set for stun automatica
crap is their operative
locomotive of the longest death

there goes indie cindy whose
sails were black when it was windy
we offed ourselves in a lover’s pact
we threw ourselves into the sea
well looksie what the wind washed back
as we follow the bouncing ball
they call this dance the washed up crawl

i am in love with your daughter
and though she has no need
i’m the one who’s got some trotters
you’ve many mouths to feed
i am in love with your daughter
and though she has no need
i’m the one who’s got some trotters

and a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown
stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
but her face fall down when she go, go, go

stand close to the fire when they light the pig

sitting here wishing on a cement floor
just wishing that i had just something you wore
i put it on when i grow lonely
will you take off your dress and send it to me?

i miss your kiss and then i miss your head
and a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
run outside in the desert heat
make your dress all wet then send it to me

i miss your soup and i miss your bread
and a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
so spill your breakfast and drip your wine
just wear that dress when you dine

p-i-x-i-e-s

sitting here wishing on a cement floor
just wishing that i had just something you wore
bloody your hands on a cactus tree
wipe it on your dress and send it to me

sitting here wishing on a cement floor
