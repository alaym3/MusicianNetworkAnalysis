lying in my bed
i hear the clock tick, and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
flashback, warm nights
almost left behind
suitcase of memories
time after—

sometimes, you picture me
i'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me
i can't hear what you've said
then you say, "go slow"
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds

if you're lost, you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall, i will catch you, i'll be waiting
time after time
if you're lost, you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall, i will catch you, i'll be waiting (i will be waiting)
time after time

after my picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray
watching through windows
you're wondering if i'm okay
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time

if you're lost, you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall, i will catch you, i'll be waiting
time after time


you said, "go slow"
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds

if you're lost, you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall, i will catch you, i'll be waiting
time after time
if you're lost, you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall, i will catch you, i'll be waiting (i will be waiting)
time after time

time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time

you with the sad eyes
don't be discouraged
oh i realize
it's hard to take courage
in a world full of people
you can lose sight of it all
and the darkness inside you
can make you feel so small

but i see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow

show me a smile then
don't be unhappy
can't remember when
i last saw you laughing
if this world makes you crazy
and you've taken all you can bear
you call me up
because you know i'll be there

and i'll see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow

can't remember when i last saw you laugh

if this world makes you crazy
you've taken all you can bear
you call me up
because you know i'll be there

and i'll see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors
true colors are shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow

all through the night
i'll be awake, and i'll be with you
all through the night
this precious time when time is new
oh, all through the night today
knowing that we feel the same without saying

we have no past, we won't reach back
keep with me forward all through the night
and once we start the meter clicks
and it goes running all through the night
until it ends, there is no end

all through the night
stray cat is crying, so stray cat sings back
all through the night
they have forgotten what by day they lack
oh, under those white street lamps
there is a little chance they may see

we have no past, we won't reach back
keep with me forward all through the night
and once we start the meter clicks
and it goes running all through the night
until it ends, there is no end

oh, the sleep in your eyes is enough
let me be there let me stay there awhile

we have no past, we won't reach back
keep with me forward all through the night
and once we start the meter clicks
and it goes running all through the night
until it ends, there is no end
keep with me forward all through the night
and once we start the meter clicks
and it goes running all through the night
until it ends, there is no end

here we are
hanging onto strains of greed and blues
break the chain then we break down
oh it's not real if you don't feel it
unspoken expectations
ideals you used to play with
they've finally taken shape for us
what's good enough for you
is good enough for me
it's good enough
it's good enough for me
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
now you'll say
you're startin' to feel the push and pull
of what could be and never can
you mirror me stumblin' through those
old fashioned superstitions
i find too hard to break
oh maybe you're out of place
what's good enough for you
is good enough for me
it's good enough
it's good enough for me
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(good enough) for you
is good enough for me
it's good, it's good enough
it's good enough for me
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
old fashioned superstitions
i find too hard to break
oh maybe you're out of place
what's good enough for you
is good enough for me
it's good enough
it's good enough for me
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(good enough) for you
is good enough for me
it's good, it's good enough
it's good enough for me
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(scat)

i had to escape
the city was sticky and cruel
maybe i should have called you first
but i was dying to get to you
i was dreaming while i drove
the long straight road ahead, i

could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you is just burning me up inside

i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night
crept in your room
woke you from your sleep
to make love to you
is that all right?
i drove all night

what in this world
keeps us from tearing apart?
no matter where i go i hear
the beating of your heart
i think about you
when the night is cold and da-ah-ark

no one can move me the way that you do
nothing erases the feeling between me and you

i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night
crept in your room
woke you from your sleep
to make love to you
is that all right?
i drove all night

could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you is just burning me up inside

i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night
crept in your room
woke you from your sleep
to make love to you
i drove all night

taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you is just burning me up inside
i drove all night...

when you were mine
i gave you all of my money
time after time, huh
you done me wrong
just like a train
let all my friends come over and eat
you were so strange
you didn't have the decency to change the sheets
oh, when you were mine
used to let you wear all of my clothes
you were so fine
hah, baby, that's the reason that it hurt me so

i know (i know)
that you're going with another guy
i don't care (don't care)
'cause i love you, baby, that's no lie
i love you more than i did when you were mine

when you were mine
you were kinda sorta my best friend
so, i was blind
i let you fool around
i never cared
i never was the kind to make a fuss
when he was there
sleeping in between the two of us

i know (i know)
that you're going with another guy
i don't care (don't care)
'cause i love you, baby, that's no lie
i love you more than i did when you were mine

i love you more, i love you more, i love you more

i said, "i'm sorry, baby, i'm leaving you tonight
i found someone new
he's waiting in the car outside"
"aw honey, how could you do it?
we swore each other everlasting love"
i said, "well yeah, i know, but when we did
there was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"

money changes everything
i said money, money changes everything
we think we know what we're doing
that don't mean a thing
it's all in the past now
money changes everything

they shake your hand
and they smile, and they buy you a drink
they say, "we'll be your friends
we'll stick with you 'til the end"
ah, but everybody's only looking out for themselves
and you say, "well who can you trust?"
i'll tell you, it's just nobody else's money

money changes everything
i said money, money changes everything
you think you know what you're doing
we don't pull the strings
it's all in the past now
money changes everything


yeah, yeah, yeah, money
money changes everything
i said money, money changes everything
we think we know what we're doing
we don't know a thing
it's all in the past now
money changes everything

at the edge of my seat

to turn it around
yes, i'm waiting for your change of heart
at the edge of my seat
please turn it around

blind leading blind
never feel the laughter
search through time
nothing reveals the answer
if its truth that you're looking to find
and its nowhere outside of your mind
when i bide my time

waiting for your change of heart
it just takes a beat
to turn it around
yes, i'm waiting for your change of heart
at the edge of my seat
please turn it around

when i was eight i had a friend
with a pirate smile
make believe and play pretend
we were innocent and wild
hopped a fence and slammed the gate
running down my alleyway
in time to watch sally's pigeons fly

we loved to watch them dive and soar
circle in the sky
free as a bird from three to four
and never knowing why
neighbors pulled their wash back in
put away my barbie and ken
look out overhead
while sally's pigeons fly

i had a fool's confidence
that the world had no boundaries
but instincts and common sense
come in different quantities

my heart began to
skip to the beat
of the boy next door
she had her eye across the street
on someone shy and tall
we lived our dreams
and challenged fate
in tears, she told me she was late
and sally let his pigeons out to fly

on the dresser sits a frame
with a photograph
two little girls in ponytails
some twenty-one years back
she left one night with just a nod
was lost from some back alley job
i close my eyes and sally's pigeons fly
she never saw those birds again
and me, i can't remember when
a pirate smile hasn't made me cry
i close my eyes
and sally's pigeons fly
