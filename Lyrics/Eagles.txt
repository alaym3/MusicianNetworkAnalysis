on a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas
rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance
i saw a shimmering light
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
i had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway
i heard the mission bell
and i was thinking to myself
"this could be heaven or this could be hell"
then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor
i thought i heard them say

"welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
such a lovely face
plenty of room at the hotel california
any time of year (any time of year)
you can find it here"

her mind is tiffany-twisted
she got the mercedes benz, uh
she got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
that she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard
sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember
some dance to forget
so i called up the captain
"please bring me my wine"
he said, "we haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
and still those voices are calling from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say

"welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
such a lovely face
they living it up at the hotel california
what a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
bring your alibis"

mirrors on the ceiling
the pink champagne on ice
and she said: "we are all just prisoners here
of our own device"
and in the master's chambers
they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives
but they just can't kill the beast
last thing i remember, i was
running for the door
i had to find the passage back
to the place i was before
"relax," said the night man
"we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave!"

well, i'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
i've got seven women on my mind
four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
one says she's a friend of mine

take it easy, take it easy
don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
lighten up while you still can
don't even try to understand
just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

well, i'm a standing on a corner in winslow, arizona
and such a fine sight to see
it's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed ford
slowin' down to take a look at me

come on, baby, don't say maybe
i gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
we may lose, and we may win
though we will never be here again
so open up, i'm climbin' in
so take it easy

well i'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
got a world of trouble on my mind
lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
she's so hard to find

take it easy, take it easy
don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
come on baby, don't say maybe
i gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me, oh oh oh
oh we got it easy
we oughta take it easy

desperado, why don't you come to your senses
you've been out ridin' fences for so long now
oh, you're a hard one
i know that you've got your reasons
these things that are pleasin' you
can hurt you somehow
don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
she'll beat you if she's able
you know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
now it seems to me, some fine things
have been laid upon your table
but you only want the ones
that you can't get
desperado
oh, you ain't getting no younger
your pain and your hunger
they're driving you home
and freedom, oh, freedom
well that's just some people talking
your prison is walking through this world all alone
don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
the sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
it's hard to tell the night time from the day
and you're losing all your highs and lows
ain't it funny how the feeling goes
away...
desperado
why don't you come to your senses?
come down from your fences, open the gate
it may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
you better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
you better let somebody love you
before it's too late

one of these nights
one of these crazy old nights
we're gonna find out, pretty mama
what turns on your lights
the full moon is calling, the fever is high
and the wicked wind whispers and moans
you got your demons and you got desires
well, i got a few of my own

ooh, someone to be kind to
in between the dark and the light
ooh, coming right behind you
swear i'm gonna find you one of these nights

one of these dreams
one of these lost and lonely dreams, now
we're gonna find one
oh, one that really screams
i've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
i've been searching for an angel in white
i've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
and i can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

ooh, loneliness will blind you
in between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
ooh, coming right behind you
swear i'm gonna find you one of these nights


one of these nights
mmm, in between the dark and the light
comin' right behind you
swear i'm gonna find you
get you, baby, one of these nights
one of these nights
hoo, hoo-hoo
hoo, hoo-hoo
one of these nights
i can feel you
i can feel
one of these nights
comin' right behind you
swear i'm gonna find you, now
one of these nights
and it gets so dark
so dark and cold and lonely
one of these nights
one of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
one of these nights
swear i'm gonna find you
comin' right behind you, now
one of these nights
hoo, hoohoooo
one of these nights
and i wanna say, ahhh
one of these nights
one of these, one of these
one of these nights
comin' right behind you
swear i'm gonna find you
one of these nights
one of these nights
one of these crazy old nights
one of these nights

he was a hard-headed man
he was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
she held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
of the cold, cold city
he had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
they said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
they had one thing in common, they were good in bed
she'd say, "faster, faster. the lights are turnin' red."

life in the fast lane, surely makes you lose your mind
life in the fast lane, huh
are you with me so far?

eager for action and hot for the game
the coming attraction, the drop of a name
they knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
they threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
there were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
she pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
out every evening, until it was light
he was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

life in the fast lane, surely makes you lose your mind
life in the fast lane, huh
life in the fast lane, everything all the time
life in the fast lane, huh

blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
they didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
she said, "listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring."
"we've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing."
he said, "call the doctor. i think i'm gonna crash."
"the doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash."
they went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
they didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off

and it was life in the fast lane, surely makes you lose your mind
life in the fast lane, huh
life in the fast lane, everything all the time
life in the fast lane, huh

life in the fast lane
life in the fast lane

she came from providence
the one in rhode island
where the old world shadows hang
heavy in the air
she packed her hopes and dreams
like a refugee
just as her father came across the sea

she heard about a place people were smiling
they spoke about the red man's way
and how they loved the land
and they came from everywhere
to the great divide
seeking a place to stand
or a place to hide

down in the crowded bars
out for a good time
can't wait to tell you all
what it's like up there
and they called it paradise
i don't know why
somebody laid the mountains low
while the town got high

then the chilly winds blew down
across the desert
through the canyons of the coast
to the malibu
where the pretty people play
hungry for power
to light their neon way
and give them things to do

some rich men came and raped the land
nobody caught them
put up a bunch of ugly boxes
and jesus people bought them
and they called it paradise
the place to be
they watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea

you can leave it all behind
and sail to lahaina
just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
they even brought a neon sign: "jesus is coming"
brought the white man's burden down
brought the white man's reign

who will provide the grand design?
what is yours and what is mine?
because there is no more new frontier
we have got to make it here
we satisfy our endless needs and
justify our bloody deeds
in the name of destiny
and in the name of god

and you can see them there
on sunday morning
stand up and sing about
what it's like up there
they call it paradise
i don't know why
you call someplace paradise
kiss it goodbye

all alone at the end of the evening
when the bright lights have faded to blue
i was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
loved me and i never knew
you know i've always been a dreamer
(spent my life running 'round)
and it's so hard to change
(can't seem to settle down)
but the dreams i've seen lately
keep on turning out and burning out
and turning out the same

so put me on a highway
and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time

you can spend all your time making money
you can spend all your love making time
if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
would you still be mine?
and when you're looking for your freedom
(nobody seems to care)
and you can't find the door
(can't find it anywhere)
when there's nothing to believe in
still you're coming back, you're running back
you're coming back for more

so put me on a highway
and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time

take it to the limit
take it to the limit
come on and take it to the limit one more time
take it to the limit
take it to the limit
you gotta take it to the limit one more time
take it to the limit
take it to the limit
come on and take it to the limit one more time
take it to the limit
take it to the limit
take it to the limit
take it to the limit
come on and take it to the limit
you got to take it to the limit one more time

there's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
great expectations, everybody's watching you
people you meet, they all seem to know you
even your old friends treat you like you're something new

johnny-come-lately
the new kid in town
everybody loves you
so don't let them down

you look in her eyes; the music begins to play
hopeless romantics, here we go again
but after a while, you're lookin' the other way
it's those restless hearts that never mend

johnny-come-lately
the new kid in town
will she still love you
when you're not around?

there's so many things you should have told her
but night after night, you're willing to hold her
just hold her, tears on your shoulder

there's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
doesn't really matter which side you're on
you're walking away and they're talking behind you
they will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

where you've been lately?
there's a new kid in town
everybody loves him, don't they?
he's holding her, and you're still around

oh, my, my
there's a new kid in town
just another new kid in town
(ooh, hoo) everybody's talking 'bout the
(ooh, hoo) new kid in town
(ooh, hoo) everybody's walking like the
(ooh, hoo) new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
i don't want to hear it
there's a new kid in town
i don't want to hear it, ah ooh
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
everybody's talking
there's a new kid in town
people started walking
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town

well baby, there you stand
with your little head, down in your hand
oh, my god, you can't believe
it's happening again
your baby's gone, and you're all alone
and it looks like the end

and you're back out on the street
and you're trying to remember, ohh
how do you start it over?
you don't know if you can
you don't care much for a stranger's touch
but you can't hold your man

you never thought you'd be alone
this far down the line
and i know what's been on your mind
you're afraid it's all been wasted time

the autumn leaves have got you thinking
about the first time that you fell, fell
you didn't love the boy too much
no, no, you just
loved the boy too well
farewell

so you live from day to day
and you dream about tomorrow, oh
and the hours go by like minutes
and the shadows come to stay
so you, take a little something
to let them go away

and i could 'a done so many things, baby
if i could only stop my mind
from wanderin' what i left behind
and from worryin' 'bout this wasted time

(ooo-ooh)
another love has come and gone
(ooo-ooh)
and the years keep rushing on
i remember what you told me
before you, went out on your own
"sometimes to, keep it together
we've got to leave it alone"

so you can get on with your search, baby
and i can get on with mine
and maybe someday we will find
that it wasn't really wasted time

mmm-hmm
ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
ohh-ooh-ooh-mmm
mmm-mmmm-mmmm-mm

city girls just seem to find out early
how to open doors with just a smile
a rich old man and she won't have to worry
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style

late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
i guess every form of refuge has it's price
and it breaks her heart to think her love is only
given to a man with hands as cold as ice

so she tells him she must go out for the evening
to comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
but he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
she is headed for the cheatin' side of town

you can't hide your lyin' eyes
and your smile is a thin disguise
i thought by now you'd realize
there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

on the other side of town, a boy is waiting
with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
she drives on through the night, anticipating
because he makes her feel the way she used to feel

she rushes to his arms, they fall together
she whispers that it's only for a while
she swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
she pulls away and leaves him with a smile

you can't hide your lyin' eyes
and your smile is a thin disguise
i thought by now you'd realize
there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

she gets up and pours herself a strong one
and stares out at the stars up in the sky
another night, it's gonna be a long one
she draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

she wonders how it ever got this crazy
she thinks about a boy she knew in school
did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
she's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

my, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
you set it up so well, so carefully
ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
you're still the same old girl you used to be

you can't hide your lyin' eyes
and your smile is a thin disguise
i thought by now you'd realize
there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes

{​instrumental lead}​
it's another tequila sunrise
starin' slowly 'cross the sky said goodbye
he was just a hired hand
workin' on the dreams he planned to try
the days go by
every night when the sun goes down
just another lonely boy in town
and she's out runnin' 'round
she wasn't just another woman
and i couldn't keep from comin' on
it's been so long
oh and it's a hollow feelin' when
it comes down to dealin' friends
it never ends
{​instrumental}​
take another shot of courage
wonder why the right words never come
you just get numb
it's another tequila sunrise, this old world
still looks the same
another frame, mmm

every night i'm lying in bed
holding you close in my dreams
thinking about all the things that we said
and coming apart at the seams

we try to talk it over
but the words come out too rough

i know you were trying
to give me the best of your love

beautiful faces
and loud, empty places
look at the way that we live
wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
left us so little to give

that same old crowd
was like a cold dark cloud
that we could never rise above

but here in my heart
i give you the best of my love

oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love

i'm going back in time
and it's a sweet dream
it was a quiet night
and i would be all right
if i could go on sleeping

but every morning
i wake up and worry
what's gonna happen today
you see it your way
and i see it mine
but we both see it slippin' away

you know we always had each other baby
i guess that wasn't enough

oh, but here in my heart
i give you the best of my love

oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love
oh sweet darling
you get the best of my love

i like the way your sparkling earrings lay
against your skin so brown
and i want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
with a billion stars all around

'cause i got a peaceful easy feelin'
and i know you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standin'
on the ground

and i found out a long time ago
what a woman can do to your soul
aw but she can't take you any way
you don't already know how to go

and i got a peaceful easy feelin'
and i know you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standin'
on the ground


i get this feelin' i may know you
as a lover and a friend
this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
tells me i may never see you again

'cause i get a peaceful easy feelin'
and i know you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standin'
i'm already standin'
yes i'm already standin'
on the ground

whoo oh ooh

raven hair and ruby lips
sparks fly from her fingertips
echoed voices in the night
she's a restless spirit on an endless flight

woo hoo, witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo, witchy woman
she got the moon in her eye

she held me spellbound in the night
dancing shadows and firelight
crazy laughter in another room
and she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

woo hoo, witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo, witchy woman
she got the moon in her eye

ah, oh ah ah (waahaa)
ah, oh ah ah (waahaa)

well, i know you want a lover
let me tell you brother
she's been sleeping in the devil's bed
and there's some rumors going round, someone's underground
she can rock you in the night time 'til your skin turns red

woo hoo, witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo, witchy woman
she got the moon in her eye

look at us baby, up all night
tearing our love apart
aren't we the same two people who live
through years in the dark? ah ahh

every time i try to walk away
something makes me turn around and stay

and i can't tell you why

when we get crazy, it just ain't right
(try to keep your head, little girl)
girl, i get lonely, too
you don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(don't get caught in your little world)
cause i love you

nothing's wrong as far as i can see
we make it harder than it has to be

and i can't tell you why
no, baby, i can't tell you why
i can't tell you why


every time i try to walk away
something makes me turn around and stay

and i can't tell you why
no, no baby, i can't tell you why
i can't tell you why
i can't tell you why

bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
oh, what a christmas to have the blues
my baby's gone, i have no friends
to wish me greetings once again
choirs will be singing "silent night"
christmas carols by candlelight
please come home for christmas
please come home for christmas
if not for christmas, by new year's night
friends and relations send salutations
sure as the stars shine above
but this is christmas, yes, christmas my dear
the time of year to be with the ones you love
so won't you tell me you'll never more roam
christmas and new year's will find you home
there will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
and i'll be happy, happy once again
ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
and i'll be happy, christmas once again

well, i heard some people talkin' just the other day
and they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
but let me tell you i got some news for you and you'll soon find out it's true
and then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

'cause i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this vict'ry song

woo hoo hoo, my my
woo hoo hoo

the letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
but i guess you felt like you had to set things right
just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
you can see the stars and still not see the light
(that's right)

and i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this vict'ry song

woo hoo hoo, my my
woo hoo hoo


well i know it wasn't you who held me down
heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
so oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
and we never even know we have the key

but me, i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing (i will sing) this vict'ry song
'cause i'm already gone

yes, i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this vict'ry song
cause i'm already gone

yes, i'm already gone
already gone
all right, nighty-night
already gone
already gone
already gone

i used to hurry a lot, i used to worry a lot
i used to stay out till the break of day
oh, that didn't get it
it was high time i quit it
i just couldn't carry on that way

oh, i did some damage
i know it's true
didn't know i was so lonely
till i found you

you can go the distance
we'll find out
in the long run (in the long run)
we can handle some resistance
if our love is a strong one (is a strong one)

people talking about us
they got nothin' else to do
when it all comes down
we will still come through

in the long run
ooh, i want to tell you
it's a long run

you know i don't understand
why you don't treat yourself better
do the crazy things that you do
cause all the debutantes in houston, baby
couldn't hold a candle to you

did you do it for love?
did you do it for money?
did you do it for spite?
did you think you had to, honey?

who is gonna make it?
we'll find out
in the long run (in the long run)
i know we can take it
if our love is a strong one (is a strong one)

well, we're scared
but we ain't shakin'
kinda bent
but we ain't breakin'

in the long run
ooh, i want to tell you
it's a long run
in the long run
in the long run

gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
long, long, long, long

they were dueling, doolin-dalton
high or low, it was the same
easy money and faithless women
red-eye whiskey for the pain
go down, bill dalton, it must be god's will
two brothers lying dead in coffeyville
two voices call to you from where they stood
lay down your law books now
they're no damn good
better keep on moving, doolin-dalton
till your shadow sets you free
if you're fast, and if you're lucky
you will never see that hanging tree
well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
like graveyards filled with tombstones, waiting for the names
and a man could use his back, or use his brains
but some just went stir crazy, lord, cause nothing ever changed
until bill doolin met bill dalton
he was working cheap, just biding time
then he laughed and said, i'm going
and so he left that peaceful life behind
mmh

what kind of love have you got?
you should be home but you're not
a room full of noise and dangerous boys
still make you thirsty and hot
i heard about you and that man
there's just one thing i don't understand
you say he's a liar and he put out your fire
how come you still got his gun in your hand?
victim of love, i see a broken heart
you got your stories to tell
victim of love, it's such an easy part
and you know how to play it so well
some people never come clean
i think you know what i mean
you're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
looking for love in between
tell me your secrets, i'll tell you mine
this ain't no time to be cool
and tell all your girlfriends
your "been around the world" friends
that talk is for losers and fools
victim of love, i see a broken heart
i could be wrong, but i'm not, no i'm not
victim of love, we're not so far apart
show me, what kind of love have you got?
victim of love, i see a broken heart
i could be wrong, but i'm not
victim of love, we're not so far apart
what kind of love have you got?
victim of love, you're just a victim of love
i could be wrong, but i'm not, no i'm not
victim of love, now you're a victim of love
what kind of love have you got?
what kind of love have you got?
what kind of love have you got?
