when i find myself in times of trouble, mother mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"
and in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"

let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
whisper words of wisdom, let it be

and when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
there will be an answer, let it be
for though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer, let it be

let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
whisper words of wisdom, let it be


let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
whisper words of wisdom, let it be

and when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
i wake up to the sound of music, mother mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"

let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
oh, there will be an answer, let it be
let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
oh, there will be an answer, let it be
let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
whisper words of wisdom, let it be

something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she woos me

i don't want to leave her now
you know i believe and how

somewhere in her smile she knows
that i don't need no other lover
something in her style that shows me

i don't want to leave her now
you know i believe and how

you're asking me will my love grow
i don't know, i don't know
you stick around, now it may show
i don't know, i don't know


something in the way she knows
and all i have to do is think of her
something in the things she shows me

i don't want to leave her now
you know i believe and how

i read the news today—oh, boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well, i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn't notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords

i saw a film today, oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book

i'd love to turn you on
(seven, eight, nine, ten)

*alarm clock rings*
woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up i noticed i was late
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke
and somebody spoke and i went into a dream

ahh-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

i read the news today—oh, boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall

i'd love to turn you on

never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way
never could be any other way

blackbird singing in the dead of night
take these broken wings and learn to fly
all your life
you were only waiting for this moment to arise

blackbird singing in the dead of night
take these sunken eyes and learn to see
all your life
you were only waiting for this moment to be free

blackbird fly, blackbird fly
into the light of the dark black night


blackbird fly, blackbird fly
into the light of the dark black night

blackbird singing in the dead of night
take these broken wings and learn to fly
all your life
you were only waiting for this moment to arise

you were only waiting for this moment to arise
you were only waiting for this moment to arise

ah, look at all the lonely people!
ah, look at all the lonely people!

eleanor rigby
picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
lives in a dream
waits at the window
wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
who is it for?

all the lonely people
where do they all come from?
all the lonely people
where do they all belong?

father mckenzie
writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
no one comes near
look at him working
darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
what does he care?

all the lonely people
where do they all come from?
all the lonely people
where do they all belong?

ah, look at all the lonely people!
ah, look at all the lonely people!

eleanor rigby
died in the church and was buried along with her name
nobody came
father mckenzie
wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
no one was saved

all the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people!)
where do they all come from?
all the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people!)
where do they all belong?

i am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
see how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
i'm crying

sitting on a cornflake
waiting for the van to come
corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody tuesday
man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

i am the eggman, i am the eggman
i am the walrus, goo goo a'joob

mister city p'liceman sitting, pretty little p'licemen in a row
see how they fly like lucy in the sky, see how they run
i'm crying, i'm crying
i'm crying, i'm crying

yellow-matter custard
dripping from a dead dog's eye
crab a locker fishwife, pornographic priestess
boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

i am the eggman, they are the egg men
i am the walrus, goo goo a'joob

sitting in an english garden waiting for the sun
if the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the english rain

i am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
they are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
i am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (good pity)
g'goo goo g'joob

expert, textpert, choking smokers
don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
see how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
i'm crying

semolina pilchard
climbing up the eiffel tower
elementary penguin singing hare krishna

umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“villain, take my purse
if ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body
and give the letters which thou findst about me
to edmund earl of gloucester: seek him out upon the english party
oh, untimely death, death–”
“i know thee well, a serviceable villain; as duteous to the vices of thy mistress as badness would desire”
“what, is he dead?”
“sit you down, father; rest you”

there are places i'll remember
all my life, though some have changed
some forever, not for better
some have gone and some remain

all these places had their moments
with lovers and friends, i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life, i've loved them all

but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new

though i know i'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i'll often stop and think about them
in my life, i love you more


though i know i'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i'll often stop and think about them
in my life, i love you more

in my life, i love you more

i look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
i look at the floor, and i see it needs sweeping
still my guitar gently weeps

i don't know why nobody told you
how to unfold your love
i don't know how someone controlled you
they bought and sold you

i look at the world, and i notice it's turning
while my guitar gently weeps
with every mistake, we must surely be learning
still my guitar gently weeps


i don't know how you were diverted
you were perverted too
i don't know how you were inverted
no one alerted you

i look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
(i look) look at you all
still my guitar gently weeps

oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
they slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
possessing and caressing me

jai guru deva, om
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world

images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
they call me on and on across the universe
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

jai guru deva, om
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world

sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
inciting and inviting me
limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
it calls me on and on across the universe

jai guru deva, om
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world

jai guru deva
jai guru deva
jai guru deva
jai guru deva

picture yourself in a boat on a river
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes

cellophane flowers of yellow and green
towering over your head
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
and she's gone

lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ahh

follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high

newspaper taxis appear on the shore
waiting to take you away
climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and you're gone

lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ahh

picture yourself on a train in a station
with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
the girl with kaleidoscope eyes

lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ahh

lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ahh

lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ahh

let me take you down, 'cause i'm going to
strawberry fields
nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
strawberry fields forever

living is easy with eyes closed
misunderstanding all you see
it's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
it doesn't matter much to me

let me take you down, 'cause i'm going to
strawberry fields
nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
strawberry fields forever

no one i think is in my tree
i mean, it must be high or low
that is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
that is, i think it's not too bad

let me take you down, 'cause i'm going to
strawberry fields
nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
strawberry fields forever

always, no, sometimes think it's me
but you know, i know when it's a dream
i think i know, i mean—er—yes, but it's all wrong
that is, i think i disagree

let me take you down, 'cause i'm going to
strawberry fields
nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
strawberry fields forever
strawberry fields forever
strawberry fields forever
