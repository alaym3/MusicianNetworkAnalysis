well, you almost had me fooled
told me that i was nothing without you
oh, but after everything you've done
i can thank you for how strong i have become

’cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i'll just say this is i wish you farewell

i hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

i'm proud of who i am
no more monsters, i can breathe again
and you said that i was done
well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'cause i can make it on my own, oh
and i don't need you, i found a strength i’ve never known
i’ll bring thunder, i'll bring rain, oh-oh
when i’m finished, they won't even know your name

you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i'll just say this is i wish you farewell

i hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

oh, sometimes i pray for you at night
someday, maybe you'll see the light
oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
but some things only god can forgive

i hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

i used to live in the darkness
dress in black, act so heartless
but now i see that colors are everything
got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
got back the stars in my eyes, too
yeah, now i see the magic inside of me

yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
but i'm falling right back in love with being alive
dreaming in light, light, lights
this kitty cat lost her mind
been lookin' for a star-sent sign that i'll be alright
look to the skies

i found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
trust me, i know life is scary
but just put those colors on, girl
come and play along with me tonight

i'd forgot how to daydream
so consumed with the wrong things
but in the dark, i realized this life is short
and deep down, i'm still a child
playful eyes, wide and wild
i can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold

and i know that i'm still fucked up
but aren't we all, my love?
darling, our scars make us who we are, are
so when the winds are howling strong
and you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart

you'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
trust me, i know life is scary
but just put those colors on, girl
come and play along with me tonight
you gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
trust me, i know the ghosts will try to find you
but just put those colors on, girl
come and paint the world with me tonight, night-night
night, night, night

ooh, ooh-ah, ah, ah
ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

i found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
trust me, i know life is scary

but just put those colors on, girl
come and paint the world with me tonight

oh, put those colors on, girl
come and paint the world with me tonight
ooh, ah, ah
come and paint the world with me tonight

been a prisoner of the past
had a bitterness when i looked back
was telling everyone it's not that bad
’til all my shit hit the fan

i know i'm always like
telling everybody, "you don't gotta be a victim"
life ain’t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

i think it's time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

had a boogeyman under my bed
putting crazy thoughts inside my head
always whispering, "it's all your fault"
he was telling me, "no, you're not that strong"

i know i'm always like
telling everybody, "you don’t gotta be a victim"
life ain’t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

so, i think it’s time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
learn to let go, learn to let go
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
learn to let go, learn to let go

i'm done reliving my bad decisions
i see now maybe there’s a reason why
i've been through hell and back
yeah, honestly, it's all made me who i am
holding on's a waste of time
gotta learn to let go in life

so, i think it's time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
learn to let go, learn to let go
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
learn to let go, learn to let go

i'm not a stranger to the dark
"hide away," they say
"cause we don't want your broken parts"
i've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"run away," they say
"no one will love you as you are"

but i won't let them break me down to dust
i know that there's a place for us
for we are glorious

when the sharpest words wanna cut me down
i'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
i am brave, i am bruised
i am who i'm meant to be, this is me
look out 'cause here i come

well, fire away 'cause today, i won't let the shame sink in
we are bursting through the barricades
and reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
yeah, that's what we've become

won't let them break me down to dust
i know that there's a place for us
for we are glorious

when the sharpest words wanna cut me down

but in my dreams, i see 'em come and rescue me
look up in the sky and there they'll be
i bet you'll think of me then

gonna say, "ooh"
"look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
damn, if it ain't true
they're coming back for me
they're coming back for me, yeah

as i leave this earth and sail into the infinite cosmic universe, the wars, the triumphs, the beauty, and the bloodshed, the ocean of human endeavor, it all grows quiet, insignificant. i'm nothing more than recycled stardust and borrowed energy, born from a rock spinning in the ether. i watch my life backwards and forwards and i feel free. nothing is real, love is everything, and i know nothing.

one, two, three, four, one

i got too many people (da-da-da, da)
i got left to prove wrong
all those motherfuckers (da-da-da, da)
been too mean for too long
and i'm so sick of crying, yeah
darlin’, what's it for?
i could fight forever, oh
but life's too short

don’t let the bastards get you down, oh, no
don't let the assholes wear you out
don't let the mean girls take the crown
don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
don't let the bastards take you down

been underestimated my entire life
i know people gonna talk shit
and darlin', that's fine
but they won’t break my spirit
i won’t let 'em win
i’ll just keep on living
keep on living, oh, the way i wanna live

don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
don't let the assholes wear you out
don't let the mean girls take the crown
don’t let the scumbags screw you 'round
don't let the bastards get you down

don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
don't let the assholes wear you out
don't let the mean girls take your crown
don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
don't let the bastards take you down

na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey

so was that a good one?
should we go again?

i feel loved, darling, i feel used
nobody makes me feel the way you do
and sometimes i, sometimes i, sometimes i just can't stand it
isn't that just the thing about us?
i'm still thinking you could be the one
but you're always, you're always, you're always taking me for granted

i got something i gotta get off of my chest
i've been staying up while you're sleeping in my bed

i don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'cause you hurt me and i don't react
i've been building up this thing for months
oh, resentment

i know you better than you know yourself
and there's a part of you that you won't help
you say you can't do it, just do it, just do it for my sake
it's a shame knowing we could be good
that you could treat me better if you really wanted to
and if you can't do it for my sake, then do it for our sake

i don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'cause you hurt me and i don't react
i've been building up this thing for months
oh, resentment

don't know how to leave or how to stay
so i've been talking to strangers
'cause i can't talk to you anymore that way
did i let you down? 'cause you let me down
but you would never say that i let you down
but you let me down, you let me down

but i don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'cause you hurt me and i'm more than sad
i've been building up this thing for months
oh, resentment

last night, i had enough of you
i put on the brakes
and i could tell you took it hard
it was all over your face
that you were slippin'
and flippin'
but here is the sitch
i signed up for a man
but you are just a bitch

you should know
that i love
you a lot
but i just can't date a dude with a vag'

when we fell in love, you made my heart drop
and you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
but you cry 'bout this and whine about that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back
yeah, i think you're hot, i think you're alright
but you're actin' like a chick all the time
you were cool and now you're not, just like that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back

when i first met you, panties droppin'
every time i saw you, it was on and
one day you asked if we could just talk
and that's the reason why i'm walkin'
if i am honest
i'm just not hooked on your phonics
i'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
i just wanted one thing from you
and you got confused

you should know
that i love
you a lot
but i just can't date a dude with a vag'

when we fell in love, you made my heart drop
and you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
but you cry 'bout this and whine about that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back
yeah, i think you're hot, i think you're alright
but you're actin' like a chick all the time
you were cool and now you're not, just like that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back

when you grow a pear, you can call me back
when you grow a pear, you can call me back
grow a pair, you can call me back
when you grow a pear, you can call me back
oh
grow a pear, you can call me back
and no, i don't want to see your mangina
when you grow a pear, you can call me back

when we fell in love, you made my heart drop
and you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
but you cry 'bout this and whine about that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back
yeah, i think you're hot, i think you're alright
but you're actin' like a chick all the time
you were cool and now you're not, just like that
when you grow a pear, you can call me back

you could ride a unicorn to school
and if you fall off, you'd have healthcare
(no, you don’t)
and if you finish school, you'd go to college for free
that makes sense and that's fair
(no, it’s not)
and if you were a lady
then you own your lady parts
just like a man goes to a dealership
and then he owns a car

vroom, vroom
fuck you (fuck you)

you won't have to climb a wall
(yes, you will!)
and if you are a boy who loves a boy

and if you are a lady and you do your lady work
then you will make as many dollars as the boys
not just two thirds
