right now, he's probably slow dancing
with a bleached-blond tramp
and she's probably getting frisky
right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'cause she can't shoot a whiskey
right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
showing her how to shoot a combo
and he don't know

i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

right now, she's probably up singing some
white-trash version of shania karaoke
right now, she's probably saying, "i'm drunk"
and he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
right now, he's probably dabbing on
three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
oh, and he don't know

oh, that i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

i might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'cause the next time that he cheats
oh, you know it won't be on me
no, not on me

'cause i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
oh, before he cheats
oh

i'm sorry, but i'm just a girl
not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
i'm pretty good at keepin' it together
i hold my composure, for worse or for better
so i apologize if you don't like what you see
but sometimes my emotions get the best of me
and falling apart is as human as it gets
you can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

you can pretty lie and say it's okay
you can pretty smile and just walk away
pretty much fake your way through anything
but you can't cry pretty

oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
it don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
a picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

you can pretty lie and say it's okay
you can pretty smile and just walk away
pretty much fake your way through anything
but you can't cry pretty

you can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
when all your mascara is going to waste
when things get ugly, you just gotta face
that you can't cry pretty

oh no, you can't
ooh, yeah

you can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
when all your mascara is going to waste
when things get ugly, you just gotta face
that you can't cry pretty

jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
out in the shack with a blue tick hound
broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
the kind that a rich man can't turn down
she caught the eye of an oil man dancing
one summer night in a dime store dress
she had the looks, he had the mansion
and you can figure out the rest

it was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
sippin' on champagne
she was all uptown, wearing that white gown
takin' his last name

she could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
and up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah, it's all gonna be alright
and just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
yeah, they're ringin'

jenny was hosting junior league parties
and havin' dinner at the country club
everyone thought they were ken and barbie
but ken was always gettin' way too drunk
saturday night, after a few too many
he came home ready to fight
and all his money could never save jenny
from the devil livin' in his eyes

it was all bruises, covered in makeup
dark sunglasses
and that next morning, sitting in the back pew
praying with the baptist

she could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
and up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah, it's all gonna be alright
you just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
yeah, they're ringin'

jenny slipped somethin' in his tennessee whiskey
no law man was ever gonna find
and how he died is still a mystery
but he hit a woman for the very last time

she could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah, it's all gonna be alright
and just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
yeah, they're ringin'

she was drivin' last friday on the way to cincinnati
on a snow-white christmas eve
goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
with the baby in the backseat
fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
on faith and gasoline
it'd been a long hard year
she had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
she was goin' way too fast
before she knew it
she was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she didn't even have time to cry
she was so scared
she threw her hands up in the air

"jesus, take the wheel
take it from my hands
'cause i can't do this on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i'm on
jesus, take the wheel"

it was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
sleepin' like a rock
and for the first time in a long time
she bowed her head to pray
she said, "i'm sorry for the way
i've been livin' my life
i know i've got to change
so from now on tonight"

"jesus, take the wheel
take it from my hands
'cause i can't do this on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i'm on
oh, jesus, take the wheel"
"oh, i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i'm on
from this road i'm on
jesus, take the wheel
oh, take it, take it from me"

oh, woah, ooh

dry lightning cracks across the skies
those storm clouds gather in her eyes
her daddy was a mean old mister
mama was an angel in the ground
the weatherman called for a twister
she prayed blow it down

there’s not enough rain in oklahoma
to wash the sins out of that house
there’s not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past

shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away

she heard those sirens screamin' out
her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
she locked herself in the cellar
listened to the screaming of the wind
some people called it taking shelter
she called it sweet revenge

shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away

there’s not enough rain in oklahoma
to wash the sins out of that house
there’s not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past

shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away

blown away
blown away
blown away
blown away

she's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
just tryna make a livin'
workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
in a run-down kitchen
when you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
it's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good christian

she said, "i don't drink
but sometimes i need a stiff drink
sippin' from a highball glass
let the world fade away"
she said, "i don't smoke
but sometimes i need a long drag
yeah, i know it might sound bad
but sometimes i need a smoke break"

but sometimes i wanna pop that top
take a swig and make the world stop
and watch it fade away"
he said, "i don't smoke

yeah, when things get tough
sometimes i need a smoke break"
yeah

two black cadillacs driving in a slow parade
headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
one is for his wife
the other for the woman who loved him at night
two black cadillacs meeting for the first time

and the preacher said he was a good man
and his brother said he was a good friend
but the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
bye bye, bye bye
yeah they took turns laying a rose down
threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
he’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

two black cadillacs
two black cadillacs

two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone

they shared a crimson smile and just walked away
and left the secret at the grave

let me make one thing clear
you can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
no pick up lines, i came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
but sitting there across the room
i couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
yeah, my heart might be breaking
but, this seat ain't taken
and you've got me thinkin'

we should be drinking alone, together
drownin' the pain is better
with somebody else who got problems
we ain't gonna solve 'em
but misery loves company
tonight all i need is a stranger
lips with a whiskey chaser
and a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
oh, we should be drinking alone (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
we should be drinking alone, together (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

i don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
but, i know just what to do
it starts with a bottle of good reposado
and ends with a shooter or two
tomorrow when the sun comes up
tonight’s the night that never was
baby, just forget my name
won't be your one and only
but just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

we should be drinking alone
'cause drownin' the pain is better
with somebody else who got problems
we ain't gonna solve 'em
but misery loves company
tonight all i need is a stranger
lips with a whiskey chaser
and a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
oh, we should be drinking alone
drinking alone, drinking alone (together)
maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (we should be drinking alone)
drinking alone, drinking alone
baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

i'll pretend that i care
baby, pull up a chair
we'll stay here 'til they make us go home

we should be drinking alone (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
oh, we should be drinking alone, together
drownin' the pain is better
with somebody else who got problems
we ain't gonna solve 'em
but misery loves company
tonight all i need is a stranger
lips with a whiskey chaser
and a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
oh, we should be drinking alone (drinking alone, drinking alone) together

but i can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
red wine, good times, no i don't mind being with everyone else
and then there's nights like tonight that i, i want you to myself

and tonight, i wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights and i love the way you look in a firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

i wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
i wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
you pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
baby, we won't need a song
we'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
what are we waiting on?

and tonight, i wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights and i love the way you look in a firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

it was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
all dressed in white
going to the church that night
she had his box of letters in the passenger seat
sixpence in a shoe
something borrowed, something blue
and when the church doors opened up wide
she put her veil down
trying to hide the tears
oh, she just couldn't believe it
she heard the trumpets from the military band
and the flowers fell out of her hand

baby, why'd you leave me?
why'd you have to go?
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance
standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

the preacher man said, "let us bow our heads and pray
lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
then they handed her a folded up flag
and she held on to all she had left of him
oh, and what could have been
and then the guns rang one last shot
and it felt like a bullet in her heart

baby, why'd you leave me?
why'd you have to go?
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance
standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
why'd you have to go?
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
oh, i'll never know

it's like i'm looking from a distance
standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

line of limousines leaves one by one
the prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
black mascara's already run
but the tears keep flowin'
you can blame it on hate or blame it on guns
but mama's ain't supposed to bury their sons
left a hole in her heart and it still ain't done
the bullet keeps on goin'

through every branch of his family tree
every birthday that he'll never see
every chance to live a good life that was stolen
through the son he'll never get to raise
his daughter on her wedding day
wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'till every heart that's left to break is broken
the bullet keeps on goin'

the grass grows back around the stone
and friends stop checkin' in on the phone
the camera crews have all moved on

every birthday that he'll never see
every chance to live a good life that was stolen

the one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'cause once i do, i know it won't leave me alone
it haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
but still, i just can't make myself delete it from my phone

that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
i know, i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it
that song that we made love to
that we made love to, yeah

i know i'm contradicting everything i said
but i wanna turn it up when i'm lyin' in this bed
pull the sheets over my head
drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
i know i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it
that song (that song, that song)
that we made love to (that song, that song)
that we made love to, yeah

me and you, you and me
on repeat, on repeat
me and you, you and me
on repeat, on repeat

that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
it breaks me, it makes me
wanna hear it again and again and again
that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
i know i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it
that song (that song, that song)
that we made love to (that song, that song)
that we made love to, yeah

that song, that song, that song
that song, that song, that song
that song, that song, that song
that song that we made love to, that we made love to, yeah

she's waiting, praying that he don't drive tonight
she's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'cause it's been on now for three days straight
he’s been nowhere to be found
probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
she called up his mama and his friends in town
but they ain't seen him
another night of no sleepin'

round and around and around they go
will it end? nobody knows
she's all cried out on the kitchen floor
spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

he's in a hotel room with the tv on
gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
he'd quit if he could
but one down, two down, three down, four
can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore

oh, 'round and around and around they go
will it end? nobody knows
he's passed out on the bathroom floor
spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

this ain't a game
nobody wins
yeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins
again and again, again and again, again and again

so, 'round and around and around they go
will this end? nobody knows
can't live like this anymore
spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles
yeah, spinnin' bottles
spinnin' bottles

it's two kids flying down the hall in the morning into our bedroom
it's a creaky board on the front porch
you swear you're gonna fix it soon
it's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
give a little thanks to the man upstairs
it's the feeling i get, baby, when i look at you

it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
and it ain't a mansion on a hill
it's perfectly imperfect
it's worth more than it's worth
it's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
this is our kingdom

it's been late nights, a few good fights
wouldn't sleep until we worked things out
it's been long days of leanin' on faith
even when we had our doubts
barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
all the hard times, no, i wouldn't trade a minute
we've come so far, it made us who we are
right here, right now

it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
and it ain't a mansion on a hill
it's perfectly imperfect
it's worth more than it's worth
it's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
and this is our kingdom
this is our, this is our, this is our kingdom
oh, yeah, this is our kingdom

no, it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
and it ain't a mansion on a hill
it's perfectly imperfect
it's worth more than it's worth
it's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
this is our kingdom
oh, yeah
this is our, this is our kingdom
this is our kingdom

it's our names carved out on that old oak tree
pictures on the wall of you and me
it's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
it's the light, it's the love living in this place
it's church on sunday, tire swings
good and the bad times
praying on our knees
thanking the lord for this beautiful life
the love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah

oh, this is our kingdom
this is our kingdom, yeah
this is our kingdom
it's pictures on the wall of you and me
thanking the lord, praying on our knees
in our kingdom

oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh

you better take it from me
that boy is like a disease
you're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
and you're wondering why you can't get free
he's like a curse, he's like a drug
you'll get addicted to his love
you wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'cause you can't live without one more touch

he's a, a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
you better run for your life

oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh

i see that look on your face
you ain't hearing what i say
so i'll say it again, 'cause i been where you been
and i know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
don't even look in his eyes
he'll tell you nothing but lies
and you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
if you listen to me and take my advice

he's a, a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
you better run for your life

run, run away
don't let him mess with your mind
he'll tell you anything you wanna hear
he'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
but just remember

he's a, a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
you better run for your life

(oh, oh)
oh, you better run for your life
(oh, oh)
oh, you better run for your life
