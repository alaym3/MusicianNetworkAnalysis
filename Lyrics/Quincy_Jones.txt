i did my best
but i guess my best wasn't good enough
'cause here we are
back where we were before
seems nothin' ever changes
we're back to being strangers
wondering if we ought to stay
or head on out the door

just once
can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong?
why we never last for very long
what are we doin' wrong?
just once
can we find a way to finally make it right?
to make the magic last for more than just one night
if we could just get to it
i know we could break through it
(hmm hmmmm)

i gave my all
but i think my all may have been too much
'cause lord knows we're not getting anywhere
seems we're always blowin'
whatever we've got goin'
and it seems at times with all we've got
we haven't got a prayer
just once
can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong?
why the good times never last for long
where are we goin' wrong?
just once
can we find a way to finally make it right?
to make the magic last for more than just one night
i know we could break through it
if we could just get to it

just once
i want to understand
why it always comes back to goodbye
why can't we get ourselves in hand?
and admit to one another
we're no good without each other
take the best and make it better
find a way to stay together

just once
can we find a way to finally make it right?
whoa, to make the magic last for more than just one night
i know we could break through it
if we could just get to it
just once
whoa oh, we can get to it
just once

ice-t, let me kick my credentials
a young player, bred in south central
l.a., home of the bodybag
you wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
i used to walk in stores and yell: "lay down!"
you flinch an inch - ak spray down
but i was lucky cause i never caught the hard time
i was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
all my homies died or caught the penzo
lost their diamonds, cops towed their benzos
livin that life that we thought was it
fast lanin, but the car flipped
i'm not gonna lie to ya, cause i don't lie
i just kick thick game, some people say: why?
cause i'm back on the block, i got my life back
so i school the fools about the fast track
i get static from the style of my technique
profanity, the blatant way in which i speak
but the dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
you don't know the dude? quincy's his first name
he told me: "ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
you let 'em tell you what to say and what to write
your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
rap on my record, man, kimiko, send ice the beat"
the dude is def no doubt, what can i say?
the man can roll with ice-t or michael j

i'm back, on the block, on the screen
i'm on the wax, i'm on the stage, i'm on the scene
i'm on the case, just like an attorney
the dude took me on a magic journey
to dance in france, alone in rome
on the farmlands of nebraska, the cold of alaska
the heat of the motherland
to be with my brotherman
on top of a snowcapped mountain i'm scoutin
what another man saw in a race of people
to see him give his life for the price of equal
the highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
the song of songs we heard david sing them
he showed me me when i was young and hung out
he showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
he showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
but tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block
stokie's just stokie, mama
(stokie's stokie)
and one by one each woman he kiss
(he kiss her and she gon' fall in love)
stokie's just stokie, you know?
(stokie's stokie)
till someone shows that they care enough
(ain't nothin gonna bother stokie much)
some say they can't take it no more
(comin here, comin here startin stuff)
but dude is back on duty fo' sho'
(back on the block to stay)
they say he ain't gonna be with it
(comin back, comin back to the street)
but dude he know you'll never forget it
(back on the block to stay)

back up and give the brother room
to let poetry bloom to whom
it may concern or consume
as i reminisce before this
the bliss that exist
but now we brought about a twist
cause i remember of my people bleedin
put through slavery and killed for bravery
we shoulda got our freedom much sooner
you never seen a blackman on the honeymooners
but now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
the elevation of a people built is so
jesse jackson, miss america, a black one
no more livin for just a small fraction
i was once told by the dude that knowledge is a food
to nourish, so to conclude
this from an asiatic descendant, big daddy is shocked

an everlasting omnipresence is my present
state of being, seeing the unpleasant
sight of righteous souls live like peasants
the mind stunts growth in adolescence
my insight enables me to enlight
the weakest of minds, and i put 'em in flight
as i transcend, a-scend or de-scend
re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
the powerful spirits of our ancestors
for those that don't know how god blessed us
because man messed up, the media dressed up
lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
confused, but i've seen it all before
from babylon to the third world war
i'm more than a man, i'm more like an entity
back on the block, and this time my identity

compliment what she does
send her roses just because
if it's violins she loves
let them play
dedicate her favorite song
and hold her closer
all night long
love her today
find one hundred ways

don't forget there could be
an old lover in her memory
if you need her so much more
why don't you say
maybe she has it in her mind
that she's just wasting her time
ask her to stay
find one hundred ways

bein' cool won't help
you keep a love warm
you'll just blow your chance
take the time to open up your heart
that's the secret of romance
sacrifice if you care
buy her some moonlight to wear
if there's one more star she wants
go all the way
in your arms tonight
she'll reflect
that she owes you the sweetest of debts
if she wants to pay
find one hundred ways


in your arms tonight

everything must change
nothing stays the same
everyone will change
no one stays the same
the young become the old
and mysteries do unfold
‘cause that’s the way of time
nothing and no one goes unchanged

there are not many things in life
you can be sure of, except
rain comes from the clouds
sun lights up the sky
and hummingbirds do fly

winter turns to spring
a wounded heart will heal
but never much too soon
yes, everything must change
the young become the old
and mysteries do unfold
‘cause that’s the way of time
nothing and no one goes unchanged
there are not many things in life
you can be sure of, except...


except
rain comes from the clouds
sun lights up the sky
and hummingbirds to fly
rain comes from the clouds (rain comes from the clouds)
sun lights up the sky (sun lights up the sky)
and hummingbirds to fly (oh, hummingbirds do fly)
rain comes from the clouds (rain comes from the clouds)
and sun lights up the sky (sun lights up the sky)
and hummingbirds do fly (and hummingbirds do fly)
rain comes from the clouds
sun lights up the sky
and music makes me cry

don'tcha' go makin no mojo moves
'round the dude
(don't try no funny bizness.)
don'tcha' be coppin no attitude
with the dude
(hey, hey, here comes the dude )
the dude speaks:
hey everybody in the neighborhood
the beauty's on duty, better hear me good
sister e-flat tomato, brother b-flat balloon
somethin' funky's goin' down, better listen to my tune
i graduated from the college of the street
i got a p.h.d. in how to make ends meet
inflation in the nation don't bother me
'cause i'm a scholar with a dollar
you can plainly see/
bridge:
he's a winner 'cause it's in his blood
ain't nobody whose out there like him
any corner in the neighborhood
that's the place that you'll always find him
soft talkin' with a rap so sweet
(he does it good )
ladies call him the candy rapper
(they want his love.)
he's the only one that's really cool
(he's really cool)
that's the reason why he's the dude
chorus:
who is it
that ain't got time for foolish talkin'?
(it's the dude )
who is it

verse ii
don'tcha' go mess with
his walkin' stick— not the dude
(don't try no funny bizness )
don't you double-cross him
he's super slick— he's the dude
(hey, hey, here come the dude )
the dude speaks again:
i'm a stone cold taker
i'm a piggy bank shaker
an' i don't waste my time talkin' trash
so if you go to my school
you gotta learn this rule —
don't let your mouth write a check
that your body can't cash
if you never had it
don't pay it no mind
i know you're gonna get it
if you take a little time
take a piece from the east
a piece from the west
put it where it feels good —
let the dude do the rest
chant:
see him steppin' down the street
no forgettin', he's the dude
see him steppin' down the street
no forgettin', he's the dude

or possibly, blocking me from opening doors
and everybody surprised now
3 years down the road, but where was everybody
when albums wasn't exposed

cause i in this thing to stay
bob on beast, bob on blast, bob is everything you say
it's a finesse, an expression, an emphasis on my name
talking record labels corporations this is entertainment

i got a ph.d. in how to make ends meet
i graduated from the college in the street
inflation in the nation don't bother me
cause i'm a scholar when it comes to the almighty dollar

money, money, money, money is...
money's on my mind
money, money, money moves me
i even like the money sign
i'm so mean with the green
i make a dollar want to holler
make a mark want to bark
make a pound want to frown
money, money, money, money is...
money's on my mind
ain't no such thing as dirty money
the rich folks know what i mean
and money ain't got no smell, let me tell you
how some green can keep you clean

money, money, money, money is...
money's on my mind
money, money, money moves me
i even like the money sign
so mean with the green
i make a yen want to grin
make a franc want to clank
make a twenty look plenty
money, money, money, money is...
the only thing that's on my mind
i'd rather be well-to-do
than have to i-o-u
i think my friend, brother getty would agree
there's only one thing that money can't buy
and that is poverty

money, money, money, money is...
money's on my mind
money, money, money moves me
i even like the money sign
i'm a stone-cold taker
i'm a piggy-bank shaker
i use every ruse, talking trash
so if you go to my school
you got to learn to this rule:
don't let your mouth write a check
that your body can't cash
money, money, money, money is...
money's on my mind
money, money, money moves me
i even like the money sign
i'm so mean with the green
i make a dollar want to holler
make a mark want to bark
make a pound want to frown
money, money, money, money is...
the only thing that's on my mind
my eyes start to blinkin' when i flash on some lincolns!
my mind start relaxin' when my pocket is full of jacksons! 

can you feel it
touching you
don't you feel it
my tempratures risin'
and it's not surprisin'
but when you're close to me girl
it's so tantalizin'
i can't help myself
i get so excited
why do i act in this fashion?
why can't i control my passion?
some call it... soul fire
i call it love's desire
come on up, i'm gonna take you higher
i'm gonna give you warmth, guaranteed to inspire
when we meet
ain't it sweet
and when we greet
feel that body heat
feel that body..
can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it
feel that body heat?
feel that body heat
body heat
give me your hand
and i'll give you mine
oh, fire and water
mixed up in one sign
touching you
inside of you, baby
oh, i like it
i like it a lot
come on baby
give it all you got
i'm gettin' warmer
but just wait til i get hot
'cause i'm a genie nonfiction
rub me til i feel the friction
some call it... soul fire
i call it love's desire
come on up, i'm gonna take you higher
i'm gonna give you warmth, guaranteed to inspire
when we meet
feel the heat
ain't sweet
feel that body heat
feel that body heat
your fahrenheit is outta sigh
it's alright, i dig body heat
i dig body
your centigrade could stand some shade
but it's okay 'cause i dig body heat
i dig body heat
can you feel it
call you feel it
can you feel it
feel that body heat? 

loving you came easily
yet it made me blind to all there was to see
now my heart is filled with pain
you understand i never will
how did it come to be that you don't love me still?
now it's getting to be plain

if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door

though some days the blues was our parade
still we marched through all the tears we made
now i find it wasn't no game of charades that you played

i did my best to bring you joy
how can you just leave me like a broken toy?
where's the man that once was you?
if i could be within your mind
i would never think to treat you this unkind
the pain you caused will come to you
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
i bet you wouldn't go
if you really cared about anyone else
i know you wouldn't hurt me
if you cared about more than yourself
you wouldn't walk out the door 

don' worry baby, just hold on
