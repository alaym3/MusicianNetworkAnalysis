would you know my name if i saw you in heaven?
would it be the same if i saw you in heaven?
i must be strong and carry on
‘cause i know i don't belong
here in heaven

would you hold my hand if i saw you in heaven?
would you help me stand if i saw you in heaven?
i'll find my way through night and day
‘cause i know i just can't stay
here in heaven

time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
time can break your heart, have you begging please
begging please


beyond the door, there's peace, i'm sure
and i know there'll be no more
tears in heaven

would you know my name if i saw you in heaven?
would you be the same if i saw you in heaven?
i must be strong and carry on
because i know i don't belong
here in heaven

it's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me, "do i look all right?"
and i say, "yes, you look wonderful tonight"

we go to a party and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady that's walking around with me
and then she asks me "do you feel all right?"
and i say, "yes, i feel wonderful tonight"

i feel wonderful because i see
the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just don't realize how much i love you

it's time to go home now and i've got an aching head
so i give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
and then i tell her, as i turn out the light
i say, "my darling, you were wonderful tonight
oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"

if i could reach the stars
pull one down for you
shine it on my heart
so you could see the truth
that this love i have inside
is everything it seems
but for now i find
it's only in my dreams

and i can change the world
i will be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world

if i could be king
even for a day
i'd take you as my queen
i'd have it no other way
and our love would rule
in this kingdom we have made
'til then i'd be a fool
wishing for the day

and i can change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world

i could change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world

i shot the sheriff, but i did not shoot the deputy
i shot the sheriff, but i did not shoot the deputy

all around in my home town
they're trying to track me down
they say they want to bring me in guilty
for the killing of a deputy
for the life of a deputy
but i say

i shot the sheriff, but i swear it was in self-defense
i shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

sheriff john brown always hated me
for what i don't know
every time that i plant a seed
he said, "kill it before it grows"
he said, "kill it before it grows"
i say


freedom came my way one day
and i started out of town
all of a sudden i see sheriff john brown
aiming to shoot me down
so i shot, i shot him down
i say


reflexes got the better of me
and what is to be must be
every day the bucket goes to the well
but one day the bottom will drop out
yes, one day the bottom will drop out
but i say

sailing down behind the sun
waiting for my prince to come
praying for the healing rain
to restore my soul again
just a toerag on the run
how did i get here?
what have i done?
when will all my hopes arise?
how will i know him?
when i look in my father's eyes

(look into my father's eyes)
my father's eyes
when i look in my father's eyes
(look into my father's eyes)
my father's eyes

then the light begins to shine
and i hear those ancient lullabies
and as i watch this seedling grow
feel my heart start to overflow
where do i find the words to say?
how do i teach him?
what do we play?
bit by bit, i've realized
that's when i need them
that's when i need my father's eyes


then the jagged edge appears
through the distant clouds of tears
i'm like a bridge that was washed away
my foundations were made of clay
as my soul slides down to die
how could i lose him?
what did i try?
bit by bit, i've realized
that he was here with me
i look into my father's eyes

the rain is falling through the mist
of sorrow that surrounded me
the sun could never thaw away
the bliss that lays around me

let it rain, let it rain
let your love rain down on me
let it rain, let it rain
let it rain, rain, rain

her life was like a desert flower
burning in the sun
until i found the way to love
it's harder said than done

let it rain, let it rain
let your love rain down on me
let it rain, let it rain
let it rain, rain, rain

now i know the secret
there is nothing that i lack
if i give my love to you
you'll surely give it back

let it rain, let it rain
let your love rain down on me
let it rain, let it rain
let it rain, rain, rain
let it rain, let it rain
let your love rain down on me
let it rain, let it rain
let it rain, rain, rain
rain, rain, rain, rain
rain, rain, rain, rain

there is nothing that is wrong
in wanting you to stay here with me
i know you've got somewhere to go
but won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
and don't you ever leave

lay down, sally, and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to?
lay down, sally, no need to leave so soon
i've been trying all night long just to talk to you

sun ain't nearly on the rise
we still got the moon and stars above
underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
won't you stay with me?
don't you ever leave

lay down, sally, and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to?
lay down, sally, no need to leave so soon
i've been trying all night long just to talk to you

i long to see the morning light
coloring your face so dreamily
so don't you go and say goodbye
you can lay your worries down and stay with me
don't you ever leave

lay down, sally, and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to?
lay down, sally, there's no need to leave so soon
i've been trying all night long just to talk to you
lay down, sally, and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to?
lay down, sally, there's no need to leave so soon
i've been trying all night long just to talk to you

what will you do when you get lonely
and nobody’s waiting by your side?
you’ve been running and hiding much too long
you know, it’s just your foolish pride
layla, you got me on my knees
layla, i’m begging darling, please
layla, darling, won’t you ease my worried mind?
i tried to give you consolation
when your old man had let you down
like a fool, i fell in love with you
you turned my whole world upside down
layla, you got me on my knees
layla, i’m begging darling, please
layla, darling, won’t you ease my worried mind?
let’s make the best of the situation
before i finally go insane
please don’t say we’ll never find a way
and tell me all my love’s in vain
layla, you got me on my knees
layla, i’m begging darling, please
layla, darling, won’t you ease my worried mind?
layla, you got me on my knees
layla, i’m begging darling, please
layla, darling, won’t you ease my worried mind?

standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
to tell me which way i should go to find the answer
and all the time i know
plant your love and let it grow

let it grow, let it grow
let it blossom, let it flow
in the sun, the rain, the snow
love is lovely, let it grow

looking for a reason to check out of my mind
trying hard to get a friend that i can count on
but there's nothing left to show
plant your love and let it grow


time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
only ask and you will get what you are needing
the rest is up to you
plant your love and let it grow

i can feel your body
when i'm lying in bed
too much confusion
going around through my head

and it makes me so angry
to know that the flame still burns
why can't i get over?
when will i ever learn?

old love, leave me alone
old love, go on home

i can see your face
but i know that it's not real
just an illusion
caused by how i used to feel

and it makes me so angry
to know that the flame will alway burn
i'll never get over
i know now that i'll never learn

old love, leave me alone
old love, go on home

i don't care if you never come home
i don't mind if you just keep on
rowing away on a distant sea
because i don't love you and you don't love me
you cause a commotion when you come to town
you give them a smile and they melt
having lovers and friends is all good and fine
but i don't like yours and you don't like mine
la la, la la la la la
la la, la la la la la

i don't care what you do at night
oh, and i don't care how you get your delights
i will leave you alone, i will just let it be
i don't love you and you don't love me

i got a problem. can you relate?
i got a woman calling love hate
we made a vow we'd always be friends
how could we know that promises end?
la la, la la la la la
la la, la la la la la

i tried to love you for years upon years
you refuse to take me for real
it's time you saw what i want you to see
and i would still love you, if you'd just love me

i got a problem. can you relate?
i got a woman calling love hate
we made a vow we'd always be friends
how could we know that promises end?
la la, la la la la la
la la, la la la la la

before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
you say i've been spending my money on other women
taking money from someone else

i called your mama about three or four nights ago
i called your mama about three or four nights ago
well your mama said, "son, don't call my daughter no more"

before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
you say i've been spending my money on other women
you've been taking money from someone else

come back home, baby, try my love one more time
come back home, baby, try my love one more time
you know i don't know how to quit you, i'm gonna lose my mind

before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
you say i've been spending my money on other women
you're taking money from someone else

well she's walking through the clouds
with a circus mind that's running 'round
butterflies and zebras, fairy tales
that's all she ever thinks about
when i'm sad she comes to me
with a thousand smiles she gives to me free
said, "it's all right
take anything you want
anything you want, anything."

fly on, little wing

it's in the way that you use it
it comes and it goes
it's in the way that you use it
boy don't you know

and if you lie you will lose it
feelings will show
so don't you ever abuse it
don't let it go

nobody's right until somebody's wrong
nobody's weak until somebody's strong
no one gets lucky until luck comes along
nobody's lonely until somebody's gone

i've seen dark skies, never like this
walked on some thin ice, never like this
i've told you white lies, never like this
looked into true eyes, never like this

it's in the way that you use it
boy don't you know
it's in the way that you use it

have you ever loved a woman?
so much you tremble in pain?
have you ever loved a woman>
so much you tremble in pain?
and all the time you know
she bears another man his name
but you just love that woman
so much, it's a shame and a sin
you just love that woman
so much, it's a shame and a sin
but all the time you know
she belongs to your very best friend

have you ever loved a woman?
and you know you cannot leave her alone?
have you ever loved a woman?
and you know you cannot leave her alone?
something deep inside of you
will not let you wreck your best friend's home

little man with his eyes on fire
and his smile so bright
in his hands are the toys you gave
to fill his heart with delight
and in the ring stands a circus clown
holding up a knife
what you see and what you will hear
will last you for the rest of your life

and it's sad, so sad
there ain't no easy way round
and it's sad, so sad
all you friends gather round
because the circus left town

little man with his heart so pure
and his love so fine
stick with me and i'll ride with you
'til the end of the line
hold my hand and i'll walk with you
through the darkest night
and when i smile, i'll be thinking of you
and every little thing will be all right


the circus left town, left town
the circus left town, left town

how many times must we tell the tale?
how many times must we fall?
living in lost memory
you just recalled
working on the sound of the band
trying to get the music right
two go out working
three stay home at night

that's when she said she was pretending
like she knew the plan
that's when i knew she was pretending
pretending to understand
pretending, pretending
pretending, pretending

satisfied but lost in love
situations change
you're never who you used to think you are
how strange


i get lost in alibis
sadness cannot prevail
everybody knows strong love
can't fail

don't be pretending about how you feel
don't be pretending that your love is real
don't be pretending about how you feel
don't be pretending that your love is real

pretending, pretending
pretending, pretending

whip-poor-will singing
soft summer breeze
makes me think of my baby
i left down in new orleans
i left down in new orleans

magnolia, you sweet thing
you're driving me mad
gotta get back to you, babe
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had

you whisper "good morning"
so gently in my ear
i'm coming home to you, babe
i'll soon be there
i'll soon be there

magnolia, you sweet thing
you're driving me mad
i've gotta get back to you, babe
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had
you're the best i ever had

i went down to the crossroads
fell down on my knees
i went down to the crossroads
fell down on my knees
asked the lord above for mercy
"save me, if you please!"
i went down to the crossroads
tried to flag a ride
i went down to the crossroads
tried to flag a ride
nobody seemed to know me
everybody passed me by
i am going down to rosedale
take my rider by my side
i am going down to rosedale
take my rider by my side
you can still barrelhouse, baby
on the riverside
you can run, you can run
tell my friend-boy willie brown
you can run, you can run
tell my friend-boy willie brown
and i am standing at the crossroads
believe i am sinking down
