a modern-day warrior
mean, mean stride
today's tom sawyer
mean, mean pride

though his mind is not for rent
don't put him down as arrogant
his reserve a quiet defense
riding out the day's events
the river

what you say about his company
is what you say about society
catch the mist
catch the myth
catch the mystery
catch the drift

the world is, the world is
love and life are deep
maybe as his skies are wide
today's tom sawyer, he gets high on you
and the space he invades, he gets by on you


no, his mind is not for rent
to any god or government
always hopeful, yet discontent
he knows changes aren't permanent
but change is

and what you say about his company
is what you say about society
catch the witness
catch the wit
catch the spirit
catch the spit

the world is, the world is
love and life are deep
maybe as his eyes are wide

exit the warrior
today's tom sawyer
he gets high on you
and the energy you trade
he gets right on to
the friction of the day

and the meek shall inherit the earth

"...the massive grey walls of the temples rise from the heart of every federation city. i have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests..."

we've taken care of everything
the words you read, the songs you sing
the pictures that give pleasure to your eye
it's one for all, and all for one
we work together, common son
never need to wonder how or why

we are the priests of the temples of syrinx
our great computers fill the hallowed halls
we are the priests of the temples of syrinx
all the gifts of life are held within our walls

look around at this world we've made
equality, our stock in trade
come and join the brotherhood of man
oh what a nice, contented world
let the banners be unfurled
hold the red star proudly high in hand

we are the priests of the temples of syrinx
our great computers fill the hallowed halls
we are the priests of the temples of syrinx
all the gifts of life are held within our walls

"...behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, i found it. i brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. i had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful..."
"...i learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. as i struck the wires with my other hand, i produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! how different it could be from the music of the temples! i can't wait to tell the priests about it!..."


what can this strange device be?
when i touch it, it gives forth a sound
it's got wires that vibrate and give music
what can this thing be that i found?

see how it sings like a sad heart
and joyously screams out its pain
sounds that build high like a mountain
or notes that fall gently like rain

i can't wait to share this new wonder
the people will all see its light
let them all make their own music
the priests praise my name on this night

"...in the sudden silence as i finished playing, i looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. father brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall..."
"...instead of the grateful joy that i expected, they were words of quiet rejection! instead of praise, sullen dismissal. i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet..."

i know it's most unusual
to come before you so
but i've found an ancient miracle
i thought that you should know
listen to my music
and hear what it can do
there's something here as strong as life
i know that it will reach you

yes, we know, it's nothing new
it's just a waste of time
we have no need for ancient ways
the world is doing fine
another toy that helped destroy
the elder race of man
forget about your silly whim
it doesn't fit the plan, no

i can't believe you're saying
these things just can't be true
our world could use this beauty
just think what we might do
listen to my music
and hear what it can do
there's something here that's as strong as life
i know that it will reach you

don't annoy us further!
oh, we have our work to do
just think about the average
what use have they for you?
another toy that helped destroy
the elder race of man
forget about your silly whim
it doesn't fit the plan!


"...i guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. clearly yet i see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase..."
"...i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptures cities, and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things..."

i wandered home though silent streets
and fell into a fitful sleep
escape to realms beyond the night
dream, can't you show me the light?

i stand atop a spiral stair
an oracle confronts me there
he leads me on light years away
through astral nights, galactic days
i see the works of gifted hands
that grace this strange and wondrous land
i see the hand of man arise
with hungry mind and open eyes

they left our planets long ago
the elder race still learn and grow
their power grows with purpose strong
to claim the home where they belong
home to tear the temples down...
home to change!

"...i have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. i can no longer live under the control of the federation, but there is no other place to go. my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last..."

the sleep is still in my eyes
the dream is still in my head
i heave a sigh and sadly smile
and lie awhile in bed
i wish that it might come to pass
not fade like all my dreams

just think of what my life might be
in a world like i have seen!
i don't think i can carry on
carry on this cold and empty life
oh no!

my spirits are low in the depths of despair
my lifeblood... spills over

living on a lighted stage
approaches the unreal
for those who think and feel
in touch with some reality
beyond the gilded cage

cast in this unlikely role
ill-equipped to act
with insufficient tact
one must put up barriers
to keep oneself intact

living in the limelight
the universal dream
for those who wish to seem
those who wish to be
must put aside the alienation
get on with the fascination
the real relation
the underlying theme

living in a fisheye lens
caught in the camera eye
i have no heart to lie
i can't pretend a stranger
is a long-awaited friend

all the world's indeed a stage
and we are merely players
performers and portrayers
each another's audience
outside the gilded cage

living in the limelight
the universal dream
for those who wish to seem
those who wish to be
must put aside the alienation
get on with the fascination

living in the limelight

for those who wish to seem

must put aside the alienation
get on with the fascination
the real relation

the real relation
the underlying theme

there are those who think
that life has nothing left to chance
a host of holy horrors
to direct our aimless dance

a planet of playthings
we dance on the strings
of powers we cannot perceive
the stars aren't aligned
or the gods are malign
blame is better to give than receive

you can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
i will choose a path that's clear, i will choose free will

there are those who think
that they've been dealt a losing hand
the cards were stacked against them
they weren't born in lotus land

all preordained
a prisoner in chains
a victim of venomous fate
kicked in the face
you can pray for a place
in heaven's unearthly estate

you can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
i will choose a path that's clear, i will choose free will


each of us, a cell of awareness
imperfect and incomplete
genetic blends
with uncertain ends
on a fortune hunt that's far too fleet

you can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
i will choose a path that's clear, i will choose free will

begin the day with a friendly voice
a companion unobtrusive
plays that song that's so elusive
and the magic music makes your morning mood

off on your way, hit the open road
there is magic at your fingers
for the spirit ever lingers
undemanding contact in your happy solitude

invisible airwaves crackle with life
bright antennae bristle with the energy
emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

all this machinery making modern music
can still be open-hearted
not so coldly charted
it's really just a question of your honesty
yeah, your honesty
one likes to believe in the freedom of music
but glittering prizes
and endless compromises
shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah

invisible airwaves crackle with life
bright antennae bristle with the energy
emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
bearing a gift beyond price, almost free


for the words of the profits
were written on the studio wall
concert hall
and echoes with the sound
of salesmen
of salesmen
of salesmen!

sprawling on the fringes of the city
in geometric order
an insulated border
in between the bright lights
and the far unlit unknown

growing up it all seems so one-sided
opinions all provided
the future pre-decided
detached and subdivided
in the mass production zone
nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

(subdivisions) --
in the high school halls
in the shopping malls
conform or be cast out
(subdivisions) --
in the basement bars
in the backs of cars
be cool or be cast out

any escape might help to smooth
the unattractive truth
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe
the restless dreams of youth

drawn like moths we drift into the city
the timeless old attraction
cruising for the action
lit up like a firefly
just to feel the living night

some will sell their dreams for small desires
or lose the race to rats
get caught in ticking traps
and start to dream of somewhere
to relax their restless flight
somewhere out of a memory
of lighted streets on quiet nights

(subdivisions) --
ihe high school halls
in the shopping malls
conform or be cast out
(subdivisions) --
ihe basement bars
in the backs of cars
be cool or be cast out

any escape might help to smooth
the unattractive truth
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe
the restless dreams of youth

there is unrest in the forest
there is trouble with the trees
for the maples want more sunlight
and the oaks ignore their pleas

the trouble with the maples
and they're quite convinced they're right
they say the oaks are just too lofty
and they grab up all the light
but the oaks can't help their feelings
if they like the way they're made
and they wonder why the maples
can't be happy in their shade

there is trouble in the forest
and the creatures all have fled
as the maples scream, "oppression!"
and the oaks just shake their heads


so the maples formed a union
and demanded equal rights
"the oaks are just too greedy
we will make them give us light"
now there's no more oak oppression
for they passed a noble law
and the trees are all kept equal
by hatchet, axe, and saw

my uncle has a country place
that no one knows about
he says it used to be a farm
before the motor law
and on sundays i elude the eyes
and hop the turbine freight
to far outside the wire
where my white-haired uncle waits

jump to the ground
as the turbo slows to cross the borderline
run like the wind
as excitement shivers up and down my spine
down in his barn
my uncle preserved for me an old machine
for fifty-odd years
to keep it as new has been his dearest dream

i strip away the old debris
that hides a shining car
a brilliant red barchetta
from a better, vanished time
we fire up the willing engine
responding with a roar
tires spitting gravel
i commit my weekly crime

wind in my hair
shifting and drifting
mechanical music
adrenaline surge
well-weathered leather
hot metal and oil
the scented country air
sunlight on chrome
the blur of the landscape
every nerve aware


suddenly ahead of me
across the mountainside
a gleaming alloy air-car
shoots towards me, two lanes wide
i spin around with shrieking tires
to run the deadly race
go screaming through the valley
as another joins the chase

drive like the wind
straining the limits of machine and man
laughing out loud with fear and hope
i've got a desperate plan
at the one-lane bridge
i leave the giants stranded at the riverside
race back to the farm
to dream with my uncle at the fireside



well, i get up at seven, yeah
and i go to work at nine
i got no time for livin’
yes, i’m workin’ all the time

it seems to me i could live my life
a lot better than i think i am
i guess that’s why they call me
they call me the workin’ man

they call me the workin' man
i guess that's what i am

so i get home at five o'clock
and i take myself out an ice cold beer
always seem to be wond'rin'
why there's nothin' goin' down here

it seems to me i could live my life
a lot better than i think i am
i guess that's why they call me
the workin' man

well, they call me the workin' man
i guess that's what i am


well, they call me the workin' man
i guess that's what i am


well, i get up at seven, yeah
and i go to work at nine
i got no time for livin'
yes, i'm workin' all the time

it seems to me i could live my life
a lot better than i think i am
i guess that's why they call me
they call me the workin' man

well, they call me the workin' man
i guess that's what i am
they call me the workin' man

when our weary world was young
the struggle of the ancients first began
the gods of love and reason
sought alone to rule the fate of man

they battled through the ages
but still neither force would yield
the people were divided
every soul a battlefield
every soul a battlefield



"i bring truth and understanding
i bring wit and wisdom fair
precious gifts beyond compare
we can build a world of wonder
i can make you all aware
i will find you food and shelter
show you fire to keep you warm
through the endless winter storm
you can live in grace and comfort
in the world that you transform"

the people were delighted
coming forth to claim their prize
they ran to build their cities
and converse among the wise
but one day the streets fell silent
yet they knew not what was wrong
the urge to build these fine things
seemed not to be so strong
the wise men were consulted
and the bridge of death was crossed
in quest of dionysus
to find out what they had lost


"i bring love to give you solace
in the darkness of the night
in the heart's eternal light
you need only trust your feelings
only love can steer you right
i bring laughter, i bring music
i bring joy and i bring tears
i will soothe your primal fears
throw off those chains of reason
and your prison disappears"

the cities were abandoned
and the forests echoed song
they danced and lived as brothers
they knew love could not be wrong
food and wine they had aplenty
and they slept beneath the stars
the people were contented
and the gods watched from afar
but the winter fell upon them
and it caught them unprepared
bringing wolves and cold starvation
and the hearts of men despaired



the universe divided
as the heart and mind collided
with the people left unguided
for so many troubled years
in a cloud of doubts and fears
their world was torn asunder into hollow
hemispheres

some fought themselves, some fought each other
most just followed one another
lost and aimless like their brothers
for their hearts were so unclear
and the truth could not appear
their spirits were divided into blinded
hemispheres

some who did not fight
brought tales of old to light
'my rocinante sailed by night
on her final flight'
to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force
we set our course
spiralled through that timeless space
to this immortal place



i have memory and awareness
but i have no shape or form
as a disembodied spirit
i am dead and yet unborn
i have passed into olympus
as was told in tales of old
to the city of immortals
marble white and purest gold

i see the gods in battle rage on high
thunderbolts across the sky
i cannot move, i cannot hide
i feel a silent scream begin inside

then all at once the chaos ceased
a stillness fell, a sudden peace
the warriors felt my silent cry
and stayed their struggle, mystified
apollo was astonished
dionysus thought me mad
but they heard my story further
and they wondered and were sad

looking down from olympus
on a world of doubt and fear
its surface splintered into
sorry hemispheres

they sat a while in silence
then they turned at last to me
"we will call you cygnus
the god of balance you shall be"


we can walk our road together
if our goals are all the same
we can run alone and free
if we pursue a different aim
let the truth of love be lighted
let the love of truth shine clear
sensibility, armed with sense and liberty
with the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere

and the men who hold high places
must be the ones who start
to mold a new reality
closer to the heart
closer to the heart

the blacksmith and the artist
reflect it in their art
they forge their creativity
closer to the heart
yeah, it's closer to the heart

philosophers and ploughmen
each must know his part
to sow a new mentality
closer to the heart
yeah, it's closer to the heart
yeah!  oh


you can be the captain
and i will draw the chart
sailing into destiny
closer to the heart
closer to the heart
closer to the heart
closer to the heart
closer to the heart
i said closer to the heart
closer to the heart
closer to your heart
closer to your heart

"to seek the sacred river alph
to walk the caves of ice
to break my fast on honeydew
and drink the milk of paradise"

i had heard the whispered tales of immortality
the deepest mystery
from an ancient book i took a clue
i scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown
time and man alone
searching for the lost xanadu
xanadu


to stand within the pleasure dome
decreed by kubla khan
to taste anew the fruits of life
the last immortal man
to find the sacred river alph
to walk the caves of ice
oh, i will dine on honeydew
and drink the milk of paradise
oh, paradise!


a thousand years have come and gone but time has passed me by
stars stopped in the sky
frozen in an everlasting view
waiting for the world to end, weary of the night
praying for the light
prison of the lost
xanadu
xanadu


held within the pleasure dome
decreed by kubla khan
to taste my bitter triumph
as a mad immortal man
nevermore shall i return
escape these caves of ice
for i have dined on honeydew
and drunk the milk of paradise
woah, is it paradise?

airport scurry flurry faces
parade of passers by
people going many places
with a smile or just a sigh
waiting waiting pass the time
another cigarette
get in line - gate thirty-nine
the time is not here yet (end)

why try? i know why
this feeling inside me says it's time i was gone
clear head, new life ahead
it's time i was king now not just one more pawn

fly by night, away from here
change my life again
fly by night, goodbye, my dear
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend

moon rise, thoughtful eyes
staring back at me from the window beside
no fright or hindsight
leaving behind that empty feeling inside

fly by night, away from here
change my life again
fly by night, goodbye, my dear
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend, whoa!
woah!


fly by night, away from here
change my life again
fly by night, goodbye, my dear
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend

start a new chapter, find what i'm after
it's changing every day
the change of a season's enough of a reason
to want to get away
quiet and pensive, my thoughts apprehensive
the hours drift away
leaving my homeland, playing a lone hand
my life begins today

fly by night, away from here
change my life again
fly by night, goodbye, my dear
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend
fly by night, away from here
change my life again
fly by night, goodbye, my dear
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend

our first stop is in bogotá
to check colombian fields
the natives smile and pass along
a sample of their yield
sweet jamaican pipe dreams
golden acapulco nights
then morocco, and the east
fly by morning light

we're on the train to bangkok
aboard the thailand express
we'll hit the stops along the way
we only stop for the best

wreathed in smoke in lebanon
we burn the midnight oil
the fragrance of afghanistan
rewards a long day's toil
pulling into kathmandu
smoke rings fill the air
perfumed by a nepal night
the express gets you there

we're on the train to bangkok
aboard the thailand express
we'll hit the stops along the way
we only stop for the best


we're on the train to bangkok

yes, we're on the train to bangkok
aboard the thailand express
we'll hit the stops along the way
we only stop for the best

i turn my back to the wind
to catch my breath before i start off again
driven on without a moment to spend
to pass an evening with a drink and a friend
i let my skin get too thin
i'd like to pause, no matter what i pretend
like some pilgrim who learns to transcend
learns to live as if each step was the end

(time stand still)
i'm not looking back, but i want to look around me now
(time stand still)
see more of the people and the places that surround me now
time stand still
freeze this moment a little bit longer
make each sensation a little bit stronger
experience slips away
experience slips away
time stand still

i turn my face to the sun
close my eyes, let my defenses down
all those wounds that i can't get unwound
i let my past go too fast
no time to pause
if i could slow it all down
like some captain, whose ship runs aground
i can wait until the tide comes around

(time stand still)
i'm not looking back, but i want to look around me now
(time stand still)
see more of the people and the places that surround me now
freeze this moment a little bit longer
make each sensation a little bit stronger
make each impression a little bit stronger
freeze this motion a little bit longer
the innocence slips away
the innocence slips away
time stand still
time stand still

i'm not looking back, but i want to look around me now
see more of the people and the places that surround me now
time stand still

summer's going fast, nights growing colder
children growing up, old friends growing older
freeze this moment a little bit longer
make each sensation a little bit stronger

experience slips away
experience slips away
the innocence slips away

the night is black, without a moon
the air is thick and still
the vigilantes gather on
the lonely torch-lit hill

features distorted in the flickering light
faces are twisted and grotesque
silent and stern in the sweltering night
the mob moves like demons possessed
quiet in conscience, calm in their right
confident their ways are best
oh, oh!

the righteous rise with burning eyes
of hatred and ill-will
madmen fed on fear and lies
to beat and burn and kill

they say there are strangers who threaten us
our immigrants and infidels
they say there is strangeness to danger us
in our theaters and bookstore shelves
that those who know what's best for us
must rise and save us from ourselves!

unstable condition
a symptom of life
in mental and environmental change
atmospheric disturbance
the feverish flux
of human interface and interchange
the impulse is pure
sometimes our circuits get shorted
by external interference
signals get crossed
and the balance distorted
by internal incoherence

a tired mind become a shape-shifter
everybody need a mood lifter
everybody need reverse polarity
everybody got mixed feelings
about the function and the form
everybody got to deviate from the norm

an ounce of perception
a pound of obscure
process information at half speed
pause, rewind, replay
warm memory chip
random sample, hold the one you need
leave out the fiction
the fact is, this friction
will only be worn by persistence
leave out conditions
courageous convictions
will drag the dream into existence

a tired mind become a shape-shifter
everybody need a soft filter
everybody need reverse polarity
everybody got mixed feelings
about the function and the form
everybody got to elevate from the norm...

everybody got mixed feelings
