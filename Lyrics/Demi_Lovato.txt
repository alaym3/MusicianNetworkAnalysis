and the cold sweats disappear
call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

i don't know, i don't know, i don't know, i don't know why
i do it every, every, every time
it's only when i'm lonely
sometimes i just wanna cave and i don't wanna fight
i try and i try and i try and i try and i try
just hold me, i'm lonely

momma, i'm so sorry, i'm not sober anymore
and daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
to the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
i'm so sorry, i'm not sober anymore

i'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
for making love the way i saved for you inside my head
and i'm sorry for the fans i lost who watched me fall again
i wanna be a role model, but i'm only human

i don't know, i don't know, i don't know, i don't know why

uh, uh

i tried to talk to my piano
i tried to talk to my guitar
talked to my imagination
confided into alcohol
i tried and tried and tried some more
told secrets 'til my voice was sore
tired of empty conversation
'cause no one hears me anymore

a hundred million stories
and a hundred million songs
i feel stupid when i sing
nobody's listening to me
nobody's listening
i talk to shooting stars
but they always get it wrong
i feel stupid when i pray
so, why am i praying anyway?
if nobody's listening

anyone, please send me anyone
lord, is there anyone?
i need someone, oh
anyone, please send me anyone
lord, is there anyone?
i need someone

i used to crave the world's attention
i think i cried too many times
i just need some more affection
anything to get me by

a hundred million stories
and a hundred million songs
i feel stupid when i sing
nobody's listening to me
nobody's listening
i talk to shooting stars
but they always get it wrong
i feel stupid when i pray
why the fuck am i praying anyway?
if nobody's listening

anyone, please send me anyone
lord, is there anyone?
i need someone, oh
anyone, please send me anyone
oh, lord, is there anyone?
i need someone
oh, anyone, i need anyone
oh, anyone, i need someone

a hundred million stories
and a hundred million songs
i feel stupid when i sing
nobody's listening to me
nobody's listening

let it go, let it go
can’t hold it back anymore
let it go, let it go
turn my back and slam the door

the snow glows white on the mountain tonight
not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation
and it looks like i'm the queen
the wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows i tried

don’t let them in, don’t let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
well, now they know

let it go, let it go
can’t hold it back anymore
let it go, let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here i stand, and here i'll stay
let it go, let it go
the cold never bothered me anyway

it’s funny how some distance
makes everything seem small
and the fears that once controlled me
can’t get to me at all
up here in the cold thin air
i finally can breathe
i know i left a life behind
but i’m too relieved to grieve

let it go, let it go
can’t hold it back anymore
let it go, let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here i stand, and here i'll stay
let it go, let it go
the cold never bothered me anyway

standing frozen in the life i’ve chosen
you won't find me, the past is so behind me
buried in the snow

let it go, let it go
can’t hold it back anymore
let it go, let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here i stand, and here i'll stay
let it go, let it go
the cold never bothered me anyway

(na na, na na) yeah
(na na na na na) let it go
(na na, na na) yeah
(na na na na na) na na
(na na, na na) let it go
(na na na na na) let it go
(na na) let it go
(na na) ooh
(na na na na na) let it go

mmm, ooh, yeah
mustard on the beat, ho

he felt just like you
his arms, his lips
his promises were just as smooth
his grip, it fit, though i admit that
only you could make me feel the way you do
though, you know love is blind
and he just caught my eye

you know me and honestly i'm better without ya
don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
baby, i'm hoping and praying
my knees weak, i'm shaking
'cause you know that i always needed saving

now i'm fucking lonely 'cause you didn't want me
trying to show me, that you didn't own me
but all you do is leave me fucking lonely
knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
for no goddamn reason
but all you do is leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely

the month was june
the smoky sun, our fated one
it ended too soon
with tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
i can see it in your eyes

don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour

my knees weak, i'm shaking

trying to show me that you didn't own me
but all you do is leave me fucking lonely
knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding

leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely

bitch, can't even say i miss you back over the fuckin' text
every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
toni braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'cause lovebirds are some busy bees
you fuck around, get stung again
and you didn't leave your underwear
'cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there
i can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
and i was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
i smoke bars full of weed and call it what i see
and when you leave, i hope you know you bring
this forest to his leaves
i'm fucking lonely, yeah

lonely
leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely
leave me fucking lonely

not like i wanna do this every night
i've been good, don't i deserve it?
i think i earned it, feels like it's worth it
in my mind, mind

twisted reality, hopeless insanity
i told you i was okay, but i was lying

i was dancing with the devil, out of control
almost made it to heaven
it was closer than you know
playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
it's so hard to say no
when you're dancing with the devil
mm-mm-mm, yeah, yeah

it's just a little white line, i'll be fine
but soon, that little white line is a little glass pipe
tinfoil remedy, almost got the best of me
i keep praying i don't reach the end of my lifetime, mm

twisted reality, hopeless insanity
i told you i was okay, but i was lying

i was dancing with the devil, out of control
almost made it to heaven
it was closer than you know
playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
it's so hard to say no
when you're dancing with the devil

thought i knew my limit, yeah
i thought that i could quit it, yeah
i thought that i could walk away easily
but here i am, falling down on my knees
praying for better days to come and wash this pain away
could you please forgive me?
lord, i'm sorry for dancing with the devil
oh, yeah-yeah

dancing with the devil, out of control (yeah, yeah)
almost made it to heaven
it was closer than you know (closer than you know)
playing with the enemy (oh), gambling with my soul (woah, woah)
it's so hard to say no
when you're dancing with the devil, mm

yeah, yeah, mm

puttin' my defenses up
'cause i don't wanna fall in love
if i ever did that, i think i'd have a heart attack

never put my love out on the line
never said "yes" to the right guy
never had trouble getting what i want
but when it comes to you, i'm never good enough
when i don't care
i can play 'em like a ken doll
won't wash my hair
then make 'em bounce like a basketball

but you make me wanna act like a girl
paint my nails and wear high heels
yes, you, make me so nervous that i just can't hold your hand

you make me glow
but i cover up, won't let it show
so i'm putting my defenses up
'cause i don't wanna fall in love
if i ever did that, i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack

never break a sweat for the other guys
when you come around, i get paralyzed
and every time i try to be myself
it comes out wrong like a cry for help
it's just not fair
pain's more trouble than love is worth
i gasp for air
it feels so good, but you know it hurts

but you make me wanna act like a girl
paint my nails and wear perfume for you
make me so nervous that i just can't hold your hand

you make me glow
but i cover up, won't let it show
so i'm putting my defenses up
'cause i don't wanna fall in love
if i ever did that, i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack

the feelings are lost in my lungs
they're burning, i'd rather be numb (i'd rather be numb)
you know there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
so scared, i'll take off in a run
i'm flying too close to the sun
and i'll burst into flames

you make me glow
but i cover up, won't let it show
so i'm putting my defenses up
'cause i don't wanna fall in love
if i ever did that, i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
i think i'd have a heart attack (-tack)
oh, i think i'd have a heart attack
i think i'd have a heart attack

standing on the front lines
staring at the sun rise over the hill
waiting for the kill
sweet anticipation, never conversation
tears in our eyes from holding too tight

waiting till the demons come
wait for us to see them run in our direction
now they're staring at us through the trees
got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson

so tell me
did you ever really love me?
did you ever really want me?
now that i see you clearer
i wonder, was i ever really happy?
didn't get the chance to ask me
now that i see you clearer
was it just smoke and mirrors?
was it just smoke and mirrors?

holding onto tables, pulling out the staples
keeping you close, now we're not afloat
point me in the right direction, answer me one question
'cause i could've sworn that i wasn't wrong

waiting till the demons come
wait for us to see them run in our direction
staring at us through the trees
got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson (teach us a lesson)

now that i see you clearer
i wonder, was i ever really happy?
didn't get the chance to ask me

ooh, was it just smoke and mirrors?

darling, i have been afraid
i could only call your name
thank the heavens that you stayed
but if i'm telling you the truth
when i cut the tether loose
it was me, saving you

so tell me
did you ever really love me?
did you ever really want me?
now that i see you clearer
i wonder, was i ever really happy?
didn't get the chance to ask me
now that i see you clearer
was it just smoke and mirrors?
was it just smoke and mirrors?

late at night, i'm sippin' as you pass me by
red or white? you pour another, say, "it's fine"

i don't believe in you (i, i don't believe that)
