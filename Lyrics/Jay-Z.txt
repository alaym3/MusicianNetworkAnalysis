do i find it so hard
when i know in my heart
i'm letting you down every day
letting you down every day
why do i keep on running away?

look, i apologize, often womanize
took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
took me too long for this song, i don't deserve you
i harassed you out in paris
"please come back to rome, you make it home"
we talked for hours when you were on tour
"please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!"
i said: "don't embarrass me" instead of "be mine"
that was my proposal for us to go steady
that was your 21st birthday
you matured faster than me, i wasn't ready
so i apologize
i seen the innocence leave your eyes
i still mourn its death and
i apologize for all the stillborns
'cause i wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
i apologize to all the women whom i toyed with your emotions
'cause i was emotionless
and i apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
and because i fall short of what i say i'm all about
your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
and you stare blankly into space
thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
so i apologize

i'm never gonna treat you
i'm never gonna treat you like i should
oh

i apologize
our love was one for the ages and i contained us
and all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
or sleep with our back turned
we supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
we're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
and then meet in a space where the dark stop
and let love light the way
like the men before me, i cut off my nose to spite my face
i never wanted another woman to know
something about me that you didn't know
i promised, i cried, i couldn't hold
i suck at love, i think i need a do-over
i will be emotionally available if i invited you over
i stew over; "what if—"
"you over my shit?"

i'm never gonna treat you
i'm never gonna treat you like i should
oh

and if my children knew
i don't even know what i would do
if they ain't look at me the same
i would prob'ly die with all the shame
"you did what with who?"
what good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"you risked that for blue?"
if i wasn't a superhero in your face
my heart breaks for the day i have to explain my mistakes
and the mask goes away
and santa claus is fake
and you go online and see
for blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

i'm never gonna treat you like i should

if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

i've got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
rap critics that say he's money, cash, hoes
i'm from the hood, stupid! what type of facts are those?
if you grew up with holes in your zapatos
you'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
i'm like, "fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
if you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward."
got beef with radio if i don't play they show
they don't play my hits, well, i don't give a shit, so
rap mags try and use my black ass
so advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
fuckers, i don't know what you take me as
or understand the intelligence that jay z has
i'm from rags to riches, niggas, i ain't dumb
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

the year is '94, in my trunk is raw
in my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
and i ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars, i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road
i heard, "son, do you know why i'm stopping you for?"
‘cause i'm young and i'm black and my hat's real low?
do i look like a mind reader, sir? i don't know
am i under arrest or should i guess some more?
"well, you was doing 55 in a 54
license and registration and step out of the car
are you carrying a weapon on you? i know a lot of you are."
i ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
"well, do you mind if i look around the car a little bit?"
well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"aren't you sharp as a tack?
you some type of lawyer or something?
somebody important or something?"
well, i ain't passed the bar, but i know a little bit
enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"well, we'll see how smart you are when the k9 come!"
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
this is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
but a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
i try to ignore him, talk to the lord
pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
you know the type, loud as a motorbike
but wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing that's gon' happen is i'ma get to clappin'
and he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the captain
and there i go, trapped in the kit-kat again
back through the system with the riff-raff again
fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
d.a. try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mil' for bail ‘cause i'm african
all because this fool was harassin' them
tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
but ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how i hold my gun
i got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

you crazy for this one, rick
it's your boy

motherfuckers say that i'm foolish, i only talk about jewels (bling-bling)
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
see, i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
the same dude you gave nothin', i made somethin' doin'
what i do through and through and
i give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade, you been afraid i penetrate pop culture
bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
and they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown
when child support knocked, "no, he's not around"
now, how that sound to ya? jot it down
i bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
i help them see they way through it, not you
can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician, but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
'cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, i'll wear it
but if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
but there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (haha)
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here?
i don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'cause here we go, he's jigga-jur-jigga-jih-jigga
and i'm the sinister mr. kiss-my-ass is just a

renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to talk about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)
renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to holler about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)

i had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollerin'? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
by the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
do not step to me
i'm awkward, i box lefty
an orphan, my pops left me
and often my mama wasn't home
could not stress to me, i wasn't grown
'specially on nights i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
big, i did it, multi before i die
no lie, just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight

see, i'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day shakespeare
jesus christ, the king of these latter-day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
but that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "dixie"
while i'm wavin' the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons, take a bath with the catholics
in holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
the new ice cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do? (huh?), i'm just a kid from the gutter
makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause i'm a motherfuckin'

renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to talk about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)
renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to holler about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)
renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day

(you see this motherfucking face)
blessings, blessings, yeah, i see..

you got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
you stabbed un over some records

sponsored by just blaze and the good folks at roc-a-fella records

fellow americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that i present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

allow me to re-introduce myself
my name is hov, oh, h-to-the-o-v
i used to move snowflakes by the o-z
i guess even back then you can call me
ceo of the r-o-c, hov!
fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
i be the music biz number one supplier

lying as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there ain't no reason why i be buying expensive chains

niggas getting high within the game

i'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
i got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
check out my hat yo, peep the way i wear it

no matter where you go, you are what you are player
and you can try to change but that's just the top layer

makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
oops, my bad, that's "my scenario"

and if you catch a lick when i spit
then it won't be a little hit

and you see us comin' down on yo' slab
livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
but nigga if you hatin' i
then you wait while i get your bitch butt-naked
just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
wet with two pairs of clothes on
now get yo' ass to the back as i'm flyin' to the track
timbaland, let me spit my prose on
pump it up in the pro-zone
that's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
ain't the track that we flows on
but when shit get hot then the glock start poppin' like ozone
we keep hoes crunk like trigger-man

gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' jigga man, fool!

on the canopy, my stamina be
enough for pamela anderson lee
mtv jam of the week
made my money quick, then back to the streets
but still sittin' on blades, sippin' that ray
standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
still gettin' that 'caine
half what i paid slippin' right through customs
it'll sell by night, its egg shell white
i got so many grams, if the man find out
it will land me in jail for life
but i'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
with bun b, pimp c, and timothy
we got bitches in the back of the truck
laughin' it up, jigga man: that's what's up!

we be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
we be big pimpin' on b-l-a-d’s
we be big pimpin' down in p.a.t

picture all the possibilities
picture all the possibilities
sounds like a love song
sounds like a love song
the most incredible, baby
uh
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
yeah, yeah
uh
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry

good dude, i know you love me like cooked food
even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
we was together on the block since free lunch
we shoulda been together havin' four seasons brunch
we used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
so now we travel first-class to change the forecast
never in bunches, just me and you
i loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
still i left you for months on end
it's been months since i checked back in
we're somewhere in a small town
somewhere lockin' a mall down
woodgrain, four and change, armor all'd down
i can understand why you want a divorce now
though i can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
but deep inside, a nigga so sick

i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta let the song cry, uh
can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i got to make the song cry

on repeat, the cd of big's "me & my bitch"
watchin' bonnie and clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
empty gun in your hand, sayin', "let me see that clip"
shopping sprees, pull out your visa quick
a nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
you helped me get the keys to that v dot 6
we was so happy poor, but when we got rich
that's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
rather mine, i don't know what made me leave that shit
made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
it was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
i used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
used to tell they friends i was ugly and wouldn't touch me
then i showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
and then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
and i don't remember you

i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
yeah, i seen 'em comin' down your eyes
but i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry

a face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
word back home is that you had a special friend
so what was oh so special then?
you have given away without gettin' at me
that's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
how was i to know that you was plain sick of me?
i know the way a nigga livin' was wack
but you don't get a nigga back like that
shit, i'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
you don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
you don't throw away what we had just like that
i was just fuckin' them girls, i was gon' get right back
they say you can't turn a bad girl good
but once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
i'll mourn forever
shit, i've got to live with the fact i did you wrong forever

i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta let the song cry
i know, i seen 'em comin' down your eyes
but i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry

it's fucked up, girl

good morn' or evening, friends
smile, you recordin'?

slammin' bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove bentley azures
we drinkin' cristal then
yeah, kept the tray on me like chris paul then
drinkin' ace of spades like it's codeine now
tryna put a million on the whole team now
push through the pain so we can see new life
so all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
society shame and the pain was too much to take
cried tears of joy when you fell in love
don't matter to me if it's a him or her
i just wanna see you smile through all the hate
marie antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

bad times turn to good memories, smile
even when i'm gone and you remember me, smile
good times never fade away, smile
even if i'm not with you here today, smile
good morn' or evening, friends
smile
here's your friendly announcer
smile

far as draft picks, my name did not get called
bet before i go i put a billion on the board
hall of fame hov, i did it all without a pen
y'all knew that was comin', i had to remind y'all again, huh?
flyin' paper planes through the projects
now the whole projects on my jet
now you see the real in the front row
in every one of y'all televised shows
super facts
niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
a loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

bad times turn to good memories, smile
even when i'm gone and you remember me, smile
good times never fade away, smile
even if i'm not with you here today, smile
good morn' or evening, friends

i mastered my aesthetics
i know you often heard me wax poetic
'bout bein' back in the lexus
but trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
the hundreds of millions, i have no ceilings
ah, this that feelin', i'm that boy
anita baker's "you bring me joy" slappin' out of the toy
the separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
objects is further than they appear
oh yeah, i was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
norman's cay, he looked up and out of the lear
how niggas can't relate?
fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
in charge of my own fate, respect jimmy iovine
but he gotta respect the elohim as a whole new regime
and niggas playin' for power, huh
so our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
ours was, "fuck you, pay me"
now it's, "fuck payin' me, i pay you
put the rest away for blue"
that blood money i giggle at it
can't even support my miss' habit
jewelry shoppin' in pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, i still ain't trippin'
that's life, winners and losers
drug dealers and abusers, america likes me ruthless
my therapist said i relapsed
i said, "pre-haps i freudian slipped in european whips"
god sent me to break the chain, i'm the true and livin'
god in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
a stain on the white suit, inferior iq
niggas'll rip your shit off tidal just to spite you
ahhhh, what did i do? 'cept try to free you
niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
this was meant to be a haiku, huh
but my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
oh, these that drugs, heron flow, i spaz on the stove
this is hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security i provided you
oh y'all thought i was washed? i'm at the cleaners
launderin' dirty money like the teamsters, huh
shout out to hoffa back home, he in the church
when i heard you got booked, that shit hurt
feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
yet it's legal in colorado, yet, we deny
black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
that's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
that's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
all these people was gon' kill me, heh
'cause the more i reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
welcome back carter, smile

living in the shadow
can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
in the shadows people see you as happy and free
because that's what you want them to see
living two lives, happy, but not free
you live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
the world is changing and they say it's time to be free
but you live with the fear of just being me
living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
no harm for them, no harm for me
but life is short, and it's time to be free
love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed
