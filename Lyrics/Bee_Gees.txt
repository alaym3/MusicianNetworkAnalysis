'til i finally died, which started the whole world living

smile an everlasting smile
a smile can bring you near to me
don't ever let me find you gone
cause that would bring a tear to me

this world has lost its glory
let's start a brand new story
now my love, right now
there'll be no other time
and i can show you how, my love

talk in everlasting words
and dedicate them all to me
and i will give you all my life
i'm here if you should call to me

you think that i don't even mean
a single word i say

it's only words, and words are all i have
to take your heart away

you think that i don't even mean
a single word i say

it's only words, and words are all i have
to take your heart away

it's only words, and words are all i have
to take your heart away
it's only words, and words are all i have
to take your heart away

i can think of younger days when living for my life
was everything a man could want to do
i could never see tomorrow
but i was never told about the sorrows

and, how can you mend a broken heart?
how can you stop the rain from falling down?
how can you stop the sun from shining?
what makes the world go round?
how can you mend this broken man?
how can a loser ever win?
please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

i can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
and misty memories of days gone by
we could never see tomorrow
no one said a word about the sorrow

and how can you mend a broken heart?
how can you stop the rain from falling down?
how can you stop the sun from shining?
what makes the world go round?
and how can you mend this broken man?
how can a loser ever win?
please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

la la la la la la, la la la la
la la la la la la, la la la la

please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

baby, when i met you, there was peace unknown
i set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb
i was soft inside
there was something going on

you do something to me that i can't explain
hold me closer and i feel no pain
every beat of my heart
we got something going on

tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
all this love we feel needs no conversation
we ride it together, our heart
from one love to another, our heart

islands in the stream, that is what we are
no one in between, how can we be wrong?
sail away with me to another world
and we rely on each other, our heart
from one lover to another, our heart

i can't live without you if the love has gone
everything is nothing when you got no one
and you walk in the night
slowly losing sight of the real thing

but that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
too deep in love and we got no way out
and the message is clear
this could be the year for the real thing

no more will you cry, baby, i will hurt you never
we start and end as one in love forever
we can ride it together, our heart
from one love to another, our heart

islands in the stream, that is what we are
no one in between, how can we be wrong?
sail away with me to another world
and we rely on each other, our heart
from one lover to another, our heart

oh, baby, alright
ghetto superstar, that is what you are
coming from afar, reaching for the stars
fly away with me to another place
and we rely on each other, our heart
from one lover to another, our heart

feel i'm going back
to massachusetts
something's telling me
i must go home

and the lights all went out down in massachusetts
the day i left
her standing on her own

tried to hitch a ride
to san francisco
gotta do the things
i wanna do

and the lights all went down in massachusetts
they brought me back
to see my way with you

talk about the life
in massachusetts
speak about the people
i have seen

and the lights all went down in massachusetts
and massachusetts
is one place i have seen

(i will remember massachusetts)
i will remember massachusetts
(i will remember massachusetts)
i will remember massachusetts
(i will remember massachusetts)
i will remember massachusetts

it's over and done
but the heartache lives on inside, oh
and who is the one you're clinging to
instead of me tonight?
and where are you now
now that i need you?
tears on my pillow
wherever you go
i'll cry me a river
that leads to your ocean
you'll never see me fall apart
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taking me over
tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
and if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
you know that there'll be
nobody left in this world to hold me tight
nobody left in this world to kiss good night
good night, good night, good night
good night
i'm there at your side
i'm part of all the things you are, oh
and you got a part of someone else
you go to find your shinning star
and where are you now
now that i need you?
tears on my pillow
wherever you go
i'll cry me a river
that leads to your ocean
you'll never see me fall apart
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taking me over
tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
and if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
you know that there'll be
nobody left in this world to hold me tight
nobody left in this world to kiss good night
good night, good night, good night
good night
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taking me over
tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
and if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
you know that there'll be
nobody left in this world to hold me tight

i couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
i shouldn't let you kick me when i'm down, my baby
i find out everybody know that you've been using me
i'm surprised you let me stay around you
one day i'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
we gotta level before we go and tear this love apart

there's no fight you can't fight
this battle of love with me, you win again
so little time, we do nothing but compete
there's no life on earth
no other could see me through, you win again
some never try, but if anybody can, we can
and i'll be, i'll be, following you (i'll be, i'll be)

oh, girl

oh, baby, i shake you from now on
i'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
i'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
nobody stops this body from taking you
you better beware, i swear
i'm gonna be there one day when you fall
i could never let you cast aside the greatest love of all

there's no fight you can't fight
this battle of love with me, you win again
so little time, we do nothing but compete
there's no life on earth
no other could see me through, you win again
some never try, but if anybody can, we can
and i'll be, i'll be, following you (i'll be, i'll be)

oh, girl

you win again
so little time, we do nothing but compete
there's no life on earth
no other could see me through, you win again
some never try, but if anybody can, we can
and i'll be, i'll be, following you (i'll be, i'll be)
oh, oh girl
you win again
so little time, we do nothing but compete
there's no life on earth (no life)
no other could see me through, you win again
(no other could, no other could)
some never try, but if anybody can, we can
there's no fight you can't fight
this battle of love with me, you win again (this battle of love)

i was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
i could make a woman hang on every single stroke
i was an iron man, i had a master plan
but i was alone

i could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
i remember how your body started trembling
oh, what a night it's been and for the state i'm in
i'm still alone

and all the wonders made for the earth
and all the hearts in all creation
somehow i always end up alone (always end up alone)
always end up alone

so i play, i'll wait
cause you know that love takes time
we came so far
just the beat of a lonely heart
and it's mine
and i don't want to be alone

well, since i got no message on your answer phone
since you're busy every minute i just stay at home
i make believe you care, i feel you everywhere
but i'm still alone

i'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
cause i know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
am i the subject of the pain? am i the stranger in the rain?
i am alone
and if there glory there to behold
maybe it's my imagination
another story there to be told

so i play, i'll wait
and i pray it's not too late
we made it so far
just a beat of a lonely heart
and it's mine
and i don't want to be alone

and all the wonders made for the earth
and all the hearts in all creation
another story there to be told

so i play, i'll wait
and i pray it's not too late
we made it so far
just a beat of a lonely heart
and it's mine
and i don't want to be alone

gone but not out of sight
i'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
face the heat of the night
the one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
shine and search for the light
and sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
and clean out of sight
i'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
face the heat of the night
the one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
shine and search for the light
and sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
and clean out of sight
i'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

in the event of something happening to me
there is something i would like you all to see
it's just a photograph of someone that i knew

have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what it's like on the outside?
don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, mr. jones
i keep straining my ears to hear a sound
maybe someone is digging underground
or have they given up and all gone home to bed
thinking those who once existed must be dead

have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what it's like on the outside?
don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, mr. jones

in the event of something happening to me
there is something i would like you all to see
it's just a photograph of someone that i knew

have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what it's like on the outside?
don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, mr. jones

the preacher talked with me and he smiled
said "come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
now for once in your life you're alone
but you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone"

i've just gotta get a message to you
hold on, hold on
one more hour and my life will be through
hold on, hold on

i told him i'm in no hurry
but if i broke her heart, then won't you tell her i'm sorry
and for once in my life, i'm alone
and i gotta let her know just in time before i go

i've just gotta get a message to you
hold on, hold on
one more hour and my life will be through
hold on, hold on

well i laughed, but that didn't hurt
and it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
now i'm crying, but deep down inside
well i did it to him, now it's my turn to die

i've just gotta get a message to you
hold on, hold on
one more hour and my life will be through
hold on, hold on

i've just gotta get a message to her
hold on, hold on
one more hour and my life will be through
hold on, hold on
i've just gotta get a message to her
hold on, hold on

your kisses taste like honey
sweet lies don't gimme no rise
oh, oh what you're trying to do?
livin' on your cheatin'
and the pain grows inside me
it's enough to leave me crying in the rain
love you forever but you're
driving me insane
and i'm hanging on
oh, oh, i'll win, i'll never give in
our love has got the power
too many lovers in one lifetime
ain't good for you
you treat me like a vision in the night
someone there to stand behind you
when your world ain't working right
i ain't no vision, i am the man
who loves you inside and out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
i love no other way
what am i gonna do if we lose that fire?
wrap myself up and take me home again
too many heartaches in one
lifetime ain't good for me
i figure it's the love that keeps you warm
let this moment be forever
we won't ever feel the storm
i ain't no vision, i am the man
who loves you inside and out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
i love no other way
what am i gonna do if we lose that fire?
don't try to tell me it's all over
i can't hear a word i can't hear a line
no man could love you more
and that's what i'm cryin' for
you can't change the way i feel inside
you're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
blow out the candle i will burn again tomorrow
no man on earth can stand
between my love and i
and no matter how you hurt me
i will love you till i die

i ain't no vision, i am the man
who loves you inside and out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
i love no other way
what am i gonna do if we lose that fire?

what am i gonna do if we lose that fire?

here we are
in a room full of strangers
standing in the dark
where your eyes couldn't see me

well, i had to follow you
though you did not want me to
but that won't stop my loving you
i can't stay away

blamin' it all on the nights on broadway
singin' them love songs
singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
blamin' it all on the nights on broadway
singin' them sweet sounds
to that crazy, crazy town

now in my place
there are so many others
standin' in the line
how long will they stand between us

well, i had to follow you
though you did not want me to
but that won't stop my loving you
i can't stay away

blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
on the nights on broadway (blame it on the nights on broadway)
singin' them love songs
singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
blamin' it all (i'm blamin' it all)
on the nights on broadway (blame it on the nights on broadway)
singin' them sweet sounds
to that crazy, crazy town (oh those nights)

i will wait
even if it takes forever
i will wait
even if it takes a lifetime
somehow i feel inside
you never-ever left my side
make it like it was before
even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh
