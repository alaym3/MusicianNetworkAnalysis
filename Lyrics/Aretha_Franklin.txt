looking out on the morning rain
i used to feel so uninspired
and when i knew i had to face another day
lord, it made me feel so tired
before the day i met you
life was so unkind
and you're the key to my peace of mind

'cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like a natural woman
(woman)

when my soul was in the lost and found
you came along to claim it
i didn't know just what was wrong with me
till your kiss helped me name it
now i'm no longer doubtful of what i'm living for
and if i make you happy, i don't need to do more

'cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like a natural woman
(woman)

oh baby, what you've done to me (what you've done to me)
you made me feel so good inside (good inside)
and i just wanna be (wanna be)
close to you, you make me feel so alive

you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like a natural woman
(woman)
you make me feel

(chain, chain, chain)
chain of fools

for five long years
i thought you were my man
but i found out, love
i'm just a link in your chain
you got me where you want me
i ain't nothing but your fool
you treated me mean
oh, you treated me cruel

chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain)
chain of fools

every chain
has got a weak link
i might be weak, yeah
but i'll give you strength, oh, hey
you told me to leave you alone
my father said, "come on home"
my doctor said, "take it easy"
oh, but your loving is much too strong

i'm added to your chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain)
chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain)
chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain)
your chain of fools

one of these mornings
the chain is gonna break
but up until the day
i'm gonna take all i can take, oh hey

chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain)

your chain of fools, oh

chain, chain, chain
(chain, chain, chain) oh
chain, chain, chain
your chain of fools, oh yeah

you're a no good heartbreaker
you're a liar and you're a cheat
and i don't know why
i let you do these things to me
my friends keep telling me
that you ain't no good
but oh, they don't know
that i'd leave you if i could
i guess i'm uptight
and i'm stuck like glue

'cause i ain't never
i ain't never, i ain't never, no, no
loved a man, the way that i, i love you

some time ago i thought
you had run out of fools
but i was so wrong
you got one that you'll never lose
the way you treat me is a shame
how could you hurt me so bad?
baby, you know that i'm the best thing
that you ever had

kiss me once again
don't you never, never say that we we're through

'cause i ain't never
never, never, no, no
loved a man, the way that i, i love you

i can't sleep at night
and i can't eat a bite
i guess i'll never be free
since you got, your hooks, in me
oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

i ain't never loved a man
i ain't never loved a man, baby
ain't never had a man hurt me so bad, no
well, this is what i'm going to do about it
i tell you, i'm gonna...

i'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
one step ahead of misery
one step is all i'd have to take backwards
to be the same old fool for you i used to be

i'm only one step ahead of your arms
one kiss away from your sweet lips
i know i can't afford to stop for one moment
'cause i'm just out of reach of your fingertips

your warm breath on my shoulder
keeps reminding me
that it's too soon to forget you
it's too late to be free, can't you see?

i'm only one step ahead of your love
i try and yet i can't take two
seems like i'll have to take that one step backwards
'cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
'cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
just one step ahead is a step too far away from you

(you're all i need, you're all i need, you're all i need)

listen, dear
i realise that you've been hurt, deep
because i've been there
but regardless to who, what, why, when and where
we're all precious in his sight
and a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

there was a rose i knew, i done met her once or twice before
she was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
she never knew what hit her, oh
steal her honey, then forget her
now the rose is scorned
she wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'cause a rose is still a rose
baby girl, you're still a flower
he can't leave you and then take you
make you and then break you
darlin', you hold the power (what i am is what i am)

now believe me when i tell you that i've been hurt myself
when he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
and now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
oh, oh, yeah
when she gets nearer
she's cryin', you can't hear her
now the rose is scorned
she wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'cause a rose is still a rose
baby girl, you're still a flower
he can't leave you and then take you
make you and then break you
baby girl, you hold the power (what i am is what i am)

see, a rose is still a rose
baby girl, you're still a flower
he can't leave you and then take you
make you and then break you
darlin', you hold the power (what i am is what i am)

let your life be in the sunshine
not the darkness of your sorrow
you may see you're lost today
but new love will come tomorrow
don't believe that life is over
just because your man is gone
girl, love yourself enough to know
that without him, your life goes on
without him, your life goes on
and without him, your life goes on

'cause a rose is still a rose
baby girl, you're still a flower
he can't leave you and then take you
make you and then break you
baby girl, you hold the power (what i am is what i am)

see, a rose is still a rose
baby girl, you're still a flower
he can't leave you and then take you
make you and then break you
darlin', you hold the power (what i am is what i am)
