in my eyes, indisposed
in disguises no one knows
hides the face, lies the snake
in the sun in my disgrace
boiling heat, summer stench
'neath the black the sky looks dead
call my name through the cream
and i'll hear you scream again

black hole sun, won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come? won't you come?

stuttering, cold and damp
steal the warm wind, tired friend
times are gone for honest men
sometimes far too long for snakes
in my shoes, a walking sleep
and my youth i pray to keep
heaven send hell away
no one sings like you anymore

black hole sun, won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come?
blackhole sun,  won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come?

black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun


hang my head, drown my fear
'til you all just disappear

black hole sun, won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come?
black hole sun, won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come?

black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?
won't you come?

whatsoever i feared has come to light
and whatsoever i've fought off became my life
just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
sunspots have faded, now i'm doin' time, now i'm doin' time

'cause i fell on black days
i fell on black days

whomsoever i've cured, i've sickened now
and whomsoever i've cradled, i've put you down
i'm a searchlight soul, they say, but i can't see it in the night
i'm only faking, when i get it right, when i get it right

'cause i fell on black days
i fell on black days

how would i know that this could be my fate?
how would i know that this could be my fate?

till what you wanted to see good has made you blind
and what you wanted to be yours has made it mine
so don't you lock up somethin' that you wanted to see fly
hands are for shaking, no, not tying, no, not tying

i sure don't mind a change
i sure don't mind a change
sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change
i sure don't mind a change

'cause i fell on black days
i fell on black days

how would i know that this could be my fate?
how would i know that this could be my fate?
how would i know that this could be my fate?
how would i know that this could be my fate?

i sure don't mind a change

shower in the dark day
clean sparks driving down
cool in the waterway
where the baptized drown
naked in the cold sun
breathing life like fire
thought i was the only one
but that was just a lie

cause i heard it in the wind
and i saw it in the sky
and i thought it was the end
and i thought it was the 4th of july

pale in the flare light
the scared light cracks & disappears
and leads the scorched ones here
and everywhere no one cares
the fire is spreading
and no one wants to speak about it
down in the hole
jesus tries to crack a smile
beneath another shovel load

i heard it in the wind
and i saw it in the sky
and i thought it was the end
and i thought it was the 4th of july
i heard it in the wind
and i saw it in the sky
and i thought it was the end
and i thought it was the 4th of july (july, july)

now i'm in control
now i'm in the fall out
once asleep but now i stand
and i still remember
your sweet everything
light a roman candle
and hold it in your hand

cause i heard it in the wind
and i saw it in the sky
and i thought it was the end
and i thought it was the 4th of july
i heard it in the wind
and i saw it in the sky
and i thought it was the end
and i thought it was the 4th of july
yeahhhhhh

follow me into the desert
as thirsty as you are
crack a smile and cut your mouth
and drown in alcohol
'cause down below the truth is lying
beneath the riverbed
so quench yourself and drink the water
that flows below her head

oh no, there she goes
out in the sunshine
the sun is mine
the sun is mine

i shot my love today, would you cry for me?
i lost my head again, would you lie for me?

close your eyes and bow your head
i need a little sympathy
'cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
who isn't me
so kill your health and kill yourself
and kill everything you love
and if you live you can fall to pieces
and suffer with my ghost

i shot my love today, would you cry for me?
i lost my head again, would you lie for me?
i left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
i lost my head again, would you cry for me?

it's just a burden in my hand
it's just an anchor on my heart
it's just a tumor in my head
and i'm in the dark

so follow me into the desert
as desperate as you are
where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
and all the little pigs have god

oh no, there she goes
out in the sunshine
the sun is mine
the sun is mine

i shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah?
i lost my head again, would you lie for me?
i left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
i lost my head again, would you cry for me?
yeah, would you cry for me?

oh, you wired me awake
and hit me with a hand of broken nails
yeah, you tied my lead and pulled my chain
to watch my blood begin to boil

but i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
yeah, i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage
and run

too cold to start a fire
i'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
yeah, i'll take the river down to stillwater
and ride a pack of dogs

but i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
yeah, i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage
and run

hits like a phillips head into my brain
it's gonna be too dark to sleep again
cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains
i'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

when the forest burns along the road
like god's eyes in my headlights
when the dogs are looking for their bones
and it's raining icepicks on your steel shore

well, i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
well, i'm gonna break
i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break my rusty cage
and run

nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard i try
nothing is closing my eyes
nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
no

and nothing seems to break me
no matter how far i fall
nothing can break me at all
not one for giving up though not invincible
i know

i've given everything i need
i'd give you everything i own
i'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
i've given everything i could
to blow it to hell and gone
burrow down in and
blow up the outside
blow up the outside world

someone tried to tell me something
"don't let the world bring you down"
nothing can do me in before i do myself
so save it for your own and the ones you can help
no

i've given everything i need
i'd give you everything i own
i'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
i've given everything i could
to blow it to hell and gone
burrow down in and
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside world


want to make it understood
wanting though i never would
trying though i know it's wrong
blowing it to hell and gone
wishing though i never could
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside world

blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside
blow up the outside...

heard it from another room
eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
love's like suicide
dazed out in a garden bed
with a broken neck lays my broken gift
just like suicide
and my last ditch
was my last brick
lent to finish her
finish her
she lived like a martyr
how she'd fly so sweetly
she lived like a martyr
but she dies
just like suicide
bit down on the bullet now
i had a taste so sour
i had to think of something sweet
love's like suicide
safe outside my gilded cage
with an ounce of pain
i wield a ton of rage
just like suicide
with eyes of blood
and bitter blue
how i feel for you
i feel for you
she lived like a martyr
how she'd fly so sweetly
she lived like a martyr
but she died
just like suicide
hey yeah
ohh
and my last ditch
was my last brick
yeah, lent to finish her
finish her
with eyes of blood
and bitter blue
how i feel for you
i feel for you
i feel for you
i feel for you
i feel it
oh, i feel for you
hey
she lived like a martyr
how she'd fly so sweetly
she lived like a martyr
but she died
just like suicide

i caught the moon today
pick it up
and throw it away all right
i got the perfect steal
a cleaner love
with a dirty feel all right
fallout and take the bait
eat the fruit
and kiss the snake goodnight

common ruse, dirty face
pretty noose is pretty hate
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from

let your motor race
pick it up
and get this mother gone
out from and far away
the wooden stake
this thing has got me on

diamond rope, silver chain
pretty noose is pretty pain
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from

common ruse, dirty face
pretty noose is pretty hate
and i don't care what you got
i don't care what you need
i don't want anything
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
and i don't like what you got me hanging from
yeah

and you stare at me
in your jesus christ pose
arms held out
like you've been carrying a load
and you swear to me
you don't want to be my slave
but you're staring at me

like i, like i need to be saved, saved
like i need to be saved, saved
in your jesus christ pose
in your jesus christ pose

arms held out
in your jesus christ pose
thorns and shroud
like it's the coming of the lord
and i swear to you
that i'd never feed you pain
but you're staring at me

nails (nails), nails (nails)
like i'm driving the nails (nails), nails
in your jesus christ pose
in your jesus christ pose

arms held out
in your jesus christ pose
thorns and shroud
it's the coming of the lord
would it pain you more to walk on water
than to wear a crown of thorns
it wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich

than to bury you poor
poor (in your jesus christ pose)
poor (in your jesus christ pose)

if i took you for a ride, would you take it wrong?
or would you make it right, make it right?
looking for a pedestal that i can put you on
