you fight me off like a firefighter
so tell me why you still get burned
you say you're not, but you're still a liar
'cause i'm the one that you run to first

every time, yeah, why do you try to deny it?
when you show up every night and
tell me that you want me, but it's complicated, so complicated

when it hurts, but it hurts so good
do you take it? do you break it off?
when it hurts, but it hurts so good
can you say it? can you say it?
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good

every time that i swear it's over
it makes you want me even more
you pull away and i come in closer
and all we ever stay is torn
baby, i don't know why i try to deny it
when you show up every night
i tell you that i want you, but it's complicated, so complicated

when it hurts, but it hurts so good
do you take it? do you break it off?
when it hurts, but it hurts so good
can you say it? can you say it?
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good

wide awake through the daylight
would you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
reach for you with my hands tied
are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?

when it hurts, but it hurts so good
do you take it? do you break it off?
when it hurts, but it hurts so good
can you say it? can you say it?
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
(yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
your love is like- (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
it hurts so good 

i said i hate you, i was angry
i got so mad, i slammed your door
you know i really love you, baby
i didn't mean to start a war
and i know there's a line, but i crossed it
and i pray that it won't leave a scar
i said i hate you, but i'm sorry
sometimes i wish you'd cut me off

maybe i should think before i talk
i get emotional and words come out all wrong
sometimes i'm more honest than i want
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before i talk

i try my best to make it better (better)
i'm all out of apologies (apologies)
you know i'm not good under pressure (pressure)
guess hurting you is hurting me
i took all that we built and i broke it
and i pray it won't tear us apart
so let me piece it back together
i know i cut you pretty deep (know i cut you pretty deep)
maybe i should think before i talk
i get emotional and words come out all wrong
sometimes i'm more honest than i want
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before
i know that i should think before i speak
'cause i'm saying things that i don't even mean
maybe i'm more honest than i wanna be
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before i

say something i might regret
and i might get too far under your skin
i can't lie, i wish we could try it again
oh i, i wish we could try it again

maybe i should think before i talk
i get emotional and words come out all wrong
sometimes i'm more honest than i want
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before
i know that i should think before i speak
'cause i'm saying things that i don't even mean
maybe i'm more honest than i wanna be
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before i talk
oh, oh, oh, oh
so maybe i should think before
maybe next time, i'll think before i talk 

my heart feels like the sharpest razor blade
i really hope this won't give me away
'cause i've been drowning here for days
like a watercolor about to fade
every inch of me is there to trace
no secrets left here on my page
underneath my skin, i see a change
blood races right up to my face

bursting out, no, i can't take it
you really wore me down
read my mind just like i'm naked
there's no hiding now
i'm paper thin, paper thin
paper thin, paper thin

you make me feel like a piece of art
hanging on your wall, just like my heart
making shadows even in the dark
i'm see-through but i won't fall apart

bursting out, no, i can't take it
you really wore me down
read my mind just like i'm naked
there's no hiding now
i'm paper thin, paper thin
paper thin, paper thin
paper thin, paper thin
paper thin
slowly you've been wearing me down
pulling up my roots from the ground
the way i feel's so obvious now
'cause i'm paper thin in love with you now

i'm bursting out, no, i can't take it
you really wore me down
read my mind just like i'm naked
there's no hiding now
i'm paper thin, paper thin
paper thin, paper thin
paper thin, paper thin
paper thin 

say you need more space
what are you, an astronaut?
got the whole universe
so what you coming 'round here for?
said you need more air
are you underwater now?
we're not even in that deep
acting like you're gonna drown

we were dancing late into the day
half asleep and half awake
when the music starts to fade
we were laying, laying in my bed
for one second, you forget
oh, here we go again

you say you want a break, so we break up
it's a mistake, so we make up
and then we make out, you freak out
here we go again
you say we go too fast when you're sober
then have a glass, you're coming over
and then we make out, you freak out
don't be such a boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
don't be such a boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

you say you need more me
what, am i a toy again?
you play me like you're all i got
but i ain't hanging by your threads
you say you need love
mmm, yeah, we all do
and i want to if you let me

we were dancing late into the day
half asleep and half awake
when the music starts to fade
we were laying, laying in my bed
for one second, you forget
oh, here we go again
you say you wanna break, so we break up
it's a mistake, so we make up
and then we make out, you freak out
here we go again
say we go too fast, when you're sober
then have a glass, you're coming over
and then we make out, you freak out

boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

breathe in, breathe out
we're chilling, so chill out
you're falling to fall out
don't be such a boy
breathe in, breathe out
we're chilling, so chill out
you're falling to fall out
don't be such a boy 

jenter er helt gærne
gutter er klin kokkos
alminneligheten tok oss
så lite håp noen gang har hjulpet noen
og verden ha'kke noen penger på oss
jeg blir sjalu og verden bli'kke det
men verden er full av blikkene alle prøver å kvittes med
finnes ingen logikk i det
alle er bare skuespiller og ingen husker replikkene
og vi kan ikke sufflere, hva som helst bare ikke det
vi er de eneste oppriktige
jeg og du, bare at vi, ikke hver for oss
det er de eneste detaljene jeg sliter med
og la oss stikke ut å sjofe stjerner
mens hele verdensrommet slåss
kun for våres øyne, vi er fulle og vi er høye og jeg kan sverge at verden spinner rundt oss

verden er ikke bra nok, vi er perfekt
perfekt, lover dette er perfekt
verden kan ikke ta oss, det er for perfekt
perfekt, la det være erkjent
det er for perfekt
verden er ikke bra nok, vi er perfekt
perfekt, lover dette er perfekt
verden kan ikke ta oss, det er for perfekt
perfekt, la det være erkjent
det er for perfekt
du er en ekte engel, du kommer ikke fra jorden
jeg er en ung mann og forelsket i en demon
denne verden er ikke skapt for deg og meg
jeg sverger det finnes en konspirasjon
du satt over meg på stasjonen
pupiller endeløse de rommer en dimensjon hver
jeg er ikke vennen din, du er ikke vennen min
for evigheten bor her, og vi vet

vi er perfekt men verden er ikke det
øynene blankere enn arkene sånn de egentlig så ut
for alle slagene og sparkene, jeg er bare en gutt
alene med alle tankene som-ah
vi er perfekt men verden er ikke det
asjetter til elefantene
sier vi samme tinga helt til vi begge er vant til det
blir det til slutt noe sant i det

verden er ikke bra nok, vi er perfekt
perfekt, lover dette er perfekt
verden kan ikke ta oss, det er for perfekt
perfekt, la det være erkjent
det er for perfekt
verden kan ikke ta oss, det er for perfekt
perfekt, lover dette er perfekt
verden kan ikke ta oss, det er for perfekt
perfekt, la det være erkjent
det er for perfekt 

i forget to

it's been a week since you hit my bed
and since then, you've started living in my head, eh
seven days, and i'm nearly dead
never thought that i'd reboot
but you're a different kind of new

it's like i feel everything more (i forget to)
all my body knows it when you reach my floor, eh
my heart is beating down the door
and now i'm stocking up on oxygen

'cause when i see you
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to, when i'm with you
(i forget to)

if i could just inhale some chill
it's like i'm living out in space
how am i still here?
did you slip me a magic pill?
got me lifted like an astronaut
no helmet on and my lungs just stop
so please, when you look at me like that
there's no way to fight back, no
please, can't you see i'm stocking up on oxygen?

'cause when i see you
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to, when i'm with you
when i see you, i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to, when i'm with you

i don't know how to live without the breath you finish
i don't know how to live without the breath you finish
i don't know how to live without the breath you finish
give me it, give me it

i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to bre-e-eathe
i forget to, when i'm with you
when i see you, i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to bre-e-eathe (i forget to)
i forget to, when i'm with you
i forget to 

on my way to your house
sneakers in the snow
i only wanna see her
and my thoughts are so loud
'cause i just wanna know, are you gonna keep her?

only call you faded
sorry, i know you hate it
probably shouldn't say this
but it hurts to bite my tongue

does she know that you held me in the dark?
does she know that i had you from the start?
does she know that the bruises never change?
my marks are on your heart
i had you from the start
remember?

ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
does she know?
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
holding water in my hands, but it never lasts
slipping through my fingers
think i held on too tight
cutting off the blood
you don't feel a thing 'til it hurts

only call you faded
sorry, i know you hate it, oh
probably shouldn't say this
but i'm done biting my tongue

now, does she know that you held me in the dark?
does she know that i had you from the start?
does she know that the bruises never change?
my marks are on your heart
i had you from the start
remember?

ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
does she know?
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
does she know?
does she know? (does she know?)
does she know that you held me in the dark?
does she know that i had you from the start?
does she know that the bruises never change?
my marks are on your heart
i had you from the start 

two weeks and i wait 'til the feeling hits
maybe i just haven't let it sink in
for three years we were living together
held me like you'd hold me forever
didn't think that heartbreak would feel like this

from everything to nothing at all
from every day to never at all
and everyone says that i should be sad
is it normal that

i don't feel sorry for myself
care if your hands touch somebody else
wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
it's okay if you forget me
i don't feel empty now that you're gone
does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
but i'll tell you what the worst is
it's the way it doesn't hurt
when i wish it did

patience is a thing that i learned from you
that some things can feel wrong even though they're true
went through all the hard times together
kept me calm when i'd lose my temper
i'm just really grateful that i had you
from everything to nothing at all
every day to never at all
and everyone says that i should be sad
is it normal that

i don't feel sorry for myself
care if your hands touch somebody else
wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
it's okay if you forget me
i don't feel empty now that you're gone
does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
and i'll tell you what the worst is
it's the way it doesn't hurt
when i wish it did

i wish it did
when i wish it did

from everything to nothing at all
from every day to never at all
and everyone says that i should be sad
is it normal that
i don't feel sorry for myself
care if your hands touch somebody else
wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
it's okay if you forget me
i don't feel empty now that you're gone
does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
and i'll tell you what the worst is
it's the way it doesn't hurt
when i wish it did
i wish it did 

he's asleep, way too deep
living like no one ever did before
and where he goes, i can't tell
no one knows
no one knows
he's got this look in his eyes
now i don't know

hyde
hyde
hyde

when he's done, tucks me in at night
when you're gone, he's the one
tucks me in at night
when you leave, he's right there
quench his thirst without a care

hyde
hyde
hyde
it’s not like i remember it
nothing at all makes him satisfied
oh, i can't keep him away when it's cold at night
and he just took my name and he threw it right in to the wall
know i'm not allowed to know about what he can't live without
his clouds

what if you understood all the words i'm too afraid to say out loud?
and what it's like living like poison through these veins
he gets this look in his eyes
now i don't know

hyde
hyde
hyde

when he's done, tucks me in at night
when you're gone, he's the one
tucks me in at night
when you leave, he's right there
quench his thirst without a care
hyde
hyde
hyde 

did you forget that i've got a thing called emotion?
you live and you let 'til you start to bleed
how would i know? 'cause you left my wound wide open
just for how long will you let it bleed? oh

the town we are from, the small-minded talk
we'd sing the songs with the lyrics all wrong
invested in love but now you feel broke
'cause shit didn't turn out the way that you hoped
i get that you're hurt 'cause we don't spend time
as much as we used to, but don't we all learn from mistakes?
mhm

did you forget that i've got a thing called emotion?
you live and you let 'til you start to bleed
how would i know? 'cause you left my wound wide open
just for how long will you let it bleed?

did you know the lies you would feed me
in the end, i'd start to believe them?
did you forget i've got a thing called emotion?
why can't we talk it over?
i just, i just don't get it
why can't we talk it over?
did you forget that i've got a thing called emotion?
you live and you let 'til you start to bleed
how would i know? 'cause you left my wound wide open
just for how long will you let it bleed? oh

did you know the lies you would feed me
in the end, i'd start to believe them?
did you forget i've got a thing called emotion? 

if i fell with no one around
would it even make a sound?
'cause i can't even make one now
and i get these thoughts in my head
but i wouldn't do it anyway
or at least that's what i say

'til i'm right on the edge
i take a look at the bottom
and i know it will hurt hitting ground
but i don't think that i'd mind the falling
would anyone know?
is there anyone watching?
i'm getting crazy ideas in my head
and i don't think i'm able to stop them
jump

when the water rushes in
i feel it filling up my lungs
i'm in the calm before the storm
when i dive, feel the wind in my hair
nobody can talk me down
i'm really gonna do it now
i'm standing right on the edge
looking down at the bottom
and i know it will hurt hitting ground
but i don't think that i'd mind the falling
would anyone know?
is there anyone watching?
i'm getting crazy ideas in my head
and i'm not even trying to stop them
jump
i'm standing right on the edge
looking down at the bottom
and i know it will hurt hitting ground
but i don't think that i'd mind the falling
would anyone know?
is there anyone watching?
i'm getting crazy ideas in my head
and i'm not even trying to stop them
jump 

i know i shouldn't say what i'm 'bout to say
'cause it's never okay to go and bring your exes up
no matter what
my second and my third, i hate they got the worst of me
they don't deserve the way that i was treating 'em
i'd lead them on

when i knew what i was doing
i was stupid, i was ruined, i was healing
but the healing never happened
and i'm sorry that i did you wrong

to all the ones i ever loved
never let you in enough
not your fault, i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
to all the ones i ever hurt
always knew it wouldn't work
not your fault, i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah

i just can't forget some of the words he said
the memories in my bed keep coming back again
like daggers in my mind, yeah
they draw blood all night, yeah
yeah, i know what i've been doing
running through 'em just to try and catch a feeling
but the feeling never happened
and i'm sorry that i did you wrong

to all the ones i ever loved
never let you in enough
not your fault i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
to all the ones i ever hurt
always knew it wouldn't work
not your fault i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah, yeah
no, there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah, yeah

promise that it kills
every time you send
a picture from a place
you and i used to go
i hope you know

to all the ones i ever loved
never let you in enough
not your fault i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
to all the ones i ever hurt
always knew it wouldn't work
not your fault i gave too much
to the first one, to the first one
there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah, yeah
no, there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah, yeah
no, there ain't nothing i can do about it, yeah, yeah
(no, there ain't nothing i can do about it) yeah, yeah 

having a bad day
having  a good day
having  a day that's in between
feel like i hold back
and i don't know why
can't  seem to say just what i mean

so  many people, all of the ones surrounding me
and if you'd ask them, they would describe me differently
so  many reasons, so many different sides of me
and i can't decide who i want to be

'cause some people make me bitter
smile and then squeeze a lime in my cut
and  some people make me sweeter
'cause they make me feel like i am enough
and that makes me a giver
but my mom says i tend to give too much
and some people make me better
and that's how i know my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you

having a moment
weight on my shoulders
i can't describe just how i feel
don't have to say it
look at my face and you'll know exactly what i mean
so many people, all of the ones surrounding me
and if you'd ask them, they would describe me differently
so many reasons, so many different sides of me
and i can't decide who i want to be

'cause some people make me bitter
smile and then squeeze a lime in my cut
and some people make me sweeter
'cause they make me feel like i am enough
and that makes me a giver
but my mom says i tend to give too much
and some people make me better
and that's how i know my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you

some people make me nervous
'cause they make me feel like nothing at all
but some people think i'm perfect
'cause they wouldn't want me to change at all
and that's what i deserve
and i'm reminded of how lucky i am
'cause most people make me better
and that's how i know
my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you
my favorite part of me is you 

cold running through my body
nothing ever felt so right
i could get lost
you're all that i want
i need you here by my side
you're running through my body
i feel it inside my bones
don't know what's happening
you got me trippin'

i don't wanna be alone tonight
you're out of sight, oh
so, where you at?
where you at, yeah?
where you at?
where you at, yeah?
world slows down
i've lost my ground, oh
so, where you at?

where, where, where you at?

two in the morning
i can't control it
lost in the moment
i just can't get no sleep, eh
two in the morning
everything's frozen
i keep on falling, and i just can't get no sleep
cold
the sky's getting cloudy
my eyes start raining
making a river as it grows bigger
it's pulling me away downstream
now the water is rising
my head's going under
drowning my thoughts
turning ‘em off

and i just wonder, where you at?
please take me back, oh
it's killing me (killing me)
it's killing me (killing me)
world slows down
i've lost my ground, oh
it's killing me (killing me)
killing me

say you need your space
i can read your face
when it gets cloudy, just come and find me
take you to a place
i won't leave a trace
we can be safe here
middle of nowhere

ooh, i know where you run
i know where you run, run to
let me be the one
let me be the one
show you how it's done
crash into the sun
i know where you run
i know where you run, run to
let me be the one
let me be the one
show you how it's done
'cause we're staying young

louder, wilder, harder
i'ma make you feel
i'ma make you feel young
deeper, bolder, stronger
i'ma make you feel
show you something real
we could take a plane right to outer space
one with the stars now
yeah, we are far out

when i'm with you, i'm dizzy
can't stop my head from spinning
everything's slow
you make me feel like water
go with the flow and further
we're not growing old

louder, wilder, harder
i'ma make you feel
i'ma make you feel young
deeper, bolder, stronger
i'ma make you feel
show you something real

ooh, i know where you run

deeper, bolder, stronger
i'ma make you feel
show you something real 

try to tune out the sunday quiet
thinking a drink will ease your mind
the bloody mary tastes like what you gave away
the minute you lay your head to rest
and you start to feel it in your chest
you're having second thoughts and you just wanna talk
but i'm doing everything i can to just get over you
so, when you clear your throat and reach out for your phone
think i know exactly what you wanna say, but don't...

'cause i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)
i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)

can't say i want you to be sad
but i didn't think you'd move so fast
and i can't look at you holding someone new
thinking about it only hurts
'cause i know you use my tricks on her
but could you please not go to every place i showed you?
i'm still doing everything i can to just get over you
and when i hear your name, i have to walk away
'cause i'm just so scared of hearing what they're gonna say
i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)
i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)
i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)
i don't wanna know
(mmm-mmm-mmm...)

it's not easy to stay busy
long days and late nights can't keep you off my mind
but are you feeling the same?

the minute i lay my head to rest
i start to feel it in my chest
i'm having second thoughts, but i don't wanna talk
'cause i don't wanna know 

when you meet someone who has someone
is it your fault if you fall in love?
when you know that you could hurt someone
is it your fault if you get involved?

try to stay away from you
but no one gets to me like you
i got everything to lose
yeah, i know

it's a mistake and my heart's gonna break
it'll probably take me years to get over
even the hurt, yeah, i know that it's worth
all the years it'll take for me to get over you, you
years to get over you, you

when you meet someone and have someone
and you're falling in and out of love
and when you're close to giving up
just to give in to another touch

you'll be coming home to me
sleeping where you shouldn't be
still i can't tell you to leave
no, i know
it's a mistake and my heart's gonna break
it'll probably take me years to get over
even the hurt, yeah i know that it's worth
all the years it'll take for me to get over you, you
years to get over you, you

now i'm better off without you
probably better off without me too

it's a mistake and my heart's gonna break
it'll probably take me years to get over
even the hurt, yeah i know that it's worth
all the years it'll take for me to get over you, you
years to get over you, you

when you meet someone who has someone
is it your fault if you fall in love? 

pour all the champagne
make it rain
have our own parade
we don't feel a thing
chardonnay running through our veins

we don't have to go, go home
we can stay here
layed out on the floor
have one more 'til the room clears
pour all the champagne
make it rain
we can stay here
stay here

and don't say the party's over
'cause we've got time to let it go
and don't say we're leaving sober
just stay the night, don't take me home
and don't say it's over
don't say it's over
and don't say it's over, over, over, no
don't say it's over
give me one more dance
one more kiss
we don't need a song
take another hit, 'nother sip
all before it's gone

you don't have to go, go home
you can stay here
tell me you won't go
take it slow 'til the rooms clears
give me one more dance, one more kiss
we can stay here, stay here

and don't say the party's over
'cause we've got time to let it go
and don't say we're leaving sober
just stay the night, don't take me home
stay the night
and don't say it's over
don't say it's over
and don't say it's over, over, over, no
don't say it's over
don't say it, don't say
don't say it, don't say
don't say it

only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
only got one night, one time

and don't say the party's over
'cause we've got time to let it go
and don't say we're leaving sober
just stay the night, don't take me home
and don't say it's over (no)
don't say it's over
and don't say it's over, over, over, no
don't say it's over, no

pour all the champagne
make it rain
we can stay here
stay here

it's like i can't escape your face, i see you everywhere
you're standing in the spotlight, it's like you're on the tv
i'm checking every window i walk past in case you're there (ah)
head against the wall
i've been here before
i can't let you go

it's hard, but it's true
i can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you (ah)
it's hard, but it's true (ah)

leaving is easy, easy for him
counting the nights
i keep my face in his sweater, i'm keeping
pretend that he holds me, embrace me
leaving is easy
leaving is easy

wherever i go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been
i go he's been

but you get out of my head now, baby
you get out of my head now

wherever i go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been
i go he's been
touching me gently
holding me close
breathe on my skin
lips down my body
ain't like nobody
he got me feeling, floating
leaving is easy
leaving is easy

wherever i go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been
i go he's been

he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
he's floating in my bloodstream now
gentle with my words
speak like my tongue burns
but i don't want to weigh your mind
i don't know what's worse
must have been why
dead nor alive
that must be why
mmm, i'm stuck in between with him (...my bloodstream now)

wherever i go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever
wherever i go he's been
i go he's been
wherever i go he's been, wherever (you...)
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever (get out of my head now, baby...)
wherever i go he's been, go he's been, wherever (you...)
wherever i go he's been
i go he's been (get out of my head now...)

get out of my head now, baby
get out of my head now
