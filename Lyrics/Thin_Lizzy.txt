haven't changed, hadn't much to say

told them you were livin' downtown
drivin' all the old men crazy

man, when i tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
i mean she was steamin'
and that time over at johnny's place
well, this chick got up and she slapped johnny's face
man, we just fell about the place
if that chick don't wanna know, forget her

{instrumental}

spread the word around...

friday night they'll be dressed to kill
down at dino's bar and grill
the drink will flow, and blood will spill
and if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
that jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
the nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
won't be long 'til summer comes
now that the boys are here again
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
(spread the word around)
the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town
(the boys are back, the boys are back)


the boys are back in town again
they're hangin' down at dino's
the boys are back in town again! 

as i was goin' over
the cork and kerry mountains
i saw captain farrell
and his money he was countin'

i first produced my pistol
and then produced my rapier
i said "stand o'er and deliver
or the devil he may take ya".

musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
whack for my daddy-o,
whack for my daddy-o
there's whiskey in the jar-o

i took all of his money
and it was a pretty penny
i took all of his money
and i brought it home to molly

she swore that she'd love me
never would she leave me
but the devil take that woman
for you know she tricked me easy
musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
whack for my daddy-o,
whack for my daddy-o
there's whiskey in the jar-o

being drunk and weary
i went to molly's chamber
takin' my money with me
and i never knew the danger

for about six or maybe seven
in walked captain farrell
i jumped up, fired off my pistols
and i shot him with both barrels

musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
whack for my daddy-o,
whack for my daddy-o
there's whiskey in the jar-o

now some men like the fishin'
and some men like the fowlin',
and some men like ta hear
a cannon ball a roarin'
me? i like sleepin'
especially in my molly's chamber
but here i am in prison
here i am with a ball and chain, yeah

musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
whack for my daddy-o,
whack for my daddy-o
there's whiskey in the jar-o

and i got drunk on whiskey-o
and i loved, i loved, i loved
i loved, i loved, i loved my molly-o
and cheerio farrell
and i'll burn it down
that dirty ol' town 

when i passed you in the doorway
well you took me with a glance
i should have took that last bus home
but i asked you for a dance
now we go steady to the pictures
i always get chocolate stains on my pants
and my father he's going crazy
he says i'm living in a trance

but i'm dancing in the moonlight
its caught me in its spotlight (it's alright, alright)
said i'm dancing in the moonlight
on this long, hot summer night

it's three o'clock in the morning
and i'm on the streets again
i disobeyed another warning
i should've been in by ten
now i won't get out until sunday
i'll have to say i stayed with friends
oh, but it's a habit worth forming
if it means to justify the ends
dancing in the moonlight
its caught me in its spotlight (it's alright, alright)
dancing in the moonlight
on this long, hot summer night

and i'm walking home
the last bus is long gone
but i'm dancing in the moonlight


dancing in the moonlight
its caught me in its spotlight (it's alright, alright)
dancing in the moonlight
on this long, hot summer night
dancing in the moonlight (i'm dancing in the moonlight)
its caught me in its spotlight (its caught me in its spotlight)
dancing in the moonlight (i'm dancing in the moonlight)
on this long, hot summer night (its got me hot)
dancing in the moonlight (i'm dancing in the moonlight)
its caught me in its spotlight (its caught me alright, alright)
dancing in the moonlight
on this long, hot summer night (it's so goddamn hot)
dancing in the moonlight (i'm dancing)
its caught me in its spotlight (i'm still dancing)
dancing in the moonlight (i'm dancing in the moonlight) 

i am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
a starry night, a campfire light
the coyote call, the howling winds wail
so i ride out to the old sundown

i am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
lord, i'm just thinking about a certain female
the nights we spent together riding on the range
looking back it seems so strange

roll me over and turn me around
let me keep spinning till i hit the ground
roll me over and let me go
riding in the rodeo

i was took in texas i did not know her name
lord, all these southern girls seem the same
down below the border in a town in mexico
i got my job busting broncs for the rodeo

roll me over and turn me around
let me keep spinning till i hit the ground
roll me over and let me go
running free with the buffalo
here i go
roll me over and i'll turn around
and i'll move my fingers up and down
up and down
it's okay, amigo
just let me go
riding in the rodeo

roll me over and turn me around
let me keep spinning till i hit the ground
roll me over and let me go
riding in the rodeo
roll me over and set me free
the cowboy's life is the life for me 

tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
somewhere in this town
see me and the boys, we don't like it
so we're getting up and going down
hiding low looking right to left
if you see us coming i think it's best
to move away do you hear what i say
from under my breath
tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
somewhere in the town
tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
so don't you be around
don't you be around
tonight there's gonna be trouble
some of us won't survive
see the boys and me mean business
busting out dead or alive
i can hear the hound dogs on my trail
all hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
like the game if you lose
go to jail
tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
somewhere in the town
tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
so don't you be around
tonight there's gonna be trouble
i'm gonna find myself in
tonight there's gonna be trouble
so woman, stay with a friend
you know it's safer

tonight there's gonna be a breakout
into the city zones
don't you dare to try and stop us
no one could for long
searchlight on my trail
tonight's the night all systems fail
hey you, good looking female

tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
somewhere in the town
tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
so don't you be around
tonight there's gonna be trouble
i'm gonna find myself in

so woman stay with a friend 

tell me the legends of long ago
when the kings and queens would dance
in the realm of the black rose
play me the melodies i want to know
so i can teach my children, oh
pray tell me the story of young cú chulainn
how his eyes were dark his expression sullen
and how he'd fight and always won
and how they cried when he was fallen
oh tell me the story of the queen of this land
and how her sons died at her own hand
and how fools obey commands
oh tell me the legends of long ago
where the mountains of mourne come down to the sea
will she no come back to me
will she no come back to me
oh shenandoah i hear you calling
far away you rolling river
roll down the mountain side
on down on down, go lassie go
oh tell me the legends of long ago
when the kings and queens would dance
in the realms of the black rose
play me the melodies so i might know
so i can tell my children, oh
my róisín dubh is my one and only true love
it was a joy that joyce brought to me
while william butler waits
and oscar, he's going wilde
ah sure, brendan where have you behan?
looking for a girl with green eyes
my dark rosaleen is my only colleen
that georgie knows best
but van is the man
starvation once again
drinking whiskey in the jar-o
synge's playboy of the western world
as shaw, sean i was born and reared there
where the mountains of mourne come down to the sea
is such a long, long way from tipperary 

down from the glen came the marching men
with their shields and their swords
to fight the fight
they believed to be right
overthrow the overlords
to the town where there was plenty
they brought plunder, swords and flame
when they left, the town was empty
and children would never play again
from their graves i heard the fallen
above the battle cry
by that bridge near the border
there were many more to die
then onward over the mountain
outward towards the sea
they come to claim the emerald
without it they could not leave 

i think i'll fall to pieces
if i don't find something else to do
this sadness never ceases
i'm still in love with you
my head it keeps on reeling
it's got me in a crazy spin
but, darling, darling, darling
is this the end?
i'm still in love with you
they say time has a way of healing
dries all the tears from your eyes
but, darling, it's this empty feeling
my heart can't disguise
after all that we've been through
i try my best but it's no use
i guess i'll keep on loving you
is this the end?
now that it's all over
woman, there's something i think you should know
baby, baby, think it over
just one time before you go
call on me, baby
if there's anything i can do for you
call on me, baby
help me see it through
call on me, baby
why don't you call on me, baby
oh help me see it through
i'm in love with you 

she's quite the mediator
a smoother operator you will never see
she'll see you later
no one dares disobey her openly
she knows music
i know music too, you see
she got the power
the teen queen, rosalie
rosalie, rosalie, rosalie, rosalie
she got the plastic
come from all the corners, corners of the world
so fantastic
she's everybody's favorite little record girl
she knows music
i know music too, you see
she got the power
i got the power, rosalie
rosalie, rosalie, rosalie, rosalie
down on me, rosalie
shine on me, will you please?
from chattanooga
to good old bogalusa
you can hear her fine
she makes the choices
then you'd best be smiling
when it's choosing time
she knows music
i know music too, you see
she's got the power
she has the tower, rosalie
rosalie, rosalie, rosalie, rosalie
rosalie 

wild one, won't you please come home?
you've been away so long
we need you home, we need you near
come back, wild one, will you?
how can we live without your love?
you know that could kill you
how can we carry on when you are gone?
my wild one
so you're a wild one
you are a wild one
over and over and over and over
so you go your way, wild one
i'll try and follow
and if you change your mind
i will be waiting here for you tomorrow
for i would beg for you
i would steal and i would borrow
i'd do anything at all, anything at all
to end this sorrow
my wild one
you are a wild one
as johnny goes to ?
johnny go to ?
there was no hope
wild one
the gypsies warned of the danger
you can laugh and joke with friends
but don't you ever talk to strangers
although their offers may be sweet
i'll bet and i would wager
away you'll stray and never come back
to those who love and made you
as johnny goes to ?
hey, you three, you where you'll stray
over and over and over
what a lonely wild one 

locked up in the classroom, waiting for the break
down to the schoolyard, knocking the gate
into the alley, meet up with the boys
waiting for the weekend to make a little noise
thunderous roar, lightning fast
kicking the girls and it's starting to blast
screaming at the heavens and the fate means stumble
it's saturday night when heavy rock was born
like thunder and lightning
god damn, it's so exciting
it hits you like a hammer
god damn
it was saturday night, i was ready for the dance
my girl walked in holding another guys hand
he stood six foot six, he looked two miles wide
i was taking it easy till he took her outside
i was madder than hell and fit to burn
this guy had played with love before but now he'd have to learn
standing in the corner giving him a thrill
you can keep your lover honey but he'll have to pay the bill
like thunder and lightning
god damn, it's so exciting
it hits you like a hammer
god damn
well, the place started rocking, it was saturday night
i was dressed to kill, i was feeling all right
all right in the middle of the night
i wasn't ready for a rumble but the mood was right
when he got up to leave, i stood in his way
i said now that you've had your fun the price you'll have to pay
in the doorway, up against the wall
when they play a heavy record then i'm going to have a ball
like thunder and lightning
god damn, it's so exciting
it hits you like a hammer
god damn
like thunder and lightning
god damn, it's so exciting
it hits you like a hammer
god damn
we started to rumble
i was tumbling in
we were rocking and rolling and rolling and tumbling
i fumbled and started to win
when the greater than wicked then i hit him again
i hit him again and i couldn't hit him any more
my head was all black and blue and my jaw was sore
screaming at the heavens and like a frightening stumble
it was saturday night when heavy rock was born 

romeo and the lonely girl
they seemed to hit it off
till romeo, he told the lonely girl
"i must take my leave, my love"
it was these few words i overheard
thought i should move in
but before i could
the lonely girl had fallen in love again

oh poor romeo
sitting out on his own-ee-o
oh poor romeo

romeo he had it rough
the guy you'd like to burn
but everything that romeo had
you can bet it was well earned
for all his good looks there were scars that he took
and a lesson to be learned
never judge lovers by good looking covers
the lover might be spurned



romeo he like to put it around
he was everybody's friend
but in the end even romeo found
on no one could he depend
for all his charms in someone else's arms
lonely girl safely lay
the train came in it had to leave again
and romeo pulled away

 

i've been a wild, wild rover
sailed all over the sea
but this thing that makes me wonder
has made a fool of me
for it took me from my childhood
underneath the stars and skies
and i hear the wind whistling through the wild wood
whispering goodbye
and it's home, boys, home
it's home, boys, home
it's home, boys, home
when you're far across the foam
and if you see my mother
tell her i'm keeping fine
will you tell her that i love her
and i'll try and write sometime
if you see my mother
give her all of my love
for she has a heart of gold there
as good as god above
and it's home, boys, home
she's home, boys, home
it's home, boys, home
when you're far across the foam
oh there's no place like home
and if you see my old one
will you tell her i'm keeping fine
will you tell her that i love her
and i'll try and write sometime
and it's home, boys, home
it's home, boys, home
it's home, boys, home
when you're far across the foam 

i put my money in the suitcase
and headed for the big race
i felt a chill on my backbone
as i hung up the telephone

stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
running down the back of my neck
to lose means trouble, to win pays double
and i got me a heavy bet

cold, cold sweat

they say chances on the outside
are looking very slim
i've been so lucky on the inside
i feel i'm going to win

stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
running down the back of my neck
take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
and i got me a heavy bet
cold, cold sweat


i've got me a whole month's wages
i haven't seen that much in ages
i might spend it in stages
and move out to las vegas

stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
running down the back of my neck
to lose means trouble, to win pays double
and i got me a heavy bet

cold, cold sweat

i put my money in the suitcase
they say chances on the outside
i got a whole months wages
stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
stone cold crazy
place another bet 

don't believe me if i tell you
not a word of this is true
don't believe me if i tell you
especially if i tell you
i'm in love with you
don't believe me if i tell you
that i wrote this song for you
there just might be
some other silly pretty girl
i'm singing to
don't believe a word
for words are so easily spoken
and your heart is just like that promise
made to be broken
don't believe a word
cause words can tell lies
and lies are no company
when there's tears in your eyes
don't believe me if i tell you
not a word of this is true
don't believe me if i tell you
especially if i tell you
that i'm in love with you
don't believe a word
no, don't believe a word
don't believe me, don't believe me
not a single word
hey, don't try

that stuff
i've got to give it up
i've got to give it up
that stuff

tell my mama and tell my pa
that their fine young son didn't get far
he made it to the end of a bottle
sitting in a sleazy bar
he tried hard but his spirit broke
he tried until he nearly choked
in the end he lost his bottle drinking alcohol

i've got to give it up
i've got to give it up
that stuff
i've got to give it up
i've got to give it up
that stuff
tell my brother i tried to write and
put pen to paper but i was frightened
i couldn't seem to get the words out right
right quite right
tell my sister i'm sinking slow
now and again i powder my nose
in the end i lost my bottle
it smashed in a casbah

i've been messing with the heavy stuff
for a time i couldn't get enough
but i'm waking up and it's wearing off
junk don't take you far
tell my mama i'm coming home
and in my youth i'm getting old
and i think it's lost control
mama i'm coming home
 

when i passed you in the doorway

he's just a boy that has lost his way
he's a rebel that has fallen down
he's a fool that done blown away
to you and me he's a renegade
he's a clown that we put down
he's a man that doesn't fit
he's a king but not in this town
to you and me he's a renegade
but he is a king when he's on his own
he's got a bike and that's his throne
and when he rides he's like the wind
to you and me he's a renegade


he's just a boy who has lost his sights
he's a stranger, prowls the night
he's a devil, that's right
to you and me he's a renegade


check it out, check his face
look at his eyes, they're so sly
i wonder why he cries from the inside
i wonder why he's a renegade
oh please, i'm on my begged bended knees
oh please, please heed my call
he's just a boy that has lost his way
he's just a boy, that's all
 

valentino's got a bookie shop
and what he takes he gives for what he's got
and what he's got he says he has not
stole from anyone
it's not that he don't tell the truth
or even that he misspent his youth
it's just that he holds the proof
but you know something's wrong
waiting for an alibi
waiting for an alibi
waiting for an alibi
waiting for an alibi
valentino's in a cold sweat
placed all his money on that last bet
against all the odds, he smokes another cigarette
says that it helps him to forget he's a nervous wreck
it's not that he misses much
or even that he's lost his lucky touch
it's just that he gambles so much
and you know that it's wrong
waiting for an alibi
waiting just to catch your eye
waiting for an alibi
tried to say i told you, i told you
waiting for an alibi
waiting just to get you
waiting for an alibi
waiting for an alibi
to say i told you
waiting for an alibi
waiting for an alibi
