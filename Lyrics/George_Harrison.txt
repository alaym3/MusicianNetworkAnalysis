isn't it a pity?
now isn't it a shame?
how we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
how we take each other's love without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity?

some things take so long, but how do i explain
when not too many people can see we're all the same
and because of all their tears
their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them
isn't it a pity?

isn't it a pity?
isn't it a shame?
how we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
how we take each other's love without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity?

forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity?
forgetting to give back
now, isn't it a pity?
what a pity
what a pity, pity, pity

sunrise doesn't last all morning
a cloudburst doesn't last all day
seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
it's not always gonna be this gray

all things must pass
all things must pass away

sunset doesn't last all evening
a mind can blow those clouds away
after all this, my love is up and must be leaving
it's not always gonna be this gray

all things must pass
all things must pass away

all things must pass
none of life's strings can last
so, i must be on my way and face another day

now the darkness only stays at nighttime
in the morning it will fade away
daylight is good at arriving at the right time
it's not always gonna be this gray

all things must pass
all things must pass away
all things must pass
all things must pass away

what i feel, i can't say
but my love is there for you anytime of day
but if it's not love that you need
then i'll try my best to make everything succeed

tell me, what is my life without your love?
and tell me, who am i without you by my side?

what i know, i can do
if i give my love now to everyone like you
but if it's not love that you need
then i'll try my best to make everything succeed

tell me, what is my life without your love?
and tell me, who am i without you by my side?
tell me, what is my life without your love?

watch out now, take care
beware of falling swingers
dropping all around you
the pain that often mingles in your fingertips
beware of darkness

watch out now, take care
beware of the thoughts that linger
winding up inside your head
the hopelessness around you
in the dead of night
beware of sadness

it can hit you
it can hurt you
make you sore and what is more
that is not what you are here for

watch out now, take care
beware of soft shoe shufflers
dancing down the sidewalks
as each unconscious sufferer
wanders aimlessly
beware of maya

watch out now, take care
beware of greedy leaders
they take you where you should not go
while weeping atlas cedars
they just want to grow, grow and grow
beware of darkness (beware of darkness)

wah-wah
you've given me a wah-wah
and i'm thinking of you
and all the things that we used to do
wah-wah, wah-wah

wah-wah
you made me such a big star
being there at the right time
cheaper than a dime
wah-wah, you've given me your wah-wah, wah-wah

oh, you don't see me crying
oh, you don't hear me sighing

wah-wah
i don't need no wah-wah
and i know how sweet life can be
if i keep myself free
wah-wah
i don't need no wah-wah

oh, you don't see me crying
hey baby, you don't hear me sighing
oh, no no-no no

wah-wah
now i don't need no wah-wah's
and i know how sweet life can be
if i keep myself free - of wah-wah
i don't need no wah-wah

wah-wah
wah-wah
wah-wah
wah-wah
wah-wah
wah-wah
wah-wah

i'm shoutin' all about love
while they treated you like a dog
when you were the one who had made it so clear
all those years ago

talkin' all about how to give
they don't act with much honesty
but you point the way to the truth when you say
all you need is love

living with good and bad
i always looked up to you
now we're left cold and sad
by someone, the devil's best friend
someone who offended all

we're living in a bad dream
they've forgotten all about mankind
and you were the one they backed up to the wall
all those years ago
you were the one who imagined it all
all those years ago

all those years ago
all those years ago

deep in the darkest night
i send out a prayer to you
now in the world of light
where the spirit free of the lies
all else that we despised

they've forgotten all about god
he's the only reason we exist
yet you were the one that they said was so weird
all those years ago
you said it all, though not many had ears
all those years ago
you had control of our smiles and our tears
all those years ago

all those years ago
all those years ago

everyone has choice
when to or not to raise their voices
it's you that decides
which way you will turn
while feeling that our love's not your concern
it's you that decides

no one around you
will carry the blame for you
no one around you
will love you today and throw it all away

tomorrow when you rise
another day for you to realise me
or send me down again
as the days stand up on end
you've got me wondering how i lost your friendship
but i see it in your eyes

though i'm beside you
i can't carry the blame for you
i may decide to
get out with your blessing
where i'll carry on guessing

how high will you leap
will you make enough for you to reap it?
only you'll arrive
at your own made end
with no one but yourself to be offended
it's you that decides

i got my mind set on you
i got my mind set on you

but it's going to take money

and by the time of my first dawn
somebody holding me they said

i welcome you to crackerbox palace
we've been expecting you
you bring such joy in crackerbox palace
no matter where you roam know our love is true

while growing up or trying to
not knowing where to start
i looked around for someone who
may help reveal my heart - someone said
while you're a part of crackerbox palace
do what the rest all do
or face the fact that crackerbox palace
may have no other choice than to deport you

i welcome you to crackerbox palace
we've been expecting you
you bring such joy in crackerbox palace
no matter where you roam know our love is true
it's twoo, it's twoo

some times are good, some times are bad
that's all a part of life
and standing in between them all
i met a mr. grief - and he said

i welcome you to crackerbox palace
was not expecting you

know that the lord is well and inside of you

and we, welcome you to crackerbox palace
we've been expecting you

no matter where you roam know our love is true

back then long time ago when grass was green
woke up in a daze
arrived like strangers in the night
(fab) long time ago when we was fab
(fab) back when income tax was all we had

caresses fleeced you in the morning light
casualties at dawn
and we did it all
(fab) long time ago when we was fab
(fab) you are my world, you are my only love

and while you're in this world
the fuzz gonna come and claim you
but you mo' better wise
when the buzz gonna come and take you away
take you away, take you away

the microscopes that magnified the tears
studied warts and all
still the life flowed on and on
(fab) long time ago when we was fab
(fab) but it's all over now baby blue

(fab) long time ago when we was fab
(fab) like this pullover you sent to me
(fab) and you really got a hold me
(fab) long time ago when we was fab

if not for you
babe, i couldn't even find the door
i couldn't even see the floor
i'd be sad and blue, if not for you

if not for you
babe, the night would see me wide awake
the day would surely have to break
it would not be new, if not for you

if not for you, my sky would fall
rain would gather, too
without your love i'd be nowhere at all
i would be lost, if not for you

if not for you
the winter would hold no spring
couldn't hear a robin sing
i just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you

if not for you, my sky would fall
rain would gather, too
without your love i'd be nowhere at all
i would be lost, if not for you

if not for you
the winter would hold no spring
couldn't hear a robin sing
i just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you

you don't need no love in
you don't need no bed pan
you don't need a horoscope or a microscope
to see the mess that you're in
if you open up your heart
you will know what i mean
we've been polluted so long
now here's a way for you to get clean

by chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see

you don't need no passport
and you don't need no visas
you don't need to designate or to emigrate
before you can see jesus
if you open up your heart
you'll see he's right there
always was and will be
he'll relieve you of your cares

by chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see

you don't need no church house
and you don't need no temple
you don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
to see that you have fallen
if you open up your heart
you will know what i mean
we've been kept down so long
someone's thinking that we're all green

and while the pope owns 51% of general motors
and the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
but the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
by chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free

though you sit in another chair, i can feel you here
looking like i don't care, but i do— i do
hiding it all behind anything i see
should someone be looking at me

while i occupy my mind, i can feel you here
love to us is so well timed
and i do— i do
wasting away these moments so heavenly
should someone be looking at me

let it down, let it down
let your hair hang all around me
let it down, let it all down
let your love flow and astound me

while you look so sweetly and divine, i can feel you here
i see your eyes are busy kissing mine
and i do— i do
wondering what it is they are expecting to see
should someone be looking at me

let it down, let it down
let your hair hang all around me
let it down, let it all down
let your love flow and astound me

let it down, let it down, ooh
let it down, let it down, ooh
let it down, let it down, ooh

why are you still crying?
your pain is now through
please, forget those teardrops
let me take them from you
the love you are blessed with
this world's waiting for
so, let out your heart please, please
from behind that locked door

it's time we start smiling
what else should we do?
with only this short time
i'm gonna be here with you
and the tales you have taught me
from the things that you saw
makes me want out your heart, please, please
from behind that locked door

and if ever my love goes
if i'm rich or i'm poor
please, let out my heart, please, please
from behind that locked door
from behind that locked door

there'll come a time when all of us must leave here
there's nothing sister mary can do
will keep me here with you
as nothing in this life that i've been trying
can equal or surpass the art of dying
do you believe me?

there'll come a time when all your hopes are fading
when things that seemed so very plain
become an awful pain
searching for the truth among the lying
and answered when you've learned the art of dying
are you still with me?

but if you want it
then you must find it
but when you have it
there'll be no need for it

there'll come a time when most of us return here
brought back by our desire to be
a perfect entity
living through a million years of crying
until you've realized the art of dying
can you believe me?
