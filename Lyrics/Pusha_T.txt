easy money
it's about to be a surgical summer
chop the tops off the coupes
the cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
the spider joint
and you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
watch the body drop

drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
even though you're multi, i see that your soul don't look alive
the m's count different when baby divides the pie, wait
let's examine why
your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
i'll start it at the home front, "i'm on one"
dennis graham stay off the 'gram, bitch, i'm on one
you mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
marriage is somethin' that sandi never had, drake
how you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
monkey-suit dennis, you parade him
a steve harvey-suit nigga made him
confused, always felt you weren't black enough
afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
since you name-dropped my fiancée
let 'em know who you chose as your beyoncé
sophie knows better as your baby mother
cleaned her up for ig, but the stench is on her
a baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
we talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
you are hiding a child, let that boy come home
deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
adonis is your son
and he deserves more than an adidas press run; that's real
love that baby, respect that girl
forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
how dare you put ye in my verses?
i'm selfish, i want all of the curses
i'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
if we all go to hell, it'll be worth it
already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
the only ones i chase are two ghosts
still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
ovo 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
how much time he got? that man is sick, sick, sick
i got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
and you don't really want it with him
surgical summer, volume 1
we gon' take this slow
we just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
yeah, daytona
album of the motherfuckin' year
and you talkin' 'bout you upset
hahahahaha
well, i wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay?
you show me that
push! 

w-w-w-what is it?

twenty-plus years of selling johnson & johnson
i started out as a baby-faced monster
no wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
my teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
gem star razor and a dinner plate
arm & hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'cause i let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
nigga, i was crack in the school zone
two beepers on me, starter jacket that was two-toned
four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
black ferris bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
what i sell for pain in the hood, i'm a doctor
zhivago, tried to fight the urge
like ivan drago, "if he dies, he dies"
like doughboy to tre, if he rides, he rides
throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
we don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
we add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
we playin' on a higher game of chess
once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
a million megapixels of the pyrex
started on the scale, digital, my only timex
nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
nigga, this is simon says, simon, red
blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead, yuugh!
"you better change what comes out your speaker"
"you better change, ch-ch-change"
"dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (what is it?)
you wanna see a dead body?
instrumentals from my momma's christmas party
trouble's on my mind
i still smell crime, my little brother crying
smokers repeatedly buying my sega genesis
either that or my auntie was stealing it
hit the pipe and start feeling it
ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
this was different, geez, louise, please help me relax
quantum physics could never show you the world i was in
when i was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
and nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
and when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
my daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
took a l, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
i said, "daddy, one day, i'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
one thousand  grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
drop some ice cubes in it, deebo on perimeter"
he said, "son, how come you think you be my connect?"
i said, "pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
he said, "well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
your son dope, nigga!
now reap what you sowed, nigga! (please reap what you sowed, nigga)
i was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
let's get it
"you better change what comes out your speaker"
"you better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"you better change what comes out your speaker"
"th-th-th-th-they must be on the dick of who?"
"th-th-th-th-they must be on the dick of who?" 

infrared, yeah, you know what i mean?

the game's fucked up
niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
the lyric pennin' equal the trumps winnin’
the bigger question is how the russians did it
it was written like nas, but it came from quentin
at the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
when the ceo's blinded by the glow it's different
believe in myself and the coles and kendricks
let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
shit, remember will smith won the first grammy?
and they ain't even recognize hov until "annie"
so i don't tap dance for the crackers and sing mammy
'cause i'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
tom brady’d you niggas, i had to scramble out
they be ridin' these waves, i pulled my sandals out
jefe latin my grammy, i went the spanish route
oh, now it’s okay to kill baby?
niggas looked at me crazy like i really killed a baby
salute ross 'cause the message was pure
he see what i see when you see wayne on tour
flash without the fire
another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
niggas get exposed, i see the cracks and i'm the liar?
shit, i’ve been exposed, i took the crack and built the wire
now who do you admire?
your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
them prices ain't real without inflation
i done flew it, i done grew it, been a conduit
moynat bags on my bitches, i done blew it

habla en español, i "y tu" it
let steven talk streamin' and shazam numbers
i'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
let's cram numbers, easily
the only rapper sold more dope than me was eazy-e
how could you ever right these wrongs
when you don't even write your songs?
but let us all play along
we all know what niggas for real been waitin' on
push
i do, so, yeah
infrared, yeah, you know what i mean?
infrared, yeah, you know what i mean?
infrared, yeah, you know what i mean?

triple back, they rush in like soviets (soviets)
at the kremlin
searchin' for the green like a gremlin, presidential emblem
presidential tint on this shit that i am driven in (woo!)

rottweilers roam the grounds, the glock hollers
the three of y'all too accessible
seen all the wrong moves, watchin' the untouchables

welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
hail mary, repeat after me

these women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
baby girl, you different
when you're not around, it feels like something's missing

might trust you with my money
might just trust you with my drugs

started out as just a fuck mission
who'd have thought i would've fucked with ya
dope boy, they got trust issues
never imagined being stuck with you
years later, we in the villa suites
top back, we on vanilla seats
reminiscing about my episodes
with them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
cold nights when you couldn't sleep
celine bags were the given treat
c-class helped you see past
all them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
whoo! i'm good money
got you talking in dollar signs
it's all good that she the top bitch
but she just wanna know the bottom line
i don't blame her, i don't change her
i just sit back and give her options
phillip lim, derek lam
every baller gotta know she's sponsored
whoo! you earned that
now where the fuck did you learn that?
we turnt up, we turnt out
we too far gone to ever turn back
these women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
baby girl, you different

trust you with my money
just might trust you with my drugs
might trust you with my money
girl, i'll trust you with my drugs
might trust you with my money
might just trust you with my drugs
might trust you with my money, girl

we everything that they talk about

them bitches lurking -- your page locked
and they still know when you shopping
they still know that i'm balling

please don't mind
i just need some time
these requirements
just gotta make sure you meet all mine
standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
look at you as something more than a ho i could smash
or being something bad i could bone at the bag
pole in my pants standing at attention
when you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
glance at the ceiling
now your glass is empty
thinking backwards, really
i done grabbed a vixen
that supposed to be a fitter after video
stacks'll really blow
dancers get exposed
missing you when you not around
we text each other when out of town
you remain the same no matter up or down
these other women stay pretending
money come and they help us spend it
but'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
i was down and out and had to go to prison
kinda high role play, acki
and again i say i like these hoes 

dis type ah shit happen everyday

drug dealer benzes with gold diggers in 'em
in elevator condos, on everything i love

this ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
this lifestyle's forever when you made
they tweet about the length i made 'em wait
what the fuck you expect
when a nigga got a cape and he's great?
oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
the love just accentuates the hate
this is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
just add water, stir it like a shake
play amongst the stars like the roof in the wraith
get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

these are the games we play, we are the names they say
this is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

to all of my young niggas, i am your ghost and your rae
this is my purple tape, save up for rainy days
and baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
they try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
stood on every couch, in the a at the black party
no jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
you laugh a little louder, the dj say your name a little prouder
and we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
we can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
my numbers lookin' like a bank code
these are the games we play, we are the names they say
this is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
the draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
with ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
caviar facials remove the toxins
this ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
who grew up on legends from outer yonkers
influenced by niggas straight outta compton, the scale never lies
i'm two-point-two incentivised
if you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
this ain't really for you, this is for the goya montoya
who said i couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
the only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
stay woke, nigga, or get out
still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
the message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

these are the games we play, we are the names they say
this is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah! 

lyrically i’m, untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

yuugh, i drops every blue moon
to separate myself from you kings of the youtube
i am more u2, i am like bono with the edge
in mexico, fuck donald and his pledge
legend has it, the wrist is magic
the left is patek, philippe's replaced by matsuhisa
ignore most requests for the feature
unless it’s getting played on the beach in ibiza
while she fucking nesha and she sucking shisha
can’t you see my total; pam, kima, keisha
i’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
and rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
still wishing on a star
the last one to find out that baby own the cars
the final trilogy of jaws
the grills like, interior gauze
it feels like, still white
matching missoni looks african on me
they tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like mano and tony
my thoughts spilling over
the soft ceiling’s open, i cross-fit the coca
yuugh! it’s a different calisthenics when i do the lennox
half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented
yeah, wearing dri-fit in my shit
it rides a little better in the cockpit
untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

mu told me to switch styles
he just came home from the feds like a mistrial
he tells me i miss out on all that club money, i don’t bounce
adidas gave me a million and that don’t bounce
the president of g.o.o.d. music has been announced
a quarter million a year and that don’t bounce
i’m in the score of these movies, i’m losing count
mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
my breakdown game bought me ‘8 mile’ fame
selling eminem to him and ‘em
white to the blacks i’m a villain in
the rolls royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
let’s talk about it gentlemen
my barcode is netflix “narcos”
part on the side of my 'fro like i’m pablo
no hablo, i sell blow
lone wolf, no tonto, head honcho
yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
i could show you the strange fruit
it’s looking like beirut
they open the wash bay, i climb it like k2
these kilos are drought killers, i flooded the jesús, i made use
of every spanish name i done ran across
no matter what the weight, i done ran it off
i’m walking on water, i took the sandals off
tell a&e to turn the cameras off, push
untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
untouchable, uncrushable
blunted in a 600, blunted in a 60 

never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
she will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
set the parameters
you either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
i won't let you ruin my dreams or harvey weinstein the kid
good mornin', matt lauer; can i live?
look at my new digs
the rooftop can host a paint-and-sip for like 40
the warhols on my wall paint a war story
had to find other ways to invest
'cause you rappers found every way to ruin pateks
it's a nightmare, yeah
i'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh!
still do the fred astaire on a brick
tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
art basel-in' the bezel
your bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal
lower level's where you settle at
i'm the pot callin' the kettle black
where there's no brake pedals at
between god and where the devil's at
had to double dutch and double back
then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
exactly what the game's been missin'
this fire burns hot as hell's kitchen
push!
now that's how the ting go, i'm back from santo domingo
that's where the kings go, down in santo domingo
now that's how the ting go, i'm back from santo domingo
this for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
'cause that's where the kings go, down in santo domingo
from honda accords to grammy awards
that's where the kings go

i can blow a million dollars into dust
lord knows how many bottles i've done bust
still runnin' through the models like i'm puff (m-m-m—)
confront my problems like i'm ralo in the bluff
pusha know these politics is paradox
chillin' in a condo full of ready rock
my homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'
i'm dyin' to find a way to get a grammy from it (maybach music)
watchin' my success, for some is bittersweet
always keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked
diamonds drippin' on me via tiffany's
all these k-9 units still sniffin' me
ignorance versus the innocence
it's not the temperature for you in timberlands
i keep the coldest flows on the hot seat (m-m-m—)
and you can spot my hoes by their car keys
another episode full of atrocities
it's double m, baby, money monopolies (maybach music)
you scared to see my face in a fancy place
so why debate my case vs. a nancy grace?
it's flesh and blood 'til i'm fresh as fuck
still hands-on, sucker, press your luck (m-m—)
your money gone every other month
my money long, so the treasure's tucked
now that's how the ting go, i'm back from santo domingo
that's where the kings go, down in santo domingo
now that's how the ting go, back from santo domingo
'cause that's where the kings go, down in santo domingo
that's where the kings go 

i sold more dope than i sold records
you niggas sold records, never sold dope
so i ain’t hearing none of that street shit
'cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
got rich selling hope to the hopeless
but i’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
i motivate to put my niggas into motors
no woman, no child, no witness, no jehovahs
like scarface but it's god's face in that mirror
we was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
scoring from the heights but i wanted mine purer
aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the führer
the judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
we ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
nah, i ain't got nothing in common with yous
pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
they tipping the scale for these crackers to win
no reading, no writing, made us savage of men
they praying for jail but i mastered the pen
descended from kings, we at it again
just hand me the crown, i'm active again
everything that it seems, hear my passion again
was never my dream, the immaculate win
i was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
wish i had a pistol before all the friends i done fought
overnight i seen a nigga go get a carrera
two weeks later i had to be that boy pallbearer
young king bury me inside a glass casket
windex wipe me down for the life after
crack dealer living like a hoop star
black marble, white walls in my new spot
four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
top down, tank top, i think i'm 2pac
so i'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
we were born to be kings, only major league teams
chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
built a school in ethiopia, should enroll in myself
god body and mind, food for the soul
when you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
if you slip and you fall i got you, my nigga, hold on
if you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
by the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
i seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
if you slipping you fall, i got you, my nigga, hold on
if you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
by the end of this song, i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on
if you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
by the end of this song, i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on
i got you, my nigga, hold on 

i wanna talk to all you addicts out there
that's got yourself a great big jones
an' you done tried all the methadone
an' you just can't leave that heroin alone
i wonder, have you tried

dope just touched down, i'm so grateful
numbers so low, bitch, be thankful
they say don't let money change you
that's how we know money ain't you
bitch, i been had, bitches been bad
we buy big boats, bitch, i'm sinbad
downright sinful, bitch, we been full
all my dopeboys, we like kinfolk
bmore burnt spoon, dc glass pipe
va sent bales, 'bout that trap life
blew through thousands, we made millions
cocaine soldiers, once civilians
bought hoes hondas, took care children
lent my pastor, build out buildin's
rapped on classics, i been brilliant
now we blend in, we chameleons, ahh

never have i been locked up in a world of misery
i need you darlin' to set me free
come back, baby, try me one more time
ooh, baby, i'm 'bout to go out of my mind
i can't—
who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'cause nobody else can fuck with me? what a show-off
nigga, wrist for wrist—let's have a glow-off
fuck it, brick for brick—let's have a blow-off
if we go by connections made
i can still climb ladders when complexions fade (yugh)
white on white, that's the testa
black on black, that's the tesla
see these diamonds in this watch face?
all that shit came from pressure
they don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
and they tired of dancin' like a ying yang twin
you can't have the yin without the yang, my friend
real niggas bring balance to the game i'm in (yugh)
can't escape the scale if i tried
interstate trafficking's alive
push

never have i been locked up in a world of misery
i need you darlin' to set me free
come back, baby, try me one more time
ooh, baby, i'm 'bout to go out of my mind
i can't—
still fresh off the boat, niggas
don't make me super-soak niggas
your life ends up a quote, nigga
the good die young, all dogs go to heaven
it's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend
i play musical chairs with these squares
rich flair before they was ric flair's
cocaine concierge, longest runnin' trapper of the year
stood the test of time like dapper dan
season my sauce like zatarain's
is he still in the caravan? (no)
it's a mil' in the caravan? (whoa)
richard mille on a leather band (ooh)
behind the wheel like an ambulance (go)
on my way up to maryland (gone)

never have i been locked up in a world of misery
i need you darlin' to set me free
come back, baby, try me one more time
ooh, baby, i'm 'bout to go out of my mind
i can't—
come back, baby, try me one more time
ooh, baby, i'm 'bout to go out of my mind
i—i can't— 

yeah, yeah, yeah
i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
money goin' in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing
getting money, baby girl, gold chains

i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
standing in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i ain't never did a thing
getting money, rocking chains
we'll never feel the same
we the thugs in the game
i don't never feel pain

eighteen-wheeler gorillas
black with gold chains, pitch bird like steelers
hines ward of the crime lords
running through this money, screaming, "encore!"
spending nights with a prime whore
but that's the bitch that you're blind for
celebrating on a whim, nigga
pain is pac, above the rim, nigga
my bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
'cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
she wasn't fucking none of them niggas
so now we're even like a hem, nigga
put your freedom over failure
tryna find my griselda (la madrina!)
might as well, they gon' nail ya
momma screaming like mahalia
pain is love and it's war
pain is running out of raw
pain is finding out you're poor
as the feds knock at your door
i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
been around here, standing in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing
getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
i'm just standing in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing
getting money, rocking all these gold chains
million dollars on one gold ring

pain is joy when it cries
it's my smile in disguise
it's what makes the story chilling
spare the women and the children
hear the scribbles of the villain
yuugh! this is drug dealer brilliance


pyrex on the platter like hot sex
but my tribe don't quest like love
pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
and a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
it's no risk without gain
it's no trust without shame
it's no us without 'caine
push: my name is my name
in the kitchen with a cape on, apron
trey-eight on, coulda been trayvon
but instead, i chose avon
powder-face like a geisha
arm & hammer for the breakup
turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)
it's a match made in heaven
all that's missing is the reverend
all that's missing is a blessing
i hope god gets the message
i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
been around here, standing in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing
getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
i don't never feel pain
'cause i done felt too much pain
i'm just standing in the rain
blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing
getting money, rocking all these gold chains
million dollars on one gold ring 

i see the strangest things
the evil that money brings
i swear it’s like a disease
that goes round and round and round like sirens
and they wanna bury me
why? cause i’m anti everything
i swear it’s like a disease
that goes round and round and round like sirens

poor minds, poor decision makers
no reward, then what’s the risk you taking?

the dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
we can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
we sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
for real, we made you watch from afar
even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
until we seen them foreign cars pull up
and watch them pick you up
and then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
so, make us proud, make it count
until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
take advantage of it when you’re worth it
real bitches worth it
money, pussy, alcohol

i’m in the club, you in the club too
i got money, you got money too

whispering in my ear like a hunny do
eyeballing every bottle that we running through
trying to stand near, nigga damn near
pushing bitches out the way to instagram here
