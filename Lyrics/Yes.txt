i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i spent the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound of
in and out the valley

the music dance and sing
they make the children really ring
i spent the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound of
in and out the valley

in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see
i'll be there with you

i will remember you
your silhouette will charge the view
of distant atmosphere
call it morning driving through the sound of
even in the valley

in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see
i'll be there with you

along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
down on the land
catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
the rim of the land
the eagle's dancing wings create as weather
spins out of hand
go closer hold the land feel partly no more
than grains of sand
we stand to lose all time a thousand answers
by in our hand
next to your deeper fears we stand
surrounded by a million years
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out

in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky, they stand there
twenty four before my love and i'll be there


i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
you spent the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound of
in and out the valley

in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see
i'll be there with you

a seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
and rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
and achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
then taste the fruit of man, recorded losing all against the hour
and assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
a dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
and take away the plane in which we move and choose the course you're running

down at the edge, round by the corner
not right away, not right away
close to the edge, down by a river
not right away, not right away

crossed the line around the changes of the summer
reaching out to call the colour of the sky
passed around a moment clothed in mornings, faster than we see
getting over all the time i had to worry
leaving all the changes far from far behind
we relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

down at the end, round by the corner
close to the edge, just by the river
seasons will pass you by
i get up, i get down

now that it's all over and done
now that you find, now that you're whole


my eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
it changed as almost strained amidst clear mana from above
i crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
there's you, the time, the logic or the reasons we don't understand
sad courage claimed the victims, standing still for all to see
as armoured movers took, approached to overlook the sea
there since the cord, the license or the reasons we understood will be

down at the end, close by a river
close to the edge, round by the corner
close to the end, down by the corner
down at the edge, round by a river

sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
all in all, the journey takes you all the way
as apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
guessing problems only to deceive the mention
passing paths that climb halfway into the void
as we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

down at the edge, round by the corner
close to the end, down by a river
seasons will pass you by
i get up, i get down



in her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
saying that she'd take the blame for the crucifixion of her own domain

i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down

two million people barely satisfy
two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
the eyes of honesty can achieve
(she would gladly say it amazement of her story)
how many millions do we deceive each day?
(asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down

in charge of who is there in charge of me
(she could clearly see the lady sadly looking)
do i look on blindly and say i see the way?
(saying that she'd take the blame for the crucifixion of her own domain)
the truth is written all along the page
(she would gladly say it amazement of her story)
how old will i be before i come of age for you?
(asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down


i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down




the time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
a constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems
and space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
as song and chance develop time, lost social temperance rules above
ah, ah
then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
he turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
i shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place

on the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
called to witness cycles only of the past
and we reach all this with movements
in between the said remark

close to the edge, down by a river
down at the end, round by the corner
seasons will pass you by
now that it's all over and done
called to the seed, right to the sun
now that you find, now that you're whole
seasons will pass you by
i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down
i get up, i get down

a man conceived a moment's answers to the dream
staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes

as a foundation left to create the spiral aim
a movement regained and regarded both the same
all complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed
between the picture of time behind the face of need

coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
emotion revealed as the ocean maid
all complete in the sight of seeds of life with you, oh

coins and crosses never know their fruitless worth
cords are broken, locked inside the mother earth
they won't hide, oh, they won't tell you
watching the world, watching all of the world
watching us go by

and you and i climb over the sea to the valley
and you and i reached out for reasons to call



coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
emotion revealed as the ocean maid
as a movement regained and regarded both the same
all complete in the sight of seeds of life with you



sad preacher nailed upon the colored door of time
insane teacher be there, reminded of the rhyme
there'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
political ends, as sad remains, will die
reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
ooh, ooh

i listened hard but could not see
life tempo change out and inside me
the preacher trained in all to lose his name;
the teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
in the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
that the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
all complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
as a moment regained and regarded both the same
emotion revealed as the ocean maid
a clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you


and you and i climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
and you and i reach, over the sun for the river
and you and i climb, clearer, towards the movement
and you and i called over valleys of endless seas

i've seen all good people turn their heads each day
so satisfied i'm on my way
i've seen all good people turn their heads each day

love comes to you and you follow
lose one onto the heart of the sunrise
sharp distance
how can the wind with its arms all around me
lost on a wave and then after
dream on onto the heart of the sunrise

sharp distance
how can the wind with so many around me
lost in the city

lost in their eyes as you hurry by
counting the broken ties they decide

love comes to you and then after
dream on onto the heart of the sunrise
lost on a wave that you're dreaming

sharp distance

i feel lost in the city

lost in their eyes as you hurry by

straight light moving and removing
sharpness of the colour sun shine
straight light searching all the meanings of the song
long last treatment of the telling
that relates to all the words sung
dreamer easy in the chair that really fits you

dream on onto the heart of the sunrise
sharp distance
how can the wind with its arms all around me

i. life seeker

sister bluebird flying high above
shine your wings forward to the sun
hide the myst'ries of life on your way
though you've seen them, please don't say a word
what you don't know, i have never heard

starship trooper, go sailing on by
catch my soul, catch the very light
hide the moment from my eager eye
though you've seen there, please don't tell a soul
what you can't see, can't be very whole

speak to me of summer
long winters longer than time can remember
the setting up of other roads
to travel on in old accustomed ways
i still remember the talks by the water
the proud sons and daughter
that knew the knowledge of the land
spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

mother life, hold firmly on to me
catch my knowledge higher than the day
lose as much as only you can show
though you've seen me, please don't say a word
what i don't know, i have never shared
ii. disillusion

loneliness is a power that we
possess to give or take away forever
all i know can be shown by your
acceptance of the facts there shown before you
take what i say in a different way
and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
as i see a new day in me
i can also show it you and you may follow

speak to me of summer
long winters longer than time can remember
the setting up of other roads
to travel on in old accustomed ways
i still remember the talks by the water
the proud sons and daughter
that knew the knowledge of the land
spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
iii. würm

yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human race
on a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
if the summer changed to winter, yours is no disgrace

battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
lost in summer, born in winter, travel very far
lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are

yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race
on a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
if the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
yours is no disgrace
yours is no disgrace

death defying, mutilated armies gather near
crawling out of dirty holes, their morals, their morals disappear

yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human, silly human race
on a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
if the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
yours is no disgrace
yours is no disgrace

battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
lost in summer, born in winter, travel very far
lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are

dawn of a light lying between
the silence and sold sources
chased amid fusions of wonder
in moments hardly seen forgotten
coloured in pastures of chance
dancing leaves cast spells of challenge
amused but real in thought
we fled from the sea whole
dawn of thought transferred through moments
of days undersearching earth
revealing corridors of time provoking memories
disjointed but with purpose
craving penetrations offer links
with the self instructor's sharp
and tender love
as we took to the air
a picture of distance
dawn of our power we amuse
redescending as fast as misused
expression, as only to teach love as
to reveal passion chasing
late into corners, and we danced from the ocean
dawn of love sent within us
colours of awakening among the many
won't to follow, only tunes of a different age
as the links span our endless caresses
for the freedom of life everlasting
talk to the sunlight caller
soft summer mover distance mine
called out a tune but i never saw the face
heard but not replaced
i ventured to talk, but i never lost my place
cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
lost in lights array, i ventured to see
as the sound began to play

what happened to this song we once knew so well?
signed promise for moments caught within the spell
i must have waited all my life for this moment, moment
the future poised with the splendour just begun
the light we were as one
and crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun
and for a moment when our world had filled the skies
magic turned our eyes
to feast on the treasure set for our strange device

what happened to wonders we once knew so well?
did we forget what happened surely we can tell
we must have waited all our lives for this, moment, moment
moment
starlight, movement, reasons
release forward
tallest rainbow
sun shower seasons
life flower reasons
they move fast, they tell me
but i just can't believe that i can feel it
there's someone to tell you
amid the challenge we look around in unison with you
getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest
thoughts would send our fusion
clearly to be home
getting over wars we do not mean or so it seems so clearly
sheltered with our passion
clearly to be home
they move fast, they tell me
but i just can't believe they really mean to
there's someone to tell you
and i just can't believe our song will leave you
skyline teacher, warland seeker
send out poison, cast iron leader
and through the rhythm of moving slowly
sent through the rhythm work out the story
move over glory to sons of old fighters past
young christians see it from the beginning
old people feel it, that's what they're saying
move over glory to sons of old fighters past
they move fast, they tell me
but i just can't believe they really mean to
there's someone, to tell you
a course towards a universal season
getting over overhanging trees
let them rape the forest
they might stand and leave them
clearly to be home
getting over wars we do not mean
we charm the movement suffers
call out all our memories
clearly to be home
we've moved fast
we need love
a part we offer is our only freedom

what happened to this song we once knew so well?
signed promise for moments caught within the spell
we must have waited all our lives for this moment, moment
past present movers, moments we'll posses the future
but only through him we know, send flowered rainbows
a piece apart chased flowers of the dark and light
of songs to follow and show all we feel for
and know of cast round
you seekers of the truth
accepting that reasons will relive
and breathe and hope
and chase and love
for you and you and you

long distance runaround
long time waiting to feel the sound
i still remember the dream there
i still remember the time you said goodbye
did we really tell lies?
letting in the sunshine
did we really count to one hundred?
cold summer listening
hot colour melting the anger to stone
i still remember the dream there
i still remember the time you said goodbye
did we really tell lies?
letting in the sunshine
did we really count to one hundred?
long distance runaround
long time waiting to feel the sound
i still remember the dream there
i still remember the time you said goodbye
cold summer listening
hot colour melting the anger to stone
i still remember the dream there
i still remember the time you said goodbye
did we really tell lies?
letting in the sunshine
did we really count to one hundred?
looking for the sunshine

stand and fight, we do consider
reminded of an inner pact between us, that's seen as we go
and ride there, in motion
to fields in debts of honour, defending
stand the marchers soaring talons
peaceful lives will not deliver freedom, fighting we know
destroy oppression, the point to reaction
as leaders look to you, attacking
choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor
kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow
casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force
to alter via the war that's seen, as friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem
wars that shout in screams of anguish
power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver, surely we know
in glory we rise to offer
create our freedom, a word we utter
a word
words cause our banner, victorious our day
will silence be promised as violence displays
the curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day
our gods awake in thunderous roars and guide the leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause
listen, should we fight forever
knowing as we do know, fear destroys
listen, should we leave our children
listen, our lives stare in silence
help us now
listen, your friends have been broken
they tell us of your poison, now we know
kill them, give them as they give us
slay them, burn their children's laughter
on to hell
the fist will run, grasp metal to gun
the spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum
our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn
the pen won't stay the demon's wings
the hour approaches, pounding out the devil's sermon
soon, oh soon the light
pass within and soothe this endless night
and wait here for you
our reason to be here
soon, oh soon the time
all we move to gain will reach and calm
our heart is open
our reason to be here
long ago, set into rhyme
soon, oh soon the light
ours to shape for all time, ours the right
the sun will lead us
our reason to be here
soon, oh soon the light
ours to shape for all time, ours the right
the sun will lead us
our reason to be here

a river, a mountain to be crossed
the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
around the south side
so cold that we cried

were we ever colder on that day, a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

move forward was my friend's only cry
in deeper to somewhere we could lie
and rest for the day
with cold in the way

were we ever colder on that day, a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

the moments seemed lost in all the noise
a snow storm, the stimulating voice
of warmth of the sky
of warmth when you die

were we ever warmer on that day, a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity


the moments seemed lost in all the noise
a snow storm, the stimulating voice
of warmth of the sky
of warmth when you die

were we ever warmer on that day, a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
the river can disregard the cost
and melt in the sky
the warmth when you die

were we ever warmer on that day, a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

i'm moving through some changes
i'll never be the same
something you did touched me
there's no one else to blame
the love we had has fallen
the love we used to share
we've given up pretending
as if you didn't care

change, changing places
root yourself to the ground
capitalize on this good fortune
one word can bring you round
changes

i look into the mirror
i see no happiness
all the warmth that i gave you
has turned to emptiness
the love we had has fallen
the love we used to share
you've left me here believing
in love that wasn't there

change, changing places
root yourself to the ground
word to the wise
well, you get what's coming
one word can bring you round
changes

but when i look into your eyes
and try to find out how
there's no way to save it now
and everything i feel

changes
keep looking for
changes
changes


for some reason you're questioning why
i always believe it gets better
one difference between you and i
your heart is inside your head

one word from you, one word from me
a clear design on your liberty
who could believe when love has gone
how we move on like everyone
only such fools
only such jealous hearts
only through love changes come

change, changing places
root yourself to the ground
capitalize on this good fortune
one word can bring you round
changes

(one road to loneliness)
it's always the same
(one road to happiness)
it's calling your name
change, changing places, changes
root yourself to the ground
capitalize on this good fortune
one word can bring you round
changes
change, changing places (changes)
root yourself to the ground
word to the wise
well, you get what's coming
one word, one word can bring you round
changes

you wanna get close to me, the feeling so clear
but i need some time to see, vision through my tears
you wanna get next to me, i need your intrusion
i don't need to be blinded by confusion

here is my heart, waiting for you
here is my soul; i eat at chez nous

love will find a way, if you want it to
love will find a way, love will find a way for me and you

love will find a way...
love will find a way...
love will find a way...
love will find... (a way)

so you want to get over me, and that's how you feel
everything you want to be seems so unreal
i want to be all of you, and that's the confusion
it's so hard for me to draw a conclusion

here is my heart, waiting for you
here is my soul; i eat at chez nous

love will find a way, if you want it to
love will find a way, love will find a way


love will find a way, if you want it to
love will find a way, love will find a way

(will love find a way?)
i believe that there's a way (if you want it to)
(will love find a way?) love will find a way
(will love find a way?) love will find a way...

high vibration go on
to the sun
oh, let my heart dreaming
past a mortal as me
where can i be?
wish the sun to stand still
reaching out to touch our all being
past all mortal as we
here we can be
here we can be
suns | high | streams | through
awaken gentle mass touch
(gentle mass touch)
awaken gentle mass touch
(gentle mass touch)
strong | dreams | reign | here
awaken gentle mass touch
(gentle mass touch)
awaken gentle mass touching
(gentle mass touch)
awaken gentle mass touch
(star | song)
star | song | age | less
awaken gentle mass touching
(gentle mass touch)
awaken gentle mass touching
(gentle mass touch)
awaken gentle mass touching
touching...
touching...
touching...
workings of man
set to ply out historical life
reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
all awakening
all restoring you
workings of man
crying out from the fire set aflame
by his blindness to see
that the warmth of his being
is promised for his seeing
his reaching so clearly
workings of man
driven far from the path
rereleased in inhibitions
so that all is left for you
all is left for you
all is left for you
all is left for you now...
master of images
songs cast a light on you
hark thru dark ties
that tunnel us out of sane existence
in challenge as direct
as eyes see young stars assemble
master of light
all pure chance
as exists cross divided
in all encircling mode
oh closely guided plan
awaken in our heart
master of soul
set to touch
all impenetrable youth
ask away
that thought be contact
with all that's clear
be honest with yourself
there's no doubt
no doubt
master of time
setting sail
over all of our lands
and as we look
forever closer
shall we now bid
farewell, farewell...
high vibration go on
to the sun, oh let my heart dreaming
past a mortal as me
where can i be
wish the sun to stand still
reaching out to touch our own being
past all mortal as we
here we can be
like the time i ran away
turned around and you were standing close to me
like the time i ran away
turned around and you were standing close to me

i can feel no sense of measure
no illusions as we take
refuge in young man's pleasure
breaking down the dreams we make
real

one down one to go
another town and one more show
downtown they're giving away
but she never came back

no phone can take your place
you know what i mean
we have the same intrigue
as a court of kings

ah... leave it
ah... leave it

two down there you go
macarthur park in the driving snow
uptown they're digging it out
better lay your claim

get home you're not alone
you just broke out of the danger zone
be there to show your face
on another dreamy day

ah... leave it
ah... leave it
(do do do...)

(ah...) goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
(...leave it) hello hello heaven
(ah...) goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
(...leave it) hello hello heaven

i can feel no sense of measure
no illusions as we take
refuge in young man's pleasure
breaking down the dreams we make
real

ah... leave it
ah... leave it

(ah...) goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
(...leave it) hello hello heaven
(ah...) goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
(...leave it) hello hello heaven

(ah...)
one down one to go
another town and one more show
(...leave it)
(ah...)
one down one to go
another town and one more show
leave it!

i see the cold mist in the night
and watch the hills roll out of sight
i watch in every single way
inside out, outside in
every day
the sun can warm the coldest dawn
and move the movement on the lawn
i learn in every single day
inside out, outside in
every way
and there you are
making it up that you're sure that it is a star
when all you see
is an illusion shining down in front of me
and then you say
even in time we shall control the day
when what you see
deep inside the day's controlling you and me
and one peculiar point i see
as one with many ones of me
as truth is gathered, i rearrange
inside out, outside in
inside out, outside in
perpetual change
and there you are
saying we have the moon, so now the stars
when all you see
is near disaster gazing down on you and me
and there you're standing
saying we have the whole world in our hands
when all you see
deep inside the world's controlling you and me
who'll see perpetual change
you'll see perpetual change
and there you are
making it up that you're sure that it is a star
when all you see
is an illusion shining down in front of me
and then you say
even in time we shall control the day
when all you see
deep inside the day's controlling you and me
as mist and sun are both the same
we look on as pawns of their game
they move to testify the day
inside out, outside in
inside out, outside in
all of the way

get the idea
cross around the track
underneath the flank
of a thoroughbred racing chaser
get the feel
as the rhythm flows
would you like to go
and shoot the mountain masses?
and here you stand no taller than the grass seas
and should you really chase so hard
the truth of sport plays rings around you
going for the one
going for the one
get in the way
of the tons of water
racing wind
passing through the rudders
once at the start
can you gamble that
you really surely
really mean to finish
after seeing all your sense of fear diminish
as you treat danger as pure connection
as you throw away misconceptions
going for the one
going for the one
going for-ward to
listen in time
taken so high
to touch, to move
listen to life
touching, touch time
travel, twilight
taken so high
roundabout, sounding out
love me so
now the verses i've sang
don't add much weight
to the story in my head
so i'm thinking i should go and write a punchline
but they're so hard to find
in my cosmic mind
so i think i'll take
a look out of the window
when i think about you
i don't feel low
should i really chase so hard?
the truth of sport plays rings around you
going for the one
going for the one
going for-ward to
listen in time
taken so high
to touch, to move
listen to life
touching, touch time
travel, twilight
taken so high
taking your time
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking, rolling
listen in time
taken so high
to touch, to move
listen to life
touching, touch time
travel, twilight
taken so high
taking your time
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking, rolling
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking, rolling
moments decide...
moments delight...
moments invite...
talk about sending love...
love...
love...
love...
love
