everybody knows that the dice are loaded
everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
everybody knows the war is over
everybody knows the good guys lost
everybody knows the fight was fixed
the poor stay poor, the rich get rich
that's how it goes
everybody knows

everybody knows that the boat is leaking
everybody knows that the captain lied
everybody got this broken feeling
like their father or their dog just died
everybody talking to their pockets
everybody wants a box of chocolates
and a long-stem rose
everybody knows

everybody knows that you love me baby
everybody knows that you really do
everybody knows that you've been faithful
oh, give or take a night or two
everybody knows you've been discreet
but there were so many people you just had to meet
without your clothes
everybody knows
everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows
everybody knows, everybody knows
that's how it goes
everybody knows

and everybody knows that it's now or never
everybody knows that it's me or you
and everybody knows that you live forever
when you've done a line or two
everybody knows the deal is rotten
old black joe's still picking cotton
for your ribbons and bows
and everybody knows

and everybody knows that the plague is coming
everybody knows that it's moving fast
everybody knows that the naked man and woman
are just a shining artifact of the past
everybody knows the scene is dead
but there's gonna be a meter on your bed
that will disclose
what everybody knows
and everybody knows that you're in trouble
everybody knows what you've been through
from the bloody cross on top of calvary
to the beach of malibu
everybody knows it's coming apart
take one last look at this sacred heart
before it blows
everybody knows 

just like in the movies
it starts to rain and we
we're the broken beauties
blindfolded minds collide and we fall

when the curtain drops
our touch is just a touch
not like in the movies
our story's after the end

like strangers, perfect pretenders
we're falling head over heels
for something that ain't real
it could never be us, eh
just you and i
strangers, perfect pretenders
we're falling head over heels
for something that ain't real
it could never be us, eh
just you and i

memories in photos
too easy to rewrite
left as lonely shadows
holding each other tight and we fall
when the curtain drops
our touch is just a touch
not like in the movies
our story's after the end

like strangers, perfect pretenders
we're falling head over heels
for something that ain't real
it could never be us, eh
just you and i

think we got it, but we made up a dream
'cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woo
i don't want you, all you want is someone
going home together to forget we're alone
think we got it, but we made up a dream
'cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woo
i don't want you, all you want is someone
going home together to forget we're alone

you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i
not like in the movies
you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i, you and i
not like in the movies
like strangers, perfect pretenders
we're falling head over heels
for something that ain't real
it could never be us, eh
just you and i

('cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woo)
perfect pretenders
(i don't want you, all you want is someone
going home together to forget we're alone)

('cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woo)
it could never be us, eh
(i don't want you, all you want is someone)
just you and i 

think you're so important to me
think you're so important to me, don't you?

you shut me down, you like the control
you speak to me like i'm a child
try to hold it down, i know the answer
i can't shake it off and you feel threatened by me

i tried to play it nice, but oh
oh, ooh-ooh, don't kill my vibe
oh, ooh-ooh, don't break my stride (oh)
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
but i wanted you to know that you don't belong here
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
don't kill my vibe
(don't you)

you love to tear me down, you pick me apart
then build me up like i depend on you
but i throw myself from heights that used to scare me
guess you're surprised, i'm the puzzle you can't figure out
i tried to play it nice, but oh
oh, ooh-ooh, don't kill my vibe
oh, ooh-ooh, don't break my stride
(i tried to play it nice, but oh)
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
but i wanted you to know that you don't belong here
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
don't kill my vibe

say i'm young, i don't care, i won't quit, no, no, no, ho
say i'm young, i don't care, i won't quit, no, no, no, ho
and oh, whoa
you're acting like you hurt me, but i'm not even listenin'
hey, no
you're acting like you hurt me, but i'm not even listenin'
don't kill, don't kill my vibe
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
but i wanted you to know that you don't belong here
think you're so important to me, don't you? (don't you?)

i tried to play it nice, but oh

you think you're so important to me, don't you?
but i wanted you to know that you don't belong here
you think you're so important to me, don't you?
don't kill my vibe 

nobody dares to speak against your word
so they just sit quiet
do what you want, who cares if you get hurt?
no, i don't know why you wonder why
wonder why, wonder why
you're surrounded by the type of people
that never say what you don't wanna hear
so they just stay quiet

oh, everybody loves a show
lights on, they all go home
you won't let anybody close
that high five is all you got
ooh, they keep saying you're the best
you ask and they say, "yeah!"
ooh, when you add up what is left
that high five is all you got

you say it's hard, feel sorry for yourself
and i don't know why you
you take it out on everybody else
no, i don't know why you wonder why
wonder why, wonder why
you're alone at night, when they're all up on ya
you know i tried, but you won't call me back
so i just stay quiet
ooh, everybody loves a show
lights on, they all go home
you won't let anybody close
that high five is all you got
ooh, they keep saying you're the best
you ask and they say, "yeah!"
ooh, when you add up what is left
that high five is all you got

a-a-alright, don't you get tired of looking for high fives? (hey!)
a-a-alright, don't you get tired of looking for high fives?
a-a-alright, don't you get tired of, don't you get tired of

and you wonder why, wonder why
no one's by your side, by your side
when the room goes quiet

ooh, everybody loves a show
lights on, they all go home
you won't let anybody close
that high five is all you got
ooh, they keep saying you're the best
you ask and they say, "yeah"
ooh, when you add up what is left
that high five is all you got 

don't know where i am with you
forgetting time and space with you

oh, i wish we had a common view
you see my red as blue
i don't belong in your universe
for better or for worse

i'm the same, but i'm bolder
you'll get home, but i'm on my way out now
not the same destinations
i will stay when you get off the train
you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite
oh, you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite

your hand is warm, but my heart is blue, is blue now
i miss you, but i've got things to do

oh, i wish we had a common view
you see my red as blue
i don't belong in your universe
for better or for worse
i'm the same, but i'm bolder
you'll get home, but i'm on my way out now
not the same destinations
i will stay when you get off the train
you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite
oh, you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite
know that i am dynamite
know, know that i am dynamite
know that i am dynamite

oh, it's so cold here
'cause i left my heart to be with you
oh, it's so cold here
'cause i left my heart to be with you

i'm the same, but i'm bolder
you'll get home, but i'm on my way out now
not the same destinations
know i will stay when you get off the train
you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite
oh, you're as safe as a mountain
but know that i am dynamite 

meet me in the hallway
for a cup of coffee by the stairs
we're both in a hurry
let's steal a minute when there's no one there
both our hoodies red, you're in my head
yeah, there's no pressure
at least that's what we always said
i was keeping it together
i guess i didn't understand
that i fell for you, i lost my cool

it hit me like a sucker punch
just one look and i'm out of touch
i'm freaking out 'cause i'm scared this might end bad
but i still come back for that
sucker punch
just one look and i'm out of touch
i'm freaking out 'cause i'm scared this might end bad
but i still come back for that
sucker punch

i try to come up with the bad things
didn't wanna write a happy song

and if i act too tough, know that i care 'bout you
i'm honest, no offense

let the flame die out and rip the bandaid off
so slow that you can feel it bu-uh-urning, bu-uh-urning
don't want that sad goodbye, let's keep it low key
'cause every love story's a gho-ost story, gho-ost story

it's better to walk away than to run with fake friends
no use for excuses so bad things come to an end
i'm not spurned and forgotten 'cause i only go for gold
don't need no fake friends
might as well shut down
might as well shut down, duh-duh-duh-duh-down
might as well shut down

i know i should be ordering takeout
sitting on my couch, that's what you do
i know i should be all in my feelings
staring at the ceiling, but here's the truth

wallowing in it would be such a waste
that isn't gonna fix it anyway, no whoa

ooh, yeah
i dry my eyes 'cause i don't feel like crying
ooh, yeah
at least tonight, no, i don't feel like crying

hope you don't blame me for what i'm saying
my heart is aching, do you feel it too?
i hope you understand that i'm dealing
it's my way of healing, but here's the truth

wallowing in it would be such a waste
that isn't gonna fix it anyway, no whoa
ooh, yeah
i dry my eyes 'cause i don't feel like crying
ooh, yeah
at least tonight, no, i don't feel like crying

it hasn't hit me yet (ooh)
and i know if i go home i'm gonna get upset, yeah
it hasn't hit me yet
and i know if i go home i'm gonna get upset
it hasn't hit me yet (ooh)
and i know if i go home i'm gonna get upset
at least tonight, no, i don't feel like crying

wallowing in it would be such a waste
that isn't gonna fix it anyway, no, whoa

ooh, yeah
i dry my eyes 'cause i don't feel like crying
ooh, yeah
at least tonight, no, i don't feel like crying

it hasn't hit me yet (ooh)

it hasn't hit me yet
and i know if i go home i'm gonna get upset
it hasn't hit me yet (ooh)
and i know if i go home i'm gonna get upset
at least tonight, no, i don't feel like crying 

couldn't wait 'til i got outside
wondering what the world be like
i knew i had to change my mind
didn't realize it would happen all so soon, all so soon

but i see the world so different now
but there's a place by the sea and that's my town

when i don't know what to say
when i don't know what to do
there's a room i need to sit in
surrounded by my favourite view
when i need a hand to hold
someone to tell the truth
would it be okay if i came home to you?

mmm
independence comes with a price
when questioning your own advice
but i know i'll be alright
with an open door, no matter what i do, what i do
mmm, but i see the world so different now
but there's a place by the sea and that's my town

when i don't know what to say
when i don't know what to do
there's a room i need to sit in
surrounded by my favourite view
when i need a hand to hold
someone to tell the truth
would it be okay if i came home to you?

no, i don't wanna keep on calling
when i'm miles away
and you're too far away
oh, but if i need you to remind me
that nothing has changed
would it be okay, would it be okay for you?

and i see the world so different now
'cause there's a place by the sea and that's my town

when i don't know what to say
when i don't know what to do
there's a room i need to sit in
surrounded by my favourite view
when i need a hand to hold
someone to tell the truth
would it be okay if i came home to you?
no, would it be okay if i came home to you? 

i know you have your good side, oh, i know you have
even at your worst, you, you're not so bad

but when you had the choice, you chose someone else
when you had the choice, you chose someone else
someone else

i don't wanna meet ya, i don't wanna talk
'cause i don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all
you don't need a reason, this is not your fault
i don't wanna know, i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know

my everyday reminder, walking by your house
that i'm the outsider in your crowd

'cause when you had the choice, you chose someone else
when you had the choice, you chose someone else
someone else

i don't wanna meet ya, i don't wanna talk
'cause i don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all
you don't need a reason, this is not your fault
i don't wanna know, i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know
and i tell my mom i feel like the odd one out
then she says that no one really likes junior high
and i believe her, yeah, i believe her
and if i run into you in the same old bar
i'll say, "it's totally cool, i'm not hurt at all"
"it's good to see ya, so good to see ya"

but i don't wanna meet ya, i don't wanna talk
'cause i don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all
you don't need a reason, this is not your fault
i don't wanna know, no, i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know

i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know 

don't look at me that way, you should know i can't take it
'cause you're making my face blush, bringing back the uselessness in me
people are telling me that i need to go through with this
but i'm too scared to admit, too scared to open up for you

i don't know-oh-oh what i want
i don't know-oh-oh what i need
oh-oh, i'm tired of always looking back to you
oh-oh, i need to move on but you're making it hard
(but you're making it hard)

don't let me crawl to you, 'cause i'm not that kind of girl
i will not degrade myself even if it means that we are not a we

i don't know-oh-oh what i want
i don't know-oh-oh what i need, what i need

so this is how it feels to be devastated
but you're feeling satisfied of knowing that someone wants you
when will this end? i can't focus
i don't have time for all of this; it's a waste of my time
oh-oh, i'm tired of always looking back to you
oh-oh, i need to move on but you're making it hard
oh-oh, i'm tired of always looking back to you
oh-oh, i need to move on but you're making it hard
but you're making it hard
(oh-oh, i'm tired of always looking back to you)
but you're making it hard
(oh-oh, i need to move on)
but you're making it hard
(oh-oh, i'm tired of always looking back to you)
but you're making it hard
(oh-oh, i need to move on)
but you're making it hard 

it's a lonely feelin', wavin' you goodbye
i don't know what i'm leavin' until the moment is gone

checkin' in, never checkin' out
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again

sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm getting up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me

the airline lost my luggage, still got all this weight
and all the things i'm done with are showin' up again

breakin' in but i won't break down
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again
sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm gettin' up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me

and i'll be damned if i ever forget
just how lucky i am to be
close to you when i need it the most
can you hold me if i wanna leave?

breakin' in but i won't break down
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again

sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm getting up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
sometimes it's like nothing is going my way
even though i know i'm getting up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me 

something about the way you and i fit
that's when it hits
feels like it’s too good to be true
we're down at the harbour and we dance in the dark
don't know what you said, but i know how i felt
it’s hard to believe our love could last
'cause you're moving so fast
then i start overthinking

then i ruin the moment 'cause i picture the end
but i don't wanna go there, so i tell myself that

hey, it's alright if we don't end up together
'cause you’re mine right now
hey, i don’t mind if we don't get to forever
’cause you're mine right now

forgot all the things that we said we would do
how we're still in this room
hear the rain on the glass hold me 'til i
fall asleep for the night, try to enjoy the quiet
but i ruin the moment ’cause i picture the end
and i don't wanna go there, so i tell myself that

hey, it's alright if we don't end up together
'cause you're mine right now
hey, i don't mind if we don't get to forever
'cause you're mine right now

it's alright if we don't end up staying together
it's alright if we don't, it's alright
'cause you're mine right now
it's alright if we don't end up staying together
it's alright if we don't, it's alright
'cause you're mine right now

i won't fall apart ('cause you're mine right now)
if you break my heart ('cause you're mine right now)
yet here we are
and i ruin the moment 'cause i picture the end
but i don't wanna go there, so i tell myself that

hey, it's alright if we don't end up together
'cause you're mine right now
hey, i don't mind if we don't get to forever
'cause you're mine right now
hey, it's alright if we don't end up together
(it's alright if we don't, it's alright)
'cause you're mine right now
hey, i don't mind if we don't get to forever
(it's alright if we don't, it's alright)
'cause you're mine right now
hey
it's alright if we don't end up staying together
it's alright if we don't, it's alright
'cause you're mine right now
hey
it's alright if we don't end up staying together
it's alright if we don't, it's alright
'cause you're mine right now 

there was an emptiness
i think you met me at a strange time and you anchored me
i felt anonymous
and you were someone who reminded me who i used to be

it had to break, i had to go
'cause it took me walkin' away to really know

i love who i see lookin' at me
in the mirror, in the mirror
nothing compares to the feeling right there
in the mirror, in the mirror

i needed loneliness
to know there's nothing that i can't turn into confidence
i couldn't play pretend
and i'm sorry that you had to pay the consequences, oh no

it had to break, i had to go
'cause it took me walkin' away to really know
i love who i see lookin' at me
in the mirror, in the mirror
nothing compares to the feelin' right there
in the mirror, in the mirror (in the mirror)

ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
just fell in love with the person in the mirror
ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
just fell in love with the person in the mirror

but i love who i see lookin' at me
in the mirror, in the mirror
nothing compares to the feeling right there
in the mirror, in the mirror

i love who i see lookin' at me
in the mirror, in the mirror
nothing compares to the feeling right there
in the mirror, in the mirror (in the mirror)

ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
just fell in love with the person in the mirror
ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
just fell in love with the person in the mirror 

i don't know, seems crazy how we got this far
there's something 'bout you that felt pretty good
that i can't see anymore
should've known, but i got stuck here in your arms
but you hold onto me like you're holding your demons
as we lie in the dark

it's you i'm gonna miss
the one i tried to fix
pathetic as it is

so don't you stay if you don't mean it
if you don't feel it and just fuck me up again
please walk away, and we'll just leave it
or were you thinkin' i would give my heart in vain?
i won't give my heart in vain, in vain
nah, nah, nah, no, oh

should've questioned how you tried to keep it low
never listened to all the alarms in my mind
that were tellin' me to go
you never talk, you keep your feelings underground
never pictured myself as someone to catch you on the rebound
it's you i'm gonna miss
the one i tried to fix
pathetic as it is

so don't you stay if you don't mean it
if you don't feel it and just fuck me up again
please walk away, and we'll just leave it
or were you thinkin' i would give my heart in vain?
i won't give my heart in vain, in vain
nah, nah, nah, no, oh

give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby
give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby
give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby
give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby
give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby
give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby (now)
oh

so don't you stay if you don't mean it
if you don't feel it, 'cause you fucked me up again
please walk away, and we'll just leave it
or were you thinkin' i would give my heart in vain?
i won't give my heart in vain
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)
in vain
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)
no, no, ooh-ooh, whoa
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)
i won't give my heart in vain
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)
in vain
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)
no, no, ooh-ooh, whoa
(give it, give it up, give it, give it up, baby)

won't give my heart in vain
won't give my heart in vain
won't give my heart in vain 

thought i saw you in the crowd tonight
but i know you're somewhere else, you're just on my mind
i don't need you, but it feels so good
to just say it as it is and be understood

oh, whoa

i think we're a hit, woo (oh)
i know that my schedule is fucked up
but, baby, you know you're the same (oh)

i could tell you the truth
but you'd call me a liar (liar, li-liar)
tried to wave a white flag
but you set it on fire (fire)

(and that's when you start asking yourself why)
you cry, they don't
every single night
that's how you know

you gotta let it go
sometimes, you just can't fix it
you love somebody, love somebody
but you gotta let them go
before you go down with them
can't love somebody who loves burning bridges
burning bridges

i used "sorry" to keep you
and that was my error (error, my error)
ooh, 'cause i tore me apart
tryna hold us together (together)
(and that's when you start asking yoursеlf why)
you cry, they don't
every single night
that's how you know

you gotta lеt it go
sometimes, you just can't fix it
you love somebody, love somebody
but you gotta let them go
before you go down with them
can't love somebody who loves burning bridges
