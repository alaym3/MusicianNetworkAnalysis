woke up 'cause the light poured in
day two, let the flood begin
day one left me in my bed (in my bed)
i can barely remember it
heart shattered in a thousand ways
they tell me pain gonna come in waves
they tell me i'm gonna be okay
i'm still waitin' for the first to break

why would you give and then take him away?
suddenly end, could you not let it fade?
what i would give for a couple of days
a couple of days

is it just across the jordan?
or a city in the stars?
are you singin' with the angels?
are you happy where you are?
well, until this show is over
and you run into my arms
god has you in heaven
but i have you in my heart
i have you in my heart
i just can't make sense of this
everything is so dissonant
somebody said he was meant for this
but i'm just straight missin' him
i wanna wake up to your laugh at two
catch you when you steal my shoes
say good mornin', afternoon
talk you through those "alex blues" (alex blues)
listen to your latest beats
talk about what the lyrics mean
venmo you another loan (another loan)
see you do your second show

you said you'd turn, you would turn it around (turn it around)
thought that you had time to straighten it out (straighten it out)
told me that you were my prodigal son
but this isn't home

is it just across the jordan?
or a city in the stars?
are you singin' with the angels?
are you happy where you are?
well, until this show is over
and you run into my arms
god has you in heaven
but i have you in my heart
i have you in my heart
did he see you from a long way off (did he see you?)
runnin' to him with a father's heart? (runnin' to him)
did you wrap him up inside your arms
and let him know that he's home?
did he see you from a long way off
runnin' to him with a father's heart?
did you wrap him up inside your arms
and let him know that he's home?
oh, oh, oh, oh

or a city in the stars? (city in the stars)
are you singin' with the angels?
are you happy where you are? (happy where you are)
well, until this show is over

turn these eyes to my sole protector
and break the will of this born defector

'cause all i know, all i know

i'm on a whole new intrigue
my space invaded, upgraded
i hear you talkin' to me
it's in the boom of the thunder, it's in the cool of the rain
and i'll say i don't ever want to get away

tonight is beautiful
it's got my mind on you
and everywhere i turn is a reminder (reminder, reminder)

i see you in everything, all day
and every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
i see you in every little thing, all day
no matter where i go i know your love is findin' me
i see you in everything
you're all up in everything

my soul's awaken
i'm taken by all the beauty you bring
you got it blarin', i'm starin'
love watchin' you do your thing
there's no mistakin' your style
no mistakin' your touch
i see the grand, i see the subtle of your love
lord, i see you in everything all day
and every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
i see you in every little thing, all day
no matter where i go i know your love is findin' me
it's findin' me in everything, all day
and every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
i see you in every little thing, all day
no matter where i go i know your love is findin' me

tonight is beautiful
it's got my mind on you (got my mind on you)
and everywhere i turn is a reminder (ooh, ooh)
from the sparkle in her eyes to the starlit open skies
you bring my heart to life, fill me with wonder (with wonder, with wonder)

i see you in everything all day (all day)
and every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
i see you in every little thing, all day (all day)
no matter where i go i know your love is findin' me
i see you in (ay, ay, ay) everything
you're all up in (ay, ay, ay) everything
i see you in (ay, ay, ay) everything
you're all up in (ay, ay, ay) everything
oh, i can see your love, your love in everything
and that's why you'll always be my everything
yeah, i can see your love, your love in everything
and that's why you'll always be my everything 

i'll keep swingin' for the fences
it's like this heart is defenseless
against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin'
and if i can't walk, then i'm crawlin'
it might flicker, but they can't kill the flame

i can't stop, i can't quit
it's in my heart, it's on my lips
i can't stop, no, i can't quit
it's in my heart, yeah, i'm all in

til the wheels fall off
til the spotlight fades
i will lift your banner high
i will lift your banner high
and til the walls crash in
for the rest of my days
i'll lay it all on the line
til the day i

til the day i die
til the end of the line
(til the day) til the day i die
it's your name i'll glorify
it's runnin' deeper than the ocean
this ain't religion, it's devotion
3-6-5, every minute, every day
so in the middle of the madness
they can stretch me out like canvas
but i ain't ever gonna fit in their frame

i can't stop, i can't quit
it's in my heart, it's on my lips
i can't stop, no, i can't quit
it's in my heart, yeah, i'm all in

t-t-t-t-t-t-til i die and they put me in the coffin (yeah)
don't matter if i'm on the road or if i'm recordin'
tell me what you think about me, that really ain't important
you know i'ma represent 'em, i ain't playin', can't afford to
i only got one life, and i get it though
and this is not an act, not a movie, not a tv show
i don't know what "quittin'" means, i don't ever take it slow
you know i'm on the grind, me and toby in the studio
do it for the king, what you know about that?
say you goin' harder, mmm, i doubt that
you say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at
how you doin' work when you asking where the couch at, huh?
god is not a crutch, you can use him when you wanna
you only look to heaven when you goin' through some drama
and when they goin' through some problems and that's the only time they call him
i guess i don't understand that life, wonder why?
cause' i'm all in
til the day i die

til the wheels fall off
til the spotlight fades
i will lift your banner high
lord, i lift your banner high
and til the walls crash in
for the rest of my days
i'll lay it all on the line
til the day i
til the day i (til the day i die)
til the day, til the day i die (til the day i die)
til the day i (til the day i die)
til the end, til the end of the line (til the end of the line)
til the day i (til the day i die)
til the day, til the day i fall
til the day i (til the day i die)
til the end, til the end of the line

no, no, no
no, no

we started out strong
but somewhere along
we lost our way
done things in your name
i'm so ashamed
i don't have the words to say
we've killed and destroyed
stolen and blamed
all in your name
you told us to give
told us to love
but we chose to take
you laid down your life
put power aside
showed us the way and the truth
we roll into church
open the word
and forget that we're called to include

now, it's long overdue
but i can't dilute
what we seem to havе put on the shelf
i can't speak for us all
but i gotta bеlieve
i'm speakin' for more than myself
when i say…
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no

we say that we're one
but we're broken up
by anything that can divide
our color o' skin
the clothes we're in
that valley's deep and wide
we overlook the broken
the homeless
and discard the poor
while we celebrate the rich and beautiful
with a wide-open door
i'm sorry we're nothing like you
you chose to bear a cross
we choose to give you parts of us
and rarely the parts that cost
now, it's long overdue
but i can't dilute
what we seem to have put on the shelf
i can't speak for us all
but i gotta believe
i'm speakin' for more than myself
when i say…

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no

wake us up, wake us up, wake us up, lord
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up, lord
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
no, no, no
i'm sorry, so sorry
no, no, no
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up, lord
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up
wake us up, wake us up, wake us up, lord

blessed are the poor in spirit
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn
for they shall be comforted
blessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness
for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful
for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart
for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers
for they shall be called the children of god
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake 

i lace the boots up, it's straight to the door
'cause this is worth fighting for
i get my head right, the heart's gotta follow
whisper a prayer like there ain't no tomorrow
take a breath, and i exhale slow
i wasn't made for this kind of cold
this ain't the kind of place that you wanna know
these are the elements, i'm telling you, bro
this world is up in my grill
this world is shooting to kill
this world always gotta be stealing my heart
this world always tryin' to rip my family apart (apart, apart, apart)

i'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements)
i'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements)
i got spirit, i got faith

i was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze
singin' like a song through the tall oak trees
it was just another summer night
had to be the last thing on my mind
yeah, i was all but lost in the moment
i was young and runnin' wide open
it was just another summer night
had to be the last thing on my mind

when love broke through
you found me in the darkness
wanderin' through the desert
i was a hopeless fool
now i'm hopelessly devoted
my chains are broken
and it all began with you
when love broke through
and it all began with you
when love broke through

i did all that i could to undo me
but you loved me enough to pursue me
yeah, you drew me out of the shadows
made me believe that i mattered to you, you
uh, you were there, you heard my prayer
in that broke-down, dusty room
it was the first time i said, "i'm yours"
the first time i called you "lord"
when love broke through
you found me in the darkness
wanderin' through the desert
i was a hopeless fool
now i'm hopelessly devoted
my chains are broken
and it all began with you
when love broke through
and it all began with you
when love broke through

yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
sang like a song through the oak trees
pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
which had me a little more open than closed
walls i built, opinions i learned
covered in the ashes of bridges i burned
blind to the arrow that was headed to my heart
but you hit the mark

when love broke through (love)
you found me in the darkness
wanderin' through the desert (desert)
i was a hopeless fool
now i'm hopelessly devoted
my chains are broken (thank you, jesus)
and it all began with you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
when love broke through
you found me in the darkness
wanderin' through the desert (desert)
i was a hopeless fool
now i'm hopelessly devoted
my chains are broken (chains are broken)
and it all began with you
when love broke through
(it all began with you, it all began with you)
and it all began with you
when love broke through
(it all began with you, jesus)

i did all that i could to undo me
but you loved me enough to pursue me 

head down as i punch this clock
the hours roll, they never stop
and i can't ever seem to get ahead
always tryin' to do what's right
straight and narrow's gettin' tight
don't know how much longer i can stand

and i'm wonderin'
yeah, i'm wonderin'
where's my promised land?

out here on this desert road
it's hot as fire but i've grown cold
circlin' like a plane that never lands
and even though the questions change
the answers always stay the same
maybe someday i will understand

so i'm wonderin'
got me wonderin'
whеre's my promised land?
yeah, i'm wondеrin'
still i'm wonderin'
where's my promised land?
well, i've run this earth for many years
if there's one thing i know
there's nowhere on this side o' heaven
where streets are made o' gold
i've long laid down my grand illusions
lookin' toward the day that i'll be home

i won't give up on this race
broken but i still have faith
that this old life is all part of a plan
and i can feel it in my soul
one day, i'll stand before the throne
with nothin' left but hope in these two hands

through all these seasons
i'm still believin'
you're my promised land
in all my grievin'
i'm still believin'
you're my promised land

you're my promised land
ooh ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh
my promised land
ooh ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh
ah ah
ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh
oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
ooh ooh-ooh

man, i wanna tell y'all something, man
man, i'm not gon' let these material things get in my way, y'all
i'm tryna get somewhere
i'm tryna get somewhere that's real and pure and true and eternal
toby, can you go witcha boy?
let's go!

father god, i am clay in your hands
help me to stay that way through all life's demands
cause they chip and they nag and they pull at me
and every little thing i make up my mind to be
like i'm gonna be a daddy who's in the mix
and i'm gonna be a husband who stays legit
and i pray that i'm an artist who rises above
the road that is wide and filled with self love
everything that i see draws me
though it's only in you that i can truly see
that it's a feast for the eyes, a low blow to purpose
and i'm a little kid at a three-ring circus

i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
mr. franklin, step up to the mic, sir
the paparazzi flashes, and that they think that it's you
but they don't know that who you are is not what you do
true, we get it twisted when we peek at the charts
yo, before we part from the start
where's your heart?
you a pimp, hustler?
tell me what's your title
america has no more stars, now we call them idols
you sit idle, while we teach prosperity
the first thing to prosper should be inside of me
we're free
not because of .22s on the range
but christ came in range, we said yes, now we changed
not the same, even though i made a fall
since i got that call, no more saul, now i'm paul

i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
don't wanna walk away
don't wanna walk away
mandisa, come on!
how do i sense the tide that's rising?
desensitizing me from living in the light of eternity
how do i sense the tide that's rising?
it's hypnotizing me from living in the light of eternity
tell me
how do i sense the tide that's rising?
desensitizing me from living in the light
living in the light of eternity

lord, what we gonna do?
we're relying on you
all eyes are on you, lord
all eyes are on you

all eyes are on you, jesus

i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
(don't let me lose my soul, my soul)
i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
(this is my honesty, father, won't you cover me)
i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
(don't wanna walk away, and all those people say)
i don't want to gain the whole world, and lose my soul
(no, i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose my soul)
lord, forgive us when we get consumed by the things of this world
that fight for our love, and our passion
as our eyes are open wide and on you
grant us the privilege of your worldview
and may your kingdom be
what wakes us up
and lays us down 

'cause we all make mistakes sometimes
and we all step across that line
but nothing's sweeter than the day we find, we find...

it's hangin' over him like the clouds of seattle
and rainin' on his swag, fallin' deeper in the saddle
it's written on his face, he don't have to speak a sound
somebody call the five-0, we got a man down

now you can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
but guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
and when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
you can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight, y'all

'cause we all make mistakes sometimes
and we've all stepped across that line
but nothing's sweeter than the day we find
forgiveness (forgiveness), forgiveness (forgiveness)
and we all stumble and we fall
bridges burn in the heat of it all
but nothing's sweeter than the day
sweeter than the day we call
out for forgiveness (forgiveness)
we all need, we all need
we all need forgiveness (forgiveness)
we all need, we all need
mr. lecrae (uh)

my momma told me what i would be in for
if i kept all this anger inside of me pent up
my heart been broken, my wounds been open
and i don't know if i can hear "i'm sorry" being spoken
but those forgiven much should be quicker to give it
and god forgave me for it all, jesus bled forgiveness
so when the stones fly, and they aimed at you
just say, "forgive 'em, father, they know not what they do"

you can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
but guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
and when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
you can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight, y'all

cause we all make mistakes sometimes
and we've all stepped across that line
but nothing's sweeter than the day we find
forgiveness (forgiveness), forgiveness (forgiveness)
and we all stumble and we fall
bridges burn in the heat of it all
but nothing's sweeter than the day
sweeter than the day we call
out for forgiveness (woo, uh, you know we need that)
(that, that, you know we need that) forgiveness
(that, that, you know we need that)
(that, yeah, let's talk to 'em)

no matter how lost you are
you're not that far, you're not too far (forgiveness)
no matter how hurt you are
you're not that far, you're not too far (forgiveness)
no matter how wrong you are
you're not that far, you're not too far (forgiveness)
no matter who you are
you're not that far, you're not too far
from forgiveness (oh, oh)
ask for forgiveness (oh, oh, oh)

cause we all make mistakes sometimes (sometimes)
and we've all stepped across that line (crossed that line)
but nothing's sweeter than the day we find
forgiveness (forgiveness), forgiveness (forgiveness)
and we all stumble and we fall
bridges burn in the heat of it all
but nothing's sweeter than the day
sweeter than the day we call
out for forgiveness (forgiveness)
we all need, we all need
we all need forgiveness (forgiveness)
we all need, we all need

some days, life feels perfect
other days it just ain't workin'
the good, the bad, the right, the wrong
and everything in between

yo, it's crazy, amazing
we can turn a heart through the words we say
mountains crumble with every syllable
hope can live or die

so speak life, speak life
to the deadest darkest night
speak life, speak life
when the sun won't shine and you don't know why
look into the eyes of the brokenhearted
watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope
you speak love, you speak...

you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

some days the tongue gets twisted
other days my thoughts just fall apart
i do, i don't, i will, i won't
it's like i'm drowning in the deep
yo, it's crazy to imagine
words from our lips as the arms of compassion
mountains crumble with every syllable
hope can live or die

so speak life, speak life
to the deadest darkest night
speak life, speak life
when the sun won't shine and you don't know why
look into the eyes of the brokenhearted
watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope
you speak love, you speak...

you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

lift your head a little higher
spread the love like fire
hope will fall like rain
when you speak life with the words you say
raise your thoughts a little higher
use your words to inspire
joy will fall like rain
when you speak life with the things you say
lift your head a little higher
spread the love like fire
hope will fall like rain
when you speak life with the words you say
(with the words you say, with the words you say)

so speak life, speak life
to the deadest darkest night
speak life, speak life
when the sun won't shine and you don't know why
look into the eyes of the brokenhearted
watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope
you speak love, you speak...

you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
you speak life, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

goin' all in, gonna make it count
won't look back, gonna set my eyes
'cause there ain't no practice runs in life

this is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
this is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
we gon' go 'til we got nothing left (this is the real thing)
this is not a, this is not a
this is not a test (woo)
this is not a test
this is not a test
test, test, test, test, te-te-te-te- not a test

we're checkin' in, so check it out (ah)
we're droppin' in, there ain't no stoppin' us now
we're breathin' in, we're breathin' out (ah)
we're droppin' in, there ain't no stoppin', stoppin' us now

we've only got one shot, gonna take it now
goin' all in, gonna make it count
won't look back, gonna set my eyes
'cause there ain't no practice runs in life

this is life

this is life, this is life
this is life, this is life
life, life, li-li-li-li-

this is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
this is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
we gon' go 'til we got nothing left (this is the real thing)
this is not a, this is not a
this is not a test (woo)
