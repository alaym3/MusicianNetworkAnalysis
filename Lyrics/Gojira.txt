waters of chaos have invaded all space
the flood on earth again, i have to find the whales
that once did guide us to the dry lands of life
i won't despair, i'll break this dark around

under heavy sea
i'll search the flight of whales

beneath the seas, i searched and had a different view
of us on earth, the sinking ship of men
but it's beyond the stars, i found the place where
they were, and they finally came to light

over the winds
they dwell in light
like the arrow in the sky
i found myself on higher grounds from up here
for i see them all the ways in flight

now i can see the whales
looming out of the dark
like arrows in the sky
i can't believe my eyes, but it's true

huge tunnel ends in light
like banks of clouds, they gather
see massive shape of flesh
swimming giants in the clear
the mightiest comes to me
i'm on the wing, wide open
they teach me how to fly
slowly moving in the air

so much told with no words at all
powerful presence for only speech
breath

over the winds
they dwell in light
fly

a growing sickness in the heart
defective, lack of control
the cure is somewhere in the silence
but i'm crushed by the noise inside

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of me falls for you

another day in the dark
no, no
stranded in the night
stranded in the cold

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone

so long i've been trying to match
it doesn't work, i'm trying, i don't know
the aberration of this world i tried to deal with
it killed a part of me that was raging
the pain is gone, the denial
i ran away from institutions
i owe myself life

there's no way i will risk all this pressure and
anger flowing through me
there is light in this world i fight for
the reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
the desire that you once had to reveal yourself
forgot to create your own life

anger, lies, denial

this righteous anger boiling inside of us
won't last forever, don't fear to let it out
branches have grown through
the wolf is your master

the sky is all over me
i run on time

quit moaning about fate and change
stand up on your feet and rise
with every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
start now, open your eyes
dead bodies falling from the sky
we are the ape with the vision of the killing
a rain of shame that fills the mines
no other blood in me but mine

time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

your heart is pounding in the brain
as they drag you naked in the mud
a devil's dancing in the rain
how could you fall so low?

no, we will never let go
let us watch them die


time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

breathing slowly, mechanical heartbeat
losing contact with the living
almighty tv plugged, hybrid empty brain
don't see anything real in the game
the tension is building constantly
no reason, just a reflex i have, driven by clockwork
i try to keep an eye open, and i realize
i haven't closed my eyes in a long time

neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
i have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
i've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
i haven't closed my eyes in a long time, i am trying

i cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
but i'm here to continue after all i have been through
i try to keep my eyes open, i am realizing
this life and death more precious than anything

i won't bring no materials in the afterlife
take no possessions, i would rather travel light
i'm of this kind that kills all day
but i don't know yet how to die
art of dying is the way to let all go
within i practice in the secret of my soul
my shape in the reflector has now forever
life on its own

four hundred thousand years ago
they came from outer space and gave us life here
and we are just taking everything for granted
i don't think we should do this now
and when i see the smoke around
i feel like i'm not from humankind down there
i feel like glaciers are my eyes
and mountains are my head, my heart is ocean
and i feel all alone
'cause everybody's wrong, i fear the living
what is this thing that we call hate?
and that's inside of me, get out of here

a world is down, and none can rebuild it
disabled lands are evolving
my eyes are shut, a vision is dying
my head explodes, and i fall in disgrace

i hold my inner child within
and tell him not to cry: "don't fear the living"
one day you will stand as a king
and no fear can erase this light below us
each one of us is now engaged
this secret we all have, this truth is growing
and as a warrior, i have to fight
i can already feel the love i'll discover

i had this dream, our planet surviving
the guiding stars always growing
and all the worlds, the fates all the countries
they're all rebuilding at the same time
i never fell and always believed in
we could evolve and get older
open thy eyes and let all this flow in
now see a new hope is growing inside

we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing
we will see our children growing

before all things reborn again
you learn the painful breath of time
cold morning stretches out your arms
to the mighty warmth of one golden sun
seems all have gone insane for gold
all was created out of the night
we're all born from the burst of a star

the day you'll come to life you'll realize
expanding force of life where you belong
and in the winter cold, with opened eyes
you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright

one day you'll walk the world and keep in mind
the heart you've been given in winter time
and through the bitter cold, with opened eyes
you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright

mortal, spawn on the altar
caught in the heart of the blaze
the primal fear of disappearing
becoming a ghost in the void
(death)

give a price, put a name
none of it real in this matter
wandering, distracting
wishing the life of another self

we were born for one thing
tame the greatest fear of all
we were born for one thing
born to face the greatest fear of all

we're all drawn into oursеlves
in a collective coma
rеmember gazing up for answers
but now we're staring down
(down)
(down)
(down)
(all is blur in the maze we put an end to all)
(all is blur in the maze we put an end to all)

we were born for one thing
tame the greatest fear of all
we were born for one thing
born to face the greatest fear of all

we're no one
united
when we're gone

we leave the shores to see the mountains rising
a distant impression growing
this judgment creates the pain we hold
destructive intentions that serve no purpose but the end of us all

these vultures from the past
coming in all the hells and worlds, the time has come
delivered from their eyes
embrace, suffer, destroy - the gift of guilt

the shame and sorrow, self-condemnation
fill all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding
bestowed upon us, devastating power
we're building connective tissue to a maze of lies

we're left as starving orphans, the vital core is gone
our sins are all over and over again we swallow
we're sick and tired when this wind blows, the reflex is insane
we must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love

in all the hells and worlds, the time has come
in all the hells and worlds, the time has come

these vultures from the past
coming in all the hells and worlds, the time has come
delivered from their eyes
i'm leaving this behind - the gift of guilt

lay down, fall away

lie awake
just cannot move my arms and legs, i'm paralyzed
don't recall how to free myself from this
heart of the dark, my face contorted
don't know how to reach the light
but i feel so bad like a freak in a cage

open the door
enter your heart
you go so far

golden unworldly silence
spaceflight at speed of light
i cross the clouds and colours
the black hole is calling me
slide on the horizon
on the frontier not to cross
black dwarf, time's gone distorted
heart of the dark, a whirl of light

enter in the realm of nothingness
i feel the cold, my eyes are shut, my fear is slowly dying
light years from here are my thoughts and cages
i can hear their moan, but now a long deep breath is calling

overtaking time and now understanding space
i feel united, i do cross light, feel the living
here in the centre stands the light of love
that never can be touched from greater silence shall return

on the first light of the day, you march on
departure has arrived, don't look back
avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
until you feel the blast of a shooting star

following the spark like a rocket in the sky
between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
headed north, frozen land where tigers go to die
don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

you are higher in the sky

learn the skill to stay alive, survival
the city is so mean, you're being watched
reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
until the light calls you back into the wild

when you get to the other side, please, send a sign
it'll fly through the atmosphere in time
and if you hold the truth within your hands
you won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn

everlasting love is ever-growing
hang on to what you have and let it grow
everlasting love is ever-dying
it's in the past, you have to let it go

incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
you rotate the frame in a world you rely on
a scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush

the greatest miracle
is burning to the ground

onto the next stage of the plan
mourn the witness of the wind
a handful of thunder
will rise one last time

there's fire in the sky
you're in the amazon
the greatest miracle
is burning to the ground

godly amazonia
bloody amazonia
mighty amazonia
killing amazonia
godly amazonia
bloody amazonia
mighty amazonia
killing amazonia
godly amazonia
bloody amazonia

burn
the land
learn
the end
burn
another gold mine is unveiled
the source of our sorrow
learn
embedded in these walls of green
is the curse that we follow

there's fire in the sky
you're in the amazon
the greatest miracle
is burning to the ground

indestructible
on this rock, i lie, but i'm alive for good
and i just free myself for now from all what was wrong
break the unbreakable

all the stars fearlessly bright
they call me out there, order me to face the wind
my structure's alive, body's on the way
don't bow down before the walls
of fear and madness, they try to counter me
and strike me down to the ground again

inexhaustible
the strength of fire is running through me
spine-like beam of light
what mortal could ever break this force?
unconstrained
i see at last my backbone straighten
thy serpent made of bones
finally rise up from the ground awaken

beat your feet on the ground now, go

serpent of light, movement of the soul
crawling stately along the spine
mighty phoenix from the ashes arises
firebird cycle of life, regenerate the cell

life burns fierce, reduced to ashes
resurrection from the flame, ageless process
quest for absolution, out of bounds introspect
self-consuming womb, ever-present, meet no end

it seems like i always knew this
since i'm a child, i can feel it
my inner light everlasting
revolving within a circle
extended wings i'm flying
over the valleys and planes
the curve of space i'm leaving
death is just an illusion

oroborus symbol of eternal life
dig a tunnel for light through ignorant walls
i'm counting the days, but i'm dying
grow up with impatience, i'm falling down
on the peaks of radiant mountains
this truth is growing before me
my attention fixed on this silence
rediscover life while i'm breathing
designing the shape of material
frozen icon distant reminder
mankind has forgotten the gateways
by the mouth of the serpent regenerate

go

i'm in a mental cage, i'm locked up
imprisoned, i live deathlike, sickening
strong is your hold on my resignation
i, don't see the stars, my memories are veiled

in fluid dreams, i fall, i'm restless
walls made of stone are turned into water now
enlightened demons take by the hand
approaching me, this great eye speaking

mountainous waves are breaking on my despair
awaken me, but i'm still dreaming
and i just plunge into this sea of light
set open the doors of soul i'm living

lightning struck me
i see the path i was so scared of
and fly to the stars
conviction now increasing at last
my skin is broken
i see the smallest part of me now
my mind is alive
but i'll never bow to this again

why do they call me there?
how can i fly?
all this water, i...
i don't feel like i could ever swim to them
whales in the sky
i feel they're so close inside and yet so far away

burst into tears, i feel sad, my dreams aflame
the force is now away
lie on a stone, drop this load and cry to see
the ocean planet is on burn

the sickness of this world is destroying all the dreams
the fools are kings, tearing apart the soul
the race for complication, communicate reaction
the lack of heart of men, i grow distant from the core

borrow this body for a lifetime
earthly material
my soul unraveled out of mental
the shell returns to dust

i focus on the present, concentrate on what i find
accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
this force increases and tells me where to go

follow, i enter my dimension
awakened heart for life
enforce my senses; understanding
i find the will to live straight, oh

i feel the change, i see the vicious circle
finally turned into a virtuous one
having the whole world in my hands filled
timelessness
out of the frame, i feel so vast, i'm all around myself
imaginative interaction
but i keep struggling inside to hold this always
forever there

is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding?
the only way to find the power is to look inside
increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
now you hold this secret appeared out of the vacuum of space
remain in what you are, the center of your life
you made it to this point, no one can tell you how
you crawled and bled all the way, but you were the only one that
was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself

we mock and slaughter all the purest kinds
blinded by the noise and maze, this flash in our eyes
hope for the world, but prepare for the worst
i'd rather find a way on my own

another world
another place to be
other world
a new place for me

don't believe your lies, don't believe your tales
i'm longing for the day i will find

another world
another place to be
other world
a new place for me

another world
another place to be
other world
a new place for me

mysterious form, soul in the dark
under this heavy sealing concrete waves
followed by servants, funeral cortège
this pale ghost is gathering his strength

ghost, pale
the procession is crawling

plastic form, dead things, it is now so clear
how could i fail to understand?
cities are burning, the trees are dying
my heart awake, but still

pain is killing me
pain is killing me

take this pestilent destruction out of my way
the great pacific garbage patch is exhausted
and the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse
with the sacred one you have lost

plastic bag in the sea
plastic bag in the sea
plastic bag in the sea
plastic bag in the sea

tell me what you see
in the afterlife
par-delà le ciel
par-delà le soleil

in all there is to learn
the sun is on our side
and though you're on the run
you will survive
expanded to the state of light
the deepest corners of the world
gliding through the lowlands
and swimming all the oceans
walking through the silence
already made it through the night
there will be a new day
whenever the sun rises

you're invisible
you're in everything
tell me what you see
tell me what you see
when you're everywhere
when you're everywhere
tell me now
tell me now

while you drift away from all the plagues of this world
you're put out of misery, giant monster
you won't have to face it again
every step of the way gets you higher

all the voices trapped underneath the ground
let 'em all go in the sky
find the power lost underneath the ground
let it all blow in the sky
all the voices trapped in my head
let 'em all scream in the night
find the power lost underneath the ground
let it all blow in the sky

a deep voice is rising from the heart of the mountain
vibrations of the stone i can hear in my heart
the call of instinct, the flight of the powerful
i hunger for it, it just keeps me alive

i met the dragon in a cave by the mountain
now i bring the evidence the beast is alive
this ageless army will strike in the morning
and then a star will rise and shine in the sky
but i grow impatient, cannot stand the wait
and i start to dig within me this tunnel to i
in this region of me, a great dragon is lying
on the wealth of a mighty world, my own world inside

i saw, i saw monsters
and i, and i start to, start to dig within
when i, when i turn my
turn my back on them, they devour me
in this region of
me, a dragon is lying there awake
monster, monster kings, do
do not scorn them, but do not fear them, no
muster, muster thy army, army
