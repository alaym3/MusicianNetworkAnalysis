let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
when you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
when you make pain look this good it never wears out
this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

while my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherfucker
i was enraged, feeling it like a motherfucker
bird in a cage, you would never know what i was dealing with
went our separate ways, but i was happy she was killing it
bittersweet, she was up, i was down
no lie, i feel good for her, but what do i do now?
forget the records, off the record, i was going through some bullshit
post survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?
meanwhile this nigga putting his hands on me
i swear y’all don’t know the half of this industry

let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
when you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
when you make pain look this good it never wears out
this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

and it’s almost been a decade
i’m behind them black shades
roll up like it’s all good, right up out that escalade
fix my make-up, “get it together, kelly, get it together”
then we make up, well get it together, nigga, get it together
kinda lucky, i was in her shadow
phone call from my sister, “what’s the matter?”
she said, “oh no baby, you gotta leave!”
i’m on the kitchen floor, he took the keys
i was mad at everybody, i mean everybody
yeah, her, her, her her everybody
five years later, i got my shit down pat
think i had it good, and they don’t know how bad
fooled everybody, except myself
soaking in this hurt, bathing in the dirt

let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
when you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
when you make pain look this good it never wears out
this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

so here i am in the spin cycle we’re coming and we’re going
nobody can notice
and i was trapped in his house, lying to my mama
thought it could get no worse as we maximize the drama
started to call them people on him
i was battered
he hittin the window like it was me, until it shattered
he pulled me out, he said, “don’t nobody love you but me
not your mama, not your daddy and especially not bey.”
he turned me against my sister
i missed you

let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
when you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
when you make pain look this good it never wears out
this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
gave you my heart, it slipped through your fingers
now you're the one to blame
don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

oh love, your dinner’s waiting down the street
and you can have it your way
so love, the mess you made is yours to clean
so don’t be looking at me

but i think you could’ve done me better, don’t you?
you fool

there’s a million ways that i could tell you
but i think i’d rather show you it’s over
and i won’t be back no more

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

i ain't trippin', just a bunch of extra shit
i ain't missing, my sister tried to tell me 'bout you
i ain't listen, now we going down this road
hit the smoke, said "bro, i've been here before"
and you know kelly never lied

oh, my, shut the fuck up

ladies, y'all wanna do it again
bey, go on michelle

i really hate to see that look on your face
you're lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade
and i know it kills to feel those tears in your eyes
but i guess your conscience finally caught up with your lies
but when my tears dropped, where the hell were you?
but it's okay, boy, i've changed, and i ain't been there waiting
so i won't pretend to feel bad for you
cause since you left, i ain't cried since
and boy, i like it that way

i can say "i'm done" in a million ways
but let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late
and now i'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
and if our love was a game, you just lost
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late

i know you hate to see this look on my face
i'm sure that you can see real clear, a little lying goes a long way
and if you think i'll waste my tears, boy you're crazy
and maybe you should get yourself admitted, don't delay
but you let the bomb drop, too bad for you
but it's okay, boy, i'm straight, my whole life's amazing
so i won't pretend to feel bad for you
cause since you left, i ain't cried since
and boy, i like it that way

i can say "i'm done" in a million ways
but let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late
and now i'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
and if our love was a game, you just lost
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late

now you wanna claim you got a clue
boy, what'd you expect for me to do?
you claim you wanna have a life or two
but you can save your "sorry's" and your "i love you" too

i can say "i'm done" in a million ways
but let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late
and now i'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
and if our love was a game, you just lost
and you changed, i changed, but it's too late

change just in time
just in time for me to change my mind
and it's too late
boy, i changed
it's too bad for you, oh-oh
for i changed my mind
i don't want you no-no more
'cause see, you changed, i changed
you changed, but it's too late, it's too late
sorry

can you describe the moment
when two people fall in love?
some say the clouds will spin in circles
and the rain will turn to dust
the poor will start to laugh
even the rich will start to cry
it can sneak up like a soldier
it can wake you up at night
that is what i feel when i'm standing here with you
it's what my heart has sworn to be true

this is love
it's written on my face
it's the way i lean my body towards you
even when i'm a hundred miles away
this is love
like a diamond in the sand
it took so long to find you
i cannot wait another day to say
this is love
this is love

you take my imperfections
and turn them into art
if i can change one thing about you
there would be no place to start
you are safety without numbers
you are dangerously wild
but you are sweeter than rock candy
and you ease my inner child
it's what i feel when i am standing here with you
it's what my heart has sworn to be true

this is love
it's written on my face
it's the way i lean my body towards you
even when i'm a hundred miles away
this is love
like a diamond in the sand
it took so long to find you
i cannot wait another day to say
this is love
this is love

no, i'm no easy angel
i'm moody like the wind
i'm impatient, complicated
i'm fragile, deep within'
but you're no fool
and i'm no little girl
have we not found
there's love in the world

this is love
it's written on my face
it's the way i lean my body towards you
even when i'm a hundred miles away
this is love
like a diamond in the sand
it took so long to find you
i cannot wait another day to say
this is love
this is love

if we start off telling lies
this love will never amount to shit
you really think me, i'm the one?

give me one shot, better pour it quick
i'mma kill it girl, full clip

you know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
if i could change everything overnight, i just might try
but then again

you know how it goes
make up just to break up
fighting in the evening
regret it when we wake up
true colors get shown
feelings change like the seasons
i had to leave you alone
you gave me too many reasons

tried your love at five in the morning
i never thought that you would hurt me
yeah baby, you sure did
i put up with your shit
call and i ignore it
why you actin' like it ain’t five in the morning?
when you know you ain't worthy
see, i just need someone to come and pick me up
'cause i've been down on love
lately, lately i've been down on love
i've been down on love
lately, lately i've been down on love

you know what they say
you win some, you lose some
forgot about that old love
looking for a new one
but you know what they say
don't be looking for love, looking for love
'cause when i needed you around, you just let me down

tried your love at five in the morning
i never thought that you would hurt me

we want two different things at two different times
you know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
if i could change everything overnight, i just might try
but then again
would you do the same? would you give it all up?
would i be the only one? callin' out your name
'cause you return the favors, would you do the same?
could i be the only one callin out your name?

'cause i've been down on love
lately, lately i've been down on love
i've been down on love
lately, lately i've been down on love
'cause i've been down on love
