we do this in our sleep, nigga
yeah
ever been in love before?
i wanna holla at you, ma
you know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
but i'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what i'm sayin?
ayy, p, give it to me one time nephew

there's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
she from around the way
ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
it wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
but when i finally found the words to say
i wanted to run away (run away, run away), simply run away, oh
you can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
you can lie to yourself, let me reason
sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
that you're in love with the girl

yes sir, that's her
but it wasn't like that back when i met her
the lavish life from all the dough spun
before the double r had to hitchhike thumb
her friends didn't like niggas like us
but i arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
spider web sex must have got caught up
but there's more to it i remember once
sayin' "let's shit on the peons
let's go to vegas and watch celine dion"
make 'em say "what we on?"
you say no like you was doin' it for eons
fuck it i just hum and let the watch give off the neons
when it rains it pours, i laugh to myself when i change the score
you said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
and somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy, i guess he played games
it's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
but when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
you in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed
but if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

what you say, say, say?
but when i finally found the words to say
i wanted to run away (run away, run away), simply run away, oh
check it out, check it out
you can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
you can lie to yourself, let me reason
sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
that you're in love with the girl

see i'm a crip in dark blue chucks
and i does what i does yeah i might say "cuz"
it's really weird cause a nigga got love
snoop dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
she told me that her baby daddy was a thug
now it is what it is and it was not was
i'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
all these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
ain't that kadija i heard she was a skeezer
she used to hit them licks wit' the visas
when i seen her wit the homies i was like "jesus"
it's been a little minute since i seen her
hope her man don't run up cause i'll have to pull the nina

there's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
but when i finally found the words to say
i wanted to run away, simply run away
you can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
you can lie to yourself, or try to reason
sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
that you're in love with the girl

there's somethin' 'bout this girl man
there's somethin' 'bout this girl man
there's somethin' 'bout this girl man
there's somethin' 'bout this girl man

i am black ambition
i am always whisperin'
they keep tellin' me i will not
but my will won't listen
gravity on a black man
with everything on his back and
his family and passion
if the doors ain't crackin'

you gotta let go (let go)
if you want to fly, take the leap
you gotta risk it all (risk it all)
or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
you gotta let, let go
'cause you never know what's in store
mister entrepreneur

in this position with no choice
a system imprison young black boys
distract with white noise
the brainwashed become hype boys
third eye dilate
you wasn't supposed to make it off sеction eight
robbin' peter just to pay paul
preparе to risk everything

you need let go (let go)
if you want to fly, take the leap
you gotta risk it all (risk it all)
or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
remember black is space
and its the color of your face
there will be no sunny days
if black went away

uh, lies told to you, through youtubes and hulus

black twitter, what's that? when jack gets paid, do you?
for every one gucci, support two fubus
sippin' crip-a-cola consumer and a owner, uh
'til we all vertically integrated from the floor up
d'usse pourer, sip ace 'til i throw up
like gang signs 'cept i bang mines for both ya
serial entrepreneur, we on our own
stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone
if you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (word)
then keep on stackin' 'til you stockin' for yourself, uh

is too small a term to completely describe the act
black nation, black builder, black entrepreneur

plat-double skeletal, tourbillion
it's just like her body, move, it turns her on
she like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
and all our car doors go up like transformers
