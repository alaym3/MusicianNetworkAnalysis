'til it was too late and i was empty within
hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
downward spiral, where do i begin?
it all started when i lost my mother
no love for myself and no love for another
searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
findin' nothin' but questions and devils
'cause i'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
losin' my sight, losin' my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine

i'm runnin' and i'm crying
i'm crying, i'm crying
i'm crying, i'm crying
i can't go on living this way

i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
and my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel

i'm drunk and i'm feeling down
and i just want to be alone
i'm pissed 'cause you came around
why don't you just go home?
'cause i've channeled all your pain
and i can't help you fix yourself
you're making me insane
all i can say is:

i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and our scars remind us that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel

i tried to help you once
against my own advice
i saw you goin' down
but you never realized
that you're drowning in the water
so i offered you my hand
compassions in my nature
tonight is our last stand
i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and our scars remind us that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel

i’m drunk and i’m feeling down
and i just want to be alone
you shouldn’t have come around
why don’t you just go home?
'cause you’re drowning in the water
and i tried to grab your hand
i left my heart open
but you didn’t understand
(but you didn’t understand)
go fix yourself!

i can't help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
i'm sorry, but i gotta move on with my own life
i can't help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
i'm sorry, but i gotta move on with my own life
i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and our scars remind us that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and our scars remind us that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel 

i think i need help
i'm drowning in myself

did someone turn the lights out?
or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
'cause i'm cut deep
my heart won't beat
deep down low, it's killing me
if i wanna scratch out yesterday
i've got so much i need to say
i've got so much i need to say

i think i need help
'cause i'm drowning in myself
it's sinking in
i can't pretend that i ain't been through hell
i think i need help
i'm drowning in myself

they're preying on my weakness
believe it
i'm thinking to myself, no, not again
and i won't keep listening when temptation's creeping in
if i wanna make it another day
i've got so much i need to say
i've got so much i need to say
i think i need help
'cause i'm drowning in myself
it's sinking in
i can't pretend that i ain't been through hell
i think i need help
i'm drowning in myself

i think i need help
'cause i put myself through hell

i think i need help
'cause i'm drowning in myself
it's sinking in
i can't pretend that i ain't been through hell
i think i need help

i think i need help
i think i need help 

i was there on the day truth died
blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
i was the number one sinner, no less
my life was a lie, and my wish was a death
i fell in love with the ways of the world
money, the fame, the booze, the girls
but i couldn't stay faithful, if i tried
i turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
i blacked out, told everything i ever did
i couldn't take all the lies i was living with
i broke your heart, woke up the next day
my bags outside, yelling, "get the hell away!
you're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
and you can't never change all the things that you did!"
that's when i knew it, it wouldn't last
you never get away, when you're running from the past

i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity

i'm a broken man, i'm full of sin
i'm sick of all this hell that i'm living in
and i can't escape it, this is how it feels
when you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
you tore me down, wished that i was dead
said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
but when i push away, you only pull me closer
it's only over when we both wanna say it's over
i gotta change this is not who i am
i wanna start over wanna try this again
you're everything i need, everything i'm not
so pull the trigger, give me one more shot
i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity

you love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
you lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
you promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
no matter what you say, i don't know truth from the lies
i helped you up, like i always do
i forgave you for your sins and i carried you through them
no matter how hard we fought, we always knew
you will bleed for me, and i will bleed for you

fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity

i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity
i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity
baby, we can float away 

i want to feel your wreckage
it's a firestorm
i'm falling like a loaded weapon
in your arms
paranoid, it might be reckless
no matter what i say
it's only going to steal your breath
and slip away

i don't want to dive in first
you don't want to hear these words
it's only gonna make it worse
you don't want to live that curse
you're telling me to keep my hope
'cause you've got a heart of gold
but maybe you should let me go
i'll love you through a periscope

you wear your heart so fearless
it's like it doesn't breathe
you push away my demons when they torture me
don't think that i can fight this pressure
pulling me underneath
it's like i've got the whole world tied around my feet
i don't want to dive in first
you don't want to hear these words
it's only going to make it worse
you don't want to live that curse
you're telling me to keep my hope
because you've got a heart of gold
but maybe you should let me go
i'll love you through a periscope

oh, through a periscope
oh, i-i'll love you through a periscope

oh, i-i'll love you through a periscope 

i am a man at war
and i am fighting for
all of the broken people

there's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
i don't need that shit
take my money, take my obsession

i just want to be heard
loud and clear are my words
coming from within man
tell them what you heard
it's about a revolution
in your heart and in your mind
you can find the conclusion
lifestyle and obsession
diamond rings get you nothin'
but a lifelong lesson
and your pocketbook stressin'
you're a slave to the system
working jobs that you hate
for that shit you don't need
it's too bad the world is based on greed
step back and see
stop thinking about yourself
start thinking about

there's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
i don't need that shit
take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
i don't need that shit
because everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
this reality is really just a fucked up dream
with the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
flip it inside out it's a big black hole
take your money burn it up like an asteroid
possessions, they are never going to fill the void
take it away and learn the best lesson
the heart, the soul, the life, the passion

there's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
i don't need that shit
take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
i don't need that shit
money, possessions, obsession

present yourself, press your clothes
comb your hair, clock in
you just can't win, just can't win
the things you own, own you. no!
take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
i don't need that shit
fuck your money, fuck your possessions, fuck your obsession
i don't need that shit
money, possession, obsession
i don't need that shit 

in the brightest hour of my darkest day
i realized what is wrong with me
can't get over you, can't get through to you
it's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
take these memories that are haunting me
of a paper man cut into shreds
by his own pair of scissors
he'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

sitting by a fire on a lonely night
hanging over from another good time
with another girl, little dirty girl
you should listen to this story of a life
you're my heroin
in this moment, i'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
all these drugs, all these women
i'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

one last kiss
before i go
dry your tears
it is time to let you go
one last kiss (one last kiss)
before i go (before i go)
dry your tears (dry your tears)
it is time to let you go

because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

one last kiss (one last kiss)
before i go (before i go)
dry your tears (dry your tears)
it is time to let you go
one last kiss

one last kiss 

it feels like, american dreams caught on fire
we're tearing down the white picket fences
a soldier bleeds, and a soldier dies
have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
i’m a son of it, fucked up from it
casualty of my family cause of it
we dare to dream, or live to die
reunited by the truth at the right time
something’s wrong here
or so it seems
'cause i’m not sleeping in

american dreams, american lies
we're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
so give me the truth
don't tell me your lies
'cause it's harder to breathe
when you're buried alive
by american dreams

with every bullet hole, there's a blood stain
another family that's struggling to keep sane
'cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
got us all wearing black every sunday
and i'm growing numb to the violence
sing along to the sounds of the sirens
we're trying to keep ourselves alive
but it's hard to get by when it feels like
something’s wrong here
or so it seems
'cause i'm not sleeping in
american dreams, american lies
we're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
so give me the truth

i'll follow you out of the dark
i tried it my way but i keep falling apart

all that i see, is the wickedness around me
i refuse to believe, the apocalypse inside of me
i can't even trust myself
i'm burning in my skin
standing at the gates of hell, but nobody will let me in

i'll follow you out of the dark
i tried it my way but i keep falling apart
i'll follow you, with all of my heart
i'm tired of my ways 'cause i keep falling, i'm falling apart

i stand here again
forsaken in a place
that feels like i can never win
i'm reaching for a saving grace
i can't even trust no one
i need to rise above
i don't think i'm good enough
to feel your perfect love
i'll follow you out of the dark

you never know when the enemy approaches

who do you trust?
tell me who do you trust?
i see 'em coming at us
but when the molotov drops
tell me who do you trust?

pull the knife out from my back
in the company of rich
i’ll take loyalty over royalty

locked up in my hurricane head
bloody knuckles paint the whole place red
straitjacket, straight tie me to the bed
all alone in a room full of misfits
cold blooded, cold hearted on a hit list
paranoid, struggling, i gotta kick this

everybody's looking at me, staring at me
everybody's looking at me

terrified, paralyzed
something's got a hold on me
let me go, i can't speak
i'm choking on my crooked teeth
wake me up if i sleep
cause i'm haunted by my dreams
crying out, but i can't speak
cause i'm choking on my, choking on my
crooked teeth
my crooked teeth

caved in, hyperventilating
cutting way too close to my skin
i feel the devil trying to creep back in
i feel the devil trying to creep back in
i'm possessed by the every day stress
flash back and i'm trying to forget
bloody hell, bloody knife, bloody mess
terrified, paralyzed
something's got a hold on me
let me go, i can't speak
i'm choking on my crooked teeth
wake me up if i sleep
cause i'm haunted by my dreams
crying out, but i can't speak
cause i'm choking on my, choking on my
crooked teeth

everybody's looking at me, staring at me
everybody's looking at me
everybody's looking at me, staring at me
everybody's looking at me

terrified, paralyzed
something's got a hold on me
let me go, i can't speak
i'm choking on my crooked teeth
wake me up if i sleep
cause i'm haunted by my dreams
crying out, but i can't speak
cause i'm choking on my, choking on my
crooked teeth
my crooked teeth 

in between a rock and a hard place
trying to find your way through the dark days
but you don't know how
you flipped the world upside down
and right now you don't wanna show it
'cause you don't think that anyone will notice
until you tell someone
you'll feel like you're the only one

and everybody says they're fine
but i know we're not alright
everybody says they're fine
but i know we're not alright

i know we're not alright
it's always darkest just before the light
i know your silence is a deadly sound
it's never easy when you're breaking down
but i'll be there when you come around
when you come around

face down in the days that we wasted
trying to find our way through the mazes
we could wait this out
or walk through that fire somehow
you trying to put together all the pieces
when you should turn around now and leave 'em
'cause you could lose your mind
trying to live back in time
and everybody says they're fine
but i know we're not alright
everybody says they're fine
but i know we're not alright

i know we're not alright
it's always darkest just before the light
i know your silence is a deadly sound
it's never easy when you're breaking down
but i'll be there when you come around
when you come around, yeah

i know we're not alright
it's always darkest just before the light
i know your silence is a deadly sound
it's never easy when you're breaking down
but i'll be there when you come around
when you come around
when you come around 

when i see her eyes
look into my eyes
then i realize that
she could see inside my head
so i close my eyes
thinking that i could hide
disassociate so i don't have to lose my head
this situation leads to agitation
will she cut me off?
will this be an amputation?

i don't know if i care
i'm the jerk
life's not fair
fighting all the time
this is out of line
she loves me not
loves me not
do you realize i won't compromise
she loves me not
loves me not

over the past five years
i have shed my tears
i have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
and until this day
she still swings my way
but it's sad to say sometimes
she says she loves me not
but i hesitate
to tell her i hate
this relationship
i want out today
this is over
i don't know if i care
i'm the jerk
life's not fair
fighting all the time
this is out of line
she loves me not
loves me not
do you realize i won't compromise
she loves me not
loves me not
life's not fair
i'm the jerk

line for line
rhyme for rhyme
sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
relationship is getting ill
piss drunk stupid
mad
on the real
could you feel what i feel
what's the deal girl?
tearing up each other's world
we should be in harmony
boy and girl
that is the promise we made
back in the day
we told each other things wouldn't be this way
i think we should work this out
it's all right baby we can scream and shout
i don't know if i care
i'm the jerk
life's not fair
fighting all the time
this is out of line
she loves me not
loves me not
do you realize i won't compromise
she loves me not
loves me not
life's not fair
life's not fair
life's not fair
i'm the jerk
life's not fair

she loves me not
loves me not 

i push you away until you beg me to stay
just for the thrill of the chase, you got me
fucked in the head from all the things that we did
but i will never forget i need you, my medication

have you ever had enough of it?
straight over it, sick of it, can't get ahold of it?
like a drug i need another fix
i'm a moth to a flame and i'll burn for the hell of it
battle scar 'cause i lost the fight
every time i take a breath it's like i'm losin' my life
fuck it, why am i so dysfunctional? so irrational?
i don't know what to do

so i push you away until you beg me to stay
just for the thrill of the chase, you got me intoxicated
fucked in the head from all the things that we did
but i will never forget i need you, my medication

are you living with the enemy?
are you affected by the devils that are tryna be a friend to me?
i'm in a place that i don't wanna be
but if i find a way to turn it all around would you follow me?
i'm alive but i lost the fight
it's like the better half of me is on the edge of the knife
cut it, why am i so emotional? uncontrollable?
i don't know what to do
so i push you away until you beg me to stay
just for the thrill of the chase, you got me intoxicated
fucked in the head from all the things that we did
but i will never forget i need you, my medication


i push you away until you beg me to stay
just for the thrill of the chase, you got me
fucked in the head from all the things that we did
but i will never forget i need you, my medication
my medication 

my words are weapons, in which i murder you with
please don't be scared, please do not turn your head
we are the future; the 21st century dyslexic, glue sniffing cyber sluts
with homicidal minds and handguns
we are insane, nothing will change

there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and, i will tiptoe down that line, but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am tripping down that tightrope
well, there is nothing to save me now, so i will not look down
and again, and again, and again, and it happens again
and again, and again

there's no beginning, there is no end
there is only change
progression backwards, is this where we are heading
take back your soul, forget your emptiness

there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and, i will tiptoe down that line, but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am tripping down that tightrope
well, there is nothing to save me now, so i will not look down
and again, and again, and again, and it happens again
and again, and again
i speak of madness, my heart and soul
i cry for people who have got no control
lets take our sanity, lets take compassion
and be responsible for every action
hell no, no how, no way, no way, no way, no how, no way, no how

there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and, i will tiptoe down that line, but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am tripping down that tightrope
well, there is nothing to save me now, so i will not look down
and again, and again, and again, and it happens again
and again, and again

down to the ground, all the way down, hidden in the dirt 

sick and tired of the bottom, need a better view
got me looking 'round my circle, is it bulletproof?
sometimes i think until i go insane
can i even trust somebody with the same last name? uh
times are crazy, people running from the light, ah
bad decisions, they can come around and bite ya
wish i could worry just a little less
wish i could quiet all the noise up inside my head

when it's over, it's over, it's over
it's over

i'm watching all the moves you make
can't turn back now, it's too late
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending
i'm counting all of your mistakes
caught up in a crossfire hurricane
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending
this is the start of the ending

i admit it took a second, but i realized
i been looking for a reason just to sever ties
only seeing what i wanna see
got me questioning the things that i started to believe
paranoid from the trauma in my life, uh
trust issues make it hard to sleep at night, uh
wish i could worry just a little less
wish i could quiet all the noise up inside my head
when it's over, it's over, it's over
it's over

i'm watching all the moves you make
can't turn back now, it's too late
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending
i'm counting all of your mistakes
caught up in a crossfire hurricane
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending

when it's over, it's over, it's over
when it's over, it's over, it's over
when it's over, it's over, it's over
it's over

i'm watching all the moves you make
can't turn back now, it's too late
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending
i'm counting all of your mistakes
caught up in a crossfire hurricane
checkmate, there's no defending
this is the start of the ending
this is the start of the ending
