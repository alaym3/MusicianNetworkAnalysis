it's another one of them ol' funky cypress hill things
you know what i'm sayin?
and it goes like this

hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
you're missin', the hoota of the funky buddha
eluder of your fucked up styles, i get wicked
so come on as cypress starts to kick it
'cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
by, hangin' out the window
with my magnum takin' out some putos
actin' kinda loco, i'm just another local
kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals

here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand

i'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
yo, because nothing is comin' from it
i'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
my gat straight hummin'
hummin'... comin' at cha...
and you know i had to gat ya

time for some action, just a fraction of friction
i got the clearance to run the interference
into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
sen got the gat, and i know that'll gat ya right
here's an example, just a little sample
how i could just kill a man!
one-time tried to come in my home
take my chrome, i said "yo, it's on
take cover son, or you're assed-out
how you like my chrome?" then i watched the rookie pass out
didn't have to blast out, but i did anyway...
hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(so i just killed a man!)

here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man

it's gonna be a long time before i finish
one of the many missions that i have to establish
to light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
and if you ain't down: bullshit!
say some punk try to get you for your auto
would you call the one-time, play the role model?
no, i think you play like a thug
next ya hear the shot of a magnum slug
hummin', comin' at cha
yeah ya know i'm gonna gat ya
so how do ya know where i'm at, when you haven't been where i've been?
understand where i'm comin' from?
when you're up on the hill in your bigger home
i'm out here riskin' my dome
just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
just to stay alive, ay yo i gotta say "fuck it"

here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you can't understand

all i wanted was a pepsi

— mira joven… si busco a alguien, que mueva producto. pero que lo mueva con madre…
— ¿pos sabes que compa? yo aquí, en el norte yo soy el que controla yo te lo puedo mover todo...

— pues bueno, aquí tenemos un negocio... vamos hacer hombres ricos… ¿tomamos no? del gusano…

*mexican yells*
— word up, tequila style
— cometelo!

eat the worm motherfucker
tequila spice, hot nice
feeling right, sipping on jose cuervo
down in tiajuana, mexico
thinking of the big score the night before
met the connect, who was impressively dressed
in high fabrics
with troops like beirut, up on the mezzanine
brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
it's all about the money, son
now that's the only reason
we came south of the border, to complete this work order
we gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
as god is my witness, we got ditches
for all you motherfuckin fake bitches
it all boils down to the business
nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
i fuckin blast you like frank castle, motherfucker!

tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die
so get the money nigga!
tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die
so get the money nigga!

i never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'til i met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
running for cover, the big bad wolf (woof), motherfucker
he was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
not like these fools who don't comprehend
you end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
you got that? getting your cup, i took a swig
the bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
just do what i say, and you'll be rich
and keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
always be aware of what's around you
they wanna down you, and fuckin' clown you
keep your shit in order the money won't stop
pretty soon you'll be on top

tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die
so get the money nigga!
tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die
so get the money nigga!

tequila sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
my, my, my, how time flies and goes by, surprise!
my mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
for my enemies who wanna murder me
eat the worm, mothafucka, while you burn, mothafucka
better kill me, don't let me return, mothafucka
trust no man, cause i'll be back, you understand?
with a plan, and my ice in hand, i want it all
i recall the words from jesus, you are the juice
better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
let these words stick, you better be ready to die
now take a fucking sip, caution it, but i never lie

tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die
so get the money nigga!
tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
realize we're all born to die

motherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls
hopin' that i fall but they can lick my balls
straight jacket, strap it
in a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it
distracted from all reality
now i'm let out on a minor technicality
(ahhh) they all fucked up now
cause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow
i'm lookin' for someone like me
livin' in my own world to my own degree
on the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties
lookin' at me and i feel shitty
a little tensed up gettin' hot
cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
i'm tryin' to find ways to cope
but i ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope

oh, what you missed this, you got to bear witness
catch a ho and another ho, merry christmas
yes i smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
i wrote shit for the blunted ones to approach it
forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
the herb is more than just a powerful potion
what's the commotion, yo i'm not joking around
people learning about, what they're smoking
my oven's on high, when i roast the quail
tell bill clinton to go and inhale
exhale, now you felt the funk of the thai
wanna feel the effects...

i want to get high–so high!
i want to get high–so high!
i want to get high–so high!
i want to get high–so high!

so you wanna be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin' up
looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
the rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
you got to go for the gusto but you don't know
about the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
and losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
shit's deep, 48 tracks
studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
but never will till he crosses over
still filling your head with fantasies
come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
you wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
and take shit from people who don't know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
and some can't pay the way
still trapped in what you rappin' about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
the route you took started collapsing
no fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

people see rockstars, younawhai'msayin?
but you still...try'na...get out more like, like everybody else
you know? it's a fun job, but it's still a job, you know?
save your money man, save your money too
hit single don't last very long, younawhai'msayin?
i mean...you're lucky in this game too
there's gon' be another cat comin' out
lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year i know this
they'll be a flipside, do whatchu you do
somebody'll try to spin off like some serious

you ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
you wanna look trendy in the bentley
be a snob and never act friendly
you wanna have big fame, let me explain
what happens to these stars and their big brains
first they get played like all damn day
long as you sell everything will be okay
then you get dissed by the media and fans
things never stay the same way they began
i heard that some never give full to the fullest
that's while fools end up dining on the bullet
think everything's fine in the big time
see me in my lex' with the chrome raised high
so you wanna roll far and live large?
it ain't all that goes with bein' a rock star

so you wanna be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody

my own son don't know me
i'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
but i thank god i'm with my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home
but only no radio or video didn't show me
no love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
so the record gets pushed by sony
i'm in the middle like monie
and the press say that my own people disown me
and the best way back is to keep your head straight
never inflate the cranium
they're too worried about them honies at the palladium
who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
till the next rock superstar with no shame
give him a year, he'll be right out the game
the same as the last one who came before him
gained fame, started gettin' ignored, i warned him
assured him, this ain't easy take it from weezy
sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
"assassins, assassins"

so you wanna be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

livin on fat pockets on full with the gat
rolling around nine deuce cadillac
still got my homies to watch my back
and they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
that's why some pigs and the kids come sweating they follow
a hollow point shell's hard to swallow (hey)
why wallow when you come to roll on?
i put the clip in the .45, bring your ass on
left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
my cribs surrounded, i'm about to get rushed, i brushed with death
how many shells stuffed in my closet where my big chrome things kept

when the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
when the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
when the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
when the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)

i told the boys get the sawed off glock and the rest of the gats
as i strapped on the bullet-proof vest
boom, i think i caught one to the chest
hot damn i didn't want to kill a man, shit
i still stand tall with the hill clan y'all better stand back
niggas bout ta fall, i'm coming out blasting like yosemite sam
got the cheese and the bread for the ham

when the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
when the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)

master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
how they want to pass the sentence
all because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
he missed, so now the nigga's hist
rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
i'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
and i'm handin' out beatdowns
i'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
and i'm handin' out beatdowns (get your face down!)
put me in chains, try to beat my brains
i can get out, but the grudge remains

sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
left hand on a forty, (puffin' on a blunt)
pumped my shotgun, (them niggas didn't jump)
lala la la lala la laaaaa...

kickin' that funky cypress hill shit
think i'll light another for the blunted to chill with
'cause i'm the chill one, known to get ill when
they stepped to the hill "what's up?", i had to kill one
now i'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
and they got me on lock down
headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
and they got me on lock down
livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
'cause i ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish

up on the hill fuckin' up at a party
tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
lala la la lala la laaa
look at all of those funeral cars
'cause i'ma

أستنى يا بي ريل، دا الواجب دا عليا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا

ونشرب سطفا حلوة ونسميها: كايروفورنيا

you're lookin' at the last of a dyin' breed
weeded up, please, speed it up
sittin' in the cali sun heated up
inked arm needled up
rocket style, don cheadle'd up
i put the fear of god in people, what
people lookin' at me sideways like i'm on the verge
like them on the purp that's blazed, i don't say a word
you don't wanna follow me, son
you ain't got the nerve
you just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd
got you paranoid in the paragraph when i paraphrase
got a pair of jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face
paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops
summoned by the grandmaster as he prepares to loose
temple doors open up, smoke billows out
now you hoping, what, for mercy? get your soul brilloed out
from another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood
even if another could, i wish a motherfucker would
clip it up or sip it up
listen, i prefer to trip it up
chem skippy ya'll bitter fucks
i can take a bigger chunk
and if i'm callin' dark figures up
don't make a move, they light triggers up
muggs, cut 'em up, chka-chka, what, huh
(this is for the-)

ever heard of me?
wicked as you ever seen
heavy on the throttle
smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen
under the cover of night
spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite
you got nothing on me, we some nomads
and my clan goes way back to the cro-mags
run together, unbreakable bloodline
too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
everything you ever heard of is not a myth
crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
which smell? it's the hash that we left around
smoke a whole pound when i feel myself comin' down
live how i wanna live and answer to no one
similar to the ways of the shogun
think again before you try and come and get me
or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot)

eat a bowl of dick up!! geeeyeah!!

"you know, people just don't...
people just don't see
how much work is really involved in this rap shit
i didn't know it, i didn't see it
i never saw it until i was actually in it
you really gotta be in it
to understand what it's like
but you always gotta
people always gotta see you smile
you always gotta put on that fake...
you know what i'm sayin'?
no matter what you just been through
shit has gotta be right"

so you wanna be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin' up
lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
to rock crowds, make money
chill with the honeys
sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
shit's funny
how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin' with it
never the less you got to go for the gusto
but you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
and losin' some of your peers
and losin' some of your self
through the years past, gone by
hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac and the brainiac
don't know how to act
shit's deep
48 tracks
studio gangsta mack
signed a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
but never will
'til he crosses over, still
fillin' your head with fantasies
come with me
show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
you wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who don't know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games
but the price of fame is high
and some can't pay to play
feelin' trapped in
what you rappin' about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
the route you took started collapsin'
no fans, no fame
no respect, no change
no women
and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

when you sign to a record label
you don't know you sign your life over
and these white boys don't care about you
'cause the minute you fall off
they'll find another noreaga
and they'll find another capone-n-noreaga
and they'll find another b-real
so you need to just keep
stack your chips up
do what you gotta do while you hot
and motherfuckin' get out the game
just stick to the drug game
it's even worse because in the drug game
if somebody jerk you
you can shoot 'em and kill 'em and
if you, in this game if somebody jerk you
you gotta be humble

no matter what you just been through
shit has gotta be right
you gotta approach people
you gotta be on the up and up
and everything's gotta be all good
when you see someone, slap hands with 'em
you know what i'm sayin'
give 'em a pound or whatever it is, you know
but you always gotta act like it ain't shit

so you wanna be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

my own son don't know me
sittin up in the hotel room lonely
but i thank god i'm wit my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home
but only no radio or videos
cuz they show me no love
the phony gotta hit the road slowly
so the record gets pushed by sony
i'm in the middle like monie
and the press say that
my own people disown me
and the best way back
is to keep your head straight
never inflate the cranium
your crew worried about them honies at the palladium
who just wanna cling on and swing on
and so on and go on and fall off
the hoes fall off
to the next rap superstar
wit no shame give him a year
and they'll be right out the game
the same as the last one
who came before him
gained fame
started gettin ignored
i warned him
assured him
this ain't easy take it from weezy
sleezy people wanna be cheesey
they talkin evil

so you wanna be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house, five cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rap superstar
and live large

wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (throw it up, holmes)
wave it around like you just don't care

it's time to exit that busta nigga
get your hands out your pockets and your finger on the trigger
let one fly, we don't die, we multiply
throw your set up in the sky
high as you can 'cause you can't fuck with this
nigga when i got the glock, you better duck quick
'cause i ain't havin' it
if you got your gat, you better start grabbin' it, i can handle it
soy numero uno mero mero
you know i run with muggs and the perro
firin' up that heater
when i'm throwin' up a set i got my nina millimeter
los scandalous, killafornia where i'm from
dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum
i'm buckin' on your ass, now you know where i'm from
dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum

throw your set in the air (c'mon)
wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (throw it up)
wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (throw your hood, holmes)
wave it around like you just don't care (go, c'mon on)
throw your set in the air (give it up)
wave it around like you just don't care

nigga, throw your set in the air, nigga, you know what i'm sayin'?
if you're scared, nigga, take your motherfuckin' punk ass to church
'cause where i'm from, nigga, on the east side
every motherfuckin' day is a job, nigga
gotta handle your business, 'cause if you don't
your motherfuckin' cap will get peeled back
and that ain't no bullshit
if you wanna test a nigga, bring it on nigga, you know what i'm sayin'?
throw your motherfuckin' set up in the air

let me take you to the dark side of the moon
tell mama that you won't be comin' home anytime soon
'cause i got you under my thumb, nigga, what set you claimin'?
better be the same set i'm claimin'
take a look around, countless amount of soldiers
when i'm chillin' on the east side of town
and it won't stop 'til i'm done
dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum

throw your set in the air (c'mon)
wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (throw it up)
wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (throw your hood up)
wave it around like you just don't care
throw your set in the air (give it up)
wave it around like you just don't care

yeah, that's right
straight givin' up the 'hood all day, fool
cypress hill, motherfucker, what you wanna do?
uh-huh, givin' my shit up in your face fool

"esto no me gusta. aquí la gente, la gente no sirve pa' mierda
aquí yo soy, yo soy capitán pingaloca. y to' mundo aquí
me sirve a mi o va pa'l carajo. oye... revolución compadre!"

in the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
mc's in the game runnin for the status
take a few seconds to review the crews
sittin on top is the hill lookin over you
killa hill niggas, cream in my dream
cookin up a scheme for all them big bank figures
the world is yours, but it can be mine and his
bust you out the frame, i don't give a fuck who it is
number one mission, opposition
get thrown sent home in dead position
in the casket, best wishes
at the bottom of the lake, sleepin with the fishes
full out search for the body
of the mc's who be comin to disrupt the party
no wins, no ends, no way
that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
sabas get blasted for words he packaged
peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
power-u niggas talkin fast like puerto ricans
what you seekin, son i catch cream like dominicans
last mohican, lyrics i'm speakin, wild as indians
tomahawk - shaolin slang, the violent talk
upstate new york, where chumps get extorted for newports
what you thought?

ease back, ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back, ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back, ease back
ease back, ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again

"y ya está dicho. todos los que no les guste mi 'rebote' van a murir
yo le voy a meter una bala a la cabeza a cualquier maricón
que no me persiga a mi a la 'singadapuerta'. ¡oye, hijo de puta!
¡quiero quemarte la cara!"

words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
i'm takin these cannabis plants yo for grant'
exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
from a dune in the desert mega-babylon pleasure
comin out the domepiece, smell my aroma
warrior nomad, put you in a coma
comma, llama, smash-crashin your armor
drama, i'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
here is where i dwell at the gates o' hell
it ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
and if not yo, credentials are essential
i see reality, few things surroundin me
three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
not frontin or braggin, hundred percent red dragon
pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
the globe-trotter, call me meadowlark lemon
five part criminal, two part felon

- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back, ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back.. ease back..
ease back, ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger
- that i'm ever gonna let ya come back again
ease back or i squeeze up on the trigger..

"esto es muy antiguo. esta dicho! aquí, la revolución! no se va a ver por televisión
todos los maricones del norte, que los voy a matar yo
va a ser aquí en nuestro país. y todos los 'singao masones'
que están chingando el mundo. también, van a ver la muerte
de ellos mismos, en las manos de ellos. un día, va a ser sangre
mucha sangre. la peste de los cuerpos muertos, van a oír
que se va a hueler hasta los estados unidos, estos cabrones
que con la democracia, que nos 'tan chingando en el culo
todos son unos mismos cabrones..."
