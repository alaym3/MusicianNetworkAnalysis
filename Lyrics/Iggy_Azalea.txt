you used to be everything, now that mean nothing
thought this was poker with the cards up, but we were bluffing
i miss you, but pride won't let me tell you
thought that we had all the time
but i'm guessing that plans fell through
yeah, we fell off, i won't ask you to climb back
i paid twenty for that rolly, i just want my time back
was wrong too but i see it now that you don't give a damn
i got you tatted, you took off before the ink dried on my hands
i was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell
i lied, tried to be perfect and i played myself
and it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that
'cause you say you love me, but real love don't work like that
the truth is, i left a piece of me in a piece i gave you
and i tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
said i crack a smile when things get painful
remembering the moments when i used to da-date you

rolex's don't tick-tock
but damn it, baby, my time costs
and damn it, baby, my time is money
so i need payback for all the time lost
i need payback for all the time lost
said, i need payback for all the time lost
damn it, baby, my time costs
so i need payback for all the time lost

say that you love me, i say that you're lying
'cause i said we could work on it, you said "let's leave it behind"
couldn't put together the picture i paint in my mind
so how i see you now, insulting me is wasting my time
but we live and learn and learn and love and let go
'cause if we stay in this, then we might make it worse than before
another hard lesson, stressing, taking personal notes
remember sweet nothings, like baby, what's the purpose in those?
both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that
but sometimes in love, it just get like that
used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back
you know, cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that
and for all of y'all watching, i hope that this entertain you
and that you enjoyed this song that i sang you
'cause i'm still here laughing when it get painful
remembering the moments when i used to da-date you

rolex's don't tick-tock
but damn it, baby, my time costs
and damn it, baby, my time is money
so i need payback for all the time lost
i need payback for all the time lost
said, i need payback for all the time lost
damn it, baby, my time costs
so i need payback for all the time lost
rolex's don't tick-tock
but damn it, baby, my time costs
and damn it, baby, my time is money
so i need payback for all the time lost

yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
that's the last thing we wanna do
we don't wanna scare anybody

never said it was fair, but still i never knew fear
not in a million years could you tell me that i'd be here
i just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
from country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
i heard that the top is lonely, i wonder if it's the truth
so i'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now i'm shining, could be blinding
ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
this that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
i'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it

not where i wanna be, but i'm far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls, i don't answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
ain't no going back now
don't know where i'm at now
ain't no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

i've been counted out, i've been stepped on
i was wide awake and got slept on
i had everything and then lost it
worked my ass off, i'm exhausted
all this talking about me, just talk about me
i'm here now, they can't walk around me
i'm dedicated, flow elevated
tell every hater hope you never play it, said i'll never make it
i'm celebrating and i'm never quitting, no resignation
i took desperate measures out of desperation
i'm the fresh face with no expiration
i know pressure make diamonds so i threw 'em off in this chain
and when it's all on the line, i'm who you want in the game
cause i'm gon' get it and that's for sure
can't be like y'all, that's a no-go
international while y'all local, got this locked up just like po-po
every beat get ate, that's ocho
won't lose, oh, no, that's yoko
been up and down like low lows
still make my own on my solo
had to be here to believe it
think like winners to perceive it
had to let you know that i mean it
if i speak it and say keep it
this flow, that's genius
just think about it, what i think about it?
if i didn't live it, won't ink about it
married to the money, put a ring around it, what?

not where i wanna be, but i'm far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls, i don't answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
ain't no going back now
don't know where i'm at now
ain't no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

and everything ain't the way i planned it
but when the smoke clears, i'm the last standing
this lifestyle can be so demanding
but i take off like a plane and ain't never landing

not where i wanna be, but i'm far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls, i don't answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
ain't no going back now
don't know where i'm at now
ain't no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

ain't no going back now
ain't no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone
