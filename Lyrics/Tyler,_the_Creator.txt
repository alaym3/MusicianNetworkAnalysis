really, boy? posers looking silly, boy
i'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than tity boi
not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is diddy riese
na'kel smith, transworld page 64
poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
i'm harder than dj khaled playing the fucking quiet game
the fuck am i saying? tyler's not even a violent name
about as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
but he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
god damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
and my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
see y'all niggas tripping, man
look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
saying i hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs
look at that mom who thinks i'm evil, hold that grudge against me
though i'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
but talk is money, i said, "hi," i guess i bought him some time
look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
they thought i wasn't fair until i threw a carnival, huh?
but then again, i'm an atheist that just worships satan
and it's probably why i'm not getting no fucking album placements
and mtv could suck my dick, and i ain't fuckin' playing
bruh, they never played it, i just won shit for they fucking ratings
"analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
all the "tron cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
but what about me, bitch? i'm getting sick of complaints
but i don't hate it when i'm taking daily trips to the bank
oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what i think?
my fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
fuck buying studio time, i'ma go purchase a shrink
record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
you niggas gon' give me mine, i don't have plenty time
flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
you niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
you niggas gon' give me mine, i don't have plenty time
flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
you niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

this shit just like the nights i look forward to not remembering
so much for being sober, i hope that you can forgive me
but momma, i'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
all i’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
that the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)
or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
so maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (i'll show you)
malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
all of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, i got one!)
dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
brother the pigeons is us
bid you goodnight and good luck
(oh, shut the fuck up!)
(gunshot)

samuel's here! where's wolf? fucking faggot. salem was mine, bitch! was that good enough, you fucking pussy?

la, la, la, la, la, la, la
aaaahhh!

satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (wolf gang!)
wolves, i know you heard of us, we're murderers
and young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (bitch!)
you niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
instead, i rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
while you niggas stacking bread, i can stack a couple dead
bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
i'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
i fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
then proceed to sat her down when i go splatter in her chatterbox
atta boy, odd future, you're not in our categore
torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
this the type of shit that make a chris brown want to kick a whore
that make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (umbrella)
i hate this, screaming, "fuck patience!"
got a nigga shaking like the calmest, fucking haitian
after chronic masturbation, asking where mary kate went
i want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
i make this damn bullwinkle the red moose
game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
she running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
until i accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
honey on that topping when i stuff you in my system
rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome
you got a fucking death wish? i'm a genie, it'll get done
nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
with a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
bitch, i'm tyler, the creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
in the jeeps where the wolf gang rides around deeper
take her to ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the berrics
stare at steve, say it costs ten to fuck eric
put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like derek
satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
and snuff and sniff, and now that michael jackson's trying to suck our dick
hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the keke palmer
they will never catch him or catch up
they asked me what it was, i told them fuckers it was ketchup
nutty like my chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
odd future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah (wolf gang)
this the type of shit that make children break in apartments
when you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(i hate you!) starve her 'til i carve her then i shove her in the rover
where i cut her like a barber with a parkinson's disorder
store her in a portable freezer with me to portland
catch me with a bunch of fucking mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
i'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
cause i'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with jesus' daughter
(fuck mary) i'm awesome, and i fuck dolphins
sicker than the starving nigerian kids barfing
odd future wolf gang nazi bar mitzvah
with your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
evident that i'm the shit, i'm the pooh like tigger dick
i got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah bob, this nigga’s sick"
animal safari, if i offend you i'm sorry
because i'm the blackest skinhead since india arie
i don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
i said fuck coke and now i'm snorting hitler's ashes
i plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
being the only bastard in a box logo casket
rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob sagets
in some kanye west glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

what the fuck?
i... i'm speechless, that was... fuck
shit, tyler, you're gonna need some help
i'm not a... fuck it, different subject
how's that girl you were telling me about?

swag, 2011

and shoot through wayne lapierre's hair with a crucifix

a little jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
little redtube, fuck lotion, i don't need lube, dry fist suits me (yeah)
up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
the shit's kind of disgusting
fap time and before i flatline
clancy chimes in my room and catch me

yeah, sorry, i needed something
clean that shit up, we're going to the office!
fuck

yo, fuck 2dopeboyz and fuck nah right
and any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
fuck you post-drake-ass cliche-jerking, la-slauson rapping
fuck-nigga-ass hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

well, tyler, hi, i'm dr. tc and um, i'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
so, just tell me something about yourself...
well, look, if, if you don't talk, i mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

this is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
some food for thought? this food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
my father's dead, well i don't know, we'll never fucking meet
i cut my wrist and play piano cause i'm so depressed
somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
this meeting just begun, nigga i'm satan's son

my mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
that i got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
are much important, i'm getting angrier while recording
i'm feeling like the bulls, i've got a gang of wolves
odd future is children that's fucked up in they mental
simple, but probably not, fuck them

i'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
drunk white girls: the only way i'll get my dick sucked
suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
cause this album pack enough evil
that you can't fit inside a jansport
go to school with this

i go from ap to jc inside a fucking week
waking up with random girls like "yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
i stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
every time i walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
no to drugs, i never spark it, i used to be bullied for honor classes
by those that were slow as molasses
take this shit to school

raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
she still don't know i made sarah to strangle her
not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a wrangler
all because she said no to homecoming, demons running
inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
i'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

i wear green hats because i'm fortunately lucky
"fuck me," the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
with this state of mind, big moves, max keeble
i'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
a fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

i graduated without honors or fucking father
he died (i'm so sorry) no bitch, don't even fucking bother
i wanted a brother, my mother i told her
but instead i got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
so both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
that's having our brains racing like dayton
wearing some fucking heelys

i know you fucking feel me, i want to fucking kill me
but times i'm so serious, you think i'm silly
i'm doing big style willy couldn't touch 11
seven, what's religion nigga? i am legend
i roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
i created o.f. cause i feel we're more talented
than 40 year old rappers talking about gucci
when they have kids they haven't seen in years
impressing their peers
with the same problem, the only way to solve them
is to go to father's day convention with a gold revolver
life's a salad, i'm a toss it, eat that shit up, rick ross it
shit it out, bag it up, sell it, i'm so damn rebellious
cause my mother let me do what i want
she wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
the shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
my father didn't give a fuck, so it's something i inherit
my mom is all i have so it's never meet the parents
when danielle or milan decide to fucking share
this confused boy, i wanna hug, oy
i’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
i'm bad milk, drink it

whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
uh, who knows i might feel as i'm evaluating

my wrist is all red from the cutter
dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
is never that's equivalent to me and sarah
well that's not her fucking name, but i think this shit is clever
my niggas wanna know if i'm fucking, if i'm kissing
but i'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
with a tear they try to tell me but i never listen
'cause i don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
hopefully they see the talent i carry just like jimmy
losers can never win me, you can never offend me
my goal in life is a grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
ceremony with all my homies, i'm suicidal
this my zombie circus, i hope the majors heard this
fuck a deal, i just want my father's email
so i can tell him how much i fucking hate him in detail

wow, umm
so, tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
what would you tell him?

comparing scars before dinner
jump off the roof into the mirror
felt like summer to my december
was it my august? shit, i don't remember
(two, three, go)
i know my temperature was set
you finally flew south
the bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
at least i had it (uh)
instead of never
or maybe i'm too dramatic
(two, three, go)

whether it's rain or shine, i know i'm fine for now
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, oh, gone
(two, three, go)
or maybe it's just a dream that i can't seem to wake up from
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, gone

gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

i know love is, is all i got
i just hope to god she got good taste
could put you on some shit you never seen
could play a couple songs that you could dance to
i hope you know she can't compete with me

whether it's rain or shine, i know i'm fine for now
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, oh, gone
or maybe it's just a dream that i can't seem to wake up from
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, oh, gone

you kept me goin', the band-aid is falling off now (keep)
you kept me goin', the band-aid is falling off now (keep)
you keep me goin', the band-aid is falling off now (gone, gone, gone)
going away, and now i'm scarred for life

my love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)
my love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone

(my love is gone)
ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
emotion, feel dumbo
ask me where my love go
that bitch walked outside the front door
(my love is gone)
knock, knock, knock, knock
i'm not shocked, i brought this on me
it's my fault, you gon' leave
lesson taught, see
the weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
my stupid ass brought umbrellas
i got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
is drenched in sweat and delusion because i jet to conclusions
you got your thing, i got nothing but memories
i know your secrets, nigga (yeah)
i'm not bitter or nothing, i understand that
everybody making a choice according to plan and
we had two different blueprints, but understood influence
you opened up early on, i thought i had a permit
you started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
i'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
you never lived in your truth, i'm just happy i lived in it
but i finally found peace, so peace
(want me do it over? everything)

i hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
it really does, it crushes your soul


thank you for the love
thank you for the joy
but i don't ever wanna fall in love again
thank you for the time
thank you for your mind, mind
but i don't ever wanna fall in love again

(got my eye)
i said go, go

thank you for the love
thank you for the joy

part 1 - fucking young

day that i met you, girl
i knew that it was something special
but i couldn't put my finger on it (fuck, i can't sing, whatever, look)
we met through mutual friends (mutual friends)
and this is where the story and confusion began
'cause i was at nirvana but i had to pretend that i wasn't

there go the policeman, knocking at my door
do i leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
or do i answer real confused like, "i don't know"? (i don't know)
now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
she kissed my hand a couple times, facetime when we're bored
there's nobody at the door, man, i'm so paranoid
fuck, 'cause

'cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
and when temptation calls my phone, i never pick up
and girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
and this is more than a crush, i just might be in love

a six-year (difference)
is a ten year (sentence)
and with the (pigment) on my skin
i don't want to be another (statistic)
you bring me (joy, joy, joy, joy)
and you fill a void that was once missing
and (i can say i'm in love)

there go the policeman, knocking at my door
do i leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
or do i answer real confused like, "i don't know"? (i don't know)
now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
she kissed my hand a couple times, facetime when we're bored
there's nobody at the door, man, i'm so paranoid
fuck, 'cause

'cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
and when temptation calls my phone, i never pick up
and girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
and this is more than a crush, i just might be in love

when you're 35, i'll be 41, and when i'm 27, you'll be 21
yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
i'll probably run, 'cause i'm fucking terrified
yo this is dumb, you should find someone else
i'm not the one for you, shit, i'm still growing up by myself
and mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'cause if they see you with t, they'll think t needs some help
so when you mention "hang," i'm thinking about a tree and a belt
and i don't want no relation, shit no relation
ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
and splatter on me like my dick in my hand
what? i'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
because i found a goose that i like, but i'm still running off
she gon' want a nest, that's why i cannot get fucking caught
that's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
but i found my wings, fuck

(but you're too fucking young)
i really like you
i don't know what to do
(and when temptation calls, i never pick up
and girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
funny thing about this is
by the time you hear this
it won't even matter
i'll be in the clear, haha
it's t and uncle charlie!
but you're too young
but you're too young
but you're too young
part 2 - perfect

boy i know, that we could be more
than just friends, but you're scared
boy i know, that we could be more
than just friends, but you're scared (i know)

i know that there could be
somethin' for you and me
what's your philosophy?
you're scared, scared
and i’ll exit and wait a while
just say the word girl
can't you see the answers are all there
but i'm just too blind to see
you and i are cut from different fabric
i wanna rock, i wanna rock with you girl
don't be too material to see
but i'm just too blind to see
somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

but you're too fuckin' young
and girl, i know that you're the one for me
and it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
and, girl, i know that you're the one for me
and it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'cause you're too fuckin' young
and, girl, i know that you're the one
that you're the one, for me
'cause you're too fuckin' young
and, girl, i know that you're the one for me, yeah

click-click 
(what the fuck was that?)

you wouldn't do that tyler, kill yourself or anyone. you don't even have the balls to begin with. what you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. so, tell me what's been going on

i'm not a fucking role model (i know this)
i'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
since kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
these mothafuckas think i'm 'sposed to live up to something? shit
i'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
but getting more pussy 'cause i tell bitches i'm wood harris (as you should)
philly to paris, i'm getting these weird stares
at skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
he still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
but that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, i got over it
and a couple bucks in my pocket, so now i could go buy
a couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking
them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
bastard intro, how the fuck i'm gonna top that?

"tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"okay, you guys caught me, i'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, i lied"
"you know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"i try too hard, huh?"
"no, you don't"

made a couple thou' and i just don't know what to buy yet
the 'preme shit is free and i don't drink, so fuck a wine set
nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
i'm fucked in the head, i lost my mind with my virginity
oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
cause i'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
i'm the star of the group (yeah)
so no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(bastard was good though) what you think i record it for?
to have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
like i didn't make "parade" or "inglorious"
cause i'm too scared to tell my friends the way i really fucking feel?
of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
in the tombs of lara croft, i'm getting pissed off (i bet)
message boards are on my dick, i need a pissing waiver (here)
let me bust one in they mouth, i know they full of flavor

"can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? why they got to fucking hate?"
"i think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you tyler, you have to believe that."
"i don't even skate anymore, i'm too fucking busy, i can barely kickflip now."
"why? why is that? do you not have any free time when you're at  home?"
"what the fuck you mean i'm not talented? you see the shit that i've been doing?"
"i have, i mean you're a great person."
"i mean, i'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, i'm pretty cool, right?"

people excited, thinking shit is so tight (for what?)
getting co-signs from rappers that i don't even like
what the fuck you want me to do? start to gobble his mic?
and start jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (no...)
fuck that, (yeah) these niggas ain't fucking with me
cause i don't listen to the immortal of tech-of-the-nique
and all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
on the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
i'd rather listen to badu and pusha the t
and some waka flocka flame instead (i love that shit) of that real hip hop
that's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
everything that we, wolf gang, has ever released
but they don't get it, (they don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
the nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
but they do not have the mindset that's same as him
i'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

"it is, but tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"i'm not homophobic."
"i mean, i don't think you are but..."
"faggot."
"alright, well, since the last time we..."
"the fuck is a good performance? i get on stage and i have as much fun as i can."
"i mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. but your twitter posts, just.. i mean, they're really random and it's add."
"who doesn't have add..? well, i don't."
"i mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"i wish thebe was here."

therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
they don't want to fuck with me cause i do not fuck with religion
you see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
here, put this middle finger in your ear (i'd rather not)
when someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (what?) his ak-47
at 47 kids, i don't wanna see my name mentioned
(i don't think anyone's going to men—i don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
college wasn't working and i wasn't working
so i was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
but i was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
cause the four days that i went, i wasn't learning shit (i mean, you...)
now i'm living dreams that i wanted since eight
and can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(i mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, i mean, i...)
they claim the shit i say is just wrong
like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
i'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
my life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
and when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(so, what are you saying, take advantage?
i mean, you've been doing pretty good, i've seen that)
i still live in my grandma's house
sell out a fucking show in london just to end up on couches
i hate my fucking life, but when i make that announcement
my hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
and then i am confused if i want in or just out
my friends really think i'm playing when i say i need counseling
i sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
and shout loud inside, sometimes i just want to die (no, you don't)
odd future came from the bottom
and it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(i believe you) all you fucking lames don't have to like me
the devil doesn't wear prada, i'm clearly in a fucking white tee

whoa, umm, alright, uh, so you was telling me you went to new york...
