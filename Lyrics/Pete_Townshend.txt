let my love open the door
let my love open the door
to your heart

(give blood) but you may find that blood is not enough
(give blood) and there are some who'll say it's not enough
(give blood) but don't expect to ever see reward
(give blood) you can give it all but still you're asked for more
(give blood) but it could cost more than your dignity
(give blood) parade your pallor in inequity
(give blood) they will cry and say they're in your debt
(give blood) but then they'll sigh and they will soon forget
(we're heading for the day of reckoning, i'm telling ya. it's all building up to something, something that can only be redeemed with fire.)
give love and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers
(give blood) but you may find that blood is not enough
(give blood) and there are some who'll say it's not enough
(give blood) but don't expect to ever see reward
(give blood) you can give it all but still you'll be asked for more
so give love and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers
give love, give love and keep blood between brothers
give your love and keep blood between brothers
give your love and keep blood between brothers
give love, give love, give love and keep blood between brothers
give love, your love, and keep blood between brothers
give love and keep blood between brothers

tough boys

rough toys
under the sheets
nobody knows her

tough boys

i wanna bite and kiss you
i wanna see what i can find
tough kids
take a bottle of wine
when your deal is broken
ten quid
she's so easy to find
not a word is spoken
rough boys

i feel pretty blissed here
tough boy

gonna get inside your bitter mind
i wanna see what i can find
rough boys

we can't be seen together
tough kids
what can i do?
i'm so pale and weedy
rough fits
in my hush puppy shoes
but i'm still pleading
pleading, bleeding, fining, whining, shining
i wanna see what i can find
tough boys

slit skirts
i was just thirty-four years old and i was still wandering in a haze
i was wondering why everyone i met seemed like they were
lost in a maze
i don't know why i thought i should have some kind of
divine right to the blues
it's sympathy not tears people need when they're the
front page sad news
the incense burned away and the stench began to rise
and lovers now estranged avoided catching each others' eyes
and girls who lost their children cursed the men who fit the coil
and men not fit for marriage took their refuge in the oil
no one respects the flame quite like the fool who's badly burned
from all this you'd imagine that there must be something learned
slit skirts, jeanie never wears those slit skirts
i don't ever wear no ripped shirts
can't pretend that growing older never hurts
knee pants, jeanie never wears no knee pants
have to be so drunk to try a new dance
so afraid of every new romance
slit skirts, slit skirt
jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
she wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt
slit skirts, slit skirt
jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
she wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt
romance, romance, why aren't we thinking up romance?
why can't we drink it up true heart romance
just need a brief new romance
let me tell you some more about myself, you know i'm sitting at home just now
the big events of the day are passed and the late tv shows have come around
i'm number one in the home team, but i still feel unfulfilled
a silent voice in her broken heart complaining that i'm unskilled
and i know that when she thinks of me, she thinks of me as him
but, unlike me, she don't work off her frustration in the gym
recriminations fester and the past can never change
a woman's expectations run from both ends of the range
once she walked with untamed lovers' face between her legs
now he's cooled and stifled and it's she who has to beg
slit skirts, jeanie never wears those slit skirts
and i don't ever wear no ripped shirts
can't pretend that growing older never hurts
knee pants, jeanie never wears no knee pants
we have to be so drunk to try a new dance
so afraid of every new romance
slit skirts, slit skirt
jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
she wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt
slit skirts, slit skirt
jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
she wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt
romance, romance, why aren't we thinking up romance?
why can't we drink it up true heart romance
just need a brief new romance

empty glass
why was i born today
life is useless like ecclesiastes say
i never had a chance
but opportunity's now in my hands
i stand with my guitar
all i need's a mirror
then i'm a star
i'm so sick of dud tv
next time you switch on
you might see me...oh.what a thrill for you
i've been there and gone there
i've lived there and bummed there
i've spinned there, i gave there
i drank there and i slaved there
i've had enough of the way things been done
every man on a razors edge
someone has used us to kill with the same gun
killing each other by driving a wedge
my life's a mess i wait for you to pass
i stand here at the bar, i hold an empty glass
why was i born today
life is useless like ecclesiastes say
i didn't get a chance
opportunity's in my hand
i stand with my guitar
all i need's a mirror
then i'm a star
i'm so sick of dud tv
next time you switch on
you might see me...
i've been there and gone there
i've lived there and bummed there
i've spinned there, i gave there
i drank there and i slaved there
i've had enough of the way things have been done
every man on a razors edge
someone has used us to shoot with the same gun
we where killing each other by driving a wedge
my life's a mess i wait for you to pass
i stand here at the bar, i hold an empty glass
don't worry smile and dance
you just can work life out
don't let down moods entrance you
take the wine and shout
my life's a mess i wait for you to pass
i stand here at the bar, i hold an empty glass

there once was a note pure and easy
playing so free like a breathe rippling by
the note is eternal
i hear it, it sees me
forever we blend as forever we die

i listened and i heard music in a word
and words when you played your guitar
the noise that i was hearing was a million people cheering
and a child flew past me riding in a star

as people assemble
civilization is trying to find a new way to die
but killing is really merely scene changer
all men are bored with other men's lives

i listened and i heard music in a word
and words when you played your guitar
the noise that i was hearing was a million people cheering
and a child flew past me riding in a star

we all know success when we all find our own dream
and our love is enough to knock down any wall
and the future's been seen as men try to realize
the simple secret of the note in us all
in us all


i listened and i heard music in a word
and words when you played your guitar
the noise that i was hearing was a million people cheering
and a child flew past me riding in a star

today is the day the sound curdles mountains
flowing and blowing each man in its wake
destroying itself in the end with vibration
there's nothing on earth it's challenge can take

accepting one note
accepting one note pure and easy
playing so free like breath rippling by
accepting one note
accepting one note

listen
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)
there once was a note - listen (pure and easy)

out here in the fields
i fight for my meals
i get my back into my living
i don't need to fight
to prove i'm right
i don't need to be forgiven
my kids ain't gonna break my heart
my greed ain't gonna spoil their part
this land just has to be a new one
i'm gonna tan underneath a new sun
don't cry
don't raise your eye
it's only teenage wasteland
don't have the latest suit
the long grass is my fruit
i am nearly an ordinary man
the family is free
to do just as they please
we all sleep together in the caravan
hey you!
don't walk on the turnips!
my lord
when will they ever learn it?
look there
nations of travelling children
no where to go
to escape the chill wind
don't cry
don't raise your eye
it's only teenage wasteland
my kids ain't gonna break my heart
my greed ain't gonna spoil their part
this land just has to be a new one
i'm gonna tan underneath a new sun
sally, take my hand
travel south cross land
put out the fire
and don't look past my shoulder
the exodus is here
the happy ones are near
let's get home
before we get older
teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland
it's only teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland
it's only teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland
it's only teenage wasteland
they're all wasted!

two dozen other dirty lovers
must be a sucker for it
cry, cry, but i don't need my mother
just hold my hand while i come to a decision on it
sooner or later
your legs give way, you hit the ground
save it for later
don't run away and let me down
sooner or later
you hit the deck, you get found out
save it for later
don't run away and let me down, you let me down
you run away, run away, let me down, run away
black air and seven seas all rotten through
but what can you do?
i don't know how i'm meant to act with all of you lot
sometimes i don't try
i just now, now, now, now, now...
sooner or later
your legs give way, you hit the ground
save it for later
don't run away and let me down
sooner or later
you hit the deck, you get found out
save it for later
don't run away and let me down, you let me down
run away, run away and let me down
why don't you hold me
why don't you hold me and kiss me now
why don't you just hold me
why don't you hold me and kiss me now
two dozen other stupid reasons
why we should suffer all this
don't bother trying to explain them
just hold my hand while i come to a decision on this
sooner or later
your legs give way, you hit the ground
save it for later
don't run away and let me down
sooner or later
you hit the deck, you get found out
save it for later
don't run away and let me down, you let me down
run away, run away, run away and run away and let me down

run away, run away, run away, run away and let me down
run away, run away and let me down
run away, run away and let me down
run away, run away and let me down
run away, run away and let me down

i've looked under chairs
i've looked under tables
i've tried to find the key
to fifty million fables
they call me the seeker
i've been searching low and high
i won't get to get what i'm after
till the day i die
i asked bobby dylan
i asked the beatles
i asked timothy leary
but he couldn't help me either
they call me the seeker
i've been searching low and high
i won't get to get what i'm after
till the day i die
people tend to hate me
'cause i never smile
as i ransack their homes
they want to shake my hand
focusing on nowhere
investigating miles
i'm a seeker
i'm a really desperate man
i won't get to get what i'm after
till the day i die
i learned how to raise my voice in anger
yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
i'm happy when life's good
and when it's bad i cry
i've got values but i don't know how or why
i'm looking for me
you're looking for you
we're looking in at each other
and we don't know what to do
they call me the seeker
i've been searching low and high
i won't get to get what i'm after
till the day i die

let's see action. let's see people
let's see freedom. let's see who cares
take me with you. when you leave me
and my shell behind us there
i have learned it. known who burned me
avatar has warmed my feet
take me with you. let me see you
time and life can meet
rumor has it. minds are open
then rumors fill them up with lies
future passing. nothing lasting
i try to scream, 'cause nothing dies
nothing is everything
everything is nothing is
please the people, audiences
break the fences, nothing is
let's see action. let's see people
let's see freedom. in the air
let's see action. let's see people
let's be free. let's see who cares

let's be free. let's see who cares
give me a drink boy wash my feet
i'm so tired of running from my own heat
take this package and here's what you do
gonna get this information through
i don't know where i'm going
i don't know what i need
but i'll get to where i'm gonna end up
and that's alright by me
i've been running from side to side
now i know for sure that both sides lied
it's got so hard but we gotta keep trying
i can't stand to see my people crying
i don't know where i'm going
i don't know what i need
but i'll get to where i'm gonna end up
and that's alright by me
(ad libs)

i remember being richer than a king
the minutes of the day were golden
i recall that when the joint passed 'round
my body felt a little colder
but now i'm like a sewer channel
running lime and scag
let me get at the master panel
let me at my stack
the sea refuses no river
and right now
this river's banks are blown
the sea refuses no river
whether stinking and rank
or red from the tank
whether pure as a spring
there's no damn thing stops the poem
the sea refuses no river
and this river is homeward flowing
i have seen a trace of strain
in other's eyes, not spoken
i must admit that i enjoyed their pain
but this time it's me that's broken
i demand for you and his
this must be the time
when we decide what freedom is
turn water into wine
for the sea refuses no river
we're polluted now
but in our hearts still clean
the sea refuses no river
we tried not to age
but time had it's rage
we're washed over the stones
from babies into clones of the mean
the sea won't refuse this muddy river
won't deny the sulfurous stream
there was a fool in a dressing robe
riding out the twilight hour
lonely and cold in an empty home
trying to assess his power
but now he's like a stream in flood
swollen by the storm
he doesn't care if he sheds his blood
let him be reborn
the sea refuses no river
remember that
when the beggar buys a round
the sea refuses no river
and rain fills the gutters
no time for stutters
this is our chance
to sing and to dance and to clown
the sea refuses no river
and rivers were sprung to drown
the sea refuses no river
no pecking code
respected for the damned
the sea refuses no river
whether starving and ill
or strung on some pill
just 'cos you own the land
there's no unique hand plugs the dam
the sea refuses no river
and the river is where i am
the river is where i am

i was always here in the silence
but i was never under your eye
gather up your love in some wiseness
for every memory shall always survive
and you will see me
i am an animal
my teeth are sharp, and my mouth is full
and the passion is so strong
when i'm alone, loneliness will change me
i am a vegetable
i get my body badly pulled
and i'm rooted to the spot
nothing will rearrange me
i'm looking back, and i can't see the past
anymore, so hazy
i'm on a track, and i'm travelling so fast
oh, for sure i'm crazy
i am a human being
and i don't believe all the things i'm seeing
i've got nowhere to hide anymore
i'm losing my way
i am an angel
i booked in here, i came straight from hell
and i don't know how to lie anymore
i'm boozing to pray
i'm looking back, and i can't see the past
anymore, so hazy
i'm on a track, and i'm travelling so fast
oh, for sure i'm crazy
i was always here in the silence
but i was never under your eye
gather up your love in some wiseness
every memory shall always survive
and you will see me
i will be immersed
queen of the fucking universe
and i don't know what i have anymore
anymore than you do
i am a nothing king
been right around on a golden ring
i don't know where you are anymore
i've got no clue
i'm looking back, and i can't see the past
anymore, so hazy
i'm on a track, and i'm travelling so fast
oh, for sure i'm crazy
i am an animal

they say that love often passes in a second
and you can never catch it up
so i'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned
but it's clear that the match is rough

common sense's tell me not to try'n continue
but i'm after a piece of that diamond in you
so keep an eye open
my spirit ain't broken
your love is so incredible
your body so edible
you give me an overdose of love
just a little is enough

i'm like a connoisseur of champagne cognac
the perfume nearly beats the taste
i eat an oyster and i feel the contact
but more than one would be a waste

some people want an endless line that's true
but all i have is a little time with you
a smile sets me reeling
a kiss feel like stealing
your love is like heroin
this addict is mellowing
i can't pretend that i'm tough
just a little is enough
{instrumental}

just like a sailor heading into the seas
there's a gale blowing in my face
the high winds scare me but i need the breeze
and i can't head for any other place

life would seem so easy on the other tack
but even a hurricane won't turn me back
you might be an island
on the distant horizon
but the little i see
looks like heaven to me
i don't care if the ocean gets rough
just a little is enough

narrator:
captain walker didn't come home
his unborn child will never know him
we believe him missing with a number of men
don't expect to see him again
he's believed to be missing with a number of men
don't expect to see him again
first nurse:
it's a boy, mrs. walker, it's a boy
it's a boy, mrs. walker, it's a boy
first nurse, second nurse and doctor:
a son! a son! a son!
second nurse:
hear the joyful celebrations in the street
it's a boy born on this first day of peace
first nurse, second nurse and doctor:
we've won! a son! we've won!

i watch you sit and twitching
with a match between your teeth
you seem to have a knack of moving it
it's in time to the beat
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
i can't be distracted
by the stuttering of the kids
i just sit, enraptured
by your fluttering eyelids
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
i can only stare
you make me feel
like i don't care
i can only stare
you make me feel
like i don't care
i can only stare
you make me feel
like i don't care
your eyes explain a story
that never had a start
your brow reveals the glory
that's hidden in your heart
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
face dances tonight
fate chances moonlight
your skin is fine china
white as winter snows
your lips are always shining
turning up your nose
face dances tonight

a love born once must soon be born again
a spark that burned, then died, leaving cinders to be fanned
by the wind and thrown to flame
flames like tongues impassioned in a moments burst
tell me, friend, why do you stand aloof from your own heart?
the truth confronts you, the truth confronts you as the sea
crushing with out detail
impassioned and detached
killing with love and power in god's name
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
love conquers poses
love smashes stances
love crushes angles into black
so you, without question
know your first love is your last
and you will never, you never, never, you'll never love again
but always wish to walk with her into restaurants, it's a clammy tale
to be seen beside her at the public bar footrail
i always wanted to be matched with her
yet her beauty was so different to mine
my "beauty" needs an understanding and a knowledge of what i am
hers is enough, earned through eons, for that is what true beauty is
time's gift to perfect humility
may i be matched with you again
i know the match is bad
but god help me
may i be matched with you again
i know the match is bad
but god help me
may i be matched with you again
i know the match is bad
god help me
may i be matched with you again
without your match, there is no flame
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people
people stop hurting people

anyone can have an opinion

little jimmy with his hair dyed red?
they don't give a shit keith moon is dead
is that exactly what i thought i read?

morality ain't measured in a room

anyone can by some leather
ain't no better than wearing sheep
anyone can sell lucky heather
you can see that words are cheap
but did you read the stuff that julie said?
or little jimmy with his hair dyed red?
they have a standard of perfection there
that you and me can never ever share
typewriter bangers on
you're all just hangers on
everyone's human 'cept jools and jim
late copy churners
rock and roll learners
your heart's are melting in pools
of gin
but i know for sure that if we met up eye to eye
a little wine would bring us closer, you and i
'cause you're right, hypocrisy will be the death of me
and there's an i before e when your spelling ecstasy
and you, you two
did you hear the stuff that krishna said?
or know for you that jesus' blood was shed?
is it in your heart or in your head?
or does the truth lie in the centre spread?

keep looking, keep looking
(we must race the race
so we can face the face)
we got to race the race
(we must race the race
so we can face the face)
we got to face the face
we got to race the race

when you travel to the green hills of ayr
where the sea breaks windows on the border line
remember me to a girl who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine
please see for me that her red hair is long
and flows and curls down to her back and breast
please see for me that her red hair is long
for that's the way i remember her best
north country girl (oh-oh-oh)
north country girl (oh-oh-oh)
north country girl (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
north country girl
see that she's warm when the summer ends
when trees are bare and the rivers freeze
she washes her clothes where the river bends
she's working on her knees
see for me that her coat's pulled up close
and her beret frames her sweet, pretty face
see that she's warm and drink her a toast
for i am exiled in a lonely place
please let me know if she remembers me at all
a hundred times i've hoped and prayed
that way up there near the roman wall
she didn't suffer when the fall-out sprayed
north country girl (oh-oh-oh)
north country girl (oh-oh-oh)
north country girl (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
north country girl

and i moved
as i saw him looking in through my window
his eyes were silent lies
and i moved
and i saw him standing in the doorway
his figure merely filled the space
and i moved
but i moved toward him
and i moved
and his hands felt like ice exciting
as he laid me back just like an empty dress
and i moved
but a minute later, he was weeping
his tears, his only truth
and i moved
but i moved toward him
i moved toward him
