yeah, doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

i never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
gotta be somethin' for me to write this
queen, i ain't seen you in a minute
wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
i know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
i ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause i probably did it too
because of you, feelings i handle with care
some niggas recognize the light
but they can't handle the glare
you know i ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
if relationship is effort i will match your work
i want to be the one to make you happiest
and hurt you the most
they say the end is near, it's important that we close
to the most high
regardless of what happen, on him let's rely

there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

it's important we communicate
and tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
i never call you my bitch or even my boo
there's so much in a name and so much more in you
few understand the union of woman and man
and sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
but that's fly by night, for you in the sky i write
for in these cold chi night's moon, you my light
if heaven had a height, you would be that tall
ghetto to coffee shop, through you i see that all
let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
for better or worse times, i hope to me you call
so i pray every day more than anything
friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family, love ain't simple
why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
granted we known each other for some time
it don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side, oh, darling
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

it's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and i can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
plus you shit pop when it's time to
thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats i should rhyme to
at times when i'm lost i try to find you
you know to give me space when it's time to
my heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
the time we committed love, it was real good
had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
i know the sex ain't gon' keep you
but as my equal, it's how i must treat you
as my reflection in light i'ma lead you
and whatever's right i'ma feed you
digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
yo, i tell you the rest when i see you; peace!

there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

i'll take my chances
before they pass
pass me by, oh, darling
you need to look at the other side
you'll agree

a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
and to the beat com sense'll be the sure shot, come on

i met this girl when i was ten years old
and what i loved most, she had so much soul
she was old school when i was just a shorty
never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
on the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
but i respected her, she hit me in the heart
a few new york niggas had did her in the park
but she was there for me, and i was there for her
pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
and just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
sittin' on a bone, wishin' that i could do her
eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘cause we related, physically and mentally
and she was fun then, i'd be geeked when she'd come around
slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
original, pure, untampered, a down sister
boy, i tell you, i miss her

a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
a-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
a-com sense y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
uac, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

now periodically i would see
ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
she didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
she was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
about my people she was teachin' me
by not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
in a method that was leisurely, so easily i approach
she dug my rap, that's how we got close
but then she broke to the west coast, and that was cool
cause around the same time, i went away to school
and i'm a man of expandin', so why should i stand in her way?
she probably get her money in l.a
and she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
she said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
she said, "afrocentricity was of the past"
so she got into r&b, hip-house, bass, and jazz
now black music is black music and it's all good
i wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
i thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
and you could tell by how her titties hung

a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
a-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
and to the beat com gotta be the sure shot
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
if you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

i might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
once the man got to her, he altered her native
told her if she got an image and a gimmick
that she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
now i see her in commercials, she's universal
she used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
and on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
talkin' bout poppin' glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
stressin' how hardcore and real she is
she was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
i did her, not just to say that i did it
but i'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
that she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
i see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
but i'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘cause who i'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop

to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
a-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
a-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
a-one, two, com sense is gonna drop, haha

i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r
i used to love h.e.r., went and fucked up all the shit, y'all

you ain't got your woman in check, man?
i think you’re overstepping your bounds just a little bit
i can't do this anymore

one day when the glory comes
it will be ours, it will be ours
one day when the war is won
we will be sure, we will be sure
oh glory
(glory, glory) ohh (glory, glory)

hands to the heavens, no man, no weapon
formed against, yes glory is destined
every day women and men become legends
sins that go against our skin become blessings
the movement is a rhythm to us
freedom is like religion to us
justice is juxtapositionin' us
justice for all just ain't specific enough
one son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
true and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
that's why rosa sat on the bus
that's why we walk through ferguson with our hands up
when it go down we woman and man up
they say, "stay down", and we stand up
shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
king pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

one day when the glory comes
it will be ours, it will be ours
one day when the war is won
we will be sure, we will be sure
oh glory (glory, glory)
ohh (glory, glory)

now the war is not over, victory isn't won
but we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
we'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)
we'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)

selma is now for every man, woman and child
even jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
they marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
from dark roads he rose, to become a hero
facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
enemy is lethal, a king became regal
saw the face of jim crow under a bald eagle
the biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
we sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
now we right the wrongs in history
no one can win the war individually
it takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
welcome to the story we call victory
the comin' of the lord, my eyes have seen the glory

one day when the glory comes
it will be ours, it will be ours
one day when the war is won
we will be sure, we will be sure
oh glory
(glory, glory)
oh (glory, glory)
oh glory
(glory, glory)
yeah (glory, glory)

when the war is won, when it's all said and done
we'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory)

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
it's a place i got to be
loving you is loving me
how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

yeah, you know what love is
even found it on the ground where the thugs live
my man had to dig deep to find his
couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
at crap games, black dames and big faces
cases in court, fam' showing love and support
you and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
as men we were taught to hold it in
that's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
if love is a place i'ma go again
at least now, now i know to go within
at times it can take ya for a spin
heartbreak hotel then you're home again
i've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
like a story that he don't want to end, yo

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
it's a place i got to be
loving you is loving me
how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

it's all love where we come from
in the hood love we was told to run from
that same hood where the guns sung
we holla love, hoping it'd become one
crack got so many lives undone
from lack of love many hide, some run
i knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
everybody loves sun, why do i attract shade?
heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
what it is to be loved by a man

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
it's a place i got to be
loving you is loving me
how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

some say that i'm a dreamer 'cause i talk about it often
seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
we walk and stand in, fall in it
with the right companion we all in it
mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
in the game of life, it's the scrimmage
reminiscing on letters i wrote in my small days
a letter to the people, love always, yeah

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
it's a place i got to be
loving you is loving me
how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

the hero that he know, that he cold
like when it's below in the g.o., wipe ya feet off in the regal
i’m king, observe the throne and the dream
i have it, supreme like mathematics
yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
rap we won’t jam in traffic
the game need direction, i’m here to map it

through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
for moms, new steps in a direction
in the right way, told her, "inside is where the fight lay
and everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"
chicago nights, they stay on the mind
but i write many lives, they lay on these lines
wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
we got arms but won't reach for the skies
waiting for the lord to rise, i look into my daughter's eyes
and realize i'ma learn through her
the messiah might even return through her
if i'ma do it, i gotta change the world through her
furs and a benz, gramps wantin 'em
demons and old friends, pops, they hauntin' him
the chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
walk like warriors, we were never told to run
explored the world to return to where my soul begun
never looking back, or too far in front of me
the present is a gift, and i just wanna be (be, be, be, be)

mr. blue sky, please tell us
mr. blue sky, please tell us
mr. blue sky, please tell us
mr. blue sky, please tell us
(listen) why you had to hide away for
(listen) why you had to hide away for
(listen) why you had to hide away for
(listen) why you had to hide away for

aston martin king, luther with dreams
the young denzel the way i move through scenes
i’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
a story of change that came with wings
pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
son of the most so from up high i shine
suited in prada, stay mellow like lala
young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
i’m the cum-lada, top of the class
black wall street so my stock will never crash
given what i ask, pure religion and cash
from the windows that open, i’m raising my glass
daylight beams, night life schemes
this is my inception, i’m writing my dreams
immortal view of a star doing what i’m born to do
i see the blue sky, see the lord's coming through

ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
now we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, that's right

it all started with a dream, i wanted to be run–d.m.c
the lord put the blessing upon the mc
o to the m, dreams were spoken to him
that's when i knew my flows would overflow to the rim
open my eyes, yes sir this is what i'm made for
to go hard in the paint like d. wade or
d. rose, from the same streets that we rose
international heroes at world primos
red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
told him for health care, my music is the medicine
my name holds weight, i am never hesitant
different state resident, this is hood elegance
sls classic, pursuing my passion
nova fashion, now i'm oscar party crashing
immortal view of a star doing what i’m born to do
i see the blue sky, see the lord's coming through

ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
now we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, that's right

aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey
aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey
aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey (aye-aye-aye-aye, aye)
aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey (aye-aye-aye, aye, aye, aye)

silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
even now it don't seem so bad, ma
close my eyes to see things in front of me
i'm gone now, imagine what i'm gonna be
dirty to worthy, now i'm all wordy
my broad up in paris, looking all purty
immortal view of a star doing what i'm born to do
i see the blue sky, see the lord's coming through

now we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, that's right

i had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
i could see it from my window
wouldn't take that long to get me there
keep running til' i can go
remember the beautiful things that life could give me
crazy how i'm the one
could've been anywhere, but i'm sitting in the air
with the wheels up staring at the sun

ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
ohh, until high we'll shine at night
now we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, that's right

yeah! it's been a long time comin'
you know what they say kanye
slow motion better than no motion

i walked in the crib, got two kids
and my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
so i had to did, what i had to did
'cause i had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
i'm up all night, getting my money right
until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

you love to hear the story, again and again
about these young brothers, from the city of wind
like juice and gin, in the city we blend
amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
y'all know the sprewells and trucks that's detailed
heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims
we livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin'
on the block white is selling like eminem
on the block it jump off like kim and 'em
on the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'
eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dim in 'em
call my man cuzo, like i'm kin to him
he tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him

i walked in the crib, got two kids
and my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
so i had to did, what i had to did
'cause i had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
i'm up all night, getting my money right
until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

it's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms
throwbacks and timbs, blacks and rims
whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
we never fall short, with us it's all force like air 1's
some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
cats is colder than four below, with self i go toe to toe
wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
though i know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
though i know the dough i got to bring back to the ghetto
arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up
clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up
freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
situations, and jaws get tighter
my man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

i walked in the crib, got two kids
and my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
so i had to did, what i had to did
'cause i had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
i'm up all night, getting my money right
until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

i, i know i could make it right
if i could just swallow my pride
but i can't run away or put my gun away
you can't front on me
i, no i can't let it ride
no, no, not tonight
see i can't run away or put my gun away
you can't front on me

yeah, i break bread with thieves and pastors, ogs and masters
emcees and actors that seize and capture
moments like the camcorder
you ain't killin' it, yo that's manslaughter
though paper can't change a man's aura
it can feed a man's daughter
i stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars
like sam jack they maneuver through drama like

i, i know i could make it right
if i could just swallow my pride
but i can't run away or put my gun away

faithful to the end (we got to be)
faithful to the end (i want to be)
faithful to the end (yes, it's for the people)
i'd like to be her very best friend
(god moves, yeah)

i was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
what if god was a her?
would i treat her the same? would i still be runnin' game on her?
in what type of ways would i want her?
would i want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
if i was wit' her would i still be wantin' my ex?
the lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
wearin' her cross, i mean the heart on my neck
her, i would reflect on the streets of the chi'
ride wit' her, 'cause i know for me she'd die
through good and bad call on her like i'm chirpin' her
couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
walk this earth for her, glory, i'm grateful
to be in her presence i try to stay faithful

faithful to the end
faithful to the end
faithful to the end
i'd like to be her very best friend

he worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
even if they don't try some ladies test men
and this was a test that was bigger than him
some believe its the nature that is given to men
he had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
one reason or another couldn't find peace at home
she asked, "why do men always have to stray?"
he said, "i'm bad, not as bad as eric benet"
"i used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
mighta got a little head but i wasn't really cheatin'"
it's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
and what you did in the past you gotta live with today
she asked if they could spend the night together
he thought, and said, "i'm tryin' to get my life together"
went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"baby you a blessin' and my best friend"

faithful to the end
faithful to the end
faithful to the end
i'd like to be her very best friend

faithful to the end
faithful to the end

there's a thin line between the fake and the real
grafted-ass nigga, i see through your "glass shield"
had skills once upon a time on this project, yo
i'm a have to wreck a ho'shea
i heard a ho say you her favorite rapper

from the immortal words of one: "a bitch iz a..."

i see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind

i want a bitch that look good and cook good
cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
we got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
to get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
pretty with her eyes low, money by her bible
the type of bitch that b.i.g. said he would die for
is the type that i ride and stay alive for
tats on her back, looking all tribal
she know shoes like she know survival
well put together, she weathered the storm
seen her brother die so forever she's strong
hear beyonce's song and she gotta perform
whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

from the hood

i don't even say shit, she can feel it
eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of stony
ghetto prince, she's my apollonia
like chick that had the back of tony, montana
reminded me a me of my, of my mama
knowing the drama like she know when to joke
steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
i poke my head out of benzes
my tweets is the streets that i know who my friends is
endless love for the money, power and clothes
my ghetto housewife watch reality shows
she might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
when the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose

from the hood

i notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
subject matter be changing too quickly at times
so i keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
call me a pro in the pussy category
had explicit experiences i shouldn't mention
for me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
powerful women playing the roles of submission
lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
pain onto my game, wanted and i'm sadistic
they liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til i get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
crib raising kids, labrador behind the white fence
but i'm still single, looking for cleopatra
african queen, yo look at me, i'm a bachelor
y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
cross your fingers, be happy i haven't chose yours
she love glamour, bought her vera wang sandals
valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
half hood half class, photographers' cameras
caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
she can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
events having sponsored by some alcohol product
jumping out a bentley with some fresh red bottoms
you live your dream with me when you were just in the projects

from the hood

memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
to cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
in they socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
with nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
they shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
the streets ain’t safe 'cause they ain’t knowing the code
by the foes i was told, either focus or fold
got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
so we can cop clothes and roll in a rolls
now i roll in a olds, with windows that don’t roll
down the roads where cars get broken and stole
these are the stories told by stony and cottage grove
the world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
on the corners

i wish i could give you this feeling
i wish i could give this feeling, uh-uh
uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
dying, just to make a living, huh?

we overstated, we underrated, we educated
the corner was our time when time stood still and
gators and snakeskins in
yellow and pink and collared blue
profiles glorifying them

street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
so they can keep sweet nike's, they head and they feet right
desires of street life, cars and weed types
it’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
the beasts roam the streets, the police is greek-like
game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
it’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
g's with three stripes, seeds that need light
cheese and recite, needs and be strife
the corner, where struggle and greed fight
we write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
reality's a bitch, and i heard that she bites
the corner

i wish i could give you this feeling
i wish i could give this feeling, uh-uh
uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
dying, just to make a living, huh?

the corner was our magic, our music, our politics
fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
broke out on different corners
power to the people
black power
black is beautiful

black church services, murderers, arabs serving burgers
as cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
the dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
the curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
it’s so hot that niggas burn to live
the furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
we talk shit, play lotto, and buy german beers
it’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
the corners

i wish i could give you this feeling
i wish i could give this feeling, uh-uh
uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
dying, just to make a living, huh?

the corner was our rock of gibraltar, our stonehenge
our taj mahal, our monument
our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
down on the corner

louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
louder, louder, yeah
louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
louder, louder, yeah
yeah, it's for the people

this is street radio, for unsung hero
riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
my daughter found nemo, i found the new preemo
'ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people

and the struggle of the brothas and the folks
with lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
scuffle for notes, the rougher i wrote, times was harder
went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
why white folk focus on dogs and yoga?
while people on the low end tryna ball and get over
lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
from the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
everyday we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
law, we ain't trusting them, thick broads, we lust in them
sick and tired of punching it, i look on the bus at them
when i see 'em struggling, i think how i'm touching them
the people

the days have come
now we are one
just take your time
and then you'll find

this is street radio, for unsung hero
riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
my daughter found nemo, i found the new preemo
'ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people

the people said that i was sharp on tv
at the grammy's, though they tried to india.arie me
got back stage, and i bumped into stevie
he said no matter what, the people gon' see me
can't leave rap alone the streets need me
hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
nobody believe, until i believe me
now i'm on the rise doing business with my guys
visions realize, music affected lives
a gift from the skies, to be recognized
i'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

the days have come
now we are one
just take your time
and then you'll find

this is street radio, for unsung hero
riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
my daughter found nemo, i found the new preemo
'ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people

from englewood to a single hood in botswana
i see the i in we, my nigga, yours is my drama
standing in front of the judge with no honor
my raps ignite the people like obama
the karma of the streets is needs and takes
sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
rebel cadillac music for the people's sake
the people

the days have come
now we are one
just take your time
and then you'll find

it's just a fly love song, what
it's just a fly love song, what

are we living in a dream world?

i know your sick and tired of arguing
but you can't keep it bottled in
jealousy, we got to swallow it

cause i'm my best when i'm with you

(let your love hold you, whoa)
i know this world is crazy
what's it without you?
(my world is nothin' without my baby, baby)

i know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
you're right, you're right, you're right
you running so fast, you just might take flight
(slow down a minute, babe)
hope you're not tired, tonight, tonight
(hope you're not tired, tonight, oh, oh, oh)

you helped me to discover me
i just want you to put trust in me
i kind of laugh when you cuss at me
the aftermath is you touching me

for the world, world, world
my name is common, no i.d

ferrari testas, armani dressers
exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
rest assured, we getting festive in miami now
told my nigga ye, i'm about to win the grammys now
getting johnny cash old white folks know me now
standing close to the mic like i'm kobe now
we celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
it's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
known to tear the club and the block up
going through the airport with more lye than an opera
knew crooks who move books like harry potter
get cleaners to get it cleaner
a legend like john, lennon, i'm a dreamer
tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
mind trips to medina to visit the redeemer
a hero, i'll drop out like hiroshima
off sangria with two broads at la esquina
still opening roads for omoye and amina
i'm a dreamer

it's for the world, world, world, world, world
dream on

we take, uh, we make, uh, paper
and build skyscrapers
walking on water, building my faith up
niggas with no heart, i'm the pacemaker
get the beat from no i, feel the pulse of the chi
survival of the fit with hope in they eye
taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
they notes from the most high, so i gotta land them
career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
rock roles like a phantom
mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
i tell them i need space like richard branson
dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
and then pass out like a pamphlet
never taking grants for granted
it's common, i'm high above standard
fly nigga, keep my feet planted
to rock the planet, i don't stop for panic
maybe i'm a hopeless hip-hop romantic
i'm a dreamer

it's for the world, world, world, world, world
dream on

he introduced me, i stepped to the podium
said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
the youth, the living resurrection
reflections of the sun glaring through the window
now the audience staring at my mental
feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
kinda took me back to when i first had a dream
to be like the king that sang billie jean
now it's gold records, and i'm on silver screens
at the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
to the dreamers

if i dream you're here
and you dream i'm there
we'll be nowhere near
you should just come here
if i wake you up
only difference is
you can live the dream
just believe in it

once you find your shoulders dropping
and your speech gets slow and hazy
you better change your way of being
before you found your brain got lazy
you can build a better future when you join the winning team
if you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
know that history holds more than it seems
we are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
from africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
and stood half naked on auction blocks
from eastern-europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
and were mis-named on ellis island
from south america and mexico, from asia, they labored in sweat shops
from all over the world, they came to america
many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
let us dream for today and for tomorrow
let us dare to dream

night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
a warrior, so i wear 'em on my shirt
wish i was free as che was, i spend a day buzzed
trippin' on heights, wishin' for nikes in different flavors
the age of kane and big daddy, short-body caddies
uncles named larry, that never really grabbed me
my mother gave birth but she really never had me
left to the hood to play daddy
raised by niggas named butch, scoot or bae-bae
with weight so they weigh they status on the streets
license plates that say they, motto
this is chicago in the heyday
similar to good times, i guess that i was jj
a skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
so many niggas, stacked upon each other
it's the black upon each other that we love so much
wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
went to school in baton rouge for a couple of years
my college career got downed with a couple of beers
came back home, now i gotta pay back loans
same nigga, same block, same shit they on
only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
in my defense, yo, i had to hit that zone
man to man, i'm good workin' with my hands
my generation never understood workin' for the man
and, of being broke i ain't a fan
now i stand in the same spot as my old man
my life i planned not to be on this corner
i still wanna see california
but this is my world

it's your world

life and death flow around us
four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
it's hard to stay grounded
we stay high, that's why old folks down us
lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
we paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
removed from earth, only to return through birth
knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
between god and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
with a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
she know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
in the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
said it was her toes, but i could tell her soul hurt
she was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
her stepfather thought he was ike, so her mother he strike
she got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
in the ass, it used to be thicker
life is fast, some choose to be quicker
i remember in high school she had a passion to sing
now she see herself in a casket in dreams
these are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
on our jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
in the chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
this queen never seen herself on this corner
she still wanna see california
but this is her world

it's your world

they say "what's happenin'?"
we say the facts and if, they lie
we comin' back for them
they might say, but they don't know!
(they say, they say)
they don't know

they say a nigga lost his mind
but in the scheme of things i never lost a rhyme
the thin line between love and hatred
i'm the black pill in the matrix, the saturated life
they say life is what you make it
so i wait quick on a spaceship so i can take it
as high as the stakes get when paper get low
i be tellin' derick, "tell cara get us a show"
little com, i make righteous bitches get low
the richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
they say "you ripped" "wow..." yea, that's what they say
my niggas couldn't tell it was me, like jamie in ray
paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
they say "dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
i stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
they never could say - tell 'em, j

they say "what's happenin'?"
we say the facts and if, they lie
we comin' back for them
they might say, but they don't know!
(they say, they say)
they don't know-ow

ah, the sweet taste of victory
go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
i know they sayin' "damn, 'ye snapped with this beat!"
fuck you expect? i've got a history
groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
haters back down, gotta be that steel!
i know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
look how they did d'angelo, ask him "how do it feel?"
my best friends worry bout me
'cause they know when you famous
and you had made cash
the media aims at us
and you be up so high
if you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
but god don't ever give me nothin' i can't handle
so please don't ever give me records i can't sample
so i could vacay where it ain't no channels
but it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
they say because of the fame and stardom
i'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
i guess it's messin' with my health then
and this verse so crazy when i finish
i'm just gon' check myself in, again

they say "what's happenin'?"
we say the facts and if, they lie (uh, ha!)
we comin' back for them
they might say, but they don't know!
(they say, they say)
they don't know

they say "dude think he righteous"
i write just to free minds, from stony to rikers
amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as mike is
on my paper, whether its weed or isis
they say "life is a game," so i play hard
writin' for my life 'cause i'm scared of a day job
they say "sef kept the hood together"
i tell the young, "we can't play the hood forever"
play my cards right, they say i went too left
they showed me strange love, like i was mr. f
played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
now i claim "king" like don, or frank white
they say my life is comparable to christ
the way i sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
they say "the crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
seen the corner, now they say "that nigga's back," uh

they say "what's happenin'?"
we say the facts and if, they lie
we comin' back for them
they might say, but they don't know!
(they say, they say)
they don't know-ow

she walk into the court her knees buckle
saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
seen and been through struggle her whole life
made a transition from being his ho to his wife
stifling, the night upend the atf bust in
her daddy was a hustla, so she love them
looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
please let me testify

fear in her chest her face in tears
had her man's back he was facing years
in her name though the place was his
they tryna take everything except the kids
for years she been through stumbling fights
while he tryna hustle that white
up all night wondering if he's alive
seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
please let me testify

the judge yelled for order the court
reporter making her words shorter
his lawyer sat next to him
she could see how the trial was affecting him
it hurt for her eyes to connect with him
using her lies for protecting him
they arrested him for murder and gun possession
as they read back her confession, she screamed

before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
please let me testify

the court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
he stated, he was guilty on all charges
she's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
a spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
that's when the prosecutor realized what happened
all that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
when this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
please let me testify

you accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
please let me testify, please let me testify
