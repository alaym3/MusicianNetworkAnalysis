i mean, clearly, you’ve been having this thing with kim
and i don’t know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you’re a rapper –
and i’m thinking, sure, i know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
even though you say it’s not specifically about her - that roman’s revenge is for kim
umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
and that's what i've learned in this business, you just never know –

i know a dude named jimmy used to run up in me
night time pissy drunk off the henny and rémy
i didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
he was a trick when i sucked his dick
he used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
suck him to sleep, i took the keys to the jeep
tell him, "i'll be back," go fuck with some other cats
flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
raw top in my man's drop
then this homie jimmy, he's screamin', "gimme"
lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
after ten times we fucked, i think i bust twice
he was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
put me in chanels, kept me out nice
called suckin' his dick, "rockin' the mic"
it was somethin' about this dude i couldn't stand
somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
somethin' i wanted, but i never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

i don't want dick tonight

uh, uh, uh, uh lil' kim, lil' kim, bring it to me now
i know a dude named ron doo push a q
had a wild crew on flatbush & avenue u
had a weed spot, used to pump african black
he used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
i used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
i dug him, so i fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
he wanted me to suck him, but i didn't, i ain't frontin'
the sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
i jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
he called next week, askin' why i ain't beep him
"i thought your ass was still sleepin'"
he laughed, told me he bought a new path
could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
"i'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash

my aunt dot
left a glock and some blood on my sheets
told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
even though i'm her niece, she copped me a piece
wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
what? she don't know i like my guns pretty?
like my boy castor troy with the twin-glizzies
i heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
to my surprise i saw these two familiar eyes
who are you?
whattup? i'm shanice, don't remember me?
she called me by my government name, kimberly
who sent you?
my mom sent me; her name is dottie
she packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
she had the prada knapsack, with the hat to match
bvlgari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
and i could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
then she handed me the note
here, read this
i just stared her up and down
'cause i couldn't believe this, then i opened it
it said, "bitches is out to get you
your so-called friends, put a bomb in your benz
i'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
they know where you live, so evacuate the crib
and oh, the little girl, that's your cousin shanice
since i can't be with her, i need you to babysit her
besides she looks up to you, you're her idol
and tomorrow is her first violin recital
and she would be, more than happy if you could take her
peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later"
damn, what went wrong?
can't we all just get along, and make hit songs?
bitches all up in my ass like a thong
if this was a show, y'all hoes would get "gonged"
'cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
what the fuck you waitin' for? c'mon, let's get it on
what? what's takin you so long? i got plans for the future
to bring back your head like medusa
girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
can't stand the pain then pop a "humphrey"
i know it hurts (i'm killin' y'all)

uhh, we in the range in this fucked up weather
it's snowin' and i'm tryin' to put the whole shit together
how laverne, she always wanted to be like me
and dress like me, and look like me
and nicole, it's like she lived in my house
askin' me for money, day in - day out
and last but not least the grimiest one tayesha
she planned it all, come to find out her name is keisha
c'mon shanice i'm takin' you to my house in alpine
(i wanna go with you!) uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine
c'mon please, i wanna be just like you
600 mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
crazy baguettes in my barrettes and
h-class rocks inside my baby g shock
fuck barney and lambchops; i don't love them hoes!
but anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
diamonds on my toes, x-and-o's
versace hottie in designer clothes
scoop lil' nique and jus, then take 'em to toys'r'us
make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
i'm the s-the-h-the-a-the-n-the-i-the-c-the-e
but all my friends call me miss little queen bee
what what? i like the green, know what i mean?
ever seen the professional? (uh-huh) well i can clean
you know what? i like you, little big person
but rule number one, no cursin'
anyway, what you know about that?
you too young for that, when i was your age
i woulda got hung for that
then i picked up the phone, to call my aunt dot
so she could fill me in a little more about the plot
hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
"hello?" yo, what's the deal?
why these bitches buggin' out;
i mean, what's this all about?
"see it's sorta like what tonya harding did to nancy
they don't want you to win no more
soul train they don't want you to attend no more
and i guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
the other day, when i was comin' out the grocery store
i saw the bitch nicole in front of the salon next door"
for real? "yup, then i choked the bitch out
at least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
through her in my backseat
then i dumped her on a dead-end street
the other two? yeah they still linger
but don't you lift a finger, i'ma get 'em
so just pray i come home
and when we hang up, get rid of your phone"
whoo! when aunt dot comes, oh brother
it's like five bloody mary's, one after another
hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin' white, no sex
and when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
'cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
is the reason why the story is to be continued
girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
can't stand the pain then pop a "humphrey"
i know it hurts (i'm killin' y'all)
