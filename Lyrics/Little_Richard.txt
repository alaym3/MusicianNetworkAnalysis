when jordan's river is chilly and cold
it chills the body, lord, but not the soul

every time i feel the spirit
moving in my heart i will pray
every time i feel the spirit
moving in my heart i will pray

i asked the lord if all of it's mine
jesus christ, his lord of all
he's coming again to save us all
