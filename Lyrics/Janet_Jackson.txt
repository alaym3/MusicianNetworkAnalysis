come on

you’re missing me, i’m missing you
whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
when i get to be together with you
it’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

a vision rolling round in my head, but i don’t really talk about it
i’m loving what you’re doing to me
and i don’t wanna do without it
day and night, i dream of us doing whatever
but i guess i’ll have to wait until that day comes

you’re missing me, i’m missing you
whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
when i get to be together with you
it’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

48 hours of love, it's gonna be a weekend marathon
so you better get ready, my king
cause i'ma be the queen of insomnia
stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
cause every second you’re away feels like forever

you’re missing me, i’m missing you
whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
when i get to be together with you
it’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
so think outside the box, my baby
show me how much you were missing me
i’ll read between the lines and i sure hope it rains

cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
how's that? (yeah that’s nice)
we ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
we ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
we ain’t gonna get no sleep

i go my way, you go yours
you taste real life, i taste tours (alright)
sweet at first, but after a while
too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
and i wear a frown now, 'cause i miss real
i miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
and you miss junk food, that’s why we work
you bring cooked food and i bring dessert
uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
the one swimming through my mind, that was always you
our time together has inspired a song or two
or three, or four, or more, mi amor
i’m sure, either you’re the one or i’m caught in the matrix
staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
drunk off love we both feel deep down
but too scared to say cause we know how this ends
thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
for the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
butterflies like mj, had to fit it in
my schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
the sun rising (already?) until the next time
i love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond i can find (we ain't gonna get no sleep)
no sleep, no sleep

can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

i wonder how 'bout you
day and night, night and day
all i've got to say is

if i was your girl, oh, the things i'd do to you
i'd make you call out my name, i'd ask who it belongs to
if i was your woman, the things i'd do to you
but i'm not, so i can't, then i won't, but if i was your girl

allow me some time to play with your mind
and you'll get there again and again
close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
take your time cause we've got all night, ooh
you on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
and let me know what you like, if you like i'll go
down, down, down, down, da, down, down
i'll hold you in my hand and maybe

your smooth and shiny feels so good
against my lips, sugar
i want you so bad

if i was your girl, oh, the things i'd do to you

i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but...

sittin' here with my tears
all alone with my fears, i'm wondering
if i have to do without you
but there's no reason why
i fell asleep late last night
cryin' like a newborn child
holdin' myself close
pretendin' my arms are yours
i want no one but you

i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but...

i still remember to the day
in fact it was a third monday
you came along to be the one for me
and now i'm alone
i'm sittin' here by the phone
call and say that you're okay
so that i have
the chance to beg you to stay
i want no one but you

i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but...

gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
you know that i know that i get so lonely thinking of you

i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
i want no one but you
i get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
you are the one that lives in me, my dear
want no one but you

all the lonely nights, i spend alone
never around to love me, you're always gone
'cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
oh, the man has come looking for you
you're a rebel now, don't give a damn
always carrying on with the gang
i'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
you won't realize 'til it's too late

don't understand why you insist
on ways of living such a dangerous life
time after time, you stay away
and i just know that you're telling me lies

black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
living on the edge, not afraid to die
heartbeat, real strong but not for long
better watch your step or you're gonna die

you're so together, boy but just at a glance
you'll do anything if given a chance
scheming, planning lies to get what you need
so full of promises that you never keep
don't you tell yourself that it's okay
sick and tired of all of your games
and you want me to stay, ah, better change
makes no sense to me, your crazy ways

don't understand why you insist
on ways of living such a dangerous life
time after time, you stay away
and i just know that you're telling me lies

not afraid to die
black cat, black cat
man, i don't understand your ways
living on the edge

don't understand why you insist
on ways of living such a dangerous life
time after time, you stay away
and i just know that you're telling me lies

black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
living on the edge, not afraid to die
heartbeat, real strong but not for long
better watch your step or you're gonna die
black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
living on the edge, not afraid to die
heartbeat, real strong but not for long
better watch your step or you're gonna die
black cat, living' on the
heartbeat, better watch your step

i heard from a friend today
and she said you were in town
suddenly the memories came back to me in my
mind

"how can i be strong?" i've asked myself
time and time i've said
that i'll never fall in love with you again

a wounded heart you gave
my soul you took away
good intentions you had many
i know you did
i've come from a place that hurts
and god knows how i've cried
and i never want to return
never fall again
making love to you
oh, it felt so good and
oh, so right

"how can i be strong?"
i've asked myself
time and time i've said
that i'll never fall in love with you again

so here we are alone again
didn't think it'd come to this
and to know it all began
with just a little kiss
i've come too close to happiness
to have it swept away
don't think i can take the pain
never fall again

kinda late in the game and my heart is in
your hands
don't you stand there and then
tell me you love me then leave again
cause i'm falling in love with
you again

hold me
hold me
don't ever let me go
say it just one time
say you love me
god knows i do
love you
again

we ain't gonna get no sleep

we walked along the beach, what a moon lit night
he held my hands in his, he kissed me, he said
"i wanna spend my life with you, i want you for my wife"
just then i thought:

what about the times you lied to me?
what about the times you said no one would want me?
what about all the shit you've done to me?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you yelled at me?
what about the times i cried? you wouldn't even hold me
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?

i took a pause then a deep sigh
he looked right into my eyes as he said
"i know i didn't say somethin' wrong"
i didn't have the courage to say but then i thought:

what about the times you lied to me?
what about the times you said no one would want me?
what about all the shit you've done to me?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you yelled at me?
what about the times i cried? you wouldn't even hold me
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you hit my face?
what about the times you kept on when i said, "no more please"
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you shamed to me?
what about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
she only gave you head
what about that, what about that?

don't wanna live my life in misery
don't tell me you did it cause you love me
i don't believe, i'm sick and tired, your deceptive games
wonder, where you have been, i can't live life wondering

my heart was poundin' but the time had come
to stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
and tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
i looked him straight in the eyes and then i said:

what about the times you lied to me?
what about the times you said no one would want me?
what about all the shit you've done to me?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you yelled at me?
what about the times i cried? you wouldn't even hold me
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you hit my face?
what about the times you kept on when i said, "no more please"
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you shamed to me?
what about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
she only gave you head
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you lied to me?
what about the times you said no one would want me?
what about all the shit you've done to me?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you yelled at me?
what about the times i cried? you wouldn't even hold me
what about those things?
what about that, what about that?
what about the times you shamed to me?
what about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?

what about that, what about that?
