i've never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and i'm not proud of my address
in a torn-up town, no postcode envy

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

my friends and i, we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows
that we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

(oh, oh-oh)
we're bigger than we ever dreamed
and i'm in love with being queen
(oh, oh-oh)
life is great without a care
we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

wait till you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out

call all the ladies out
they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in
their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother
while he glows through the room

dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes, as well
even the comatose
they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see on-screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing
for a love they won't receive
'cause what this palace wants is release

we live in cities you'll never see on-screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there
i'm kind of older than i was when i reveled without a care
so there

we live in cities you'll never see on-screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

we're on each other's team
and you know, we're on each other's team
we're on each other's team
and you know, and you know, and you know

go for it
one, two

baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
we slow dance in the living room
but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
till all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting, running through the night
but every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

they're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun

i do my makeup in somebody else's car
we order different drinks at the same bars
i know about what you did and i wanna scream the truth
she thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
(liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar)

well, those great whites, they have big teeth
hope they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

but i hear sounds in my mind
brand new sounds in my mind
but honey, i'll be seein' you 'ever i go
but honey, i'll be seein' you down every road
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

'cause honey, i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

sometimes i wake up in a different bedroom
i whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

well, those rumours, they have big teeth
hope they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

but i hear sounds in my mind
brand new sounds in my mind
but honey, i'll be seein' you 'ever i go
but honey, i'll be seein' you down every road
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

'cause honey, i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, honey, i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
yes, honey, i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

the drink you spilt all over me
"lover's spit" left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy, getting old

we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine

how you wish it would be all the time

it feels so scary, getting old

we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine

how you wish it would be all the time

this dream isn't feeling sweet
we're reeling through the midnight streets

i want 'em back, i want 'em back
the minds we had, the minds we had
how all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
i want 'em back, i want 'em back
the minds we had, the minds we had
it's not enough to feel the lack
i want 'em back, i want 'em back
i want 'em

you're the only friend i need
(you're the only friend i need)
sharing beds like little kids
(sharing beds like little kids)
and laughing till our ribs get tough
(laughing till our ribs get tough)
but that will never be enough
(but that will never be enough)
you're the only friend i need
(you're the only friend i need)
sharing beds like little kids

well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements, still i can't get enough
i overthink your p-punctuation use
not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame
all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest

blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
but we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the louvre
down the back, but who cares? still the louvre
okay, i know that you are not my type (still i fall)
i'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
nothing wrong with it, supernatural
just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

a rush at the beginning

don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
making smart with their words again, well, i'm bored
because i'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
never not chasin' a million things i want
and i am only as young as the minute is, full of it
getting pumped up on the little bright things i bought
but i know they'll never own me (yeah)

baby, be the class clown
i'll be the beauty queen in tears
it's a new art form
showing people how little we care (yeah)
we're so happy
even when we're smilin' out of fear
let's go down to the tennis court
and talk it up like, "yeah" (yeah)

pretty soon, i'll be getting on my first plane
i'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
but my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
how can i fuck with the fun again when i'm known?
and my boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
but i know it's not forever (yeah)

and i will sit close to you
let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
guess this is the winter
our bodies are young and blue
i'm at jungle city, it's late and this song is for you

'cause i remember the rush, when forever was us
before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
well, i guess i should go, yeah, i guess i should go

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when sweet words and fevers
all leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god, i wish i believed ya
when you told me this was my home, oh, oh

i light all the candles
cut flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days, we kiss and we keep busy
the waves come after midnight
i call from underwater
why even try to get right?
when you've outgrown a lover (oh)
the whole world knows but you (oh)
it's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when sweet words and fevers
all leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god, i wish i believed ya
when you told me this was my home, oh, oh

three years, loved you every single day
made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
now i'll fake it every single day
'til i don't need fantasy, 'til i feel you leave
but i still remember everything
how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
i'll start letting go of little things
'til i'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah


"what is this tape?"
"this is my favorite tape"

i hate the winter, can't stand the cold
i tend to cancel all the plans (so sorry, i can't make it)
but when the heat comes, something takes a hold
can i kick it? yeah, i can

my cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
no shirt, no shoes, only my features
my boy behind me, he's taking pictures
lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
come one, come all, i'll tell you my secrets
i'm kinda like a prettier jesus

forget all of thе tears that you've cried
it's ovеr (over, over, over, over)
it's a new state of mind
are you coming, my baby?

acid green, aquamarine
the girls are dancing in the sand
and i throw my cellular device in the water
can you reach me? no, you can't (aha)

my cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches

my boy behind me, he's taking pictures (he's taking pictures)

solar-olar-olar power
solar-olar-olar power
solar-olar-olar power
solar-olar-olar power
solar-olar-olar power

every night, i live and die
feel the party to my bones
watch the wasters blow the speakers
spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
it's just another graceless night
i hate the headlines and the weather
i'm nineteen and i'm on fire
but when we're dancing, i'm alright
it's just another graceless night

are you lost enough?
have another drink, get lost in us
this is how we get notorious, oh
'cause i don't know
if they keep tellin' me where to go
i'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh (tch-tch)

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

every night, i live and die
meet somebody, take 'em home
let's kiss and then take off our clothes
it's just another graceless night 'cause

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway?
all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway?
all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway?

(when you get to my high, when you get to)
night, midnight

oh god, i'm clean out of air
in my lungs, it's all gone
played it so nonchalant
it's time we danced with the truth
move alone with the truth
ooh (hey)
we're sleeping through all the days
i'm acting like i don't see
every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

but my hips have missed your hips
so let's get to know the kicks
will you sway with me?
go astray with me?
(ah-ha)

we're king and queen of the weekend
ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(but what will we do when we're sober?)
uh, when you dream with a fever

midnight, we're fading
till daylight, we're jaded
we know that it's over
in the morning, you'll be dancing with
all the heartache and the treason
the fantasies of leaving
but we know that, when it's over
in the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
oh, dancing with us

blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

all the broken glass sparkling
i guess we're partying

break the news—you're walking out
to be a good man for someone else
sorry i was never good like you
stood on my chest and kept me down
hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
did my best to exist just for you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops
i'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe

i still feel you, now and then
slow like pseudo-ephedrine
when you see me, will you say i've changed?
i ride the subway, read the signs
i let the seasons change my mind
i love it here since i’ve stopped needing you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops
i'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe
i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops
i'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe

i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(i remember when your head caught flame)
well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
it's buzzcut season, anyway
(well, you laughed, baby, it's okay)

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how we're living
(we ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(shut my eyes to the song that plays)

the men up on the news
they try to tell us all that we will lose
but it's so easy in this blue
where everything is good

and i'll never go home again
(place the call, feel it start)
favourite friend
(and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
i live in a hologram with you
we're all the things that we do for fun
(and i'll breathe, and it goes)
play along
(make-believe it's hyper real)
but i live in a hologram with you

cola with the burnt-out taste
i'm the one you tell your fears to
there'll never be enough of us

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

and i'll never go home again
(place the call, feel it start)
favourite friend
(and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
i live in a hologram with you
we're all the things that we do for fun
(and i'll breathe, and it goes)
play along
(make-believe it's hyper real)
but i live in a hologram with you

in my head
i play a supercut of us
all the magic we gave off
all the love we had and lost
and in my head
the visions never stop
these ribbons wrap me up
but when i reach for you
there's just a supercut

in your car, the radio up
in your car, the radio up
we keep trying to talk about us
i'm someone you maybe might love
i'll be your quiet afternoon crush
be your violent overnight rush
make you crazy over my touch

but it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us
oh, it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us

so i fall
into continents and cars
all the stages and the stars
i turn all of it
to just a supercut

'cause in my head (in my head, i do everything right)
when you call (when you call, i'll forgive and not fight)
because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

in your car, the radio up
in your car, the radio up
we keep trying to talk about us
slow motion, i'm watching our love
i'll be your quiet afternoon crush
be your violent overnight rush
make you crazy over my touch

but it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us
oh, it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us
but it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us
oh, it's just a supercut of us
supercut of us

'cause in my head, in my head, i do everything right
when you call, i'll forgive and not fight
all the moments i play in the dark
wild, fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'cause in my head (in my head, i do everything right)
when you call (when you call, i'll forgive and not fight)
because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'cause in my head (in my head, i do everything right)
when you call (when you call, i'll forgive and not fight)
because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

in my head, i do everything right
in my head, i do everything right

you asked if i was feeling it, i'm psycho high
know you won't remember in the morning when i speak my mind
lights are on and they've gone home, but who am i?
oh, how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses
we told you this was melodrama
(oh, how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses)
our only wish is melodrama
(oh, how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses)

and the terror and the horror
when we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
and the terror and the horror
god, i wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
all the glamour and the trauma
and the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
all the gun fights and the lime lights
and the holy sick divine nights, whoa
(holy sick divine nights, whoa)
they'll talk about us, all the lovers
how we kiss and kill each other, whoa
they'll talk about us, and discover
how we kissed and killed each other, whoa
(and we'll tell them)

we told you this was melodrama
you wanted something that we offer
we told you this was melodrama
you wanted something that we offer
we told you this was melodrama
you wanted something that we offer
we told you this was melodrama
you wanted something that we offer

we told you this was melodrama
we told you this was melodrama
we told you this was melodrama
we told you this was melodrama
we told you this was melodrama

got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
just in case i wake up and realise i've chosen wrong
i love this life that i have
the vine hanging over the door
and the dog who comes when i call
but i wonder sometimes what i'm missing

well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
it's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

'cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
and all the times they will change, it'll all come around
i don't know
maybе i'm just stoned at the nail salon
maybe i'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
we'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
but the sun has to rise
when it does, we'll divide up the papers
two former hell-raisers
i'm still crazy for you, babe

well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
it's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

'cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
and all the times they will change, it'll all come around
i don't know
maybe i'm just
maybe i'm just stoned at the nail salon again

oh, make it good
oh, make it good
i'd ride and i'd ride on the carousel
'round and 'round forever if i could
but it's time to cool it down
whatever that means

spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
i don't know
maybe i'm just stoned at the nail salon
maybe i'm just stoned at the nail salon again

we're never done with killing time
can i kill it with you
till the veins run red and blue?
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
we're hollow like the bottles that we drain
you drape your wrists over the steering wheel
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow but we're brave

(and i like you)
i love these roads where the houses don't change
(and i like you)
where we can talk like there's something to say
(and i like you)
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(and i like you)
we move in the tree streets
i'd like it if you stayed

now we're wearing long sleeves
and the heating comes on
(you buy me orange juice)
we're getting good at this
dreams of clean teeth
i can tell that you're tired
but you keep the car on
while you're waiting out front

you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
we're hollow like the bottles that we drain
you drape your wrists over the steering wheel
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow but we're brave

(and i like you)
i love these roads where the houses don't change
(and i like you)
where we can talk like there's something to say
(and i like you)
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(and i like you)
we move in the tree streets
i'd like it if you stayed

we're never done with killing time
can i kill it with you
till the veins run red and blue?
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

(and i like you)
i love these roads where the houses don't change
(and i like you)
where we can talk like there's something to say
(and i like you)
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway

we move in the tree streets
i'd like it if you stayed

(and i like you)
(and i like you)
and i like you

there's a humming in the restless summer air
and we're slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos, there is calculation
(drop-drop-drop-drop) dropping glasses just to hear them break
you've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
it's clear that someone's gotta go
we mean it, but i promise we're not mean

and the cry goes out (oh)
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out (oh)
now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but we're the gladiators
(oh, oh) everyone a rager
(oh, oh) but secretly they're saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but victory's contagious

delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
god knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old ways)
chance is the only game i play with, baby
we let our battles choose us

and the cry goes out (oh)
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out (oh)
now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but we're the gladiators
(oh, oh) everyone a rager
(oh, oh) but secretly they're saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but victory's contagious

no-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
the sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
we'll always win at this, i don't ever think about death
it's all right if you do, it's fine
we gladiate, but i guess we're really fighting ourselves
roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
wide awake in bed, words in my brain
"secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
let me in the ring, i'll show you what that big word means

(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but we're the gladiators
(oh, oh) everyone a rager
(oh, oh) but secretly they're saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
(oh, oh) you could try and take us
(oh, oh) but victory's contagious

we wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
i guess you're lucky that it's dark now
and if i like it, then we'll stay
impress the empress; take a shot now

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop this

if you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
give the bruises out like gifts
you'll get the picture of your dreams
i won't be smiling, but the notes from my admirers
fill the dashboard just the same, ah, ah-ah

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop us when we're up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop this

and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no-one could

i'll let you in on something big
i am not a white teeth teen
i tried to join, but never did
the way they are, the way they seem
is something else, it's in the blood
their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
and do nothing, and love it

and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no-one could
and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no-one could

we got the glow in our mouths
(and everything works out so good)
(i wear the robe like no-one could)
white teeth teens are out
(and everything works out so good)
(i wear the robe like no-one could)
white teeth teens are out
