amazing grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost, but now i'm found
was blind, but now i see

'twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed

my chains are gone, i've been set free
my god, my savior has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love, amazing grace

the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures

but god, who called me here below
will be forever mine
will be forever mine
you are forever mine

from the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
every creature unique in the song that it sings
all exclaiming

indescribable, uncontainable
you placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name
you are amazing god
all powerful, untameable
awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
you are amazing god

who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
none can fathom

indescribable, uncontainable
you placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name
you are amazing god
all powerful, untameable
awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim

you see the depths of my heart and you love me the same
you are amazing god
you are amazing god 

oh yeah

some people think you're distant, just some words on a page
that you're nothing more than fables, handed down along the way
but i've seen you part the waters
when no one else could pull me from, the deep
that's who you are to me

some people think you just live in cathedrals made of stone
but i know you live inside my heart, i know that it's your home
and i've seen you in a sunset and in the eyes of a stranger on the street
that's who you are to me

you're amazing, faithful, love's open door
when i'm empty you fill me with hunger for more
of your mercy, your goodness
lord, you're the air that i breathe
that's who you are to me
who you are to me

sometimes i have my doubts, i'm sure that everybody does
and i wonder when i stumble, am i still worthy of your love?
but i know that i get stronger when i'm talking to you down on my knees
you're everything i need
you're amazing, faithful, love's open door
when i'm empty you fill me with hunger for more
of your mercy, your goodness
lord, you're the air that i breathe

you're forever holy
you're the lamb who is worthy
my forgiveness (my forgiveness), my healer (my healer)
the messiah, my redeemer

when i'm empty you fill me with hunger for more
of your mercy, your goodness
lord, you're the air that i breathe
(lord, you're the air i breathe)
that's who you are

you are greater, higher over it all
in your presence, jesus, i stand in awe
of your mercy, your goodness

there's a peace i've come to know
though my heart and flesh may fail
there's an anchor for my soul
i can say "it is well"

jesus has overcome
and the grave is overwhelmed
the victory is won
he is risen from the dead

and i will rise when he calls my name
no more sorrow, no more pain
i will rise on eagles' wings
before my god fall on my knees
and rise
i will rise

there's a day that's drawing near
when this darkness breaks to light
and the shadows disappear
and my faith shall be my eyes
jesus has overcome
and the grave is overwhelmed
the victory is won
he is risen from the dead

and i will rise when he calls my name
no more sorrow, no more pain
i will rise on eagles' wings
before my god fall on my knees
and rise
i will rise

and i hear the voice of many angels sing
"worthy is the lamb"
and i hear the cry of every longing heart
"worthy is the lamb" 

and i will rise when he calls my name
no more sorrow, no more pain
i will rise on eagles' wings
before my god fall on my knees
and rise
i will rise
