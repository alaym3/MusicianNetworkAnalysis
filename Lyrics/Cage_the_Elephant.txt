did you stand there all alone?
oh, i cannot explain what's going down
i can see you standing next to me
in and out somewhere else right now
you sigh, look away
i can see it clear as day
close your eyes, so afraid
hide behind that babyface

do-do-do, do-do-do

you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer

funny how it seems like yesterday
as i recall, you were looking out of place
gathered up your things and slipped away
no time at all, i followed you into the hall
cigarette daydream
you were only seventeen
soft speak with a mean streak
nearly brought me to my knees
do-do-do, do-do-do

you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason, a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason, a reason to stay
standing in the pouring rain

do-do, do-do-do
do-do, do-do-do-do
do-do, do-do-do
do-do, do-do-do-do

you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason, a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason, a reason to stay
standing in the pouring rain 

ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh

we were at the table by the window with the view
casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
spoke a lot of words, i don't know if i spoke the truth

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life, didn't do it for you
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh

we will come to pass, will i pass the test?
you know what they say, yeah
the wicked get no rest
you can have my heart, any place, any time

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life, didn't do it for you

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life, didn't do it for you

ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind 

i was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
i saw a pretty little thing approaching me
she said, "i never seen a man, who looks so all alone
oh, could you use a little company?
if you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
and you can go and send me on my way."
i said, "you're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?"
she looked at me and this is what she said:

"oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
i got bills to pay, i got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
oh no, i can't slow down, i can't hold back
though you know, i wish i could
oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good"

not even fifteen minutes later i'm still walking down the street
when i saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
and then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
he made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
he said, "give me all you've got, i want your money, not your life
but if you try to make a move, i won't think twice."
i told him, "you can have my cash, but first you know i gotta ask
what made you want to live this kind of life?"
he said, "there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
i got bills to pay, i got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
oh no, i can't slow down, i can't hold back
though you know, i wish i could
oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good"

well now a couple hours passed and i was sitting in my house
the day was winding down and coming to an end
and so i turned on the tv and flipped it over to the news
and what i saw i almost couldn't comprehend
i saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
he'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
but even still i can't say much because i know we're all the same
oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
you know there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
we got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
though you know we wish we could
oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good 

time shakes, found you at the water
at first you were my father, now i love you like a brother
earthquakes shake the dust behind you
this world at times will blind you
still i know i'll see you there

come a little closer, then you'll see
come on, come on, come on
things aren't always what they seem to be
come on, come on, come on
do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
come on, come on, come on
do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
come a little closer, then you'll see

heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
will we burn on or just smolder?
somehow i know i'll find you there
ooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it
still i know i'll see you there

come a little closer, then you'll see
come on, come on, come on
things aren't always what they seem to be
do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
come on, come on, come on
do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
come a little closer, then you'll see
come a little closer, then you'll see
ten thousand people stand alone now
and in the evening the sun sank
tomorrow it will rise
"time flies by," they all sang along
"time flies by," they all sang along
"time flies by," they all sang along
"time flies by, by"

come a little closer, then you'll see
come on, come on, come on
come a little closer, then you'll see
come a little closer, then you'll see
come a little closer, then you'll see 

in a far and distant galaxy
inside my telescope i see
a pair of eyes peer back at me
he walks and talks and looks like me
he sits around inside his house
from room to room, he moves about
fills his life with pointless things
and wonders how it all turns out

do-do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do-do
it's safe to say that

i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
the walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent or time i've wasted
don't waste it

afraid of what the truth might bring
he locks his doors and never leaves
desperately searching for signs
too terrified to find a thing
he battens all the hatches down
and wonders why he hears no sounds
frantically searching his dreams
he wonders what it's all about
do-do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do-do
it's safe to say that

i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
the walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent or time i've wasted

here in my mind, losing my friends
fall on my face, do it again
you say, "how do you do?"
man, how 'bout you? man, how 'bout you?
to be free, to be sold
to be killed, to be safe
in my head, i'm alone
i'm not dead, i'm ashamed
just like you, i've been trying to escape
in my bones, i feel cold
i give thanks to the lord
industry, in the street
let me go, let me be
i don't need to be here
i'm alone, can't you see? can't you see?
i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
these walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent or time i've wasted
don't waste it 

doctor, look into my eyes
i've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
doctor, the problem's in my chest
my heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

doctor, can you help me? 'cause i don't feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind
doctor, can you help me? 'cause i don't feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind

well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
darker in the day than the dead of night
cold, cold, cold, cold inside
doctor, can you help me? 'cause something don't feel right
something don't feel right

sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
i've seen those eyes before, i can tell you want to play
counselor, give me some advice
tell me, how hard will i fall if i live a double life?

doctor, can you help me? 'cause i don't feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind
doctor, can you help me? 'cause i don't feel right
better make it fast, because there ain't much time
well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
darker in the day than the dead of night
cold, cold, cold, cold inside
doctor, can you help me? 'cause something don't feel right
something don't feel right
something just ain't right

and as the darkness falls, it fills up both my eyes
my life before me like a flash in the night
with my arms open wide

well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
cold, cold, cold, cold inside
cold, cold, cold, cold inside
doctor, can you help me? 'cause something don't feel right
something don't feel right
something just ain't right 

sun went down, sun went down over pompeii
on both sides, a vow was broken
oh my, my, i'm the one
trying to hide this damage done
one day, all our secrets will be spoken

as we slow danced, i became your statue, frozen
times i wonder are we just a puff of smoke? yeah
underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
like we were never close

don’t you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
i'ma strike these matches, never had control
i'm ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself?
i’ma spread these ashes, never had control
i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to let go

sun went down, sun went down over pompeii
on holy ground, our vows were broken
we met up, we broke bread
i was blue, your dress was red
ain't it strange?
we both knew this day was coming
as we slow danced, i became your statue, frozen
times i wonder are we just a puff of smoke? yeah
underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
like we were never close

don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
i'ma strike these matches, never had control
i'm ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself?
i’ma spread these ashes, never had control
i’m ready, i'm ready, i’m ready to let go

don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
i'ma strike these matches, never had control
i'm ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself?
i’ma spread these ashes, never had control
i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to let go 

i think it's strange when people say
you're the next big thing, you'll never fade
the slightest touch, forced to fold
sleight of the hand, modern gold

starry-eyed child left behind
choose your favorite vice
i don't have the strength to play nice

hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
people always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"

at least you're on the radio, oh
at least you're on the radio, huh
at least you're on the radio, oh

close your eyes, don't be afraid
take some of these, they'll ease the pain
live fast, die young, pay the price
the best die young, immortalized
starry-eyed children left behind
to choose their favorite vice
i don't have the strength to think twice

hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
people always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"

at least you're on the radio, oh
at least you're on the radio, huh

hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
don't know if i can play this part much longer
i don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
i'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
people always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"
at least you're on the radio, oh 

shake me down, not a lot of people left around
who knows now? softly laying on the ground
oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

in my life i have seen people walk into the sea
just to find memories plagued by constant misery
their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
their eyes cast down

i'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
broken sound, softly laying on the ground
oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

in my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
with eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

i'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
turn back now, it's time for me to let go
way down, had to find a place to lay low
lamp shade, turned around into a light post
walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
i try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
i don't want to know the future, i'm like rolling thunder
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day

i'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
i'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
i'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

shake me down, not a lot of people left around
oooh oooh 

sweetie little jean, where did you go?
everyone's been searching high and low
and your mother's worried sick
dearest daddy lost his grip
while the whole world's watching
candlelight vigils being held in silence
on the channel four
and they've knocked on every door
every place you've been before

how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go

i, i want you back (back)
let's get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all my troubles will be dead and gone

how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go

has melancholy taken you for good?
you know that i would save you if i could
watched your laughter turn to tears
then you vanished in thin air
well we pinned your missing persons picture up
on every mother-loving post
how's it feel to be a ghost?
you're the one i love the most
i, i want you back (back)
let's get back
lay my weary head against your breast
where all our troubles will be laid to rest

i pushed and i pulled 'til i pushed you aside
now all that is left are the tears that you cried
i'm sorry love for all of the damage done
my only hope is someday to be back beside you

i, i want you back (back)
let's get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all our troubles will be dead and gone

how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go 

oh my precious ember burning, my sweet glowing light
from the moment i first saw you, i was yours and you were mine
deep down we both knew you were trouble by design
and the echo of my mother's words, "baby, don't you play with fire"

i was always playing the part
first love only set by a spark
there was no way changing my mind

now i'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
no turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
it's too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god, is this real?
no more time
it's too late, it's too late to say goodbye

i can hear the sounds of sirens circling around
forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground
deep down we both knew it was trouble by design
and the echo of my mother's words, "baby, don't you play with fire"
i was always playing the part
first love only set by a spark
there was no way changing my mind

now i'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
no turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
it's too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god, is this real?
no more time
it's too late, it's too late, it's too late to say goodbye

after all the dust has settled, we can settle down
just the two of us forever, no one else around
no one else around
around

now i'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
no turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
it's too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god
no escape
no more time
it's too late, it's too late, it's too late to say goodbye 

soft glow on the city
she said, "there's no one here who can touch you now"
caught the last flight out of lax
with your one-way ticket, new york-bound

climb so high, don't make a sound
don't you forget what goes up must come down
climb so high, tell me how it feels

call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, hallelujah
makes no difference here, so let's be real
black madonna, my black flower
nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
you're not havin' fun, i think that you should ride
call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, my hallelujah

on the phone you sound shifty
you say that you're at home, alone right now
but in the background there's a muffled laugh
as you spin that wool and pull it down
climb so high, don't hear a sound
don't you forget what goes around, comes around
climb so high, tell me how to feel

call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, hallelujah
makes no difference here, so let's be real
black madonna, my black flower
nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
says it should be gone, at least it was this time
call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, my hallelujah

call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, hallelujah
makes no difference here, so let's be real
black madonna, my black flower
nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
you're not havin' fun, i think that you should ride
call me when you're ready to be real
black madonna, my hallelujah 

wake up, say a little prayer
out of bed to the bathroom where
i take a look at myself and i stop and stare
and i wonder who is this standing here

and i try to find the will to carry on
wonder how much longer i can carry on
cause these days they take so long, yes they do

hey, how are you true?
the light will guide you home, yes it will
hey, how are you true?
well there's one thing that you should know
yes you should
you need love, you need love, you need love
you need love

all your days spend counting numbers
'til one day you'll find (day you'll find)
that life has passed you by
and in the quiet still of silence try to hide your eyes (hide your eyes)
oh no so don't cry, oh no
hey, how are you true?
the light will guide you home, yes it will
oh the years, they turn so fast
soon the present will be past and you'll look back and laugh
yes you will

well i can still remember, yes, i was a young man too
alone, but not forgotten and the candle shining through
still all these words i've spoken don't mean anything at all
without love, without love, without love
without love
do, do, do, oh yeah
do, do, do, oh yeah

i remember clearly we were both there on the airplane
told me all your secrets, oh i never saw it coming
i thought that you were joking
you were actually quite serious 

i am the one you left for dead
say you want it, too
you are the bullet in my head
and as you stand over my grave
tell me it's okay
your porcelain lips upon my face

either i'm in heaven, or i'm in hell
am i losing my mind here? 'cause i can't tell
i've been waiting for answers for way too long
seems i'm always waiting around

spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind
it all works out in time, you know i'm gonna be alright
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind

talk to me now

i think your mother wants me dead
say you want it, too
i am a schizophrenic man
i wouldn't change you if i could
say you want me, too
treat me cold, i'll play it cool
spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind
it all works out in time, you know i'm gonna be alright
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind
it all works out in time, you know i'm gonna be alright
you may take my eyes, but baby, i'm not blind 

baby, you should know by now that i’m right for you
but every time i step to you, you change your tune
sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
i step to the right, you move to the left
and there's no one else i'd rather die to myself

oh why won't you make up your mind?
i think i must confess, i'm starting to unwind
i've been tripping over you
so tell me something new
take it or leave it

maybe i should pack my things and move on
maybe i'm fooling myself and you're already gone
watching the flames wither and fade
trying to make sense of the look on your face
i'm down on my knees just praying that i can hold on

oh why won't you make up your mind?
i think i must confess, i'm learning to unwind
i've been tripping over you
so tell me something new
take it or leave it
baby, please
oh baby, please
stay with me
or cut me free
it’s killing me

oh why won't you make up your mind?
i think i must confess, i'm starting to unwind
i've been tripping over you
so tell me something new
take it or leave it
take it or leave it 

all my life, i read between the lines
held on too tight, you know i tried
but in the end, it left me paralyzed
it's alright, goodbye, goodbye
seems like yesterday i was a child
just a ripple in the folds of time
i wish you well, i want to see you smile
it's alright, goodbye
goodbye

goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
i won't cry, i won't cry, i won't cry
lord knows how hard we tried
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

so many things i want to say to you
so many sleepless nights i prayed for you
my heart's an ashtray and i lost my mind
you bring the smokes, i've got the time
i want to scream, i want to laugh, i want to close my eyes
i want to hide somewhere that's hard to find
stop wasting time trying to shape your life
it's alright, goodbye
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
i won't cry, i won't cry, i won't cry
lord knows how hard we tried
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

my pretty bird, my favorite lullaby
how'd i become the thorn in your side?
all your laughter turned into a cry
it's alright, goodbye
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
i won't cry, i won't cry, i won't cry
lord knows how hard we tried
it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 

yeah, alright

electrified harmonious
i think i'll take it out to the streets
will somebody please help me?
call the doctor but don't call the police
yeah, cool

are you into the beat?
are you into the beat?
i can feel it in my teeth

i can feel it in my teeth
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me mad
i can feel it in my teeth
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me crazy
it's driving me crazy
it's driving me mad

i wish i were an astronaut
space-case making the scene, yeah
put me in a hospital
lock me up and throw out the key
hey, hey, hey, hey
are you into the beat?
i'm the king of the beat
i can feel it in my teeth

i can feel it in my teeth
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me mad
i can feel it in my teeth
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me crazy
it's driving me crazy

now, shut up and dance

i can feel it in my teeth
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me mad
i can feel it in my teeth, ooh
i can feel it in my teeth
and it's driving me crazy
it's driving me crazy
it's driving me mad
yeah, yeah
we live in an environment whose entire population of critics and no painters to be found
where have all the storytellers gone?
just when did i become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
and then i lose my voice in between the echoes of self-serving prophecy
a captain without his ship
a chief—a chief without a tribe
a raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
a muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry
power concaved inside a woman
to configure through the mythical power of the trees, the graphics being paper th—
paper thin garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments
pray for summer days
the rain and wind is so strong outside my window
and winter's always searching for another
i hear—i hear his cheeks slap together and worship his own voice
lou—louder? okay, alright
i'm so tired of the demands of this world, her nagging voice
the song she sings, the songs that she desires
she cries out in the heat of her passions
her legs spread ready for—ready for a stranger
the captain without his ship
a chief with—a chief without a tribe
a raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
i dare not take another drink until it's gone
just when did i become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
when i lose my voice in between the echoes of self-serving prophecy 

i been trying real hard to, to realize
but some things take a long, long, long, long time
long time

hold the phone, hit repeat
got me foamin' at the knees
saw the flame, tasted sin
you burn me once again
cut the cord, she's a creep
aberdeen!
way back, way back, way back!

never saw my dark side in-in your eyes
back and forth, bloody fingers painting up the sky
the sky

hold the phone, hit repeat
got me foamin' at the knees
saw the flame, tasted sin
but you burn me once again
cut the cord, she's a creep
aberdeen!
way back, way back, way back!
hey! hey! hey!
ooh, ooh

hold the phone, hit repeat
got me foamin' at the knees
saw the flame, tasted sin
you burn me once again
cut the cord, she's a creep
aberdeen!
aberdeen!
way back, way back, way back!

way back, way back, way back!
way back, way back, way back
way back, way back, way back
way back, way back, way back
(ooh, ooh) 

tonight, bleeding from the holes in my face
but i don't want to give it away
you did it for the family name
