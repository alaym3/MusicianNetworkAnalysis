i said a hip, hop
i let my tape pop
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
and you don't stop
you don't stop!
i never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
i've got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
ladies love me long time like 2pac's sold
like whoa, like dough, light 'dro, nitro
and if you don't know, now you know
you know i got soul
oh! (4x)
yeah! (5x)
i pulled up to the house
in my six-four
oh snap! guess what i saw?
standing on the front stoop hanging out the windows
snoop doggy dogg and dr. dre is at the door
i jumped out the ride and said "wassup?"
designated driver take the keys to my truck
pour lean in my cup
get nice, split the blunt up
come on everybody let's get ...
get the fuck up
uh huh. now, what y'all wanna do?
so what you wanna do?

gonna be a baller (be ballers), shot caller (shot callers)
i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
holla!!
i was like, good gracious - ass is bodacious
and i approach baby like
hi, my name is (chka-chka-chka)
last name ever, first name greatest
(chka-chka-chka)
i've been spending hundreds since they had small faces
c-notes by the layers, true fucking players
base in the space means peace, see ya later
funky fresh and yes, cold on my feet
my life's like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
when these streets keep callin', heard it when i was sleep
c-o-m-p-t-o-n, my city, mobbing in the street
this is my part, nobody else speak
oh (choir)
uh huh, baby, yeah yeah
uh huh, uh huh, uh
hey, wait, wait a minute!
pooh, stop this shit!
o-oh-oh-oh-ok
first lemme hop out the
cha-cha-cha-chopper
sister, brother, son
show stopper, flow proper, head knocker, beat scholar
girl, i wanna waller
in the back of my impala
i know you ain't a pimp, but, pimp, remember what i taught ya
who am i?!
i-i-i-i-i-i
i'm the boss!
(i'm a boss!)
i still represent swishahouse
(i call the costs)
who shot biggie smalls if we don't get them
they gone get us all! (ayy!)
and you know how we ball (ayy!)
ridin' in shiny cars (ayy!)
with no regard for the law
we dodge 'em like, "fuck 'em all!"
smokin' out, pourin' up, keep that lean up in my cup
you leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
can't you hear the music's pumpin' hard like i wish you would?
you's a superstar, boy
why still up in the hood?
ooh-ooh-ooh (and we back)
i'm good!
one! two! three!
back on the scene, crispy and clean
it was all a dream
it wasn't even close to halloween
when the mc's came, to live out the name
went solo and they ass
but it's still the same
ok, first things first i'll eat your brains
eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains
west side when we ride
come equipped with game
look homie, i done came up, and i ain't changed
aww yeah!

hold up
i don't mean to hold you up but i got something to say
(c'mon)
gimme the mic so i can take it away
players haters get away
or my lead will spray
because this type of shit, it happens every day
and i will never stop
because i just can't quit
mayonnaise-colored benz, i push miracle whips
now gather 'round, i'm the new fool in town
i'm the young harlem nigga with the goldie sound
get down! down!
i came to get down
get down, girl, go head, get down
i get money, money i got
rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
to the...tic-toc, you don't stop!
i told you i'm just like a clock, when i tick and i tock
to the beat, y'all, and it don't stop
cause who i'm talkin' 'bout, y'all, is hip hop

step through the do' she peeking
i need the girl she eyein'
she want me i know it
my neck look like it's snowin'
i'ma lonestar like texas
she on my dick like magnums
gold wrappas lil sonny
yellow diamonds on my chain make my neck look sunny
never bun b vans on my feet
tiny toon tickles shine bright see the teeth
got cheese gotta watch out fo' rats
i'm bigger than the mice so i keep the mouse traps
a lot of snakes in my hood gotta keep a low grass
nicknamed "jeff" 'cause i'm known fo' killin' tracks
bass wood punk rock
ice so right all you gotta do is stop

somebody's watchin' me
bitch i'm shinin'

one step over the margin
(risky, i might just take it)
we put faith in the darkness
(risking my life)

calling out, be wary
the time is now that we become visionaries
have you ever felt like you're drowning out in no regret
you can either sink or swim, but the wave's still wet


tell me, love, where you run to
the secret place you go, and no one knows what goes on inside
and i'd spend forever if i were able, because it's comfortable
with all my feelings spread out on the table


all i really need is to know where you're hiding
risky

so risky
don't let go

like cigarettes light ribbons
in the red light district
where they intersect like rhythms
you look at life through a prism
willing to split the difference
if only for the right schism
elegance takes percision
catch flies with simple syrup
sacrifice pure vision
truth is a nervous system
balanced on the precipice
of perfect wisdom
who’s gonna marry me now?
or carry me out?
or stare me down?
downstairs, the fair’s letting out
the affair’s getting out
who cares? it’s just sound
like innocence? try prison
like you won’t take deliverance
whatever hole you find it in
violence is a given
from the other side of the fence
it’s just like television
i’ll admit there’s been some dereliction
i’ll seek forgiveness, you get the permissions
life’s a bit like a burn victim: we see it's
harsh reality, and yet we prefer fiction
like, this is nice
but is it worth it?
does it justify it's price?
does it serve it's worthless purpose?
will you heed your own advice?
if you want to make it work
it’s best to check everything twice
in lieu of two new sets of eyes
incentivize some passersby...
she feels no strings inside her stomach
but that doesn’t mean they're not there
much less never were
and the audiences love it
their expectations plummet
i bring to mind the things she’s signed but
she’s long since memorized her lines
and she’s terrified in public
objectified by her subjects
“who’s gonna marry me now?
where are we now? you’re wearing me out.”
if you want ‘em to care ten years from now
then here’s how. shout:
these things are nice, but it ain’t worth it
i been wasted half my life
i been trained to thing i deserve it
i’ve been dumb and deaf and blind
this ain’t right
i ain’t perfect. i ain’t trying to say...
things are nice
but it ain’t worth it
it ain’t worth it
come on

everybody knows, everybody knows
how the story goes, how the story goes
they say they've seen it all before, seen it all before
but with us you never know, with us you never know
ok, now you should know the motivation, gotta deliver
that's the topic of this conversation, and we ain't trippin'
we ain't rushin', we just stayin' patient, they always told me
if you want it then you gotta pace it, so we pace it

and i'm feelin' like we run it
yeah, i'm feelin' like we run it
i said i'm feelin' like we run it
i'm feelin' like we run it
i do it different than they've done it
i do it different than they've done it
and i'm feelin' like we run it
yeah, i said i'm feelin' like we run it

no comparison, this one on one
the sky is blue, where we in the sun
got a lot with some mordecoe
since we in this, we just havin' fun
mess around and we won't do a lot
we got everything we say we got
do it how they never done it
ask about us, tell 'em that we run it

down, in the cavern of your smile
where the echo goes on for miles
you give me lip, you gloss right over it
go, turning the water in her hands
take on a sea change that you can stand
turn the tides, wash right over it
down, in the hallway down the aisles
where the echo turns on you and smiles
you give me lip, you gloss right over it
(another lifetime till sunrise)
down, in the cavern of your smile
where the echo goes on for miles
you give me lip, you gloss right over it

as the earth shook
another hour till sunrise
it's one for the record books
that fell from the shelves
as the earth shook

alright alright, you already said your goodbye
i read it in the lines while you measured my eyes
that’s not honest, project your problems
and that look left more footnotes than foster wallace
yeah yeah i got it, ok i get it
devil’s in the details, divinity omitted
you play angelic, i play dumb
we play positions that we both safe from
give it wings, let it fly
let it live, it’s still a lie
and that don’t mean nothing
looking at me like i owe you something
and it may be the way we lay with our clothes off
that keeps us at least a touch truthful
but ain’t that the usual, we don’t say much
i draw the shades up while the sun wakes up
i know what’s...

down, in the cavern of your smile
where the echo goes on for miles
you give me lip, you gloss right over it
