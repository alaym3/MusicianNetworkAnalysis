you think your life's so grand
you don't believe a word you say
your feet aren't on the ground
you let your life just slip away
just so uncertain of your body and your soul
the promises you make your mind go blank
and then you lose control, then you lose control!
i never was the one, the one to say
the things you say
never seem to wonder what you say
you think you've got your life completely in control
you've got a lot to learn, the bridge you burned
it's gonna take its toll!
pay the burnt bridge toll!
so practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!
you think your life's so grand
you don't believe a word you say
your feet aren't on the ground
you let your life just slip away
just so uncertain of your body and your soul
the promises you make your mind goes blank
and then you lose control
pay the burnt bridge toll, then you lose control
pay the burnt bridge toll, so practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!
practice what you preach!

i'm gonna take you
to a place far from here
no one will see us
watch the pain as it disappears
no time for anger
no time for despair
won't you come with me
there's room for us there
this innocent beauty
my words can't describe
this rebirth to purity
brings a sullen tear right to your eyes
no time for anger
no time for despair
please let me take you
'cause i'm already there
i'm so alone
my head's my home
i'll return to serenity
rhyme without reason
is why children cry
they see through the system
that's breeding them just so they die
so please let me take you
and i'll show you the truth
inside my reality
we shared in my youth
i'm so alone
my head's my home
and i feel
so alone
you know
at last
i return to serenity
now that i've taken you
to a place far from here
i really must go back
close your eyes and we'll disappear
won't you come with me
salvation we'll share
inside of my head now
there's room for us there
chorus

coiled forever in the darkness below
they await for the right time to strike
defending the truth and protecting the lies
reptilian, shedding their skin
they gather in masses, encrypting the stars
to breed slaves sworn to war
the thrashing and bashing and blistering burns
death brought forth to the world

serpent's eyes
always watching you
without a trace
the covenant of the snake
succumbing unto your fate
they've been watching you
through shape-shift eyes
in sumerian disguise
by the gods who decree our faith
by the gods who decree our faith
de-luvium religions of monarchs and gods
the hideous hydra takes shape
the bloodline descendants of its original form
the dragon of egypt awakes
they've taken the tablets and hidden the scrolls
to deceive the ones they protect
the truth of creation, mutation of man
entombed in the vatican walls

serpent's eyes
always watching you
without a trace
the covenant of the snake
succumbing unto your fate
they've been watching you
through shape-shift eyes
in sumerian disguise
by the gods who decree our faith
by the gods who decree our fate
by the gods who decree our fate
by the gods who decree our fate
now
we are the ones who dominate (who dominate)
five thousand years silent control (silent control)
societies to subjugate (to subjugate)
eternity complete control (complete control)
the brotherhood of the snake (of the snake)
and they will always assume control

i've been a prisoner
trapped in by fear
ordered for the rest of my life
condemned in a jail cell
ain't seen life in years
escape is the only way out

restart my life
or self destruction
to climb this wall
of dark construction
holding the quest for freedom
that beckons me

my sanity is all but gone
my patience is growing very weak
i need to get a hold of myself
i stare at the wall
for the right time to come
escape must occur on this night

restart my life
or self destruction
to climb this wall
of dark construction
holding the quest for freedom
that beckons me

stand in my way
and i'll run you straight through
there's no one to stop me now
for i'm on the loose
and i'm ready to start
torture and hell on this town

over the wall

the search will not stop
and the hounds will not rest
till i am back in my cell
for if i am caught, i will try it again
over the wall i will go, i will go

restart my life
or self destruction
to climb this wall
of dark construction
holding the quest for freedom
that beckons me

over the wall

in trans-human state
it's time to evacuate
waiting for a ride to take them to the gate
await the siren call
more phenobarbital
pour it down the hatch, ingest it all

children of the next level
they're chillin' with the devil
children of the next level
here they come!

a new life for an old life
a new form of religion
the final task will reinforce their faith
immortality
is it really worth living?
gather up the children going to the gate

break through heaven's gate
freedom from this broken world
this mortal shell they leave
ride up to the sky
climb aboard and take a trip
to your final destiny

finished with education
so primitive this creation
it's time to go now no time to waste
they want to see it through
no plan to procrastinate
the mind and soul will elevate you

so now the time has come for t. i. to appear
the book of knowledge taught, predicted the end is near

ride the comet all dressed in black
exit earth, there's no turning back
who holds the key to open heaven's gate?
they gave their lives just to escape
thirty-nine who took the ride
san diego mass suicide
who holds the key to open heaven's gate?
and take 'em to the next level

break through heaven's gate
freedom from this broken world
this mortal shell they leave
ride up to the sky
climb aboard and take a trip
to your final destiny

so now the time has come for t. i. to appear
the book of knowledge taught, predicted the end is near

ride the comet all dressed in black
exit earth, there's no turning back
thirty-nine who took the ride
the children of the devil

break through heaven's gate
freedom from this broken world
this mortal shell they leave
ride up to the sky
climb aboard and take a trip
to your final destiny

here we go, the people show
victims of tomorrow
the way it goes, it never shows
emptiness or sorrow
there is nothing left inside
nothing left to cry for
so i justify my crimes
things that i must die for

so alone, away it goes
the life that you have wasted
you never know where it might go
the sweet success you've tasted
tested by a bitter frown
knowing i must die for
can't confide to all the lies
no one to inquire
as i wander, change of seasons
as i realise that i'll soon be there
i'll let you know, the reapers show
makes you beg or borrow
he comes to see the tragedy
his fate he will not follow
wearing your electric crown
the preacher starts to pray
shiver as the lights go down
heed these words i say
as i wander, change of seasons
i can't ponder, got my reasons
as i realise i don't care
all i know is that i'll soon be there

now it's done, the time has come
the people stand in silence
another dawn has come and gone
his fate has been decided
there is no one left inside
a brain without mind
traces of a bitter man
are all that you will find
as i wander, change of seasons
i can't ponder, got my reasons
as i realise i don't care
all i know is, that i'll soon be there
and i'll soon be there
and i'll soon be there
and i'll soon be there

life in a world untold, question the unknown
this prison captures me, my cell is all i know
i thought i knew it all, stubborn in my ways
my sentence has begun, my future's what i waste

next chapter of my life is filled with violent scenes
i stay awake at night hiding from my dreams
the voices haunting me, driving me insane
can't seem to get away, they're calling out my name
i feel i am slipping
are they out to get me?
my life is upside down
more than meets the eye

for now, i am in control, choosing my own fate
and now i sleep at night because i'm not afraid
the demons haunting me, i chased them all away
i've conquered all my fears, my destiny awaits
i'm no longer slipping
(i'm not slipping away)
no one is out to get me
(no one will get in my way)
no longer upside down
(i've turned my life around)
more than meets the eye
more than...
more than...
more than...
more than meets the eye

deep in the pit and lying alone
where death has reared itself a throne
we're all the good, the bad
the worst and the best
and where they land is their eternal rest
foul plays of passion
at twilight's dim
in joy of woe, of good and sin
winds of storm and fates overcast
darkly, my presence is now your past
join the insanity
or die as you fall
into the pit
the mass production
and the killing of all
into the pit
the future screams for help
are fading away
into the pit
the world tomorrow
will it die for today?
into the pit
so in the sad, silent watches of night
the lonely pathway envisions my sight
echoes of laughter
and boundless cries
so here i wander under infinite skies
join the insanity
or die as you fall
into the pit
the mass production
and the killing of all
into the pit
the future screams for help
are fading away
into the pit
the world tomorrow
will it die for today?
into the pit

whenever i stumble, whenever i fall
whenever i'm pushed against the wall
this white man's world won't tell me what to do
nowhere to run, my native blood
i wanna reach and touch the sun
blistering my soul, but i can't feel
you hear me say "get out of my way."
i'll do it my own way
cross my path and get what you deserve

i'm warning this world
to stay out of my way
my voice will be heard
i'm alone
i won't be afraid
i got something to say
my voice will be heard
so loud, native blood

forever proud, so goddamn loud
it's me alone against the crowd
right or wrong, it's the road that i must choose
there's no excuse, attitude
got something here that i must prove
live to win instead of born to lose

i'm warning this world
to stay out of my way
my voice will be heard
so strong
i won't be afraid
i got something to say
my voice will be heard
so loud, native blood

i learned to walk before i could crawl
whenever pushed, i push back
not afraid to throw the first punch
i'm never wrong, 'cause i'm always right
and when i'm wrong, i won't admit it
i'm the person your mother warned you about
they broke the mold after i came out
what gives me strength is my beliefs

whenever i stumble, whenever i fall
i won't be pushed against the wall
this white man's world won't tell me what to do
nowhere to run, native blood
i wanna reach and touch the sun
blistering my soul, but i can't feel

i'm warning this world
to stay out of my way
my voice will be heard
i'm alone
i won't be afraid
i got something to say
my voice will be heard
so loud, native blood
i'm warning this world
to stay out of my way
my voice will be heard
so strong
i won't be afraid
i got something to say
my voice will be heard
so loud, native blood
my native blood
my native blood
my native blood

i was awakened by the howling of the dog
or perhaps a wolf
summoned by the voices who are shouting in my ear
the pale king comes from afar
before the time
who will decide
i live to see one thousand moons
i am weak
i am ill
i am old with the taste for the kill
all that i've seen in the years that i possess
faces i don't recognize
summoning the ancients with the evil that awaits
read from the book of the dead
zone of the gods
below the sea
i've traveled amongst the stars
i am life
i am death
i control the gates of this world
the pale king's reign condemns this world
they're doing time til the end of their lives
falling
travelling throughout this world
falling
falling from the skies
taken from the prophecy
as they control your mind
the pale king holds your fate
one hundred thousand years and counting
one hundred million more to go
throughout his life he keeps on searching
the pale king makes this world his own
and the seals of these are written herein
yet others i must take with me
the spirit and daemon no longer known
anu have mercy on my soul

can't you see
that the world that we live in
political lies
are just corporate decisions
they'll take away
all the hopes and their promises
they'll put an end to the
land of the livin'
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
they got control
of the heart of a nation
their social tribes
seem so graciously
as time goes by
'cause time as you came see
will slowly die for you and me
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
so put an end
to this idolization
antagonizing so commonly
open your eyes
'cause the lie's there so plain to see
life goes on
there's no guarantees
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
they're bleeding so black

we're gonna take you back
through the pages of the past
just another lonely boy
i could laugh and play
and live in any other way
then the devil took my soul
the fortune and the fame
i knew i was not the same
and i know i'd never return
looking at the sky
i know i would never die
and forever shining through
wish the sky would say
that blue would turn to grey
and i know i'd be there
life was like a fantasy
taken by reality
does anyone remember me
you once knew me
flashes of the day
i knew i was here to stay
but no one stays the same
turn the pages back in time
through the chapters in my mind
life's too short to leave behind
it's too late now
life was like a fantasy
taken by reality
does anyone remember me
you once knew me
flashes of the day
i knew i was here to stay
but no one
knows my name

lies, broken dreams, dismal past
is there more in life i should have known
ending wars, ending pain
ending of mankind is insane
when there's all these possibilities
some will fail and some will achieve
even though in my youth
i didn't know but what can i do

and i may not ever see
in my pain, my suffering
cannot live for the rest of my life
d.n.r. do not resuscitate me

life, lost unseen behind the mask
and with the open arms will i grasp
open doors, open minds
ending all the madness i hate

and i may not ever see
in my pain, my misery
can not live for the rest of my life
d.n.r. do not resuscitate me, d.n.r

wing of sadness will hold my prayers
all this madness will end my fears
contempt in life, conceptualize
wrong or right, the ending of life
god, save me now

time, end it now, no going back
can you see the light as you pass
ending wars, ending pain
waited all my life to be saves

and i will not ever see
all the hate and suffering
can not live for the rest of my life
d.n.r. do not resuscitate me, d.n.r

cast to the fire
banned by the light
worship and listen to me
condemned in his mind
in his evil place
your fate is all that you'll see
i am the one
to show you the path
salvation is in the fields
listen up children and follow me
or i'll let you pay
the price of malachai!
disciples of the watch
obey!
or i'll burn you to that cross
holding the mass
the demon is cast
to resurrect your soul
calling to him
is like an evil sin
a prophet is what they're told
taking the land under command
killing friend or foe
feel the might of his evil wrath
desecrate your soul
disciples of the watch
obey!
or i'll burn you to that cross
cast to the fire
banned by the light
worship and listen to me
condemned in his mind
in his evil place
your fate is all that you'll see
i am the one
to show you the path
salvation is in the fields
listen up children and follow me
or i'll let you pay
the price of malachai!
disciples of the watch
obey!
or i'll burn you to that cross

i'm not one to say
where my feelings are going when they wither away
i pray to see another day
my heart's feeling like a needle lost in the hay
restrained to meet again
my friend do you think that we ever will
i know we are free...
the games are played with your life on the line
some lose, you win if you keep on trying
i don't mind doing the time, i'm happier being alive
now i know the means to my oppression were all lies
the only truth is your own most sacred lesson i've ever learned
i know we are free...
yeah!
yeah!
don't go!
no! don't look back!
just realize!
i've been robbed, i've been fooled
i intend now to make my own rules
dagger's edge cut the line, i've been down that road
too many times
what's to fear, fear no more
show my conscience what fears's for
now i know this is so real
what's done is done so do as you will!
i'm keeping alive! go on, no, don't look back
just realize where you've gone
where are you going to, no life's not done with you
you've only just begun, to live your life!
for you...

device of doom, pure savagery
a holocaust on land or sea
on blighted land these lords of war shall roam
dictator's oath, his destiny
destroyer of humanity
launch an assault that the world has never seen

nuclear warhead
dropping on the masses
leaving them all dead
before they reach the underground
seeking out the shelter

mushroom cloud last thing they see
vision blurred, their eyeballs bleed
brutality… fuels the death machine
organs fail, the blood shall seep
open sores beyond belief
slowly rot as you die from the inside out

nuclear warhead
dropping on the masses
leaving them all dead
before they reach the underground
turning the streets red
everything's turned to ashes
welcome to world war three

everyone is gonna die
there is no escape
your lungs turning black
no one can save you
it's armageddon!

all hope is lost
the earth's been blown away
it's pouring down
unholy acid rain
forever raining blood
forever blot the sun
depraved, no sign of life
in darkness, devoid of light

nuclear warhead
dropping on the masses
leaving them all dead
before they reach the underground
turning the streets red
everything's turned to ashes
the war of the world
there is no more world
welcome to world war three

world burning down
beyond the dark side
nobody here left to live

takers of humanity, elders paranoid
the time is now
give up this world you once destroyed
society versus the underground
their battles fought and lost
the time has come
to rule the world at any cost
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here
cities turn to battlefields
a deadly spell is cast
corpses falling one by one
until the last
the preacher speaks of prophecy
so many years before
no one escapes their punishment
the gods of war
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here
death is like an empty space
feel no thoughts of fear
the future cries
as mother nature sheds a tear
the world becomes a prisoner
a victim of its crime
the human race is now a race
against time
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here

accuse you of a crime
sentenced to endless time
the price you have to pay

sworn in by the stand
your rights are gone
the system's banned
they think you are a liar
a trial by fire
hey!
this is what the people say
a new way
a trial by fire!
locked in an empty cell
your life becomes a living hell
the river of fire flows
time only knows!
trapped by flames of fury
ordered unto by the jury
death is their desire
thrown in the fire!
hey!
this is what the people say
a new way
a trial by fire!
quiver by the fiery light
cringing as your soul ignites
the book of law's been thrown away
starting today!
the system before the war
is gone for now and evermore
there is no sentence higher
a trial by fire!
hey!
this is what the people say
a new way
a trial by fire!
