the lies, the weight
deceit, decay
the lies, the weight
it's clear i lost my way
deceit, decay
decomposing

i thought i was an architect, but i was just moving dirt
stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt
i hadn't been building
the time was spent digging
boring the barriers that kept others away
the deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall

so now i know there is no one else to blame

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave
inside of my own grave

beneath my lies
delusional enough to think i'd designed something great
like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate
i hadn't been building
the time was spent digging
an ugly truth from which there was no way to escape
nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what i'd become

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave
what i'd become
buried alive inside of my own grave

beneath my pride crushing me
beneath my lies collapsing
but we are still alive
we are still alive

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave
my own grave

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
the lies and the weight, i know i lost my way
what i'd become
buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive, buried alive

finally forced to face what i'd become
what i'd become in my own grave
buried in my own grave alive

i refuse to let go of the memories
'cause they've changed everything inside of me

if i could go back now to save myself the loss
substanceless character brought back would be the cost
agony today is tomorrow's strength
so don't run away 'cause misery is
evolving into something that we can't see
evolving and becoming, transforming
so don't run away

the pain can never be erased
remain and turn it into strength, turn it into strength

what do we value in the midst of complacency?
but in despair, we beg for something, anything
even our mistakes can have the power
to light the way like a glaring tower

the pain can never be erased
remain and turn it into strength
from our failures, we are refined
replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined

healed scars can be stronger than skin
the wounds we have can be rewritten
redefined, redefined, redefined
agony today is tomorrow's strength, redefined
so don't run away

the pain can never be erased

the pain can never be erased
remain and turn it into strength
the pain can never be erased
remain and turn it into strength
from our failures, we are refined
replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined
from our failures we are refined
replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined

don't run away
misery's evolving

the wise before me chose to refine themselves
melt away their shortcomings by enduring trials
a process we will all undertake
even if we try to prevent change

face it before you are pulled in
face it while it's still within

like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
we aren't born, we aren't born this way
we are reborn, we are reborn through pain

though i too have endured fire
i wasn't wise enough to ignite the flame myself
but carried enough fuel for a flicker to excel

face it before you are pulled in
face it while it's still within
face it before you are pulled in
face it while it's still within

shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
we aren't born, we aren't born this way
we are reborn through pain
shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
through pain we are reborn, we are reborn through pain

the time has come to watch the fire grow
find new things to throw in, don't let the flames get low
i've grown used to the heat that makes me reevaluate
what i carry with me and what should be thrown away

face it before you are pulled in
face it while it's still within

like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
we aren't born, we aren't born this way
we are reborn through pain
shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
we are reborn, we are reborn through pain

yeah

only through struggle have i found rest
with a piece of me taken away
i begin to understand
hollow out this machine-like chest
with its gears that turn to make me feel
and assembled thoughts that fade away

only through struggle have i found rest
only through struggle have i found rest

remove from me (from me)
(this de...) this deception (...ception)
(that i) that i called love (called love)
(that i) that i called love (called love)

yeah

with its gears that turn to make me feel
and assembled thoughts that fade away

remove from me (remove from me)
this deception (that i, that i)
that i called love (that i called love)
that i called love

only through struggle have i found rest
with a piece of me taken away

i begin to understand
i begin to understand
i begin to understand love

have you ever been blinded by the pain?
blinded, blinded by the pain

unwilling to see, senseless
so blinded by selfishness
only focusing on myself
and ignoring anyone else
becoming driven by despair
feeling trapped into a corner
losing more and more of reality
perceiving all the hurt only one-sidedly

have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache

losing yourself
feeling too powerless to change
stuck and unable to escape
incapable to see another way
i need someone to shake me, to wake me
i don't even need full clarity
just to start the shift from blind to blurry

have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache
and does that mean we cannot change?
or will we always be seen that way?

will we always be seen that way?
and does that really mean we have not changed?

or does it only mean
the truth is not in how we're seen?
but in the actions that we're now determined to take
revealing the new path we chose to mend the heartache
was it a pattern or a disastrous mistake?
is the truth in what you see or what i say?

have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache
and does that mean we cannot change?
or will we always be seen that way?

be seen that way?
blinded by pain? blinded by the pain

and does that really mean we have not changed?

for so, long i, have felt alone
content, to live with unrest
longing, faded, into countless, nights that buried my, weary heart
you brought an end, to this, dead hour
and meaning, to a, a calloused life
held in your arms, but too far from my heart
held in your arms, but too far from my heart

these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in
these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in mine!

i remember the way you looked, at me
and the way you drew, drew me close with one, deep sigh
scattering pieces of my, my restless mind
forgetting all, that we, have left, left, behind
we have left behind
we have, left behind
we have left behind

these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in
these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in
these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in
these thoughts, will carry me
through the darkest nights
while your eyes rest in

how many years have we waited
for a ship that never set sail?
and how many days have we wasted
chasing a love that was not our own?
i sat ashore and watched as one
hopeless wave crashed upon another
while my thoughts ran to the hills
my heart never reached the sea
with only delusions of an endless journey
i am left with an ocean between you and me
an ocean between
is this your salvation?
is this all you can give?
i will not stand in reflection
of someone else's dream
the gate to my heart has been weld shut
with the splendor of my aspirations closed in
how many years have we waited
for a ship that never set sail?
and how many days have we wasted
chasing a love that was not our own?
is this your salvation?
is this your salvation?
is this all you can give?
i will not stand in reflection
of someone else's dream

i will not stand in reflection
of someone else's dream

this world was never worthy
but how can i call it unfaithful
every promise was fulfilled
as decay crawled from it's throat
like the dead rising from an open grave
like the dead rising
from an open grave

lips of splendor and tongue of deceit
all dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste

like those gasping for their last breath
we cannot hide there's nothing left
like those gasping for their last breath
we cannot hide there's nothing left
nothing left
nothing left
there is nothing left
nothing left

if all my sorrow has led me here
then i would cry all of my tears
to have this chance
to have this chance again
to have this chance
to have this chance
and know there's more than this
and know there's more than you

like those gasping for their last breath
we cannot hide there's nothing left
like those gasping for their last breath
we cannot hide there's nothing left

we are all comatose
we are overfed and under, undernourished, yearning for something more
never starving yet never quite satisfied
carnal but without useful flesh or mind
i am a walking contradiction that's found consistency
consuming everything, all without producing sustenance
in the parallels we struggle, struggle to upkeep
there is a better way for us to be set free
from all it is we crave, there must be more to life than to simply stay alive
to simply stay alive
we are not the same as i hope to show
there is a better way if we just let go
we are not, we are not the same
we are not, we are not the same
let go
in the tension between devouring want or simple need
it's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve
we are not the same as i hope to show
there is a better way if we just let go
we are not, we are not the same
we are not, we are not the same
let go
we are not the same
and in the parallels we struggle to upkeep
there's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free
and in the parallels we struggle to upkeep
there's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free
we are not the same as i hope to show
there is a better way if we just let go
we are not, we are not the same
we are not, we are not the same
let go
we are not the same

we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears
we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears

but what wisdom is there within us
to live based on the feeling of our hearts?
how many times has instinct let us down?
never to be thought through, never to be questioned!
say what you really mean
when your ambition calls you, calls you!
for what use is there, is there in praying
if you will only hear what you want to hear?

we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears

we speak of fighting to resist this world
but what about the battle within us?
if we have chosen to live against the grain
then why are we all facing the same way?

there is no difference between us and them
if we all blindly seek truth from sentiments


we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears
we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears
we have all heard what we wanted to hear
"truth" that sounds right to our ears

that night that i never came home
wandering souls captured my thoughts
emptiness filled my mind
urgency spoke her lies in the confines of these grey walls
i watched them move together
taking me places i cannot remember (remember)
we have been poured out into a loveless bride

how quickly i forget
that this is meaningless
*how quickly i forget
that this is meaningless*

in a world passing through my fingers
i still chase the wind

how quickly i forget
that this is meaningless
*how quickly i forget
that this is meaningless*

what have i learned from yesterday
what have i learned from yesterday?

pulled both ways, but still suspended
the worst of each, reduced and blended
still suspended, suspended

i thought i was stuck between two worlds
because i was not willing to let go
recklessly pulled both ways
but somehow still suspended
the worst of each, reduced and blended
but as life unfolded, i realized
the momentum to drift from side to side
came from within, came from inside

i feel torn between two hearts dying, but i'll trade them in for one
broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would i hold on?

one heart turned black, the other blue and bruised
arms breaking, arms breaking from the dreams
dreams shattered, the dreams that i can't reach
there has to be, there has to be a choice i have not seen

i feel torn between two hearts dying, but i'll trade them in for one
broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would i hold on?
i feel torn between two hearts dying, but i'll trade them in for one

one darkened over time burning away the shame
erasing hidden insights i did not want to be seen
the other was beaten from being exposed
so it hurt less to never hold it close

i feel torn between two hearts dying, but i'll trade them in for one
broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would i hold on?
i feel torn between two hearts dying, but i'll trade them in for one
so why would i hold on? i'll trade them in for one

neither heart had power to fill my veins
or be the source of who i want to be
pulled both ways, but still suspended

reality no longer battles perception
this letter's written to no one

sincere
i sought your truth and divine purpose
through myths of revelation
guidance all wrapped up in a paper box
supported only so long
as my mind was the enemy
i could not in conscience hold on

as we face distress
we must not lose heart
stand fast and press on
triumph awaits
as we face distress
we must not lose heart
stand fast and press on
triumph awaits us

the powerful constant that i had once leaned on is no longer there (no longer)
you call this shameful disbelief
a process like losing my closest friend

as we face distress
we must not lose heart
stand fast and press on
triumph awaits
as we face distress
we must not lose heart
stand fast and press on
triumph awaits us

sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
before we can rebuild them again
a greater foundation
we watch our whole lives
sometimes we have to watch our whole lives
fall apart
before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
a greater foundation

i wish there was another way
but no amount of devotion can fix this
triumph awaits
triumph awaits
triumph awaits
triumph awaits
triumph awaits

sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
a greater foundation (we watch our whole lives fall apart)
sometimes we have to watch our whole lives (rebuild them again)
before we can rebuild them again
a greater foundation

the wreckage seemed too great for me
i saw my dreams collapsing, collapsing
but through debris, the tragedy
not one of us died fighting
the wreckage

we somehow found a way through storming weather
enduring skies turned grey when we all said never
the winds, the rain
downpour needed to cultivate

we don't get to choose when it rains
we can fight or just get washed away
will we be transformed or
feel like we're drowning, drowning?
the wreckage

so use the storms ahead to flood out shortcomings
and then use what is left to water what is worth planting
the winds, the rain
downpour needed to cultivate
debris, tragedy
but not one of us died, but not one of us died fighting

we don't get to choose when it rains
we can fight or just get washed away
will we be transformed or
feel like we're drowning?

will we fight or just get washed away?
and now the mountains that we face are starting to look more like hills
we rose to a higher plain so the whole horizon fell
it fell, the whole horizon fell

through the debris of tragedy
not one of us died fighting, fighting

we don't get to choose when it rains
we can fight or just get washed away
will we be transformed or
feel like we're drowning?
we don't get to choose when it rains
we can fight or just get washed away
will we be transformed or
feel like we're drowning?

the wreckage that once seemed insurmountable to me
is now becoming a part of rebuilding
we somehow found a way through storming weather
enduring skies turned grey when we all said never
so use the storms ahead to flood out shortcomings
and then use what is left to water what is worth planting

deep roots that refuse, deep roots that refuse
deep roots that refuse, that refuse to break
deep roots that refuse, refuse to break
deep roots that refuse to break

the life that i sought was already like a jail
long before i was ever bound

wrapped up in chains
no one had built the bonds
use to hold me captive
i had locked away myself in a captain-less ship
destined to destroy ashore
destruction was my savior
crushing collapse
crashing from the impact

i can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
but i keep fighting to get away
the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

my control disappeared
'cause it was never real

aboard a ship with nowhere to go
guided by lifelessness, a skeleton without a soul
crushing collapse, looming ahead
crashing is imminent from the impact

i can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
but i keep fighting to get away
the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me
i can't escape the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

though i found freedom when
i stopped fighting everyone else
and loosened up the anchor
that i had tied around myself
i let go of the chains, chains
just let go of the chains
i let go of the chains used to hold me in
my addictions killing me from within

i can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
but i keep fighting to get away
the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me
i can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
but i keep fighting to get away
the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

just let go of the chains, chains
i let go of the chains used to hold me in my addiction

i took what you gave me, destroyed it all
i  had to lose everything to know that i was wrong
and  now i see what was true all along
a void in me, now that everything is gone
now that everything is gone

the  emptiness can be a source of clarity
taking  away a way for us to hide, always revealing
no choice but to rebuild, no voice, no peace, no love, no home
nothing  left to hold, nothing left but hope

take my broken frame
what still remains free from the chains, free from the chains

nothing left to hold, nothing left but hope
like  hunting for prey that we don't even need to track
so easy to follow what's next, we are left with only one path, one path
no choice but to rebuild, no voice, no peace, no love, no home
nothing left but hope

take my broken frame
what still remains free from the chains, free from the chains
take what's left in me, what's worth saving
no matter how much time it takes

from merely hope, we are brought back to life
from broken bones, we revive
take what's left and create
take what's left and then rebuild

you had every reason to give up on me
but you stood and waited when everyone ran away

i took your gifts, destroyed them all
and then lost everything to know that i was wrong
but you still carried me when you could barely walk
you reminded me i was never too far gone

take my broken frame
what still remains free from the chains, free from the chains
take what's left in me, what's worth saving
no matter how much time it takes
take my broken frame
what still remains free from the chains, free from the chains

take what's left
take what's left and rebuild

forever your eyes will hold the memory
i saw your heart as it overtook me
we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away
i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
with that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me
and all i knew is what had overtaken me
with no reason i am comforted by inability to understand
forever your eyes will hold the memory
i saw your heart as it overtook me
we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away
i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
forever your eyes will hold the memory
forever your eyes will hold the memory
forever your eyes will hold the memory
when i wake from this dream
will your smile still open my heart
and leave me transparent?
when i wake from this dream
will your smile still open my heart
and leave me transparent?

you've lost touch
you've lost touch with the outcasts

have you forgotten your own past?
have you forgotten that your house is made of glass?
so while you're pointing your fingers
you are unable to use your hands
to help with solving
solving real and present problems
'cause we're appealing
and you've become too perfect to understand

you're a gatekeeper
blocking the entrance to nowhere
you're a gatekeeper
trying to keep others in despair, yeah
trying to keep others in despair

i don't want you to get dirty reaching down to a lowly creature
i don't want you to show mercy and make me like you, self-righteous preacher
did you think you were the only one
the only one who held the keys?
did you hope that your judgement would
spread just like a disease?

you're a gatekeeper
blocking the entrance to nowhere
you're a gatekeeper
trying to keep others in despair

the self-importance of the moral elite
to think that their approval means anything, yeah

so eager to capitalize
capitalize on other people's pain
but when the healing begins
so quick to turn away
have you forgotten?
have you forgotten your own past?

you're a gatekeeper
blocking the entrance to nowhere
you're a gatekeeper
keeping others in despair

i never wanted and i never cared before
i never wanted and i never cared before
take it back, this is a new day
i never wanted and i never cared before
take it back, this is...
how i long to regress
to the days before i took upon myself
(for tomorrow) the obsessions of this world
(may fall) a day of innocence equating beauty
(and today) and tomorrow may fall
(is already) and today is already gone
tomorrow may fall
today is already gone
take it back, this is a new day
i never wanted, this is a new day
and i never cared before
i never wanted, i never wanted
and i never cared before
i've grown tired of chasing
convinced i was in need
and now the years i've spent
only a slave to this
tomorrow may fall
and today is already gone
i will no longer adore
these things that will never satisfy me
i've seen my world change
and then go back to where it came
in this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die
in this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die
to die
(i have seen my) in this vicious circle
(my world change) we are all
(and then go back) brought back to life
(back to where it came) only to die
(but without these) in this vicious circle
(barren obsessions) we are all
(i am simply) brought back to life
(i am simply free) only to die
i've seen my world change
and then go back to where it came

94 hours of regret
for me to realize what i held
unfading beauty, not just a face
i held its innocence within my heart

go!
now i won't let go
i won't let go
i won't let go
(now i...) i won't let go
(now i...) i won't let go

the torment of your eyes
has awakened my soul
the torment of your eyes
has awakened my soul
the pain of a moment's time
will forever beg your forgiveness
forgiveness

94 hours
for me to realize
i held the unfading beauty
i held your innocence
