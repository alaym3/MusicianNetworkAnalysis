to be far from hood, but to understand the streets
i never threw away that paper with my grammy speech
because i haven’t hit the pinnacles i plan to reach

my future's so bright but my past so ugly
and i just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
so i accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
all this space created, all that hard work it got me here
so what i look like telling a nigga that i shouldn't be here
power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
and i'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
out in the open all alone, i felt the coldest air
secluded in my thoughts in fear
no one to talk to, no one there
not even a voice, not even an ear
no one alive, no one to care
now i got a power circle, now i'm on a power trip
and they calling me counterfeit cause i ain't gave a coward shit
stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
it's funny how it comes full circle
now they wanna be a part of the power circle
they wanna be a part of the power circle

may the wind be at your back
may the bad be in your past
may the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
and you realize your goals
and what's life without grind
those niggas, yo' niggas?
hope those niggas real as mine
may the wind be at your back
may the bad be in your past
may the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
and you realize your goals
and what's life without grind
those niggas, yo' niggas?
hope those niggas real as mine

there's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
there's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
there's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
and i'm on tour, jordan 4's, tom ford
and i ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
i give her d, i throw up two, i call that shit a safety
shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
and my inner sanctum need real estate i'm out my cabeza
jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy i made it
i be feeling like brother malcolm just out of the nation
allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
i seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
so shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
my circle small but regardless, my circumference official
my clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
they gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
i'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
at least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
if they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
and we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

i'm like welcome to the power circle
i came a long way, i started with a powdered circle
clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
lotta talking, lotta tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
kill my dog, i kill your dog, we tied even, i'd believe it
if you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
my cousin knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
and still make the profit
the streets say i'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
i'm just being honest
back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
look at my persona, i dreamed it, woke up and conquered
and there was commas after commas, i eat 'em like benihanas
put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
and the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
cause we the only thing to talk about
cause we the only thing to talk about

look inside the eyes of the last mohicans survived
you won't last a weekend outside
seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
see a demon don't compromise
and so i walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
i'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
i might as well put all my killers in ysl
put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
hell's fire, i never lie, you will never grind
i know the priors they running by us when we do crime
i know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
when they heard that ohio state gave me 30 racks in july
oh lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
when they day breaks and you earned them stripes
and you learned that strike
from upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
it's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
the death rate will eventually climb, so eventually i'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
so about face if it ain't business, i get offended, i mind
now one fake, i'm a realist in strive, i'm a billion in five
well a billion cause the limit is the sky and i live on cloud nine
and i recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
but pussy, we'll hurt you
life in the power circle

regardless of how it goes down
life goes on, am i right?
tried to warn you niggas
i tried to warn you niggas
it's too late now
double m-g
too much cake
too much power
too much respect
bow down, nigga
ugh!

yo this chris rock! i'm in here with my man ricky rozay. we in here drinkin' this belaire rosé. that's how we do it. that's all we do, belaire rosé! eatin' wingstop, what you know about wingstop, nigga? you don't know nothin' about no wingstop. you can't handle this, nigga, you can't handle, sit down in the corner, shut the fuck up and take notes, bitch. just take notes

i used to see niggas on tv, man
i used to be like, "yo, them niggas so blessed"
you know what i'm sayin'?
if i had that opportunity, you know what i'm sayin'?
(maybach music)
(black metaphor)

damn, i grew up on that cash money
bling bling, was well known to flash money
hit the liquor store, after my vic authority
quick to switch a bitch up, pick up me a thicker shorty
pistol on me, nigga, ain't no pickin' on me
we veterans so it's better if you go get your army
a thug holiday is where your body lay
me and trick daddy come from a common place
so us gettin' money, that's just a conversation
it's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations
cigars in the oval office, ronald reagan
hug barack obama, whisper, "as-salāmu ʿalaykum"
live for the moment, die for the streets
bible on the dash, kilos on the seat
i used to see you niggas on my tv screen
and wondered what was life like, was it all a dream?
and then i met you out on livenation dates
came to the realization that your watch was fake
damn... you nearly broke my heart
i really thought you niggas really owned them cars

i used to look up to you, nigga
ugh

hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
i'ma bring my niggas with me if i lose or win
bought a fleet of cars, let the bitches tag along
this little thing of ours, not the ones to tattle on
omerta the code, met ball, parties with vogue
still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose
such a head rush until the day the feds rush
that's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
leased whips, bad blood, that shit'll sink ships
fast money comin' slow, you better think quick
rap game, so much fuck shit done
that's why this .45 in my trukfit trunks
fuck a skateboard, i went and got a wraith, boy
catholic record labels, niggas gettin' raped, boy
birdman's a priest, moans in his synagogue
publishin' is a sin, repent, forgive me, lord
shots fired, home invasion out on palm isle
red beam detonators, who the bomb now?
look you in your eyes, nigga, 'fore i say good night
and pray that mannie fresh'll get to see the light

damn, stunna
i loved you, nigga
hate it came to this
(maybach music)

you stole them boys' pub' and bought a foreclosure
scott storch demons in it, which is more poison
i handed over records, never charged a coin
but could sense the sentiment, i'm talkin' all along
all miami issues, rozay handle for him
same way big ducky do for me in california
never slippin', got relationships with the trillest niggas
tony draper, j prince and even jimmy henchmen
plenty killers and i know that diddy with it
tyga, chinchilla, really ain't no penny pinchin'
knew that you would never visit bg
turk came home, take that boy a three piece
shootin' dope, usin' coke, movin' like you the folks
sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult
you would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
but was in our pockets by the time we count to five
i pray you find the kindness in your heart for wayne
his entire life, he gave you what there was to gain
i watched this whole debacle so i'm part to blame
last request, can all producers please get paid?

can't believe this shit, homie
i still love you, nigga
how the fuck, nigga, you touch half a billion, nigga
and your team starvin', nigga?
you on an island, nigga, you came to my city, nigga
i let you in my city, nigga
and what hurt me the most, nigga
is how you did my brother khaled, nigga
khaled was loyal to you, nigga
the pain i seen in my brother's eye, nigga
facetimin' my nigga, nigga, he took that to the chin, nigga
that's why my nigga blessed!
that's why my nigga khaled blessed!
you put my nigga in the hole, homie
i don't feel you for that, my nigga
that shit hurt me, you under-dig? umm
it's painful what you see real niggas do
when they get the paper, when they get the bag
you can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
i'll never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
lil bruh and them, always remember
lil bruh and them, this for lil bruh and them
stunna

huh! this is special
extremely special

when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh, yeah
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh, yeah
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah

it's funny because, it's been on my mind lately
having a dope beat, a dope idea
sixteen bars ain't enough!
how the fuck, can i squeeze my whole life into a sixteen-bar verse?
you know, so many different levels, to living your life and
depicting, with your wordplay
exactly what life means to you, and sixteen ain't enough
i know y'all gonna feel me on this one
you gotta feel me on this one, huh!

it's funny how things change, funny how time fly
more than my feet travel, the more that i feel fly
more that i make now, the more that the chicks smile
she call me a local nigga, i opened a swiss account
eisenhower status, etta james on the dash
smooth as john coltrane cruising in the cadillac
seville, feel my life on the real
we the last poets so this is a world premiere
rolling like mick jagger, the women just getting badder
all i see is the money, cream, eric clapton
and all i wanted was one, sixteen ain't enough
talking that fast money, fifteen every month
when your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
everything i ever wore was once worn before
roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
dressed like sammy davis, steaming my marijuana
double m g's, double m fees
we in every hood, nigga: government cheese
yacht to yachtmasters, ol' dirty bastard
floor seat for the heat, paper that i'm stackin
better put away a penny for the rainy days
pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
living like scottie pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
started off with a scribble, now i'm flowing a river
she say my heart cold, i'm naming my son december
whitney died night before the grammys – damn, what a memory
trump tower and i started with a 10 speed
born broke, had to use a nigga's instincts
now i get a hundred racks for the sixteen
waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
niggas hating, i'm just watching on the big screen
three stacks on the beat and the kicks mean

when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh, yeah
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh, yeah
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah

you know how sometimes you got so much to say but
they on-, they only give you sixteen? hehehe
man it's like, i mean, i got so much to say
the world has said so much to me
and i just wanna give right back to 'em
but, i only get sixteen, that's like a cage, you know?
i really can't say what i wanna say, you know?
it's just a glimpse, that's all
just one uh, one little single glimpse, just a page
but i guess i'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking
aight

summer '88, or was it '89?
or was it wintertime? aw never mind
i'm in my room, booming
drawin' ll cool j album covers with crayolas on construction paper
i'm tryna fuck my neighbor, i'm tryna hook my waves up
i'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
before lil' marc was jacob, before them girls wore makeup
before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
before my mama wake up, before my crumbs would cake up
before they tell me they love me and we'll never break up
before the time she makes love to someone that i thought was my homeboy
but boy, was i wrong now
i don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and a porch
and a porsche, and a horse and unfortunately but of course
an assortment of torches that scorches the skin
when they enter, intruders whose tutors did
a lousy job, how's he god if he lets lucifer let loose on us?
that noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
make us think we do so much and do it big
like they don't let us win, i can't pretend
but i do admit, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
hence, why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
then go grab the finest wine and drink it
like we know which grape and which region it came from
as if we can name 'em; hint-hint—it ain't, um, welch's
hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
y'all can't measure my worth
but when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the greek gods
because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
i feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
all kellygreen with envy while i'm jelly beans descending
into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smile
with such a devilish grin, like "where the hell have you been?"
she's yelling, "selling’s a sin," well, so is telling young men
that selling is a sin if you don’t offer new ways to win
a dolphin gon' shake his fin, regardless if he gets in
or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
and flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall i hold my tongue?
i miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm
and not set off these alarms, when camera’s snap-snap-snap
return fire, pap-pap-pap pap pap-pap pap pap
they’ll learn why, mere privacy, so essential
they won't make no laws, i break their laws 'til they see out our window
i take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
forsake them all, i hate them all, don’t like em, don’t pretend to
yeah something tells me, we ain’t in kansas anymore
all that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
all the women we were pursuing, now they want more
and they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours

when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh (lord!) yeah (oh lord!)
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
when sixteen ain't enough
when sixteen ain't enough
ooh, yeah (when sixteen ain't enough)
aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah (when sixteen ain't enough)
breakdown, breakdown

does your mama know you see me? does she know you're freaky?
does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya i am speaking?
do you ever ponder where i'm at when you get sleepy?
how the hell i'm gonna tell the youth don't be me? yeah
hahahahah, hahahah, i love it
does your daddy think you perfect? does he know for certain?
does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
do he think i'm 2pac 'cause i'm black and put the words in?
does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman? yeah

hahahah, it's funny because, we could've short-changed you (huh!)
but because we love you, we go that extra mile
break it down for 'em, andré, huh!

maybach music

you wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. these niggas is roaches. these niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. i'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. you don't wanna motherfuckin'... you don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
you don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. you can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

momma's tryna save me but she don't know i'm tryna save her
man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til i got this paper
you're nobody 'til somebody kills you

"blast for me" – the last words from my nigga
on the pavement, born killers, body shivers
drug money, dollar figures
hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
havin' sushi down in nobu
strapped like an afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
so it's bang, no survivors
only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
stalkin' niggas on their ig's, never; i be
still solo, under armour still polo
no wire, on fire
my desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
nine lives, sk with the cooler
makaveli in the 'rari, still b-i double g, i, e
i pray you smoke with me
go to bed with a kilo like casino
janet reno, we all we got the creed of nino
pretty cars in the driveway
if you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

momma's tryna save me but she don't know i'm tryna save her
man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til i got this paper
you're nobody 'til somebody kills you

you fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas? what the fuck is their culture? where the fuck is their souls at? what defines you? these niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces. you wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with god, nigga? make up your goddamn mind

i'm from where the streets test you
niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
the narcotics is our product
the by-product, you walk up on me, i cock it
new mercedes as it peels off
nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
i said my prayer as i'm countin' sheep
never really athletic, but i play for keeps, do you feel me?
the mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
we kill 'em and takin' their bitches, r.i.p
chinchillas on a winter night
black bottles when i'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
and i'm never on that tour bus
just a decoy for niggas, the pj's for two of us
ciroc boys down to die for diddy
my niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
touch mine, until it's even: kill
like i'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with steven hill
we magic city of the networks
cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

momma's tryna save me but she don't know i'm tryna save her
man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til i got this paper
you're nobody 'til somebody kills you

fuck, y'all wanna talk about fuckin' jewelries and bentley's and hublot's and fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls and fuckin' mansions niggas ain't got. niggas can't even pay the irs, let alone their fuckin' staff, nigga. you gotta tell the truth, man. the truth'll set you free, son, the truth will set you free

(hahahah!)
just being somebody that the neighborhood respected
and my mama could be proud of, was the apple of my eye
that's all i ever wanted, just being something, man
so at that point what else can you ask for?
(m-m-maybach music)

tears runnin' down a nigga face
in a room full of failures, i feel out of place
still sleepin' on the floor when you deserve better
got you reekin' through the cold even in warm weather
i told meek, "i wouldn't trust nicki
instead of beefin' with your dog, you just give 'em some distance"
we all make mistakes, let's not be too specific
we like, "i rather be a killer than be a statistic"
i never fold, no, i never ran
on my soul, i'll roll like an avalanche
i thank the lord i got some great friends
that's why every bottle i open, i say, "amen"
just had seizure at the super bowl
woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
if it's more than a quarter million, i'll count it twice
pucci broke my heart, shit, i call it life
and never will i call it right
not perfect but i'm the one you would call at night
travelin' the world, i'm just reppin' my city
but rarely do i hear that this nigga done did it
when niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
'cause the loss of life's the only thing niggas believe
so i pray you listen carefully
then i become another motherfuckin' casualty

always speak and say hi
you just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
you even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
you do it for the love of you and i (for the love of you and)

standin' on your block but you so out of place
uncle on the couch, momma runnin' out of space
lights off so you never tend to speak much
go your separate ways every time the lease up
a fat ugly nigga, thought i'd never be nothin'
another tree stump, happy with his free lunch
duckin' pigeons, i'm an eagle on a sunny day
flap my wings once a week, pray i glide safe
i want fried chicken at my funeral
rolls royces, dope boys, sway interviews
everybody dyin' for the same things
cop kill a nigga, don't nobody gangbang
i'm happy donald trump became the president
because we gotta destroy, before we elevate
real shit, look at me inside the white house
with a pocket full of weed inside the white house
dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
u.s. treasury addressing me, mad at my address
own the biggest residential pool in the u.s
drake and kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water
then i go an tell what happened to my only daughter
so her daddy told it to her firsthand
never perfect but it's not just 'bout them purses

always speak and say hi
you just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
you even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
you do it for the love of you and i (for the love of you and)
maybach music

the streets could never teach me
all the things i got from you
i found myself in the wrong lane
and i ended up in pain, pain
i was strolling down a dark street
when this girl passed me by
she said you've always been a good friend (always been a good friend)
and you never never never let me down
i'll just fall back, never turn back
let it go, let it go
i'll just fall back, never turn back
let it go, let it go

always speak and say hi
you just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
you even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
you do it for the love of you and i (for the love of you and)

i see how these niggas playin'

i look in my fridge, my shit lookin' scarce
i got a few kids, we need some shit on the shelf
i get a knock at the door, they say my rent overdue
and while my niggas sell dope and don't know what else to do
the only thing on my mind, i'm tryin' to keep on the lights
i call up my slime, i need a kilo tonight
everything went well, i'm eatin' steak, no more soup
then i parked the caprice, i went and got me a coupe
everything takes time, but this shit came fast
niggas standin' in line, they wanna hold me back
i multiplied my hustle, stimulated my mind
motivated my niggas and we'll never divide, no!

these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these hoes won't hold me back

first i got me a taurus, then i copped me a lexus
i took over florida, my connect out of texas
then i start sippin' purple, got my shit screwed
when you feedin' your circle, watch your shipments improve
fabricate 'bout your fortune, all my fabric's imported
fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage
24k my toilet, all my taxes reported
all my exes deported, shout-out texas, new orleans
all these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance
i just bought me the purest, but i need some insurance
niggas watch who you fuckin' just to hate on your bitches
niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspension

these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these niggas won't hold me back
these hoes won't hold me back

momma workin' three jobs 'til i told her to quit
how we rose from the sewers, funny now i'm the shit
niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion
had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis
killers ride for that paycheck, ak, okay, check
bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex
these niggas won't hold me back, told the feds they sold me sack
whip 'em right and then come right back
whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

these niggas won't hold me back

rumors of lucifer, i don’t know who to trust
whole world want my demise—turn the music up
hear me clearly: if y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
fuck all these fairytales

this is a hail mary pass, y’all interfering
he without sin shall cast the first stone
so y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
