warm my mind near your gentle stove
turn me out and i'll wander baby
stumblin' in the neon groves

she holds her head so high
like a statue in the sky
her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
when she moves my brain screams out this song
sidewalk crouches at her feet
like a dog that begs for something sweet
do you hope to make her see, you fool?
do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

sunlight in her hair

(she came) blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh
(she came) yeah, the river runs red down the legs of the city
(she came) the women are crying red rivers of weepin'

she came in town and then she drove away
sunlight in her hair


indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

blood in the streets in the town of new haven
blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of venice
blood in my love in the terrible summer
bloody red sun of fantastic la

blood screams her brain, they chop off her fingers
blood will be born in the birth of a nation
blood is the rose of mysterious union

there's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
blood in the streets, the town of chicago
blood on the rise, it's following me

strange days have tracked us down
they're going to destroy
our casual joys

voices will signal their tired end
the hostess is grinning
her guests sleep from sinning
hear me talk of sin
and you know this is it
yeah!

strange days have found us
and through their strange hours
we linger alone
bodies confused
memories misused
as we run from the day
to a strange night of stone
