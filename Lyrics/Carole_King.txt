looking out on the morning rain
i used to feel so uninspired
and when i knew i had to face another day
lord, it made me feel so tired
before the day i met you, life was so unkind
your love was the key to my peace of mind
cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like
a natural woman (woman)
when my soul was in the lost and found
you came along to claim it
i didn't know just what was wrong with me
till your kiss helped me name it
now i'm no longer doubtful of what i'm living for
cause if i make you happy i don't need to do more
cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like
a natural woman (woman)
oh, baby, what you've done to me
(what you've done to me)
you make me feel so good inside
(good inside)
and i just want to be
(want to be)
close to you
you make me feel so alive
cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel like
a natural woman
you make me feel
you know you make me feel
you make me feel like
a natural woman
you know you, you make me feel
you make me feel like
you make me feel like
a natural woman
natural woman 

stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
there's something wrong here, there can be no denying
one of us is changing
or maybe we just stopped trying

and it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it
something inside has died
and i can't hide and i just can't fake it
oh no no no no (no no, no no)

it used to be so easy living here with you
you were light and breezy and i knew just what to do
now you look so unhappy and i feel like a fool

and it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
something inside has died
and i can't hide and i just can't fake it
ohhhh, nooo no
{instrumental}
(do do do do do do do do doooo do dooooo dahhhhh)
there'll be good times again for me and you
but we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
still i'm glad for what we had and how i once loved you

but it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
something inside has died and i can't hide
and i just can't fake it
ohhhh, nooo no no no no

it's too late, baby
it's too late, now darlin'
it's too late 

so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
doesn't help to know you're just time away
long ago i reached for you and there you stood
holding you again could only do me good
oh, how i wish i could
but you're so far away
one more song about moving along the highway
can't say much of anything that's new
if i could only work this life out my way
i'd rather spend it being close to you

but you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
doesn't help to know you're so far away
traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
nothing else to do but close my mind
i sure hope the road don't come to own me
there's so many dreams i've yet to find
but you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
doesn't help to know you're so far away 

my life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
an everlasting vision of the ever changing view
a wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
a tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold
once amid the soft silver sadness in the sky
there came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
he wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leather hide
and a coat of many colors, yellow-green on either side
he moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree
and his hand came down empty
soon within my tapestry along the rutted road
he sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
it seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
and i wept to see him suffer, though i didn't know him well
as i watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
a figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard
in times of deepest darkness, i've seen him dressed in black
now my tapestry's unraveling, he's come to take me back
he's come to take me back 

i feel the earth
move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down
i feel my heart start to trembling
whenever you're around

ooh, baby, when i see your face
mellow as the month of may
oh, darling, (i can't stand it)
when you look at me that way

i feel the earth
move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down
i feel my heart start to trembling
whenever (you're around)

ooh, darling, when you're near me
and you tenderly call my name
i know that
(my emotions)
are something i just can't tame
i've just got to have you, baby
uh, ah, ah
uh, ah, ah yeah-heah
i feel the earth
move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
i feel the earth move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down

i just a-lose control
down to my very soul
i get uh, hot and cold
all over, all over, all over, all over

i feel the earth
move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
i feel the earth move
under my feet
i feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down

uh tumbling down
uh tumbling down
uh tumbling down
tumbling down 

tonight you're mine completely
you give your love so sweetly
tonight the light of love is in your eyes
but will you love me tomorrow?
is this a lasting treasure
or just a moment's pleasure?
can i believe the magic in your sighs?
will you still love me tomorrow?
tonight with words unspoken
you said that i'm the only one
but will my heart be broken
when the night (when the night)
meets the morning sun?
i'd like to know that your love
is love i can be sure of
so tell me now and i won't ask again
will you still love me tomorrow?
will you still love me tomorrow? 

loving you the way i do
i only wanna be with you
and i would go to the ends of the earth
oh, darling, to me that's what you're worth
where you lead, i will follow
anywhere that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow where you lead
if you're out on the road
feeling lonely, and so cold
all you have to do is call my name
and i'll be there on the next train
where you lead, i will follow
anywhere that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow where you lead
i always wanted a real home
with flowers on the window sill
but if you want to live in new york city
honey, you know i will (yes i will, yes i will)
i never thought i could get satisfaction
from just one man
but if anyone can keep me happy
you're the one who can
and where you lead, i will follow
anywhere that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow oh, oh, where you lead (repeat)
i will follow
any-anywhere that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow where you lead
oh baby
ooh
i'm gonna follow were you lead
(i'm gonna follow were you lead)
i'm gonna follow were you lead
(i'm gonna follow were you lead)
i'm gonna follow were you lead
(i'm gonna follow were you lead)
i'm gonna follow were you lead
(i'm gonna follow were you lead)
i'm gonna follow were you lead 

you've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
and show the world all the love in your heart
then people gonna treat you better
you're gonna find, yes, you will
that you're beautiful as you feel

waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
i've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
mirrored in their faces i see frustration growing
and they don't see it showing, why do i?

you've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
and show the world all the love in your heart
then people gonna treat you better
you're gonna find, yes, you will
that you're beautiful as you feel

i have often asked myself the reason for the sadness
in a world where tears are just a lullaby
if there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness
maybe not, oh, but we can only try
you've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
and show the world all the love in your heart
then people gonna treat you better
you're gonna find, yes, you will
that you're beautiful, you're beautiful
you're beautiful as you feel
 

now and forever
you are a part of me
and the memory cuts like a knife
didn't we find the ecstasy
didn't we share the daylight
when you walked into my life
now and forever, i'll remember
all the promises still unbroken
and think about all the words between us
that never needed to be spoken
we had a moment
just one moment
that will last beyond a dream, beyond a lifetime
we are the lucky ones
some people never get to do
all we got to do
now and forever
i will always think of you
didn't we come together
didn't we live together
didn't we cry together
didn't we play together
didn't we love together
and together we lit up the world
i miss the tears
i miss the laughter
i miss the day we met and all that followed after
sometimes i wish i could always be with you
the way we used to do
oh, now and forever
i will always think of you
now and forever
i will always be with you
oh woh 

now smackwater jack, he bought a shotgun
cause he was in the mood for a little confrontation
he just let it all hang loose
he didn't think about the noose
he couldn't take no more abuse
so he shot down the congregation
you can't talk to a man
with a shotgun in his hand
shotgun
now big jim the chief stood for law and order
he called for the guard to come and surround the border
now from his bulldog mouth
as he led the posse south
came the cry, we got to ride
clean up the streets for our wives and our daughters
you can't talk to a man
when he don't want to understand
no, no, no, no, no, no
the account of the capture wasn't in the papers
but you know, they hanged ole smack right then instead of later
you know the people were quite pleased
cause the outlaw had been seized
and on the whole, it was a very good year
for the undertaker
you know, you know, you can't talk to a man
with a shotgun in his hand
shotgun in his hand
smackwater jack, yeah
smackwater jack bought a shotgun
yeah, smackwater jack bought a shotgun
smackwater jack, yeah
smackwater jack, yeah
talkin' about smackwater jack, yeah
talkin' about smackwater jack, oh
talkin' about jack and his shotgun
talkin' about smack, talkin' about jack
smackwater jack, yeah 

way over yonder
is a place that i know
where i can find shelter
from a hunger and a cold
and the sweet tastin' good life
is so easily found
a way over yonder
that's where i'm bound
i know when i get there
the first thing i'll see
is the sun shining golden
shining right down on me
then trouble's gonna lose me
worry leave me behind
and i'll stand up proudly
in true peace of mind
a way over yonder
is a place i have seen
in a garden of wisdom
from some long ago dream
oh yeah
maybe tomorrow
i'll find find my way
to the land where the honey runs
in rivers each day
and the sweet tastin' good life
is so easily found
a way over yonder
that's where i'm bound 

sometimes i wonder if i'm ever gonna make it home again
it's so far and out of sight
i really need someone to talk to, and nobody else
knows how to comfort me tonight
snow is cold, rain is wet
chills my soul right to the marrow
i won't be happy till i see you alone again
till i'm home again and feeling right
snow is cold, rain is wet
chills my soul right to the marrow
i won't be happy till i see you alone again
till i'm home again and feeling right
till i'm home again and feeling right
i wanna be home again and feeling right 

loving you the way i do
i know we're gonna make it through
and i will go
to the ends of the earth
'cause darling, to me that's what you're worth

where you lead
i will follow
anywhere that you tell me to
if you need, if you need me to be with you
i will follow
where you lead

if you're out on the road
feelin' lonely and so cold
all you have to do is call my name
and i'll be there
on the next train

where you lead
i will follow anywhere
that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow
where you lead
i always wanted a real home
with flowers on the windowsill
but if you wanna live in new york city
honey you know i will
you never know how it's all gonna turn out
but that's ok
just as long
as we're together
we can find a way

where you lead
i will follow, anywhere
that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow -
oh, oh, oh!
where you lead
i will follow, anywhere
that you tell me to
if you need, you need me to be with you
i will follow
where you lead
oh baby, yeah
i'm gonna follow where you lead
i'm gonna follow where you lead
i'm gonna follow where you lead
i'm gonna follow where you lead
i'm gonna follow where you lead 

although you see the world different than me
sometimes i can touch upon the wonders that you see
all the new colors and pictures you've designed
oh yes, sweet darling
so glad you are a child of mine
chorus
child of mine, child of mine
oh yes, sweet darling
so glad you are a child of mine
you don't need direction, you know which way to go
and i don't want to hold you back, i just want to watch you grow
you're the one who taught me you don't have to look behind
oh yes, sweet darling
so glad you are a child of mine
nobody's gonna kill your dreams
or tell you how to live your life
there'll always be people to make it hard for a while
but you'll change their heads when they see you smile
the times you were born in may not have been the best
but you can make the times to come better than the rest
i know you will be honest if you can't always be kind
oh yes, sweet darling
so glad you are a child of mine
repeat chorus 2 times 

sometimes i'm tired and i wonder
what's so all-fired important
about being someplace at some time
oh, but i don't really mind
cause i could be on easy street
and i know that
you've got to take the bitter with the sweet
i guess it gets to everyone
you think you're not having any fun
and you wonder what you're doing
playing the games you play
hey, well, it's true what they say
if you want to feel complete
don't you know that
you've got to take the bitter with the sweet
a friend of mine once told me
and i know he knows all about feelin' down
he said everything good in life you've got to pay for
but feelin' good is what you're paving the way for
so, don't let it get you down, my friend
though it seems the blues will never end
on this you can depend, they always do
and i can tell you that it's true
it's a feeling that can't be beat
and you've got to do it
you've got to take the bitter with the sweet 

lift me, won't you lift me
above the old routine;
make it nice, play it clean, jazzman

when the jazzman's testifyin'
a faithless man believes
he can sing you into paradise
or bring you to your knees
it's a gospel kind of feelin'
a touch of georgia slide
a song of pure revival
and a style that's sanctified

jazzman, take my blues away;
make my pain the same as yours
with every change you play
jazzman, oh jazzman

when the jazzman's signifyin'
and the band is windin' low
it's the late night side of morning
in the darkness of his soul
he can fill a room with sadness
as he fills his horn with tears
he can cry like a fallen angel
when rising time is near
jazzman take my blues away;
make my pain the same as yours
with every change you play

oh lift me, won't you lift me
with every turn around
play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman 

i only wanted to play
i thought what he didn't know
wouldn't hurt him anyway
but he found out and
someone else gave him her hand to hold
and suddenly i find myself out in the cold
he trusted me all the time
i thought i could see another man
and he would still be mine
well yesterday i had a good thing
worth more than gold
today he's got a truer love and i'm out in the cold
i had a love warmer than fire
but i listened to my desire
now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heartache
i'm paying, paying for my mistake
now, girl, take a tip from one who knows
if you open up a new door
you may find the old one's closed
so be true to your good man
take a lesson from this story i have told
or you just might get left now
out in the cold
you just might get left now
out in the cold
don't let yourself get left now
out in the cold
don't let yourself get left now
out in the cold 

funny how i feel more myself with you
than anybody else that i ever knew
i hear it in your voice,see it in your face
you've become a memory i can't erase
you could have been anyone at all
a stranger falling out of the blue
i'm so glad it was you
it wasn't in the plan, not that i could see
suddenly a miracle came to me
safe within your arms i can say what's true
nothing in the world i would keep from you
you could have been anyone at all
an old friend calling out of the blue
i'm so glad it was you
words can hurt you if you let them
people say them and forget them
words can promise
words can lie
but your words make me feel like i can fly
you could have been anyone at all
and that's what catches me when i fall
i'm so glad it was you
you could have been anyone at all
an old friend falling out of the blue
i'm so glad it was you
anyone at all
you could have been anyone at all
i'm so glad it was you 

no i'd rather go and journey
where the diamond crescents flowing
and run across the valley
beneath the sacred mountain
and wander through the forest
where the trees have leaves of prisms
that make the light up into colors
that no one know the names of
and when it's time i'll go and lay
beside the legendary fountain
till i see her form reflected
in its clear and gentle waters
and if you think i'm ready
you may lead me to the chasm
where the rivers of our visions
flow into one another
and i'll stay awhile and wonder
at the mist that they created
and lose myself within it
cleanse my mind and body
and i know at that moment
as i stand in that cathedral
i will want to dive
beneath the white cascading water
she may beg and she may plead
and she may argue with her logic
mention all the things i'll lose
that really have no value
tho' i doubt that she will ever
come to understand the meaning
in the end she'll surely know
i was not born to follow
