sweet love, yeah

i didn't mean it when i said i didn't love you so
i shoulda held on tight, i never shoulda let you go
i didn't know nothing, i was stupid, i was foolish
i was lying to myself
i couldn't have fathomed i would ever be without your love
never imagined i'd be sitting here beside myself
guess i didn't know you, guess i didn't know me
but i thought i knew everything i never felt

the feeling that i'm feeling now that i don't hear your voice
or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause i don't have a choice
oh, what i wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
right here, 'cause, baby (we belong together)

when you left, i lost a part of me (together)
it's still so hard to believe
come back, baby, please
(come back, come back, come back, come back)
'cause we belong together
who else am i gonna lean on when times get rough? (who else)
who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (who else)
who's gonna take your place? there ain't nobody better (who else)
oh, baby, baby, we belong together
i can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
bobby womack's on the radio
singing to me, "if you think you're lonely now"
wait a minute, this is too deep (too deep)
i gotta change the station
so i turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
and then i hear babyface, "i only think of you"
and it's breaking my heart
i'm tryna keep it together, but i'm falling apart

i'm feelin' all out of my element
throwin' things, cryin'
tryin' to figure out where the hell i went wrong
the pain reflected in this song
ain't even half of what i'm feeling inside
i need you, need you back in my life, baby (my life, my life)
(we belong together)

when you left, i lost a part of me (together)
it's still so hard to believe
come back, baby, please
(come back, come back, come back, come back)
'cause we belong together
who else am i gonna lean on when times get rough? (who will?)
who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (who will?)
who's gonna take your place? there ain't nobody better (who will?)
oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(we belong together) (who will?)
when you left, i lost a part of me (who will?)

who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (who will?)
who's gonna take your place? there ain't nobody better (who will?)

there's a hero
if you look inside your heart
you don't have to be afraid
of what you are
there’s an answer
if you reach into your soul
and the sorrow that you know
will melt away

and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you

it's a long road
when you face the world alone
no one reaches out a hand for you to hold
you can find love
if you search within yourself
and the emptiness you felt
will disappear
and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you

lord knows
dreams are hard to follow
but don't let anyone
tear them away
hold on
there will be tomorrow
in time
you'll find the way

and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you
that a hero lies in you
that a hero lies in you 

sorry i've never told you
all i wanted to say
and now it's too late to hold you
'cause you've flown away, so far away

never had i imagined
living without your smile
feeling and knowing you hear me
it keeps me alive, alive

and i know you're shining down on me from heaven
like so many friends we've lost along the way
and i know eventually we'll be together (together)
one sweet day
(and i'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

like so many friends we've lost along the way
and i know eventually we'll be together

you called yesterday to basically say
that you care for me but that you're just not in love
immediately, i pretended to be feeling similarly
and led you to believe i was o.k
to just walk away from the one thing
that's unyielding and sacred to me

well, i guess i'm trying to be nonchalant about it
and i'm going to extremes to prove i'm fine without you
but in reality i'm slowly losing my mind
underneath the guise of a smile gradually i'm dying inside
(underneath the guise of smile)
friends ask me how i feel and i lie convincingly
'cause i don't want to reveal the fact that that i'm suffering
so i wear my disguise 'til i go home at night
and turn down all the lights and then i break down and cry
so, what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
of the pain that rejection is putting you through
do you cling to your pride and sing "i will survive"
(gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
do you lash out and say "how dare you leave this way"
(gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
(gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
(gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

'cause i've drowned in you
and i won't pull through
without you by my side

i'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
i'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
'cause i can't go on
living in the memory of our song
i'd give my all for your love tonight

baby, can you feel me?
imagining i'm looking in your eyes
i can see you clearly
vividly emblazoned in my mind
and yet you're so far, like a distant star
i'm wishing on tonight

when his candy kisses sweetly

no, i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
yes, it shows

no, i can't forget tomorrow
when i think of all my sorrow
when i had you there, but then i let you go
and now it's only fair that i should let you know
what you should know

i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't give
i can't give anymore

well, i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow show
yes, it shows
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
(no, can't live)
(no, i can't live)
no, no, no, no, hey
i can't live (no, can't live)
if living is without you (no, i can't live)
i can't live
i can't give anymore
can't live (no, can't live, no, i can't live) 

when you love someone so deeply
they become your life
it's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
blindly i imagined i could
keep you under glass
now i understand to hold you
i must open up my hands
and watch you rise

spread your wings and prepare to fly
for you have become a butterfly
oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
if you should return to me
we truly were meant to be
so spread your wings and fly
butterfly

i have learned that beauty
has to flourish in the light
wild horses run unbridled
or their spirit dies
you have given me the courage
to be all that i can
and i truly feel your heart will
lead you back to me when you're
ready to land
spread your wings and prepare to fly
for you have become a butterfly
oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
if you should return to me
we truly were meant to be
so spread your wings and fly
butterfly

i can't pretend these tears
aren't overflowing steadily
i can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
but i will stand and say goodbye
for you'll never be mine
until you know the way it feels to fly

spread your wings and prepare to fly
for you have become a butterfly
oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
if you should return to me (i will know you're mine)
we truly were meant to be
so spread your wings and fly, butterfly (my butterfly)
spread your wings and prepare to fly
for you have become a butterfly
oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
if you should return to me
we truly were meant to be
so spread your wings and fly
butterfly (fly)
so flutter through the sky
butterfly
fly
spread your wings and fly
butterfly
