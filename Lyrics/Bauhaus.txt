white on white translucent black capes
back on the rack
bela lugosi's dead
the bats have left the bell tower
the victims have been bled
red velvet lines the black box
bela lugosi's dead
bela lugosi's dead
undead undead undead
undead undead undead

the virginal brides file past his tomb
strewn with time's dead flowers
bereft in deathly bloom
alone in a darkened room
the count
bela lugosi's dead
bela lugosi's dead

all we ever wanted was everything
all we ever got was coal
get up, eat jelly
sandwich bars, and barbed wire
squash every week into a day

oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh

the sound of the drum is calling
the sound of the drum has called
flash of youth shoot out of darkness
factorytown

oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh

oh, to be the cream
oh, to be the cream
oh, to be the cream
oh, to be the cream

caressing, bent up to the jug again
with sheaths and pills invading all those stills
in a hovel of a bed, i will scream in vain
oh please, ms. lane, leave me with some pain

went walking through this city's neon lights
in fear of disguising my warping seething pressure lines
among confidant heirs, intangible of price
trying so hard to find what was right

i came upon your room, it stuck into my head
we leapt into the bed degrading even lice
she took delight in taking down my shielded pride
until exposed became my darker side
puckering up and down those avenues of sin
too cheap to ride, they're worth a try
if only for the old times, cold times
don't go waving your pretentious love

he's soliciting on his tan brown brogues (dark entries, dark entries)
gyrating through some lonesome devils row
(dark entries, dark entries)
pinpointing well meaning upper class prey
(dark entries, dark entries)
of walking money checks possessing holes
(dark entries, dark entries)
he sleekly offers his services (dark entries, dark entries)
exploitation of his finer years (dark entries, dark entries)
work with loosely woven fabrics of office clerks
(dark entries, dark entries)
any lay suffices his eye (dark entries, dark entries)

learning lines in the rain
special effects by loonatik and drinks
the graveyard scene
the golden years
(she's in parties)
it's in the can
(she's in parties)
it's in the can
freeze frame screen kiss
hot heads under silent wigs
fall guys tumble on the cutting room floor
look-a-likes fall on the cutting room door
(she's in parties)
it's in the can

it's in the can
learning lines in the rain

freeze frame, screen kiss, hot headlights, her powder
is patently obvious
(she's in parties)
it's in the can
(she's in parties)

hot lines under a rain of drums
cigarette props in action
dialogue dub, now here's the rub
she's acting her reaction

a gut pull drag on me
into the chasm gaping we
mirrors multi-reflecting this
between spunk-stained sheet and odorous whim
camera eye-flick-shudder within
assist me to walk away in sin
where is the string that theseus laid?
find me out this labyrinth place
i do get bored, i get bored
in the flat field
i get bored, i do get bored
in the flat field
yin and yang lumber punch
go taste a tart, then eat my lunch
and force my slender, thin and lean
in this solemn place of fill-wetting dreams
of black-matted lace of pregnant cows
as life maps out onto my brow
the card is lowered in index turn
into my filing cabinet hemispheres spurn
i do get bored, i get bored
in the flat field
i get bored, i do get bored
in the flat field
let me catch the slit of light
for a maiden's sake, on a maiden flight
in the flat field i do get bored
replace with piccadilly whores
in my yearn for some cerebral fix
transfer me to that solid plain
hammer me into blazen pain
moulding shapes, no shame to waste
moulding shapes, no shame to waste
and drag me there with deafening haste

in a crucifixation ecstasy
lying cross-chequed in agony
stigmata bleed continuously
holes in head, hands, feet and weep for me
stigmata oh you sordid sight
stigmata in your splintered plight
look into your crimson orifice
in holy remembrance, in scarlet bliss
stigmata martyr
stigmata martyr
in nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
in nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
in nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
in nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
father, son and holy ghost

i dare you to be real
to touch
to touch a flickering flame
the pangs
the pangs of dark delight
don't cower
don't cower in night fright
don't back away just yet
from destinations set
i dare you to be proud
to dare to shout aloud
for convictions that you feel
like sound from bells to peal
i dare you to despise
bureaucracy and all its lies
in the void
in the void they stare
they never
they never dared to dare
i dare
i dare
i dare you
you
you
you
i dare you
you

she had nut painted arms
that were hers to keep
and in her fear
she sought cracked pleasures
the passion of lovers is for death said she
licked her lips
and turned to feather
and as i watched from underneath
i came aware of all that she keep
the little foxes so safe and sound
they were not dead
they'd gone to ground
the passion of lovers is for death, said she
the passion of lovers is for death
she breaks her heart
just a little too much
and her jokes attract the lucky bad type
as she dips and wails
and slips her banshee smile
she gets the better of the bigger to the letter
the passion of lovers is for death, said she

and he spoke of pastures green
i was never told why
each journey lasts an age
and my throat feels dry
it must be the lesson
hidden deep inside
it must be the lesson
so roll the tide
so i began the crossing
my throat burned dry
searching for satori
the kick in the eye
i am the end of reproduction
given no direction
every care is taken
in my rejection
kick in the eye
kick in the eye
kick in the eye
kick in the eye
every care is taken
with my rejection
and my abduction
to my addiction
every care is taken
with my protection
and my abduction
from my addiction
kick in the eye
kick in the eye
kick in the eye
kick in the eye

go and look for the dejected once proud
idol remembered in stone aloud
then on coins his face was mirrored
take a look it soon hath slithered
to a fractured marble slab, renunciation clad
his nourishment extract from his subjects
that mass production profile
he's a god in an alcove
once he spread the rain
so they dreamt in vain
once he spread the wheat
had made garlands for his feet
until the lily poet of our times
horizoned on the line
love became the in theme then
opposing fakers thrice by ten
don't perceive his empty plea
that redundant effigy
he's a god in an alcove
take in view his empty stool
what's left is satin cool
clawing adornment for his crimes
they saw they had to draw the line
so they sent him far away
so they sent him far away
to a little alcove
to a little alcove
all alone
he's a god, a god
now i am silly
now i am silly
silly, silly, silly, silly
silly

oh classic gentlemen
say your prayers
to the wind, of prostitution
to your faces, and rex complexes
riddle my breast
full of the oppressed puss
oh gentlemen, with your fish
that you surround, all around
and you man, will always point
your fishes, at me
but i will always exist
because i always exist
damn good too
the rat race begins
the fat face stings
i hold the fresh pink baby
with a smile
i slice off those rosy cheeks
because i feel so thirsty
and oedipus rex complexes
...riddle my closed bloated breast

i'm lost!
the man of shadows thinks in clay
dreamed trapped thoughts of suffocation days
he's seen in iron environments
with plastic sweat out of chiselled slits for eyes
from the growth underneath the closed mouth
you'll catch if you listen
rack-trapped cubist vowels
from a dummy head expression
from a dummy head expression
the transformation is invested
with the mysterious and the shameful
while the thing i am becomes something else
part character part sensation
the shadow is cast

there were tims
there was pork
there are legs
there are skarks
there was john
there are cliffs
there was mother
there's a poker
there was you
then there was you
there are scenes
there are blues
there are boots
there are shoes
there are turks
there are fools
they're in lockers
they're in schools
they're in you
then there was you
burn my fingers
burn my toes
burn my uncle
burn his books
burn his shoes
cook the leather
put it on me
does it fit me
or you
it looks tight on you

what do you want of me
what do you long from me
a slim pixie, thin and forlorn
a count, white and drawn
what do you make of me
what can you take from me
pallid landscapes off my frown
let me rip you up and down
for you i came to forsake
lay wide despise and hate
i sing of you in my demented songs
for you and your stimulations
take what you can of me
rip what you can off me
and this i'll say to you
and hope that it gets through
you worthless bitch
you fickle shit
you will spit on me
you will make me spit
and when the judas howl arise
and like the jesus jews you epitomize
i'll still be here as strong as you
and i'll walk away in spite of you
and i'll walk away
away
walk away
(repeat)

shoes that no man would want to wear
slice of life that's night's last cold stare
red fist curled 'round the house
wash away, boy, shelly's shoes
wash
chocolate power is so crisp
atomic open house is really here
and we have gone so desperate
your power knows no bounds
and heavier with time are our shoes
that no man would want to wear
new tread wipes a wet road so dry
(it stings)
into the borrowed course
under the dreadful birds
under the singing soil and all those guilty clouds
i have seen too much, wipe away my eyes too much
wipe away my eyes, too much
wipe away my eyes, too much
wipe away my eyes, too much
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
wipe away my eyes
my eyes, eyes, eyes

nerve ends tick in flicker-book animation
one eye's closed in fear, anticipation
will it stay shut? will it ever open?
what if?
what if?
nerves
tell-tale tongues lick at seven senses
brittle spittle sparks, you are defenceless
the fabric of dreams is ripped apart
as you feel the twist of the shadowed dagger
in your pumping heart
nerves
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
a trail of random cutlery cuts a dash in the concrete underpass
sense of serenity is shattered in the glint of splintered glass
nerves
nerves
nerves, nerves
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel
nerves like nylon, nerves like steel

back in the good old days when dancing meant exploding
the idea was simple for a decent overloading
and for a multiple flash with no cords attached
he came up with a more remote flash trigger
it's connected to an accessory to his hip
which automatically fires in perfect synchro
but perhaps his most exciting development is his angle
they call it the dance
it's the st. vitus dance
such flexibility
what an accessory
see his soft bounce
what flexibility
such a soft bounce
what an accessory
ah
and for special effects he has six filters
three coloured red with the others pilfered
and if you really want to know what that means
he could throw a blue flash from eighty-five feet
'cause you might want to check out your own little output
so we devised a few simple and easy-to-crack contortions
so you can bump and scrape all the day through
with the dance
it's the st. vitus dance
the st. vitus dance
such flexibility
what an accessory
su-such a soft bounce
what flexibility
such a soft bounce
check his hot shoe
feel his output
he's a light machine
see his angle
he's a light machine

ancient earthwork, fort and barrow
discreetly hide their secret abodes
the most fearful hide deep inside
and venture not there upon yuletide
for invasion of their hollow hills
that music hold and oberon fill
is surely recommended not
for fear of death, in fear of rot
hollow hills
hollow hills
hollow hills
hollow hills
baleful sound and wild voices ignored
ill luck, disaster - the one reward
violated sanctity of supermen's hills
so sad (hollow hills)
love lies there still (hollow hills)
so sad (hollow hills)
so sad (hollow hills)
hollow hills (hollow hills)
hollow hills (hollow hills)
hollow hills
hollow hills
and witches too, and goblins too
the speckled silk
lament, repent
oh mortal you (oh mortal you)
so sad (hollow hills), so sad
so sad, so sad...

hidden in the dashboard
the unseen mechanized eye
under surveillance
the road is full of cats eyes
it's sick function to pry
the spy in the cab
coldly observing
callously reserving
a driver's time
automated autonomy
playing on his mind
the spy in the cab
the spy in the cab
an eye for an eye
a spy for an eye
an eye for an eye
a spy for an eye
a twenty-four hour unblinking watch
installed to pry
installed to cop
the spy in the cab
the spy in the cab
the spy in the cab
i spy with my little eye
spy with my little, i spy with my little eye
spy with my little, i spy...

we're going down
we're going down
we're going down
to the kamikaze dive
fishnet leatherette
pussy galore
pseudo sumo wrestler
on the door
dangerous dances
the dragon's claw
k-tel oriental
the monkey's paw
you're dead
i said you're dead
you're a dead ringer
for madame butterfly
snappy little fingers
stitch my thigh
you're so necromantic
venomous and vain
mixing molotov cocktails
in the subterrain
you're dead
i said you're dead
we're going down to the kamikazi dive
like insects in a chinese lantern now
we're feeling so alive, what's showing?
we're going down to the kamikaze dive
like manic moths in chinese lanterns now
we're feeling so alive!
