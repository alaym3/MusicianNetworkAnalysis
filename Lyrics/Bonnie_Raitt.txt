turn down the lights
turn down the bed
turn down these voices inside my head
lay down with me
tell me no lies
just hold me close
don't patronize
don't patronize me

'cause i can't make you love me if you don't
you can't make your heart feel something it won't
here in the dark in these final hours
i will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
but you won't, no you won't
'cause i can't make you love me if you don't

i'll close my eyes
then i won't see
the love you don't feel when you're holding me
morning will come
and i'll do what's right
just give me 'til then to give up this fight
and iâ€™ll give up this fight

'cause i can't make you love me if you don't
you can't make your heart feel something it won't
here in the dark in these final hours
i will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
but you won't, no you won't
'cause i can't make you love me if you don't

i am an old woman
named after my mother
my old man is another
child who's grown old
if dreams were thunder
and lightning was desire
this old house would've burned down
a long time ago
make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing
that i can hold on to
to believe in this livin'
is just a hard way to go
when i was a young girl
i had me a cowboy
he weren't much to look at
just a free ramblin' man
that was a long time
and no matter how i tried
the years just flow by
like a broken down dam
make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing
that i can hold on to
to believe in this livin'
is just a hard way to go
there's flies in the kitchen
i can hear all their buzzin'
and i ain't done nothing since i woke up today
how the hell can a person
go to work in the morning
come home in the evening
and have nothing to say
make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing
that i can hold on to
to believe in this livin'
is just a hard way to go

a friend of mine, she cries at night
and she calls me on the phone
sees babies everywhere she goes
and she wants one of her own
she's waited long enough she says
and still he can't decide
pretty soon she'll have to choose
and it tears her up inside
she is scared
scared to run out of time
i see my folks are getting on
and i watch their bodies change
i know they see the same in me
and it makes us both feel strange
no matter how you tell yourself
it's what we all go through
those lines are pretty hard to take
when they're staring back at you
oh oh oh, scared you'll run out of time
when did the choices get so hard
with so much more at stake
life gets mighty precious
when there's less of it to wa-a-a-aste
mmm-m-m-m-m-m
mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time
just when i thought i'd had enough
and all my tears were shed
no promise left unbroken
there were no painful words unsaid
yo-o-o-u came along and showed me
i could leave it all behind
you opened up my heart again
and then much to my surprise
i found love, baby, love in the nick of time
(love in the nick of time)
i found love darlin', love in the nick of time
(love in the nick of time)
i found love baby, love in the nick of time
ooooooo-ooo-ooo-whoo-ooo
yeah baby
uhhhhh-huh-uh
found love...
in the nick of time...
thought i'd given up...
given up baby...
oh ooo wo ooo wo...

people are talking, talking 'bout people
i hear them whisper, you won't believe it
they think we're lovers kept under cover
i just ignore it, but they keep saying
we laugh just a little too loud
stand just a little too close
we stare just a little too long
maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling

let's give 'em something to talk about
let's give 'em something to talk about
let's give 'em something to talk about
how about love?

i feel so foolish, i never noticed
you'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
it took the rumor to make me wonder
now i'm convinced i'm going under
thinkin' 'bout you every day
dream 'bout you every night
i'm hoping that you feel the same way
now that we know it, let's really show it, darling

let's give 'em something to talk about
a little mystery to figure out, babe
let's give 'em something to talk about
how about love?
let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
a little mystery to figure out
let's give 'em something to talk about
how about love?
ooh, listen to 'em baby
a little mystery won't hurt 'em
let's give 'em something to talk about
how about our love, love, love, love

something in your eyes
makes me want to lose myself
makes me want to lose myself
in your arms
there's something in your voice
makes my heart beat fast
hope this feeling lasts
the rest of my life
if you knew how lonely my life has been
and how low i've felt for so long
if you knew how i wanted someone
to come along
and change my life the way you've done
feels like home to me
feels like home to me
feels like i'm all the way back where i come from
feels like home to me
feels like home to me
feels like i'm all the way back where i belong
a window breaks
down a long dark street
and a siren wails in the night
but i'm alright cause i have you here with me
and i can almost see
through the dark there's a light
if you knew how much this moment
means to me
and how long i've waited for your touch
if you knew how happy you are making me
i never thought i'd love anyone so much
feels like home to me
feels like home to me
feels like i'm all the way back
where i come from
feels like home to me
feels like home to me
feels like i'm all the way back where i belong
feels like i'm all the way back where i belong

sittin' here thinking, baby, about you
i'm wonderin' how i ever got through my life without you
days passed me by and left my life somewhere behind
games i was trying left me old before my time
you came into my life almost like you knew
the time was running out i came running home with you
you taught me how to love you
you helped me to believe
you could even love me
i was all you'd ever need
sometimes when you're sleepin'
i wonder if its true
i'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream with you
then you wake and hold me and love me through the night
then i'll know that somehow everything will be alright
thank you baby, for giving me my life
i love you honey, you've given me my life
thank you baby, for giving me my life

as i walk along i wonder what went wrong
with our love, a love that was so strong
and as still walk on i think of the things we've done
together while our hearts were young
i'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and i feel a pain
wishing you were here by me to end this misery
and i wonder, i wo wo wo wo wonder
why, you ran away
and i wonder where you will stay
my little runaway, a runaway
(instrumental break)
i'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and i feel a pain
wishing you were here by me to end this misery
and i wonder, i wo wo wo wo wonder, baby, yeah
you know why, you ran away
and i wonder where you will stay
my little runaway, my little runaway
come back baby
a run run runaway
you left me standin' in the rain
a run run runaway
come back baby
a run run runaway
(fades)

the men that i've been seein', baby
well they got their soul up on a shelf
you know they could never love me
cause they can't even love themselves
but i need someone to love me
someone to really understand
who won't put himself above me
who just loves me like a man
i never seen such losers
don't think i haven't tried
find a man to take me home
instead of takin' me for a ride
and i need someone to love me
i know you can
believe me when i tell you
you can love me like a man
they all want me to rock them
like my back ain't got no bone
i want a man to rock me
like my back bone was his own
darlin', i know you can
believe me when i tell you
you can love me like a man
i come home sad and lonely
feel like i wanna cry
i want a man to hold me
not some fool to ask me why
i know you can
don't you put yourself above me
you just love me like a man

i've had bad dreams too many times
to think that they don't mean much anymore
fine times have gone and left my sad home
friends who once cared just walk out my door
love has no pride when i call out your name
love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
i'd give anything to see you again
i've been alone too many nights
to think that you could come back again
and i've heard you talk, "she's crazy to stay"
but this love hurts me so, i don't care what you say
love has no pride when i call out your name
love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
i'd give anything to see you again
if i could buy your love, i'd truly try, my friend
and if i could pray, my prayer would never end
but if you want me to beg, i'll fall down on my knees
asking for you to come back, i'd be pleading for you to come back
begging for you to come back to me
love has no pride when i call out your name
love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
i'd give anything to see you again
yes, i'd give anything to see you again

hey!
shut up
don't lie to me
you say i'm blind, but i've got eyes to see
hey, mister, how do you do?
oh, pardon me, i thought i knew you
would you stand back, baby, 'cause i want to get a better look
the big man who couldn't handle the little bit of love you took
hey, hey, have a heart
hey, have a heart
if you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
have a heart, please
oh, don't you have a heart?
little by little you fade while i fall apart
oh, oh
oh, darling, i love you so
i told you yes, and then you told me no
baby, how can you say
you should be free and i should pay and pay
and you talk and talk about you and what you need
but sooner or later your love is gonna make me bleed
hey, hey, have a heart
hey, have a heart
if you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
have a heart, please
oh, don't you have a heart?
little by little you fade while i fall apart
oh, oh
talk on, talk on, but love is what you need
and sooner or later that love is gonna make you bleed
hey, hey, have a heart
hey, have a heart
if you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
have a heart, please
oh, don't you have a heart?
little by little you fade while i fall apart
but don't you run away, baby
hey, hey, have a heart
hey, hey, have a heart
hey, hey, have a heart

rain is pourin' down like the heavens are hurtin'
seems like it's been dark since the devil knows when
how do you go on, never knowin' for certain
will the sun ever shine again?

feels like it's been years since it started to thunder
clouds are campin' out in the valley and glen
how do you go on, when you can't help but wonder
will the sun ever shine again?

what if the rain keeps fallin'?
what if the sky stays gray?
what if the winds keep squallin'
and never go away?

maybe soon the storm will be tired of blowin'
maybe soon it all will be over, amen
how do you go on, if there's no way of knowin'?
will the sun ever shine?
wish i could say
send me a sign-
one little ray
lord, if you're list'nin', how long
until then?
will the sun ever shine again?

nobody else could make me happy
no one could hurt me like you do
you were the only one that mattered
then you were gone...love had moved on
left me alone thinking of...
you...there was never any other
you...and i were created to be true
isn't it love that keeps us breathing
isn't it love we're sent here for
wasn't that love that we were feeling
(that was something baby)
deep in our soul...deeper than we know
keeping me holding out for
you...there was never any question
you'll be forever on my mind
you and i, we were meant to be together
true hearts in a world where love is dyin'
and i might as well have been dyin' when
we were apart
when you came back i felt the beating of my heart
you...there was never any question
you'll be forever on my mind
you and i, we were meant to be together
you...and only you
it was you...only you
you...always you

traveling at night, the headlights were bright
and we'd been up many an hour
and all through my brain came the refrain
of home and it's warming fire

and home sings me of sweet things
my life there has it's own wings
fly over the mountain
though i'm standing still

the people i've seen they come in between
the cities of tiring life
and the trains come and go but inside you know
the struggle will soon be a fight

and home sings me of sweet things
my life there has it's own wings
fly over the mountain
though i'm standing still

traveling at night, the headlights were bright
but soon the sun came through the trees
around the next bend the flowers will send
the sweet smell of home in the breeze

and home sings me of sweet things
my life there has it's own wings
fly over the mountain
though i'm standing still

don't have to humble yourself to me
i ain't your judge or your king
baby, you know i ain't no queen of sheba
we may not even have our dignity
this could be just a powerful thing
baby we can choose, you know we ain't no amoeba
are you ready for the thing called love?
don't come from me and you, it comes from up above
i ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
are you ready for the thing called love?
i ain't some icon carved out of soap
sent here to clean up your reputation
baby, you know you ain't no prince charming
we can live in fear or act out of hope
some kind of peaceful situation
baby, how come the cry of love is so alarming
are you ready for the thing called love?
don't come from me and you, it comes from up above
i ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
are you ready for the thing called love?
ugly ducklings don't turn into swans
glide off down the lake
whether your sunglasses are off or on
you only see the world you make
are you ready for the thing called love?
don't come from me and you, it comes from up above
i ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
are you ready for it?
are you ready for the thing called love?
don't come from me and you, it comes from up above
i ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
are you ready for it
are you ready for love, baby
oooh, yeah babe
are you ready for love

they all said 'louise was not half bad'
it was written on the walls & window shades
and how she'd act
a little girl
the deceiver, don't believe her
that's her trade
sometimes a bottle of perfume
flowers, and maybe some lace
men bought louise ten cent trinkets
their intentions were easily traced
everybody thought it kind of sad
when they found louise in her room
they'd all put her down
below their kind
still some cried when she died
that afternoon
louis rode home on a mail train
somewhere to the south i heard them say
'it's too bad it ended so ugly
it's too bad she had to go that'
but the wind is blowin' cold tonight
goodnight louise, goodnight
yes, the winds' blowin' cold tonight
goodnight louise, good-night...

jesus cried, wept and died
i guess he went up to heaven
i've been downtown such a long, long time
i'll never make it home by seven
won't you come & take me home
i've been too long at the fair
and lord, i just can't stand it anymore
well i went down to jason's
walked 'til my feet got sore
but i never knew what laughin' was
'til you walked out the door
won't you come and take me home
i've been too long at the fair
and lord, i just can't stand it anymore
you can give my soul to abraham
give my soul to saul
give my bones to canada
my teeth they don't hurt at all
i don't know who made the highway
i guess that's just my pride
but i have heard the prince of darkness
on his charger ride
the silver blade is gleamin'
the scales are in his hands
i swear that night is fallin'
don't you lose another man
won't you come and take me home
i've been too long at the fair
and lord, i just can't stand it anymore

you dust the bottles on the bar counter
you're writing screenplays on the side
three nights a week can keep a girl workin
sometimes it's good to lose your pride
these things we do to keep the flame burnin
and write our fire in the sky
another day to see the wheel turnin
another avenue to try
it's in the luck of the draw, baby
the natural law
forget those movies you saw, little baby
it's in the luck of the draw
the natural law
(flame keep on burnin)
forget those movies you saw, little baby
(wheel ever turnin)
you turn around and say it's last orders
you fix the ribbon in your hair
tomorrow's letter by the hall doorway
could be the answer to your prayers

papa, come quick, jody's gone to the city
what we gonna do now that jody's gone?
she's left a note on the tv and, papa, it's a pity
what we gonna do now that jody's gone?

well, mama's been cryin' in the kitchen since mornin'
she cried right through "as the world turns"
i seen it myself and, papa, it's a bitch'n
let's haul ass before the baby gets burned

gas up the old ford, get out the road map
they got a head start, about half a day
load up the shotgun, put it in the gun rack
jody's with chico down in east la


it must've been that wild-eyed, silver-tongued schemer
a girl like jody don't think for herself
him and that harley and his damn jalapena
smokin' that stuff'll make you hurt yourself

papa, come quick
papa, come quick
papa, come quick
papa, come on

papa come quick, jody's gone to the city
what we gonna do now that jody's gone?
she left a note on the tv and papa it's a pity
what we gonna do now that jody's gone?

gas up the old ford, get out the road map
they got a head start about a half a day
stop at the mobil, pump up the flat wheel
jody and chico and his ding dang deal

mama's been cryin' in the kitchen since mornin'
she cried right through "as the world turns"
i seen it myself and, papa, it's a bitch'n
let's haul ass before the baby gets burned

i was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
feelin that i'd always be the lonely one
then i saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
whisperin that i wasn't the only one
the lonely one
one change intervention, see what it can signify
the slightest misapprehension, baby
and we'd have passed each other by
when i heard your sweet voice callin
saw your light come shinin throught
i couldn't stop my heart from turning
churnin out my love for you, my love to you
true love or perfection
it seems like it's overdue
then just when you least expect it
it comes sneakin up on you
when i thought that i was dreamin
felt your body close to mine
now love takes on a different meaning
together till the end of time
i was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
feeling that i'd always be the lonely one
when i saw your face through the web of my confusion
whisperin that i wasn't the only one
the lonely one

i know it's hard sometimes
and things seem larger than they are
but if you need to tell someone
that's what i'm here for
cry on my shoulder
i'll help you rise above
cry on my shoulder, my love
out in the world outside
it can be harsh and cold
but if you need someone
i will be here to hold you
cry on my shoulder
i'll help you dry your eyes
cry on my shoulder, my love
i know it's hard sometimes
and things seem larger than they are
but if you need to let it go
then you can call on me
cry on my shoulder
i'll help you dry your eyes
cry on my shoulder, my love
cry on my shoulder
i'll help you rise above
cry on my shoulder, my love
my love...
