today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now

backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now

and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

because maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now

and all the roads that lead you there were winding
and all the lights that light the way are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

i said maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall
i said maybe (i said maybe)
you're gonna be the one that saves me

i said maybe (i said maybe)
you're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
you're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)

slip inside the eye of your mind
don't you know you might find
a better place to play?
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
slowly fade away

so i start a revolution from my bed
'cause you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, i heard you say

take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock 'n' roll band
who'll throw it all away

i'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'cause you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
'cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as she's walking on by
my soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, i heard you say

so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as she's walking on by
my soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger
i heard you say
at least not today

how many special people change?
how many lives are living strange?
where were you while we were getting high?

slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannonball
where were you while we were getting high?

someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova
a champagne supernova in the sky

wake up the dawn and ask her why
a dreamer dreams she never dies
wipe that tear away now from your eye

slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannonball
where were you while we were getting high?

someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova
a champagne supernova

'cause people believe
that they're gonna get away for the summer
but you and i, we live and die
the world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
why? why? why? why?

she's sniffing in a tissue selling the big issue

tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

need a little time to wake up
need a little time to wake up, wake up
need a little time to wake up
need a little time to rest your mind
you know you should so i guess you might as well

yeah, we're on, haha

i would like to leave this city
this old town don't smell too pretty and
i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind
and when i leave this island
i'll book myself into a soul asylum
'cause i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind

so here i go
i'm still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say?
you can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
you're half the world away
half the world away

half the world away
i've been lost, i've been found but i don't feel down

and when i leave this planet
you know i'd stay but i just can't stand it and
i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind
and if i could leave this spirit
i'll find me a hole and i'll live in it and
i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind

here i go
i'm still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say?
you can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
you're half the world away
half the world away

half the world away
i've been lost, i've been found but i don't feel down

no, i don't feel down
no, i don't feel down
i don't feel down
i don't feel down
don't feel down
i don't feel down

take the time to make some sense
of what you want to say
and cast your words away upon the waves
sail them home with acquiesce
on a ship of hope today
and as they land upon the shore
tell them not to fear no more
say it loud and sing it proud today
and then

dance if you wanna dance
please brother take a chance
you know they're gonna go
which way they wanna go
all we know is that we don't know
how it's gonna be
please brother let it be
life on the other hand
won't make us understand
we're all part of a masterplan
say it loud and sing it proud today

i'm not saying right is wrong
it's up to us to make
the best of all the things that come our way
'cause everything that's been has passed
the answer's in the looking glass
there's four and twenty million doors
on life's endless corridor
say it loud and sing it proud
and they

will dance if they wanna dance
please brother take a chance
you know they're gonna go
which way they wanna go
all we know is that we don't know
how it's gonna be
please brother let it be
life on the other hand
won't make you understand
we're all part of a masterplan

some might say that sunshine follows thunder
go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
some might say that we should never ponder
on our thoughts today 'cause they hold sway over time

some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say we will find a brighter day

'cause i've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
you made no preparation
for my reputation once again
the sink is full of fishes
she's got dirty dishes on the brain
it was overflowing gently
but it's all elementary my friend


some might say they don't believe in heaven
go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
some might say you get what you've been given
if you don't get yours i won't get mine as well

some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say we will find a brighter day

'cause i've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
that made no preparation
for my reputation once again
the sink is full of fishes
she's got dirty dishes on the brain
and my dog's been itching
itching in the kitchen once again

some might say (some might say)
some might say (some might say)
you know what some might say (you know what some might say)

she's electric
she's in a family full of eccentrics
she's done things i never expected
and i need more time
she's got a sister
and god only knows how i've missed her
and on the palm of her hand is a blister
and i need more time

and i want you to know
i've got my mind made up now
but i need more time
and i want you to say
"do you know what i'm saying?"
but i need more

there's lots and lots for us to see
there's lots and lots for us to do
she is electric, can i be electric too?


she's got a brother
we don't get on with one another
but i quite fancy her mother
and i think that she likes me
she's got a cousin
in fact she's got 'bout a dozen
she's got one in the oven
but it's nothing to do with me

and i want you to know
i've got my mind made up now
but i need more time
and i want you to say
"do you know what i'm saying?"

a cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
about the things caught in my mind
and as the day was dawning my plane flew away
with all the things caught in my mind

i do wanna be there when you're... coming down
i do wanna be there when you hit the ground

so don't go away
say what you say
say that you'll stay
forever and today
in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time
just to make things right

damn, my situation, and the games i have to play
with all the things caught in my mind
damn, my education, i can't find the words to say
with all the things caught in my mind

i do wanna be there when you're... coming down
and i do wanna be there when you hit the ground

so don't go away
say what you say
say that you'll stay
forever and today
in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time
just to make things right

me and you, what's going on?
all we seem to know is how to show
the feelings that are wrong

so don't go away
say what you say
say that you'll stay
forever and today
in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time
just to make things right

so don't go away
say what you say
say that you'll stay
forever and today
in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time
just to make things right
yes, i need more time
just to make things right
yes i need more time
just to make things right

so don't go away

here’s a thought for every man
who tries to understand what is in his hands (what’s in his hands)
he walks along the open road of love and life
surviving if he can (surviving if he can)

bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
as he faced the sun he cast no shadow (hi-high)

as they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
as they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
as they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
as he faced the sun he cast no shadow

(hi-high, hi-high, hi-high)

somewhere right between the eyes
sleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complain

is it my imagination
or have i finally found something worth living for?
i was looking for some action
but all i found was cigarettes and alcohol

to spend your days in the sunshine
you might as well do the white line
'cause when it comes on top
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen

is it worth the aggravation
to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?

to spend your days in the sunshine
you might as well do the white line
'cause when it comes on top

i need some time in the sunshine
i've gotta slow it right down
the day's moving just too fast for me

i live my life for the stars that shine
people say, "it's just a waste of time"
then they said, "i should feed my head"
that to me was just a day in bed
i'll take my car and drive real far
they're not concerned about the way we are
in my mind my dreams are real

step off the train all alone at dawn
back into the hole where i was born
the sun in the sky never raised an eye to me
the blood on the trax and they must be mine
the fool on the hill and i feel fine
don't look back 'cause you know what you might see
look into the wall of my mind's eye
i think i know, but i don't know why
the questions are the answers you might need
coming in a mess, going out in style
i ain't good looking but i'm someone's child
no-one can give me the air that's mine to breathe

i met my maker, i made him cry
and on my shoulder he asked me why
his people won't fly through the storm
i said "hey, listen up man, they don't even know you're born"

all my people right here, right now
d'you know what i mean? (yeah, yeah)
all my people right here, right now
d'you know what i mean? (yeah, yeah)
all my people right here, right now
d'you know what i mean? (yeah, yeah)
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

i don't really care for what you believe
so open up your fist or you won't receive
the thoughts and the words of every man you'll need
so get up off the floor and believe in life
no-ones ever gonna ever ask you twice
get on the bus and bring it on home to me

i met my maker i made him cry (yes you did)
and on my shoulder he asked me why
his people won't fly through the storm
i said "listen up man, they don't even know you're born"

all my people right here, right now
they know what i mean (yeah, yeah)
all my people right here, right now
they know what i mean (yeah, yeah)

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

i don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
i don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
i only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes
i hope that i can say the things i wish i’d said
to sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed
who wants to be alone when we can feel alive instead

because we need each other
we believe in one another
and i know we're going to uncover
what's sleepin' in our soul
because we need each other
we believe in one another
i know we're going to uncover
what's sleepin' in our soul
what's sleepin' in our soul

there are many things that i would like to know
and there are many places that i wish to go
but everything's depending on the way the wind may blow
i don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
i don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
i only want to see the light that shines behind your eyes

because we need each other
we believe in one another
and i know we're going to uncover
what's sleepin' in our soul
because we need each other
we believe in one another
i know we're going to uncover
what's sleepin' in our soul
what's sleepin' in our soul

what's sleepin' in our soul
what's sleepin' in our soul
sleepin' in our soul
'cause we believe
'cause we believe
yeah we believe
'cause we believe
'cause we believe
'cause we believe
because we need
because what we need
