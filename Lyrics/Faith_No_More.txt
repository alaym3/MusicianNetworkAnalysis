can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
if you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
you will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
and it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
it's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
it's so groovy, it's outta sight
you can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
but it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

you want it all, but you can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

it's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
so you lay down on it and you do it some more
you've got to share it, so you dare it
then you bare it and you tear it

you want it all, but you can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's in your face, but you can't grab it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

it's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
it's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
it's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
it's sad, it happened, and it's a shame

you want it all, but you can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's in your face, but you can't grab it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

what is it? it's it
what is it? it's it
what is it? it's it
what is it? it's it


you want it all, but you can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's in your face, but you can't grab it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

what is it? it's it
what is it? it's it
what is it? it's it
what is it?

you want it all, but you can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's in your face, but you can't grab it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! what is it?
it's it! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
it's it! what is it?
it's it!

go on and wring my neck
like when a rag gets wet
a little discipline
for my pet genius
my head is like lettuce
go on, dig your thumbs in
i cannot stop givin'
i'm thirty-something

sense of security
like pockets jingling
midlife crisis
suck ingenuity
down, through the family tree

you're perfect yes, it's true
but without me, you're only you (you're only you)
your menstruating heart
it ain't bleeding enough for two
it's a midlife crisis
it's a midlife crisis

what an inheritance
the salt and the kleenex
morbid self attention
bending my pinky back
a little discipline
a donor by habit
a little discipline
rent an opinion

sense of security
holding blunt instrument
midlife crisis
i'm a perfectionist
and perfect is a skinned knee


it's a midlife crisis
it's a midlife crisis

know it sounds funny, but i just can't stand the pain
girl, i'm leaving you tomorrow
seems to me, girl, you know i've done all i can
you see i begged, stole, and i borrowed, yeah

ooh, that's why i'm easy (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i'm easy like sunday morning, yeah (ah, ah, ah, ah)
that's why i'm easy (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i'm easy like sunday morning

i wanna be high, so high
i wanna be free to know the things i do are right
i wanna be free, just me, oh baby
ugh


oh, ooh, that's why i'm easy (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i'm easy like sunday morning, yeah (ah, ah, ah, ah)
that's why i'm easy, yeah (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i'm easy like sunday morning

i'll be your leprechaun
shamrock or lucky charm
(whoa, yeah)
tap-dancing all alone
(it's ok)
dip into the sugar bowl
(whoa, yeah)

sunny side up
sunny side up
such a lovely way to start the day
sunny side up
sunny side up
not the only way to fry an egg
sunny side up
sunny side up

i am just a grain of sand on your beach
with all of my heart
all of my heart
a drop of rain through  your hands
rainbows will bend for me
curvy
honey bees will sting for me
stingin', stingin'

sunny side up
sunny side up
such a lovely way to start the day
sunny side up
sunny side up
dance the night away like fred astaire

come on ride my wave
ride it all the way
(sunny side up)
'til the ocean ends
(sunny side up)
i'll see you there
(sunny side up)

if you want to open the hole
just put your head down and go
and step beside the piece of the circumstance
you got to wash away the taste of evidence

wash it away
evidence, evidence, evidence
got to taste evidence

i didn't feel a thing
it didn't mean a thing
look in the eye and testify
didn't feel a thing

anything you say and we know you're guilty
hands above your head and you won't even feel me
you won't feel me

wash it away
evidence, evidence, evidence
got to taste evidence
 3x

force fed more than we'd eat in the wild
grazed on a mash that could suffocate a child
bloated, promoted in an ode to pomp and style
moistening in the feed while we choke upon the bile
cornering the market on the geese without the bones
hushing out the public in a strike without a drone
the cage became collapsable
our sticks equipped with stones

get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

hello, motherfucker
my lover
you saw it coming

set aside the scruples in a stratagem of strain
a smallpox-laden blanket, invisible with stains
inoculating bastards, bloody pecked pain
distemper has a hold, distemper has a hold
we took the second sip from a cup we made of bones
the first it was a ruse, a trick, so aptly thrown
the truth is that our youth was a carpet laid in stones

get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

hello, motherfucker
my lover
you saw it coming
goodbye, motherfucker
my lover
you had it coming

get the mother fucker on the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone
get the mother fucker on the phone

i'd like to peel the skin off
this winter day
i'd like to burn the hair off
this summer fling
what love can do when love's lost
grow overweight
and smile as if
there's nothing left to say
wear the cone of shame
town is quiet now
like it's holding its breath
stone marks the spot
you know who you are
they outlined it in chalk
word to the wise
and the barman calls time
i'd like to peel your skin off
so i can see what you really think
or if there is anything
under that cone of shame
i'd like to strip the bone off
so i can see how you're really made
and see how you really take
your special pleasure
i'd like to pull your wings off
read your lines like a gypsy
just as lonely as anything
so infinite
cone of shame covering all
you're only happy when you're pissing me off
cone of shame covering all
i'm only happy when i'm pissing you off

i'm coming lord, i'm on my way
worshiping at the altar of no one
can't remember which god is my wine
can't repent if i'm wrong; impartial
empty rituals, trinkets and fossils
and now lord, i'm on my way (my way)
amen

peace ain't coming our way
but the sun keeps burning my face
where's my faith?
my blasphemy
keep singin', lord, i'm on my way
...home

floorboards and the ceilings are creaking
and the roof is old and leaking
but looking up high to the heavens
how can we declare our independence
from evolution and penance
(our way)

sin ain't coming our way
but the sun keeps burning my face
when's my faith renewing today?
i believe in something, i think
where's my faith
my monastery

we were so happy
things worked out better than we had planned
capital from boy, woman and man
we're like ink and paper
numbers on a calculator
knew arithmetic so well
working overtime
completed what was assigned
we had to multiply ourselves
a bouncing little baby
a shiny copper penny
and he spent himself
would not listen to us
but when he lost his appetite
he lost his weight in friends
he became a fat nickel so fast
then came puberty
exponentially
soon our boy became a million
people loved him so
and helped him to grow
everyone knew the thing that was best
of course, he must invest
a penny won't do, no
a penny won't do, no
a penny won't do, no
a penny won't do, no
but he made us proud
he made us rich
but how were we to know
he's counterfeit
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah
now everything's ruined, yeah

i know the feeling
it is the real thing
the essence of the truth
the perfect moment
that golden moment
i know you feel it too
i know the feeling
it is the real thing
you can't refuse the embrace

it's like the pattern below the skin
you gotta reach out and pull it all in
and you feel like you're too close
but you swallow another dose
the pinnacle of happiness
filling up your soul
you don't think you can take any more
you never wanna let go
to touch the roots of experience
the most basic ingredients
to see the unseen glitter of life
and feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
cherish the certainty of now
it kills you a bit at a time
cradle the inspiration
it will leave you writhing on the floor

this is so unreal, what i feel
this nourishment, life is bent
into a shape i can hold
a twist of fate, all my own
just grit your teeth, make no sound
take a step away and look around
just clench your fist and close your eyes
look deep inside, hypnotize
the whisper is but a shout
that's what it is all about
yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
you will never let it slip away

like the sacred song that someone sings through you, through you
like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into, into
like the dream you know one day will come to life, life
try to hold on just a little longer, longer, stronger, stronger

it's the jewel of victory
the chasm of misery
and once you have bitten the core
you will always know the flavor
the split second of divinity
you drink up the sky
all of heaven is in your arms
you know the reason why
it's right there, all by itself
and what you are, there is nothing else
you're growing a life within a life
the lips of wonder kiss you inside
and when it's over the feeling remains
it all comes down to this
the smoke clears, i see what it is
that made me feel this way

i know the feeling
it is the real thing
the essence of the truth
the perfect moment
that golden moment
i know you feel it too
i know the feeling
it is the real thing
you can't refuse the embrace

this is so unreal, what i feel
flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
pump through your veins, can't explain
the element that's everything
just clench your fist and close your eyes
look deep inside, hypnotize
yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
you will never let it slip away
yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
you will never let it slip away
you will never let it slip away
you will never let it slip away

like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence
like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending
ending, ending
ending, ending
i know...

i started this
it's all for me
what's yours is yours and mine is mine
that's plain to see
so give it up
i've got to have

i swallow, i swallow
i swallow, i swallow

be aggressive
b-e aggressive
b-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e

what someone else
would leave behind
and spit it out, let go to waste
i claim is mine
you're my flavor of the week

i swallow, i swallow
i swallow, i swallow

be aggressive
b-e aggressive
b-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e

aggressive (aggressive, aggressive)
aggressive (aggressive, aggressive)

tall and reckless
ugly seed
reach down my throat
you filthy bird
that's all i need
this empty pit
i've got to feed
to prove i'm fit
a healthy man i've got to be
malnutrition, my submission
you're the master
and i take it on my knees
ejaculation
tribulation

i swallow, i swallow
i swallow, i swallow

be aggressive
b-e aggressive
b-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win

back and forth, i sway with the wind
resolution slips away again
right through my fingers, back into my heart
where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
sometimes i think i'm blind
or i may be just paralyzed
because the plot thickens every day
and the pieces of my puzzle keep crumbling away
but i know, there's a picture beneath
indecision clouds my vision
no one listens...

because i'm somewhere in between
my love and my agony
you see, i'm somewhere in between
my life is falling to pieces
somebody put me together

layin' face down on the ground
my fingers in my ears to block the sound
my eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
droplets of "yes" and "no"
in an ocean of "maybe"
from the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
from the top, another downhill slope of mine
but i know, the equilibrium's there
indecision clouds my vision
no one listens

because i'm somewhere in between
my love and my agony
you see, i'm somewhere in between
my life is falling to pieces
somebody put me together

backside melts into the sofa
my world my tv and my food
besides listening to my belly gurgle
there ain't much else to do
yeah, i sweat a lot
pants fall down everytime i bend over
my feet itch
yeah - i married a scarecrow

i hate you
talkin' to myself
everybody's staring at me
i'm only bleedin'

someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes
no one speaks english anymore
would anybody tell me if i was getting stupider?

i hate you
talkin' to myself
you don't feel it after awhile
you take the beating

i'm a swingin' guy
throw a belt over the shower curtain rod
and swing---
toss me inside a hefty
and put me in the ground

a drink needs me
i don't
i ain't about to guzzle no tears
so kiss my ass
newscasters, cockroaches, and desserts

i hate you
talking to myself
everbody's staring at me
i'm only bleeding

where are the kids?
maybe getting pregnant or on drugs or on welfare
on top of the world on the honor roll on parole
on the dodgers on the backs of milk cartons
on stakes in the middle of cornfields
on covers of future history books on old lady's mantles
walkin' on water nailed on crosses
i think it's time i had a talk with my kids
i'll just tell 'em what my daddy told me
you ain't never gonna amount to nothin'

you have a winning way, so keep it
your future, your future, your future
you are an angel heading for a land of sunshine
and fortune is smiling upon you
prepare for a series of comfortable miracles
from fasting to feasting, to feasting
and life to you is a dashing, bold adventure
so sing and rejoice, and sing and rejoice
and look for the dream that keeps coming back
your future, your future, your future
so pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake
'cause everything is not yet lost
does life seem worthwhile to you?
does life seem worthwhile to you?
here's how to order
yes, mm-hmm, now for the next question
does emotional music have quite an effect on you?
do you feel sometimes that age is against you?
sing and rejoice and sing and rejoice
yes, mm-hmm, that's interesting, but tell me
do you often sing or whistle just for fun?
do you feel sometimes that age is against you?
i-i can help-i can help you-i can help you help yourself!
does life seem worthwhile to you?
does life seem worthwhile to you?
here's how to order
varicose
comatose
senile

pour shame all over us harden into a crust (cement)
forget the glamour and mumble a jackhammer (under your breath)
hide your face in the curtains
better unsaid, so close
and it rolls off the tongue, almost
the world expects the pose, perfectly natural (loosen up)
smearing wet concrete and swearing you'll never be (caught)
at your weakest, etched in stone
and we're frozen here, peeking
almost, sweet talk, caffeine
make contact
up to my neck
i confess in quicksand
"but it's so easy for you
there's always one thing
do you have something to tell me?
say something
anything"
i'm warning you
i'm warning you
i'm fucking you
i'm warning you
"relax, it's just a phase
you'll grow out of it"
believe anything anyone ever tells you
it's not funny any more
it's the thing you hate the most
the thing you hate the most
the thing you hate almost

when lonesome stood over me
a future shadow
he boasted and sang to me
farewell, so long

i’ll awake you
from this living sleep
we’ll walk the shore
where you were born
in bed with me

pull the white sheet off your face
march forward, my son
a battle beyond frozen years
only for dogs here

we will rise from the killing floor
like a matador

the stained glass of bovine eyes
can see right through every tombstone lie

let us retrace every step
out of this world
and every ditch
every ditch

we will be when you will be no more
no more

the stained glass up the hangman’s ass
we served you well, now we’re coming back

atop the weight
of conscious ghosts
we’ll jump the gates
and live to rise, we will rise


let the dead live
may the dead live
and the dead live
what more can we give?
let the dead live
may the dead live
and the dead live
the dead live…

a hierarchy
spread out on the nightstand
the spirit of team
salvation is another chance
a sore loser
yelling with my mouth shut
a cracking portrait
the fondling of the trophies
the null of losing
can you afford that luxury?
a sore winner
but i'll just keep my mouth shut
it shouldn't bother me (no)
it shouldn't (no, no, no, no)
it shouldn't bother me (no)
it shouldn't
but it does
the small victories
the cankers and medallions
the little nothings
they keep me thinking that someday
i might beat you
but i'll just keep my mouth shut
it shouldn't bother me (no)
it shouldn't (no, no, no, no)
it shouldn't bother me (no)
it shouldn't
but it, but it does
it shouldn't bother me (no, no, no, no)
it shouldn't bother me
it shouldn't bother me (no)
it shouldn't bother me (no, no, no, no)
if i speak at one constant volume
at one constant pitch
at one constant rhythm right into your ear
you still won't hear (x11)

the words are so familiar
all the same greats, the same mistakes
it doesn't have to be like this
if you don't make a friend now
one might make you
so learn
the gentle art of making enemies
don't you look so surprised
happy birthday, fucker
blow that candle out
we're gonna kick you, kick you
don't say you're not because you are
don't say you're not because you are
history tells us that you are
history tells us that you are

and all you need is just one more excuse
you put up one hell of a fight
you put up one hell of a fight
i wanna hear your very best excuse
i never felt this much alive
i never felt this much alive

your day has finally come
so wear the hat and do the dance
and let the suit keep wearing you
this year you'll sit and take it
and you will like it
it's the gentle art of making enemies
i deserve a reward
cause i'm the best fuck that you ever had
and if i tighten up my hole
you may never see the light again
there's always an easy way out
there's always an easy way out
you need something wet in your mouth
you need something wet in your mouth

and all you need is just one more excuse
you put up one hell of a fight
you put up one hell of a fight
i wanna hear your very best excuse
i never felt this much alive
i never felt this much alive

i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, never felt this much alive
i never felt, this much alive
