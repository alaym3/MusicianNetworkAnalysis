come to the end of the road
still i can't let go
it's unnatural, you belong to me, i belong to you

girl, i know you really love me
you just don't realize

we should be happy together
forever, you and i

it's unnatural, you belong to me, i belong to you

girl, i'm here for you
all those times at night when you just hurt me
and just ran out with that other fella
baby, i knew about it, i just didn't care
you just don't understand how much i love you, do you?
i'm here for you
i'm not out to go out and cheat all night (baby, i'm here for you, baby)
just like you did, baby, but that's alrright
heh, i love you anyway (baby, you tried)
and i'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
right now, i'm just in so much pain, baby (we should be happy together forever)
'cause you just won't come back to me (you and i)
will you? just come back to me (yeah, yeah)

(lonely) yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(lonely) my heart hurts, baby
(lonely) yes, i feel pain too
(lonely) baby, please

still i can't let go (oh my god, oh my god, help me out a little bit, baby)
it's unnatural (baby), you belong to me (baby), i belong to you (baby)
although we've come to the end of the road

still i can't let go (i know i just can't let go, no)
it's unnatural, you belong to me, i belong to you (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

girl it's drivin' me insane
and i know i just need one more chance
to prove my love to you
and if you come back to me
i'll guarantee
that i'll never let you go

can we go back to the days our love was strong?
can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
can somebody tell me how to get things back
the way they use to be?
oh god give me a reason
i'm down on bended knee
i'll never walk again until you come back to me
i'm down on bended knee

so many nights i dream of you
holding my pillow tight
and i know i don't need to be alone

how do i say goodbye
to what we had?
the good times that made us laugh
outweigh the bad

i thought we'd get to see forever
but forever's gone away
it's so hard to say goodbye
to yesterday

i don't know where this road
is going to lead
all i know is where we've been
and what we've been through, ooh

if we get to see tomorrow
i hope it's worth all the wait
it's so hard to say goodbye
to yesterday

and i'll take with me the memories
to be my sunshine after the rain
it's so hard to say goodbye
to yesterday
and i'll take with me the memories
to be my sunshine after the rain
it's so hard to say goodbye
to yesterday

you taught me everything
everything you've given me
i'll always keep it inside
you're the driving force in my life, yeah
there isn't anything
or anyone that i could be
and it just wouldn't feel right
if i didn't have you by my side
you were there for me to love and care for me
when skies were gray
whenever i was down
you were always there to comfort me
and no one else can be
what you have been to me you will always be
you will always be the girl
in my life for all times

mama, mama you know i love you
mama, mama you're the queen of my heart
your love is like tears from the stars
mama i just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul

you're always down for me
have always been around for me even when i was bad
you showed me right from my wrong
yes you did
and you took up for me
when everyone was downin' me
you always did understand
you gave me strength to go on
there ware so many times
looking back when i was so afraid
and then you come to me and say to me
i can face anything
and no one else can do
what you have done for me
you'll always be, you will always be
the girl in my life, ooh oh

mama, mama you know i love you
mama, mama you're the queen of my heart
your love is like tears from the stars
mama i just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul

never gonna go a day without you
fills me up just thinkin' about you
i'll never go a day
without my mama

mama, mama you know i love you
mama, mama you're the queen of my heart
your love is like tears from the stars
mama i just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul

we don't even talk anymore
and we don't even know what we argue about
don't even say "i love you" no more
cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed
some people work things out
and some just don't know how to change

let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we might watch our whole lives pass us by
let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
don't do it, baby

now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
but we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
why do we hurt each other?
why do we push love away?

let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we might watch our whole lives pass us by
let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
don't do it, baby
some people will work things out
and some just don't know how to change

let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we might watch our whole lives pass us by
let's don't wait till the water runs dry
we'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
don't do it, baby
don't do it, baby
don't do it, baby

let it snow, let it snow
let it snow, let it snow

hey, it's another christmas holiday
it's a joyous thing let the angels sing
cause we're together
we got a thing here, can't let it slip away
though outside is rain and sleet
when our bodies meet...
i don't care 'bout the weather

let it snow, let it snow
outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
so baby let it snow
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

ohhhh, come over here and help me trim the tree
i wanna wrap you up baby
then you'll see you're the only present i need
there's so much more
waiting for you in store
from this precious day
i can gladly say
there's no place that i'd rather be

and ohhh, you are my everything, come a little closer
god must have sent you down from heaven

let it snow, let it snow
outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
so baby let it snow
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

let it snow, let it snow
let it snow baby, let it snow
i don't care about the weather baby
let it snow let it snow
let it snow let it snow,
let it snow
let it snow, let it snow
let it snow
let it snow
let it snow
i don't care 'bout the weather baby
all i need you to do is be with me baby
let it snow
as long as you're here with me
let it snow
i don't mind, i don't mind
let it snow
i don't care what the weather may be
as long as you're here with me

i long for
the warmth of
days gone by
when you were mine
but now those days are memories in time
life's empty
without you
by my side
my heart belongs to you
no matter what i try

when i get the courage up to love somebody new
it always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
your love won't release me, i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume
when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean
where we used to do
when autumn sheds the leaves
the trees are bare when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same, oh)

remember
the nights when (remember the night)
we closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
and vowed that you and i
would be in love for all time

everytime i think about these things i shared with you
i break down and cry 'cause i get so emotional
until you release me i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume
when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
when autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same

this loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
please let me love again (i just wanna know if i can fix this)

'cause i need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume
when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
when autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same)

remember
the warmth of
days gone by

there was a time, when i thought life was over and out
when you went away from me
my dying heart made it hard to breathe
would sit in my room because i didn't want to have to go out
and see you walking by
one look and i'd break right down and cry
now you say that you made a big mistake
never meant to take your love away
but you can save your tired apologies
cause it may seem hard to believe, but i

i'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
without you in my life
i don't need you in my life
but i, i'm doin' just fine
time made me stronger
you're no longer on my mind

you were my earth, my number one priority
i gave my love to only you
anything you'd ask of me, i would do
but somewhere down the road
you felt a change in the weather and told
me that you had to journey on
a kiss in the wind and your love was gone, all gone
now you say you never meant to play your games
but girl don't you know it's far too late
because you let our love just fall apart
you no longer have my heart

i'm doin' just fine
getting along very well without you in my life
i don't need you in my life
but i, i'm doin' just fine
time made me stronger
you're no longer on my mind
i don't need you anymore

when you said goodbye, i felt so all alone
there were times at night i couldn't sleep
my heart was much too weak to make it on my own
baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
so unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
and i ain't missin' you at all

i'm fine, (i'm doin' just fine baby)
getting along very well
without you in my life
i don't need you in my life
i'm fine (said i'm doin' just fine)
time made me stronger
you're no longer on my mind

see, baby when you walked away
(i'm doing just fine)
you didn't think it would end up this way
(getting along very well without you in my life)
but i knew you'd be coming 'round someday
(i don't need you in my life)
just as sure as my name is wanya
said i'm, i'm doin' just fine
time made me stronger your no longer on my mind

hey, baby
i'm sorry
i never meant to hurt you
please don't go

slowly, my eyes began to see
that i need you near right with me at all times, yeah
my feelings are so deep for you
that i won't let go, no, of you

i can't let this love (slip away)
and i can't turn it around (can't you see?)
and only then

please don't go away from me (i'll be there for you)
when you call my name (call my name)
i'll reach out my hand to you (and i welcome you)
to my heart (my future, my heart)
please don't go away from me, we can work it out
whatever it may be, girl
please don't go
(no, no, no, no, no, please don't go)

you know, it's not often that we see each other
that's why i cherish every moment that we spent together

when you're away, temptation may come
above of when i get caught up by you
when i get caught up by you
when i get caught up, ooh
i let go
thinking about you each day
i feel (i love you and i never let go)
your love makes my head spin 'round and 'round in a daze
yeah, oh, baby

i can't let this love (slip away)
and i can't turn it around (can't you see?)
and only then

please don't go away from me (i'll be there for you)
when you call my name (call my name)
i'll reach out my hand to you (and i welcome you)
to my heart (my future, my heart)
please don't go away from me, we can work it out
whatever it may be, girl
please don't go
(no, no, no, no, no, please don't go)
please don't go away from me (i'll be there for you)
when you call my name (call my name)
i'll reach out my hand to you (and i welcome you)
to my heart (my future, my heart)
please don't go away from me, we can work it out
whatever it may be, girl
please don't go
(no, no, no, no, no, please don't go)

please don't go away
don't go, don't go
don't go, don't go
don't go, don't go, girl

i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
i'll be there, i'll be right there
don't go, baby, hey

"can you stand the rain"

on a perfect day
i know that i can count on you
when that's not possible
tell me, can you weather the storm

'cause i need somebody who will stand by me
through the good times and bad times
she will always, always be right there

sunny days, everybody loves them
tell me
can you stand the rain
storms will come
this we know for sure
can you stand the rain

your love unconditional
i'm not asking this of you
and girl, to make it last
i'll do whatever needs to be done

'cause i need somebody who will stand by me
when it's tough she won't run
she will always, be right there for me

sunny days, everybody loves them
tell me
can you stand the rain
storms will come
this we know for sure
can you stand the rain

the last kiss we shared, tasted like a wine
sweet and bitter like, our memories
and i long for you to, come right back to me
tomorrow the time will be the same as today
nothing goes on in my heart except your memories
where will you be, and who will you think of...!

you were always gonna be my love
and you should know
even if i fall in love with somebody else
i'll remember to love you taught me how
you were always gonna be the one
and for now, i'll still be singing this love song
for... somebody like you
my first love...

time after time, baby i tried to forget our life together
but the memories are so so hard to let go
tomorrow the time will be the same as today
trying to hold back the tears when thinking of you
all i want is to be with you once more...!

you will always be inside my heart
and you should know
that i wish that i could ever let you go
i know that i love you 
now and forever see the one
and for now, i'll still be singing this love song
for... somebody like you
my first love...

you were always gonna be my love
and you should know
even if i fall in love with somebody else
i'll remember to love you to hell
you were always gonna be the one
i'll still be singing this love song
for... somebody like you
my first love...

here i am again
wondering if you're okay
can't stop this troubled heart 'cause we're apart... miles away
phone pressed up to my ear, wish you were here, holding me
a face to go with your sweet voice will bring me joy ...totally

i know i can't be there, baby, it's all right
(but i know it's alright)
i'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
i pray that you'll be there when i close my eyes
meet me in my dreams tonight

one thing that never changes no matter what
i can't wait to see you
can't wait to feel you
and there's a place of our own
where we can go, nobody knows
i close my eyes real tight
and make love to you all night

i know i can't be there, baby, it's all right
i'll be waiting for you tonight (ooh yeah)
i pray that you'll be there when i close my eyes
meet me in my dreams tonight

i wish i may, i wish you might
find sometime when you sleep tonight
to think of me and i'll appear before your eyes
it's my paradise, your world
you're my heart, my life, my girl
ooh, can't wait to go to sleep
'cause there's a possibility... you'll meet me...

i know i can't be there, baby it's all right
(it's okay)
i'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
i pray that you'll be there when i close my eyes
meet me in my dreams tonight (tonight)
i know i can't be there, baby it's all right
(it's alright)
i'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
i pray that you'll be there when i close my eyes
meet me in my dreams tonight

to ease the pain
of changing from boys ii men
no one to guide me, i'm all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
of changing from boys ii men
no one to guide me, i'm all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
of changing from boys ii men
(here we go again)

i was young (bop)
and didn't have no where to run
i needed to wake up (wake up) and see (and see)
what's in front of me (na-na-op)
there had to be a better way
sing it again a better way
to show i'm grateful (hum)
so i thought up this song
to show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
you don't know much you mean to me

'cause even though when times got rough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)
when i felt i had enough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)

all through my life
i knew that you'd be my world
knowing everywhere i go
things you taught me they would show
so many times and changes
you've seen me through
i sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you
and so i thought up this song
to show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
you don't know how much you mean to me, oh

'cause even though when times got rough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)
when i felt i had enough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)
'cause even though when times got rough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)
when i felt i had enough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)


'cause even though when times got rough
you never turned away
you were right there
and i thank you (thank you)
when i felt i had enough
you never turned away

passion overflows with every look in your eyes
infatuation, lust, and a lot of love
sweet caresses, yes, it's good to be as you want
and clench my back, ecstasy fills the air
as you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair

and somehow i survived, with no rhyme or reason
and now i know i'll make it
through the miracle of you

i know the color of love
and it lives inside of you
i know the color of truth

like a bridge
over troubled, troubled water
you stood beside me, stood beside me
and your love, did not falter

and then the angel, angel in you
gave me the strength to know that i will get through
and that's how i survived
ain't no other reason
and now i know i'll make it
through the miracle of you

i know the color of love
and it lives inside of you
i know the color of truth
(it's in the image of you)
if it comes from the heart
then you know that it's true
it will color your soul, like a rainbow
(like a rainbow)
and the color of love is in you
colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
