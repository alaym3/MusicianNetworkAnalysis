now you say you're lonely
you cried the long night through
well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
i cried a river over you
now you say you're sorry
for being so untrue
well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
i cried, cried, cried a river over you

you drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
while you never shed a tear
remember, i remember, all that you said
you told me love was too plebeian
told me you were through with me and

now you say, you say you love me
well, just to prove you do
come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
cause i cried a river over you

you drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
while you never shed a tear
remember, remember, all that you said
told me love was too plebeian
told me you were through with me and
now, now you say you love me
well, just to prove you do
come on and cry, cry, cry me a river, cry me a river
cause i cried a river over you
if my pillow could talk, imagine what it would have said
could it be a river of tears i cried in bed?
so you can cry me a river
daddy, go ahead and cry that river
cause i cried, how i cried a river over you
how i cried a river over you 

summertime and the livin' is easy
fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
so hush little baby, don't you cry

one of these mornings
you're gonna rise up singing
yes you'll spread your wings
and you'll take to the sky
but 'til that morning
there ain't nothin' can harm you
with daddy and mammy standin' by

summertime, and the livin' is easy
fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
so hush little baby, don't you cry
oh don't you cry
oh don't you cry
don't you cry
oh don't you cry 

after one whole quart of brandy
like a daisy, i'm awake
with no bromo-seltzer handy
i don't even shake
men are not a new sensation
i've done pretty well i think
but this half-pint imitation
put me on the blink
i'm wild again, beguiled again
a simpering, whimpering child again
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
when love came and told me, i shouldn't sleep
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
lost my heart, but what of it
he is cold i agree
he can laugh, but i love it
although the laugh's on me
i'll sing to him, each spring to him
and long, for the day when i'll cling to him
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
he's a fool and don't i know it
but a fool can have his charms
i'm in love and don't i show it
like a babe in arms
love's the same old sad sensation
lately i've not slept a wink
since this half-pint imitation
put me on the blink
i've sinned a lot, i'm mean a lot
but i'm like sweet seventeen a lot
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
i'll sing to him, each spring to him
and worship the trousers that cling to him
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
when he talks, he is seeking
words to get, off his chest
horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
vexed again, perplexed again
thank god, i can be oversexed again
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i
wise at last, my eyes at last
are cutting you down to your size at last
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
burned a lot, but learned a lot
and now you are broke, so you earned a lot
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
couldn't eat, was dispeptic
life was so hard to bear
now my heart's antiseptic
since you moved out of there
romance, finis. your chance, finis
those ants that invaded my pants, finis
bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more 

love is like a never-ending melody
always have compared it to a symphony
a symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon
but our song of love is slightly out of tune
once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch
now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich
seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing
like the bossa nova, love should swing
we used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time
now the lyrics and the melody don't even rhyme
for you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon
and so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune
tune your heart to mine the way it used to be
join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving
we've got to be together and before too long
there'll be no desafinado
when you give your heart  to me completely
then you won't be slightly out of tune
you'll sing along with me
there'll be no desafinado
when you give your heart  to me completely
you won't be slightly out of tune
you'll sing along with me 

look at me, i'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
and i feel like i'm clingin' to a cloud
i can't understand
i get misty, just holding your hand
walk my way
and a thousand violins begin to play
or it might be the sound of your hello
that music i hear
i get misty, the moment you're near
can't you see that you're leading me on?
and it's just what i want you to do
don't you notice how hopelessly i'm lost
that's why i'm following you
on my own
would i wander through this wonderland alone
never knowing my right foot from my left
my hat from my glove
i'm too misty, and too much in love
too misty
and too much
in love 

grab your coat and get your hat
leave your worry on the doorstep
just direct your feet
to the sunny side of the street
can't you hear a pitter-pat?
and that happy tune is your step
life can be so sweet
on the sunny side of the street
i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but i'm not afraid
this rover crossed over
if i never have a cent
i'll be rich as rockefeller
gold dust at my feet
on the sunny side of the street
i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but i'm not afraid
this rover has crossed over
if i never, never have a cent
i'll be rich as rockefeller
with gold dust at my feet
on a sunny, sunny side of the street
on a sunny, sunny side of the street 

my heart is sad and lonely!
for you i sigh, for you dear only
why haven't you seen it?
i'm all for you, body and soul
i spend my days in longing
and wondering why it's me you're wronging
i tell you, i mean it
i'm all for you, body and soul!
i can't believe it
its hard to conceive it
that you'd turn away romance
are you pretending?
it looks like the ending!--
unless, i can have
one more chance to prove dear..
my life a wreck you're making!
you know i'm yours
for just the taking
i'd gladly surrender
myself to you, body and soul! 

there's a saying old, says that love is blind
still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
so i'm going to seek a certain lad i've had in mind

looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
he's the big affair i cannot forget
only man i ever think of with regret

i'd like to add his initial to my monogram
tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

there's a somebody i'm longin' to see
i hope that he turns out to be
someone who'll watch over me

i'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
i know i could always be good
to one who'll watch over me

although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome
to my heart, he carries the key
won't you tell him please to put on some speed?
follow my lead, oh, how i need
someone to watch over me

won't you tell him please to put on some speed?
follow my lead, oh, how i need
someone to watch over me

someone to watch over me 

when the bells all ring and the horns all blow
and the couples we know are fondly kissing
will i be with you or will i be among the missing?
maybe it's much too early in the game
ah, but i thought i'd ask you just the same
what are you doing new year's, new year's eve?
wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
when it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
welcoming in the new year, new year's eve
maybe i'm crazy to suppose
i'd ever be the one you chose
out of the thousand invitations you received
ah, but in case i stand one little chance
here comes the jackpot question in advance
what are you doing new year's, new year's eve?
oh, what are you doing new year's, new year's eve? 

behold the way our fine feathered friend
his virtue doth parade
thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
the picture thou hast made
thy vagrant brow, and thy tousled hair
conceal thy good intent
thou noble upright truthful sincere
and slightly dopey gent
you're my funny valentine
sweet comic valentine
you make me smile with my heart
your looks are laughable, un-photographable
yet, you're my favorite work of art
is your figure less than greek?
is your mouth a little weak?
when you open it to speak, are you smart?
but, don't change a hair for me
not if you care for me
stay little valentine, stay!
each day is valentine's day
is your figure less than greek?
is your mouth a little weak?
when you open it to speak, are you smart?
but, don't change a hair for me
not if you care for me
stay little valentine, stay!
each day is valentine's day 

all of me, why not take all of me?
baby, can't you see i'm no good without you?
take my lips, i'll never use them
take my arms, i want to lose them
your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
tell me how can i go on, dear, without you?
you took the part that once was my heart
so why not take all of me?
all of me, why not take all of me?
can't you see i'm no good without you?
take my lips, i want to lose 'em
take my arms, i'll never use them
your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry
how can i go on, dear, without you?
you took the part that once was my heart
so why not take all of me?
come on and take, take all of me 

"our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
though by tomorrow you're gone
the song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
the melody lingers on
they may take you from me
i'll miss your fond caress
but though they take you from me
i'll still possess...
the way you wear your hat
the way you sip your tea
the memory of all that
no they can't take that away from me
the way your smile just beams
the way you sing off key
the way you haunt my dreams
no, no they can't take that away from me
we may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
still i'll always, always keep the memory of
the way you hold your knife
the way we danced till three
the way you changed my life
no, no they can't take that away from me
no, they can't take that away from me." 

mmmmm
i've got a crush on someone, guess who?
i've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
all the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
i never had the least notion
that i could fall with so much emotion
could you coo? could you care?
for a cunning cottage we could share
the world will pardon my mush
'cause i've got a crush, my baby, on you
how glad a million laddies
from millionaires to caddies
would be to capture me
but you had such persistence
you wore down my resistance
i fell and it was swell
you're my big and brave and handsome romeo
how i won you, i shall never never know
it's not that you're attractive
but, oh, my heart grew active
when you came into view
i've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
all the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
i never had the least notion
that i could fall with so much emotion
could you coo? could you care?
for a cunning cottage we could share
the world will pardon my mush
'cause i've got a crush, my baby, on you 

oops, my heart went oops
the moment that we met my heart went oops
i never will forget my heart turned hoops
the moment that i met you
oops, my feet went oops
i nearly took a spill--my knees went oops
they shook up it until my head went oops
you must'nt let it get you
i was going for a very
choo'd call a solitary sorta stroll
just a twiddle of my thumb
when i heard a lot of drums begun to pound and roar
and, oops, my heart went oops
it went into a spin of loop-di-loops
you must've thought me kin to nincompoops
the silly way i acted
of course you wouldn't know
that you were so a-glow
and i was so attracted
but, baby, take a bow
my heart is going oops right now
pops, you are the tops
the moment that my eyes behold your chops
you lift me to the skies, my heart flip-flops
you shouldn't make it make like that
bell, my buxom bell
i'm still in love with you 'cause truth tell
you always kinda knew that we would gel
'cause jam could never shake like that
i was going for a frantic
but completely unromantic sorta drive
but i knew you wouldn't quit
when i dug you and you hit me with that old time jive
(sing it, ella)
then, oops, my heart went oops
sitting on the stoops, the local droops
they nearly flipped their tops, i mean, in groups
the silly way we acted
of course they couldn't know
that you were so a-glow
and i was so attracted
yes, baby, take a bow
my heart is going oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, right now
oops, oops, then 

heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
yes, heaven, i'm in heaven
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh i'd love to climb a mountain
and reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
oh i'd love to go out fishing
in a river or a creek
but i don't enjoy it half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
now, mama, dance with me
i want my arms about you
the charms about you
will carry me through, yes
heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
(sing it ella, swing it)
heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
heaven, i'm in heaven
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh i'd love to climb a mountain
and reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
oh i love to go out fishing
in a river or a creek
but i don't enjoy it half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
come on and dance with me
i want my arm about you
the charm about you
will carry me through to
heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
yes, dance with me
i want my arm(s) about you
the charm(s) about you
will carry me through to
heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
cheek to cheek
cheek to cheek
cheek to cheek 

i'm discontented with homes that i've rented
so i have invented my own
darling, this place is lovely oasis
where life's weary taste is unknown
far from the crowded city
where flowers pretty caress the stream
cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
don't let it apart in my dream
picture me upon your knee
just tea for two
and two for tea
just me for you
and you for me alone
nobody near us to see us or hear us
no friends or relations
on weekend vacations
we won't have it known
that we own a telephone, dear
day will break and i'll wake
and start to bake a sugar cake
for you to take for all the boys to see
we will raise a family
a boy for you
and a girl for me
can't you see how happy we would be
picture you upon my knee
just tea for two
and two for tea
just me for you
and you for me alone
nobody near us to see us or hear us
no friends or relations
on weekend vacations
we won't have it known
that we own a telephone, dear
day will break, you'll wake
and start to bake a sugar cake
for you to take for all the boys to see
we will raise a family
a boy for you
and a girl for me 

you say it's only a paper moon
sailing over a cardboard sea
but it wouldn't be make believe
if you believed in me
yes, its only a canvas sky
hanging over a muslin tree
but it wouldn't be make-believe
if you believed in me

without your love
it's a honky tonk parade
without your love
it's a melody played in a penny arcade
it's a barnum and bailey world
just as phony as it can be
but it wouldn't be make-believe
if you believed in me

you say its only a paper moon
sailing over a cardboard sea
but it wouldn't be make believe
if you believed in me
yes, its only a canvas sky
hanging over a muslin tree
but it wouldn't be make-believe
if you believed in me

without your love
it's a honky tonk parade
without your love
it's a melody played in a penny arcade
it's a barnum and bailey world
just as phony as it can be
but it wouldn't be make-believe
if you believed in me
but it wouldn't be make-believe
believe if you believed in me 

somewhere there's music
how faint the tune
somewhere there's heaven
how high the moon
there is no love
when love is far away too
till it comes true
that you love me as i love you
somewhere there's heaven
it's where you are
somewhere there's music
how near, how far
the darkest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will, how still my heart
how high the moon
how high the moon
is the name of this song
how high the moon
though the words may be wrong
we're singing it
because you ask for it
so we're swinging it just for you
how high the moon
does it touch the stars
how high the moon
does it reach up to mars
though the words may be wrong
to this song
we're asking how high, high, high
high, high is the moon

another bride, another june
another sunny honeymoon
another season, another reason
for makin' whoopee
a lot of shoes, a lot of rice
the groom is nervous, he answers twice
its really killin' that he's so willin'
to make whoopee
now picture a little love nest
down where the roses cling
picture the same sweet love nest
think what a year can bring
he's washing dishes and baby clothes
he's so ambitious, he even sews
but don't forget, folks
thats what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee
another year or maybe less
what's this i hear? well, you can't confess
she feels neglected and he's suspected
of makin' whoopee
she sits alone most every night
he doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
he says he's busy, buut she says, "is he?"
he's makin' whoopee
he doesn't make much money
only five thousand per
some judge who thinks he's funny
says, "you'll pay six to her"
he says, "now judge, suppose i fail?"
the judge say, "budge right into jail
you'd better keep her, i think it's cheaper
than makin' whoopee
you'd better keep her, i think it's cheaper
than makin' whoopee" 

i try to think that love's not around
but it's uncomfortably near
my ol' heart ain't gaining no ground
because my angel eyes ain't here
angel eyes, that old devil sent
they glow unbearably bright
need i say that my love's misspent
misspent with angel eyes tonight
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
have fun you happy people
the laugh's and the joke's on me
pardon me but i got to run
the facts uncommonly clear
got to find who's now number one
and why my angel eyes
oh, where is my angel eyes?
'scuse me while i disappear
angel eyes
