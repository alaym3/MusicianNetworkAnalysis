we get some rules to follow
that and this, these and those
no one knows
we get these pills to swallow
how they stick in your throat
tastes like gold
oh, what you do to me
no one knows

and i realize you're mine
indeed a fool am i
and i realize you're mine
indeed a fool am i

i journey through the desert
of the mind with no hope
i follow
i drift along the ocean
dead lifeboat in the sun
end come undone
pleasantly caving in
i come undone
and i realize you're mine
indeed a fool am i
and i realize you're mine
indeed a fool am i

heaven smiles above me
what a gift here below
but no one knows
a gift that you give to me
no one knows

ustedes que son padres de familia...
…buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el
"dj héctor bonifacio echevarría cervantes de la cruz arroyo rojas"
esta es la radio quetzalcoatl
estación donde el rock vive y no muere
vamos a escuchar un par de temas de queens of the stone age
primero vamos a escuchar "first it giveth..."
...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… 

gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
do run-run, you won't get far
i'm machine, obsolete
the land of the free lobotomy
i wanna suck, i wanna lick
i wanna cry and i wanna spit
tears of pleasure, tears of pain
they trickle down your face the same
it's how you look, not how you feel
a city of glass with no heart

if i had a tail, i'd own the night
if i had a tail, i'd swat the flies
(uh-uh-uh-uh) yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(uh-uh-uh-uh) yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
do run-run, you won't get far
animals in the midnight zone
when you own the world, you're always home
get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves
brainwashed or true believers
buy flash cars, diamond rings
expensive holes to bury things
i'm machine, i'm obsolete
in the land of the free immortality
if i had a tail, i'd own the flies
if i had a tail, i'd swat the flies
(uh-uh-uh-uh) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(uh-uh-uh-uh) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-oh

ah-ooh, ooh-ooh
ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

(uh-uh-uh-uh) see me dancing on the scars?
(uh-uh-uh-uh) see me dance?
ah-ooh
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

if i had a tail, i will control the night
if i had a tail, i will control the night
(if i had a tail, i will control the night)
if i had a tail, i will control the night
(when we have a tail, we will control) 

calling all comas
prisoner on the loose; description
the spitting image of me
except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

shock me awake and tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
prisoner of sleep, deeper down
the rabbit hole, never to be found
again

where are you hiding, my love?
cast off like a stone; feelings
raw and exposed
when i'm out of control
pieces were stolen from me
or dare i say, given away
watching the water give in as i go down the drain
i appear missing now

i go missing, no longer exist
one day, i hope i'm someone you'd miss
shock me awake, tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
deeper asleep, further down
the rabbit hole, never to be found

it's only falling in love
because you hit the ground

dancing on wire, both ends are on fire
cut me loose
nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
wandering along the road in the summer night

i go missing, no longer exist
one day, i hope i'm someone you'd miss

shock me awake, tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
deeper asleep, further down
the rabbit hole never to be found
(confide) with my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(don't cry) i never loved anything until i loved you
(inside) i'm over the edge, what can i do?
(but shine) i haven't a thing unless i have you
(confide) with my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(don't cry) i never loved anything until i loved you
(inside) i'm over the edge, what can i do?
(but shine) i've fallen through 

i sat by the ocean
and drank a potion, baby, to erase you
face down in the boulevard
yet, i couldn't face you
there ain't no use in crying
it doesn't change anything
so, baby, what good does it do?
your friends, they all sympathize
maybe i don’t need them to

imagined i'd be your one and only
instead, i'm the lonely one
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night

there's nowhere to run away
said, "boy, if you want love
you'll have to go and find it with someone new
do you know who you really are
are you sure it's really you?"
lies are a funny thing
they slip through your fingertips
because they never happened to you
time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view
imagined i'd be your one and only
instead i'm the lonely one
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
into the light, left with nowhere to hide

closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night 

she said, "i'll throw myself away
they're just photos after all"
i can't make you hang around
i can't wash you off my skin
outside the frame is what we're leaving out
you won't remember anyway

i can go with the flow
don't say it doesn't matter (with the flow)
matter anymore
i can go with the flow (i can go)
do you believe it in your head?

it's so safe to play along
little soldiers in a row
falling in and out of love
something sweet to throw away
i want something good to die for
to make it beautiful to live
i want a new mistake
lose is more than hesitate
do you believe it in your head?
i can go with the flow
don't say it doesn't matter (with the flow)
matter anymore
i can go with the flow (i can go)
do you believe it in your head?

do you believe it in your head?
do you believe it in your head? 

when i first met her she was seventeen
seventeen
jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
burned alive

we run 'til no one could find us
girl, we outrun everyone

but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do
yeah

is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
fine with either
gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
they'll terrorize

if the world exploded behind us
i never noticed if it done
let nobody dare confine us
i'll bury anyone who does
but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do

now
the way you used to do

my heart, a ding-a-ling
a puppet on a string
c'est la vie
so lay your hands across my beating heart, love

if the world exploded behind us
i never noticed if it done
let nobody dare confine us
i'll bury anyone who does

but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do
used to do
like the way you used to do
come and love me now
like the way you used to do
like the way you used to do 

your heart is like a fortress
you keep your feelings locked away
is it easier?
does it make you feel safe?
you wander through the darkness
of wilderness behind your eyes
i know you’re afraid
but you gotta move on

every fortress falls
it is not the end
it ain't if you fall
but how you rise that says
who you really are
so get up and come through
if ever your fortress caves
you're always safe

i believe i know you
yet, i don't truly know myself
i pray you won't feel as alone as i have felt
i don't want to fail you so
i tell you the awful truth
everyone faces darkness on their own
as i have done, so will you

every fortress falls
it is not the end
it ain't if you fall
but how you rise that says
who you really are
so get up and go through
if ever your fortress caves
you're always safe in mine

the earth spins 'round the sun
and behold
everything happens
every night falls prey to sunrise

if your fortress is under siege
you can always run to me
if your fortress is under siege
you can always run
every fortress falls
it is not the end
it ain't if you fall
but how you rise that says
who you really are
so get up and go through
if ever your fortress caves
you're always safe in mine
if ever your fortress caves
you're always safe in mine
if ever your fortress caves
you're always safe in mine

come on through
come on through 

k-l-o-n los angeles, klon radio
we play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else
klon
hey, alright, it's kip kasper
klon radio, la's infinite repeat
how we feelin' out there?
how's your drive time commute?
i need a saga
what's the saga?
it's songs for the deaf
you can't even hear it

dead bull with the life from the low
i'll be massive conquistador
give me soul and show me the door
metal heavy, soft at the core
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more
pressurize, neutralize
deep fried, gimme some more!

space truckin', four on the floor
fortified with the liquor store
this one's down, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more!
shrunken head i love to adore
b-movie, gimme some gore
gimme toro, gimme some more
b-movie, gimme some gore!

uh!
yow!
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more
gimme toro, gimme some more! 

i want god to come
and take me home
'cause i'm all alone in this crowd
who are you to me?
who am i supposed to be?
not exactly sure anymore
where's this going to?
can i follow through?
or just follow you for a while?

does anyone ever get this right?
i feel no love

ain't no confusion here
it is as i've feared
the illusion that you feel is real
to be vulnerable
is needed most of all
if you intend to truly fall apart

you think the worst of all
is far behind
the vampire of time and memories
has died, i've survived
i speak, i breathe
i'm incomplete
i'm alive, hooray
you're wrong again 'cause i feel no love
does anyone ever get this right?


does anyone ever get this right?
i feel no love
i feel no love 

you wanna know if i know why?
i can't say that i do
don't understand the evil eye
or how one becomes two
and i just can't recall what started it all
or how to begin in the end
i ain't here to break it
just see how far it will bend
again and again, again and again

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(anytime, anywhere)
i wanna make it
(again and again)
i wanna make it wit chu

sometimes the same is different
but mostly it's the same
these mysteries of life
that jus' ain't my thing
if i told you that i knew about the sun and the moon
i'd be untrue
the only thing i know for sure
is what i wanna do
anytime, anywhere, and i say babe
i wanna make it
(again and again)
i wanna make it wit chu
(anytime, anywhere)
i wanna make it
(again and again)
i wanna make it wit chu
i wanna make it
(anytime, anywhere)
i wanna make it wit chu
(yeah)
i wanna make it
(whooo)
i wanna make it wit chu


i wanna make it
(again and again)
i wanna make it wit chu
i wanna make it
(anytime, anywhere)
i wanna make it wit chu
i wanna make it
(again and again)
i wanna make it wit chu
i wanna make it
(again and again and again and again and again) 

chasing, chasing
dancing, on and on
chasing, chasing
dancing, on and on
chasing, chasing
dancing, on and on
chasing, chasing
dancing, on and on

i was born in the desert, may 17 in '73
when the needle hit the groove
i commence to moving
i was chasing what's calling me

oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
one foot in the gutter
one in the clouds
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on

life is hard that's why no one survives
i'm much older than i thought i'd be
feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
footloose and fancy free
oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on

push myself, the breaking point
it's all i know to do except for lie
i chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
driven by feelings i cannot hide
to be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
on and on and on and on and...

me and my gang come to bust you loose
we move with an urgency
between pleasure and agony, on a one-way line
that's the sound that's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's
time to go, regret it later
we're gon' take it as it comes
future tense meets middle finger
we take the long way home

oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
do whatcha gotta do
oh do it now
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on 

i never lie
to myself tonight
rose-tinted eyes
color my sorrow
a shade of wine

bye-bye, black balloon
see you real soon
wave bye-bye (bye-bye)

oh, why you so sad?
what have they done?
forget those mindless baboons
they're off playing god
copycats in cheap suits
are playing it safe
while cannibals of bad news
consume a parade

is it wonderful?
kalopsia, kalopsia
kalopsia
kalopsia, kalopsia
far, far from shore
the land of nightmares
gone forever more
and i love you more
than i can control

i don't even try
why would i?

oh, why the long face?
you've got it all wrong
forget the rat in the race
we'll choke chain them all
fates favor the ones
who help themselves
the rest feel the sting of the lash
as they row (as they row)
the boat (the boat)
to hell, to hell

row 

is there anyone out there?
or am i walking alone?
when i turned around and found that you'd gone
before the first rain could fall

it seems every single time i was bleeding
broken promises that never came true
well, it ain't so long before the dawn
when the sun is gone, well, so are
well, so are you

so what's it gonna take
to get you back in bed?
gossips, frauds, or snakes
they're just our best fairweather friends (fairweather friends)
fairweather friends (fairweather friends)

one day, when we're far away
from everything that hurts
drink wine and screw is all we'll do
every day (yeah)

so what's it gonna take
to get you back in bed?
gossips, frauds, or snakes
they're just our best fairweather friends (fairweather friends)
you know the hour's late (you're under blue sky)
don't let 'em in your head (fairweather friends) (you're under)
i'm gonna pray for rain again and again
fairweather friends
fairweather friends

fairwe–
i don't give a shit about them anyhow 

everyone, it seems
has somewhere to go
and the faster the world spins
the shorter the lights will glow
and i'm swimming in the night
chasing down the moon
the deeper in the water
the more i long for you

most of what you see, my dear
is purely for show
because not everything that goes around
comes back around, you know
holding on too long is just
a fear of letting go
because not everything that goes around
comes back around, you know
one thing that is clear
it's all downhill from here

the love line in your hand
cleverly disguised
all the promises of stone
crumble in the light
most of what you see, my dear
is worth letting go
because not everything that goes around
comes back around, you know
holding on too long is just
a fear of what to show
because not everything that goes around
comes back around, you know
not everything that goes around
comes back around, you know
one thing that is clear
it's all downhill from here 

i miss you now, what's come over me?
we're hostages of geography
the wait is long and heavy too
despite what you're accustomed to
i know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
have no intentions of letting go
only us, no one in the world
only us, no one in the world

i better do something, move earth and sky
and patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
i sing only for you
to the beat of my footsteps in the night

close your eyes and dream me home
forever mine, i'll be forever yours
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore

there's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
what's done is done until you do it again
life in pursuit of a nameless prey
i've been so close, i'm so far away
it's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
i need you now, nothing is real
save me from the villains of circumstance
before i lose my place
close your eyes and dream me home
forever mine, i'll be forever yours
i'll be forever yours
i'll be forever yours
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore, and on and on
always, evermore 

ah!
oh, yeah

it's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
i got nothing to lose and only one way up
i'm burnin' bridges, i destroy the mirage
all visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

it's all smooth sailing
from here on out

i got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
got my own theme music, plays whenever i yawn
fear is the hand that pulls your strings
a useless toy, pitiful plaything
i'm in flagrante
in every way
every day

it's all smooth sailing
from here on out
i'm gon' do the damage
that needs getting done
well, god only knows one long vacation
if reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it
(it's so easy to see) yet so hard to find
make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine

i hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
i blow my load over the status quo, here we go
i'm a little bit nonchalant when i dance
i'm risking it all-ways, no second chance

it's gonna be smooth sailing
from here on out
i'm gon' do the damage
'til the damage is done

well, god only knows, so mind your behavior
follow prescriptions of your loaded savior
(every temple needs gold) every hook needs to shine
hell is at the temple of the closed mind
closed mind
closed mind
closed blinds
(ah, shut up, shut up)
it's all smooth sailing
from here on out
oh, shut up
oh, ooh
pow! 

far beyond the desert road
where everything ends up
so good, the empty space
mental erase, forgive, forgot

heal them, like fire from a gun
kneeling, my god is the sun
heal them with fire from above
kneeling, my god is the sun

well, i don't know what time it was
i don't wear a watch
so good to be an ant who crawls
atop a spinning rock
(beyond)

heal them, like fire from a gun
kneeling, my god is the sun
heal them with fire from above
kneeling, my god is the sun
yeah
heal them, like fire from a gun
kneeling, my god is the sun
healing, kneeling
godless heathens
godless heathens
always want from the sky 

hey, sister, why you all alone?
i'm standing out your window
hey, little sister, can i come inside, dear?
i want to show you all my love
i want to be the only one
i know you like nobody ever, baby

little sister, can't you find another way?
no more living life behind a shadow
little sister, can't you find another way?
no more living life behind a shadow

you whisper secrets in my ear
slowly dancing cheek to cheek
such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
they say i'll only do you wrong
come together 'cause i understand
just who you really are, yeah, baby

little sister, can't you find another way?
no more living life behind a shadow
little sister, can't you find another way?
no more living life behind a shadow
a shadow

askew
frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
buried so close to the fountain of youth i can almost reach
frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
buried so close to the fountain of youth i can almost reach
i had a vision as clear as day (frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
was delusions of grandeur in our dna (buried so close to the fountain of youth i can almost reach)
every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth (frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth (buried so close to the fountain of youth i can almost reach)
screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh-uhuh-uhai

there's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
come drink from the water before it's been drained away
every drop like an ocean, every moment undone
implosions of beauty back to where we begun
there's gotta be somewhere to bury the proof
everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth
screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
screaming, mm-hm, mm-hm, hm-hm, hmmm-hmmm-hmmm
