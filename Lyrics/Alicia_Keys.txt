seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on broadway

even if it ain't all it seems, i got a pocketful of dreams

on the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to god
hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from harlem to the brooklyn bridge
someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

and everybody know the story of david and goliath
but this is bigger than triumph
this is for the warrior, this is for you and i
this is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
god is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
even when stability's never in your favor
fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
run through the flames, that's more passion for me
i passed testimony just so the world can see
my battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
i know, i know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
i know, i know, it's mind control
i know i could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
i stand up and i stand by ya, what?

i am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
and even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
i'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
and even when i'm tired, go is the only word i know

and the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
and the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
when it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
unless you move forward

i bet they wonder how i go on, go on

i'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
the world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

i am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
in the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego
there ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

and the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
and the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[when it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
unless you move forward]

i bet they wonder how i go on, go on
i bet they wonder how i go on, go on
i'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
the world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
and everybody here tryna get on top
everybody from the burbs down to the block
gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
huh, so you think you hot?
gotta grind hard, give it all you got
you can have, or you can have not
you see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

i bet they wonder how i go on, go on
i bet they wonder how i go on, go on
i'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
the world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

i keep on fallin' in
and outta love with you
sometimes i love ya, sometimes you make me blue
sometimes i feel good, at times i feel used
lovin' you, darlin', makes me so confused

i keep on fallin' in and out
of love with you

even if you were a million miles away
i could still feel you in my bed
near me, touch me, feel me
and even at the bottom of the sea
i could still hear inside my head
tellin' me, touch me, feel me

and all the time, you were tellin' me lies

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
well, you could try sleeping in my bed

lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
you wore the crown
you made my body feel heaven bound
why don't you hold me?
near me, i thought you told me
you'd never leave me
looking in the sky, i could see your face
and i know right where i fit in
take me, make me, you know that i'll always be in love
with you
right 'til the end
oh

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

anybody could've told you right from the start
it's 'bout to fall apart
so rather than hold on to a broken dream
or just hold on to love
and i could find a way to make it
don't hold on too tight
i'll make it without you tonight

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

it’s been awhile, i’m not who i was before
you look surprised, your words don’t burn me anymore
been meaning to tell you, but i guess it’s clear to see
don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
can't be bad, i found a brand new kind of free

careful with your ego, he’s the one that we should blame
had to grab my heart back, god knew something had to change
i thought that you’d be happy
i found the one thing i need
why you mad? it’s just the brand new kind of me

it took a long, long time to get here
it took a brave, brave girl to try
it took one too many excuses, one too many lies
don't be surprised, don't be surprised

if i talk a little louder, if i speak up when you're wrong
if i walk a little taller, i been under you too long
if you notice that i'm different, don't take it personally
don't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me
and it ain't bad, i found a brand new kind of free

it took a long, long road to get here
it took a brave, brave girl to try
i've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
don't be surprised, see you look surprised

if you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again
if your were worth a while, you'd be happy to see me smile
i'm not expecting sorry, i'm too busy finding myself
i've got this, i've found me, i've found me

i don’t need your opinion, i’m not waiting for your okay
i’ll never be perfect, but at least now i’m brave
now my heart is open, and i can finally breathe
don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of free
that ain't bad, i found a brand new kind of me
don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me

if i had no more time
no more time left to be here
would you cherish what we had?
was i everything that you were looking for?
if i couldn't feel your touch
and no longer were you with me
i'd be wishing you were here
to be everything that i've been looking for

i don't wanna forget the present is a gift
and i don't wanna take for granted
time you may have here with me
'cause lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like you'll never see me again
every time you touch me
touch me like this is the last time
promise that you'll love me
love me like you'll never see me again
oh oh oh

how many really know what love is?
many of you never will
do you know until you lose it?
that it's everything that we are looking for
when i wake up in the morning
and you're beside me
i'm so thankful that i found
everything that i've been looking for

i don't wanna forget the present is a gift
and i don't wanna take for granted
the time you may have here with me
'cause lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like you'll never see me again
every time you touch me
touch me like this is the last time
promise that you'll love me
love me like you'll never see me again
so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like you'll never see me again
(can you do that for me, baby?)
every time you touch me
(see, we don't really know)
touch me like this is the last time
(say every day, we never know)
promise that you'll love me
(i want you to run with me)
love me like you'll never see me again
(like you'll never see me again)

oh oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh oh, oh oh oh

are you gonna see me when light gets dark?
the sun goes down over gramercy park
and it's become easy to hide pieces away
making up someone in the hope that you'll stay

'cause i've been trying to be everything i think you want me to be
i've been doing all the things that i think you wanna see
i've been trying to fulfill you with your every need
now you falling for a person that's not even me
said you falling for a person that's not even me (gimme the beat)

mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm (gimme the beat)
mmm, mmm
now you falling for a person that's not even me

don't get me wrong, i wasn't out to deceive
i like the attention with your eyes on me
the trouble with the truth is it's so hard to believe
now, here i stand with my heart on my sleeve

and i've been trying to be everything i think you want me to be
i've been doing all the things that i think you wanna see
i've been trying to fulfill you with your every need
now you falling for a person that's not even me
said you falling for a person that's not even me (gimme the beat)

mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm (gimme the beat)
mmm, mmm
now you falling for a person that's not even me
now you falling for a person that's not even me
'cause i forgot about the person that i used to be
