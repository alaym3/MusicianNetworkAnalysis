he left no time to regret
kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
me and my head high
and my tears dry, get on without my guy
you went back to what you know
so far removed from all that we went through
and i tread a troubled track
my odds are stacked, i'll go back to black

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
i go back to us

i love you much, it's not enough
you love blow and i love puff
and life is like a pipe
and i'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to

black, black, black, black
black, black, black
i go back to
i go back to

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to black

meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
you say "what did you do with him today?"
and sniffed me out like i was tanqueray
'cause you're my fella, my guy
hand me your stella and fly
by the time i'm out the door
you tear men down like roger moore

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good

upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
he's in a place but i can't get joy
thinking on you in the final throes
this is when my buzzer goes
run out to meet you, chips and pita
you say, "when we married"
'cause you're not bitter
"there'll be none of him no more"
i cried for you on the kitchen floor

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good

sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
we're like how we were again
i'm in the tub, you on the seat
lick your lips as i soap my feet
then you notice likkle carpet burn
my stomach drop and my guts churn
you shrug and it's the worst
who truly stuck the knife in first?

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good
i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
yeah, you know that i'm no good

they tried to make me go to rehab, but i said, "no, no, no"
yes, i've been black, but when i come back, you'll know, know, know
i ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks i'm fine
he's tried to make me go to rehab, but i won't go, go, go

i'd rather be at home with ray
i ain't got seventy days
'cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
that i can't learn from mr. hathaway

i didn't get a lot in class
but i know it don't come in a shot glass

they tried to make me go to rehab, but i said, "no, no, no"
yes, i've been black, but when i come back, you'll know, know, know
i ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks i'm fine
he's tried to make me go to rehab, but i won't go, go, go

the man said "why do you think you here?"
i said, "i got no idea"
i'm gonna, i'm gonna lose my baby
so i always keep a bottle near

he said, "i just think you're depressed"
this, me: "yeah, baby, and the rest"

they tried to make me go to rehab but i said, "no, no, no"
yes, i've been black, but when i come back, you'll know, know, know

i don't ever wanna drink again
i just, ooh, i just need a friend
i'm not gonna spend ten weeks
have everyone think i'm on the mend

it's not just my pride
it's just till these tears have dried

they tried to make me go to rehab, but i said, "no, no, no"
yes, i've been black, but when i come back, you'll know, know, know
i ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks i'm fine
he's tried to make me go to rehab, but i won't go, go, go

all i can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
and this regret i've got accustomed to
once it was so right, when we were at our height
waiting for you in the hotel at night
i knew i hadn't met my match
but every moment we could snatch
i don't know why i got so attached
it's my responsibility
and you don't owe nothing to me
but to walk away, i have no capacity

he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i'm grown (i'm grown)
and in your way, in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own

i don't understand, why do i stress the man?
when there's so many bigger things at hand
we could've never had it all
we had to hit a wall
so this is inevitable withdrawal
even if i stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
i'll be some next man's other woman soon
i cannot play myself again
i should just be my own best friend
not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i'm grown (i'm grown)
and in your way, in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own

so we are history
your shadow covers me
the sky above ablaze

he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i'm grown
and in your way, in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own

i wish i could say no regrets
and no emotional debts
'cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
so we are history, the shadow covers me
the sky above ablaze that only lovers see

he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i'm grown (i'm grown)
and in your way, my blue shade
my tears dry on their own
woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i am grown
and in your way, my deep shade
my tears dry on their own, woah

he walks away, the sun goes down
he takes the day, but i'm grown
and in your way, my deep shade
my tears dry

nobody stands in between me and my man
it's me and mr. jones
(me and mr. jones)

what kind of fuckery is this?
you made me miss the slick rick gig (oh, slick rick)
and thought i didn't love you when i did (when i did)
can't believe you played me out like that

no, you ain't worth guest list
plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
you can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
can't believe you played yourself (out) like this

rulers one thing, but come brixton
nobody stands in between me and my man
'cause it's me and mr. jones
(me and mr. jones)

what kind of fuckery are we?
nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
i might let you make it up to me (make it up)
who's playing saturday?

what kind of fuckery are you?
side from sammy you're my best black jew (best black jew)
but i could swear that we were through (we were through)
i still wonder 'bout the things you do

mr. destiny, 9 and 14
nobody stands in between me and my man
'cause it's me and mr. jones
mr. jones (me and mr. jones)
me and, oh

for you, i was a flame
love is a losing game
five story fire as you came
love is a losing game
one i wish i never played
oh, what a mess we made
and now the final frame
love is a losing game

played out by the band
love is a losing hand
more than i could stand
love is a losing hand
self-professed, profound
'til the chips were down
though you're a gambling man
love is a losing hand

though i battle blind
love is a fate resigned
memories mar my mind
love is a fate resigned
over futile odds
and laughed at by the gods
and now the final frame
love is a losing game

part i: "intro"

part ii: "stronger than me"

you should be stronger than me
you been here seven years longer than me
don't you know you supposed to be the man?
not pale in comparison to who you think i am
you always wanna talk it through, i don't care
i always have to comfort you when i'm there
but that's what i need you to do, stroke my hair

'cause i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

you should be stronger than me
but instead you're longer than frozen turkey
why'd you always put me in control?
all i need is for my man to live up to his role
always wanna talk it through, i'm okay
always have to comfort you every day
but that's what i need you to do, are you gay?

'cause i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady, and you my ladyboy

he said, "the respect i made you earn
thought you had so many lessons to learn"
i said, "you don't know what love is, get a grip
sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
i'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
i just wanna grip your body over mine
please tell me why you think that's a crime

i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me

it's okay in the day, i'm staying busy
tied up enough, so i don't have to wonder, "where is he?"
got so sick of crying, so just lately
when i catch myself, i do a 180
i stay up, clean the house
at least i'm not drinking
run around just so i don't have to think about thinking
that silent sense of content that everyone gets
just disappears soon as the sun sets

he's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
he floods me with dread
soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
pour myself over him
moon spilling in
and i wake up alone

as far as my heart, i'd rather be restless
second i stop, the sleep catches up and i'm breathless
'cause this ache in my chest
'cause my day is done now
the dark covers me and i cannot run now
my blood running cold, i stand before him (before him)
it's all i can do to assure him (assure him)
when he comes to me, i drip for him tonight
drowning me, we bathe under blue light (under blue)

he's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
he floods me with dread
soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
pour myself over him
moon spilling in
and i wake up alone

and i wake up alone
and i wake up alone
and i wake up alone

woo

when you walk in the bar
and you're dressed like a star
rockin' your "eff me" pumps
and a man notice you with your gucci bag crew
can't tell who he's looking to
'cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
and that's your whole claim to fame
never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
is to be a footballer’s wife

you don't like players
that's what you say
but you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
you don't like ballers
they don't do nothing for ya
but you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

you're more than a fan lookin' for a man
but you end up with one-night stands
he could be your whole life if you got past one night
but that part never goes right
in the morning, you're vexed
he's on to the next
and you didn't even get no text
don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

you don't like players
that's what you say
but you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
all them big ballers
don't do nothing for ya
but you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

you can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
and you lucky it's ladies' night
with your big empty purse
every week it gets worse
at least your breast cost more than hers
so you did miami, 'cause you got there for free
but, somehow, you missed the plane
you did too much e
met somebody and spent the night getting caned

without girls like you, there'd be no fun
we'd go to the club and not see anyone
without girls like you, there's no night life
all those men just go home to their wives
don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
and your old tricks no longer work
you should have known from the jump
that you always get dumped
so dust off your "fuck me" pumps

when will we get the time to be just friends?
it's never safe for us, not even in the evening
'cause i've been drinking
not in the morning where your shit works
it's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
and i've been thinking
"can we be alone?
can we be alone?"

when will we get the time to be just friends?
when will we get the time to be just friends?

and, no, i'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
if she don't first
i'll never love you like her
though we need to find the time to just do this shit together
'fore it gets worse
i wanna touch you, but that just hurts

when will we get the time to be just, just friends?
when will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?

when will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
when will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
just friends?

lent you outsidaz and my new badu
while you were thinking i didn't have a clue
tough to sort files with your voice in my head
so then i bribed you downstairs with a marlboro red, uh
and now i feel so small discovering you knew
how much more torture would you have put me through?
you probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
or how i did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

and although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
with your battered jeans and your beasties tee
now i can't work like this, no, no, with you next to me

and although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
it just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
and i'm not use to this, no, no
i observe, yeah, i don't chase
but now i sit with consequences thrust in my face, yeah
and the melodramas of my day deliver blows
and that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
a simple attraction that reflects right back to me
so i'm not as into you as i appear to be

and although my pride is not easily disturbed, yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
with your battered jeans, yeah, and your beasties tee
now i can't work like this, no, with you next to me

his message was brutal, but the delivery was kind
maybe if i get this down, i'll get it off my mind, yeah
oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
and i knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
at least you're attracted to me which i did not expect
didn't think you'd get my number down as such
but i've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

and although my pride, yeah, is not easy to disturb, yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
so with your battered jeans, yeah, and your beasties tee
now i can't work like this, no, no, with you next to me, yeah
and although my pride, yeah, is not easy to disturb, yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
so with your battered jeans, yeah

woah, ooh
oh, oh-oh, woah
oh

he can only hold her for so long
the lights are on, but no one's home
she's so vacant, her soul is taken
he thinks, "what's she running from?"

now how can he have her heart
when it got stole?
so he tries to pacify her
because what's inside her never dies

even if she's content in his warmth
she is plagued with urgency
searching kisses, the man she misses
the man that he longs to be

now how can he have her heart
when it got stole?
so he tries to pacify her
because what's inside her never dies

so he tries to pacify her
because what's inside her, it never dies
so he tries to pacify her
but what's inside her never dies

tell your boyfriend, next time he around
to buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
i wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
i'd rather him leave you then leave him my dro

when you smoke all my weed, man
you gots to call the green man
so i can get mine
and you get yours

once is enough to make me attack
so bring me a bag and your man can come back
i'll check him at the door, make sure he got green
i'm tighter than airport security teams

when you smoke all my weed, man
you gots to call the green man
so i can get mine
and you get yours

i'm my own man
so when will you learn
that you got a man but i gots to burn?
don't make no difference if i end up alone
i'd rather have myself and smoke my home grown
oh, it's got me addicted
does more than any dick did

yeah, i can get mine
and you get yours
hey, i can get mine
and you get yours

if my man was fightin' some unholy war
i would be behind him
straight shook up beside him
with strength he didn't know
it's you i'm fightin' for
he can't lose with me in tow (with me in tow)
i refuse to let him go (to let him go)
at his side and drunk on pride
we wait for the blow

we put it in writin'
but who you writin' for?
just us on kitchen floor
justice done, recitin'
my stomach standin' still
like you're readin' my will
he still stands in spite of what his scars say
and i'll battle 'til this bitter finale (bitter finale)
just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, woah, woah

yes, yes, my man's fightin' some unholy war
and i will stand beside you
but who you dyin' for?
b, i would have died, too
i'd  like to
if my man was fightin' some unholy war
yeah, if my man was fightin'

wish i could say it breaks my heart
like you did in the beginning
it's not that we grew apart
a nightingale no longer singin'
it's something i know you can't do
separate sex with emotion
i sleep alone, the sun comes up
you're still clinging to that notion

everything is slowin' down
river of no return
recognise my every sound
there's nothin' new to learn

you'll never get my mind right
like two ships passing in the night
in the night, in the night
want the same thing when we lay
otherwise, mine's a different way
a different way from where i'm going
oh, it's you again
listen, this isn't a reunion
so sorry if i turn my head
yours is a familiar face
but that don't make your place safe
in my bed, my bed, my bed

i never thought my memory
of what we had could be intruded
but i couldn't let it be
i needed it as much as you did
now, it's not hard to understand
why we just speak at night
the only time i hold your hand
is to get the angle right

everythin' is slowing down
river of no return
recognise my every sound
there's nothin' new to learn

you'll never get my mind right
like two ships passing in the night
in the night, in the night
want the same thing when we lay
otherwise, mine's a different way
a different way from where i'm going
oh, it's you again
listen, this isn't a reunion
so sorry if i turn my head
yours is a familiar face
but that don't make your place safe
in my bed, my bed, my bed

i never wanted you to be my man
i just needed company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
i lose it when you love me
like smoke, i hung around in the unbalanced
woah, ohh

it’s not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
i spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds i make
the miles i take put in your face
oh, my mistake, you’re not a floozy, then excuse me
before i talk, my style introduce me
get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
y’all know the story, y’all know the commentary
i kick the narrative, this is legendary
the good samaritan, hood thespian
like a polygamist, with a twist
will i marry again? maybe, i guess
i hold a lady’s interest i just met
the love scholar, she’s the teacher’s pet
every other eve', we meet and make each other sweat
i feel triumphant, no strings, just a fling to have fun with
i be out in london, camden
huntin’ for the answers, why did god take away the homie?
i can’t stand it
i’m a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
just hope the big man show me some courtesy
why? ‘cause i’m deemed a heart breaker
like smoke, girls linger ‘round a player, yeah yuh

i never wanted you to be my man
i just needed company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
i lose it when you love me
like smoke, i hang around in the unbalanced
woah, ohh

yo, this recession is a test
it’s affectin' my complexion
misdirectin' my affection
my concerns of bill collections
the facts is the taxes, they after me
chapter three, my property
my handlers, they dealt with me improperly
i say some things i should probably keep privately
evaluate the world bank trusts like i’m ieg
there's fly suites and my bourgeoisie
tall freak, she wouldn’t protest with me at wall street
she says, "no, you’re so deep"
i said, "no, let’s go through it"
historically so ruthless, feds came for joe louis
she said, "my man, you need to laugh sometimes"
classifies me as a bore, i told her have some wine
you colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
she’s thinkin’ that’s just so silly to say
but if you really think about it, hussy
see, a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
and it’s a dragon, it’s a bastard you’re in tune with, just lust
i’m through with you after i crush
so is that humorous enough?
the smoke i puff
tell the car to go to aura, funky buddah, whisky mist on mayfair
i hope i meet some monie love so she can show me love
nyc to uk, i might stay there
everybody in the club tonight say, “yeah”
you know how me and amy are, straight players

ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

i never wanted you to be my man
i just needed company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
i lose it when you love me
like smoke, i hung around in the unbalanced
woah, ohh

ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

understand, once he was a family man
so surely i would never, ever go through it firsthand
emulate all the shit my mother hates
i can't help but demonstrate my freudian fate
my alibi for taking your guy
history repeats itself, it fails to die
and animal aggression is my downfall
i don't care about what you got, i want it all

it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
and i question myself again, "what is it 'bout men?"
my destructive side has grown a mile wide
and i question myself again, "what is it 'bout men?
what is it 'bout men?"

i'm nurturing, i just wanna do my thing
and i'll take the wrong man as naturally as i sing
and i'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
our behavioural patterns that stick over the years

'cause it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
and i question myself again, "what is it 'bout men?"
now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
and i question myself again, "what is it 'bout men?"

ooh, it's bricked up in my head and it's shoved under my bed
and i question myself again, "what is it 'bout men?"
my destructive side has grown a mile wide
and i question myself again "what is it 'bout men?
what is it 'bout men?"

your neighbours were screaming
i don't have a key for downstairs
so i punched all the buzzers
hoping you wouldn't be there
and now my head's hurting
you say i always get my own way
but you were in the shower when i got there
and i'd have wanted to stay
but i got nothing to say

you were so beautiful before today
and then i heard what you say
man, that was ugly

the moschino bra you bought me last christmas
(put it in the box, put it in the box)
frank's in there and i don't care
(put it in the box, put it in the box)
just take it, take the box
take the box

i came home this evening
and nothing felt like how it should be
i feel like writing you a letter
but that's not me, you know me
feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
but when i left my shit in your kitchen
i said goodbye to your bedroom
it smelled of you

mister-false-pretence, you don't make sense
i just don't know you
but you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
i think i love you

the moschino bra you bought me last christmas
(put it in the box, put it in the box)
frank's in there, i don't care
(put it in the box, put it in the box)
now take it, take the box
just take it, take it
take the box
and now just take the box
take the box

i couldn't resist him
his eyes were like yours
his hair was exactly the shade of brown
he's just not as tall
but i couldn't tell
it was dark and i was lying down

you are everything
he means nothing to me
i can't even remember his name
why're you so upset?
baby, you weren't there
and i was thinking of you when i came

what do you expect?
you left me here alone
i drank so much and needed your touch
don't overreact, i pretended he was you
you wouldn't want me to be lonely
how can i put it so you understand?
i didn't let him hold my hand
but he looked like you
i guess he looked like you
no, he wasn't you
but you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
it's not cheating, you were on my mind

yes, he looked like you
but i heard love is blind

her name is cherry, we've just met
but already she knows me better than you
she understands me after eighteen years
and you still don't see me like you ought to do

maybe we could talk 'bout things
if you was made of wood and strings
while i love her every sound
i don't know how to tune you down
you're so thick and my patience's thin
so i got me a new best friend
with a pickup that puts you to shame
and cherry is her name

and when i'm lonely, cherry's there
and she plays along while i sing out my blues
i could be crying, and you don't care
you won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule
maybe we could talk 'bout things
if you was made of wood and strings
you might think i've gone too far
i'm talking 'bout my new guitar
