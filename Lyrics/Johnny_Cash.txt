the other night dear, as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
when i awoke, dear, i was mistaken
so i bowed my head and i cried

you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
you'll never know, dear, how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away

i've always loved you and made you happy
and nothing else could come between
but now you've left me to love another
you have shattered all of my dreams

you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
you'll never know, dear, how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away

i hurt myself today
to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but i remember everything

what have i become
my sweetest friend?
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

i wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here

what have i become
my sweetest friend?
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

if i could start again
a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find a way

love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
i fell into a ring of fire

i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down
and the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire


i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down
and the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire

the taste of love is sweet
when hearts like ours meet
i fell for you like a child
oh, but the fire went wild

i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down
and the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire
i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down
and the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire

and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire
the ring of fire
the ring of fire
the ring of fire
the ring...

i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds
because you're mine, i walk the line

i find it very, very easy to be true
i find myself alone when each day is through
yes, i'll admit that i'm a fool for you
because you're mine, i walk the line

as sure as night is dark and day is light
i keep you on my mind both day and night
and happiness i've known proves that it's right
because you're mine, i walk the line

you've got a way to keep me on your side
you give me cause for love that i can't hide
for you, i know i'd even try to turn the tide
because you're mine, i walk the line

i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds
because you're mine, i walk the line

i hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
and i ain't seen the sunshine since i don't know when
i'm stuck in folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to san antone

when i was just a baby my mama told me, "son
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
but i shot a man in reno just to watch him die
when i hear that whistle blowing, i hang my head and cry

i bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
well i know i had it coming, i know i can't be free
but those people keep a-movin'
and that's what tortures me

well if they freed me from this prison
if that railroad train was mine
i bet i'd move it on a little farther down the line
far from folsom prison, that's where i want to stay
and i'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
we've been talkin' 'bout jackson, ever since the fire went out
i'm going to jackson, i'm gonna mess around
yeah, i'm goin' to jackson
look out jackson town

well, go on down to jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself
yeah, go to jackson; go comb your hair
honey, i'm gonna snowball jackson
see if i care

when i breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (hah)
all them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
i'm goin' to jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'cause i'm goin' to jackson
"goodbye," that's all she wrote

but they'll laugh at you in jackson, and i'll be dancin' on a pony keg
they'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
with your tail tucked between your legs
yeah, i'll go to jackson, you big-talkin' man
and i'll be waitin' in jackson, behind my japan fan

well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
we've been talkin' 'bout jackson, ever since the fire went out
i'm goin' to jackson, and that's a fact
yeah, we're goin' to jackson, ain't never comin' back

mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mhmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm
well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'
and we've been talkin' 'bout jackson, ever since the fire went...

and i heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. one of the four beasts saying, "come and see." and i saw, and behold a white horse

there's a man going 'round taking names
and he decides who to free and who to blame
everybody won't be treated all the same
there'll be a golden ladder reaching down
when the man comes around
the hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and in each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup
or disappear into the potter's ground
when the man comes around

hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling, voices crying
some are born and some are dying
it's alpha and omega's kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

till armageddon no salaam, no shalom
then the father hen will call his chickens home
the wise men will bow down before the throne
and at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
when the man comes around
whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around

hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling, voices crying
some are born and some are dying
it's alpha and omega's kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
in measured hundredweight and penny pound
when the man comes around

and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. and i looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him

early one morning while making the rounds
i took a shot of cocaine and i shot my woman down
i went right home and i went to bed
i stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
got up next morning and i grabbed that gun
took a shot of cocaine and away i run
made a good run but i run too slow
they overtook me down in juarez, mexico
late in the hot joints taking the pills
in walked the sheriff from jericho hill
he said, "willy lee, your name is not jack brown
you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
"yes, oh yes, my name is willy lee
if you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
shot her down, because she made me slow
i thought i was her daddy but she had five more"
when i was arrested i was dressed in black,
they put me on a train and they took me back
had no friend for to go my bail
they slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
early next morning about a half past nine
i spied the sheriff coming down the line
talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
he said, "come on you dirty hack into that district court"
into the courtroom, my trial began
where i was handled by twelve honest men
just before the jury started out
i saw that little judge commence to look about
in about five minutes, in walked the man
holding the verdict in his right hand
the verdict read, in the first degree
i hollered, "lawdy, lawdy, have mercy on me"
the judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
ninety-nine years in the folsom pen
ninety-nine years underneath that ground
i can't forget the day i shot that bad bitch down

come on, you've got to listen unto me
lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be

these men have receptions; matlock a50632 and batshelter 83979. they have receptions." "yeah, i doubt that."

you can run on for a long time

sooner or later, god'll cut you down
sooner or later, god'll cut you down

go tell that long tongue liar
go and tell that midnight rider
tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
tell them that god's gonna cut 'em down
tell them that god's gonna cut 'em down

well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
my head's been wet with the midnight dew
i've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from galilee
he spoke to me in the voice so sweet
i thought i heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
he called my name and my heart stood still
when he said, "john, go do my will!"

go tell that long tongue liar
go and tell that midnight rider
tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter

"i want you to, if you don't mind, carl, i'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar."
"i'd love to!"
"one of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?"

well, my daddy left home when i was three
and he didn't leave much to ma and me
just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
now, i don't blame him cause he run and hid
but the meanest thing that he ever did
was before he left, he went and named me "sue."

well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
and it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
it seems i had to fight my whole life through.
some gal would giggle and i'd get red
and some guy'd laugh and i'd bust his head
i tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "sue."

well, i grew up quick and i grew up mean
my fist got hard and my wits got keen
i'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
but i made a vow to the moon and stars
that i'd search the honky-tonks and bars
and kill that man who gave me that awful name

well, it was gatlinburg in mid-july
and i just hit town and my throat was dry
i thought i'd stop and have myself a brew
at an old saloon on a street of mud
there at a table, dealing stud
sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "sue."

well, i knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
he was big and bent and gray and old
and i looked at him and my blood ran cold
and i said: "my name is 'sue!' how do you do!
now you're going to die!!"

well, i hit him hard right between the eyes
and he went down, but to my surprise
he come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
but i busted a chair right across his teeth
and we crashed through the wall and into the street
kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

i tell you, i've fought tougher men
but i really can't remember when
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss
he went for his gun and i pulled mine first
he stood there lookin' at me and i saw him smile

and he said: "son, this world is rough
and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and i knew i wouldn't be there to help ya along
so i give ya that name and i said goodbye
i knew you'd have to get tough or die
and it's the name that helped to make you strong

he said: "now you just fought one hell of a fight
and i know you hate me, and you got the right
to kill me now, and i wouldn't blame you if you do
but ya ought to thank me, before i die
for the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
because i'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you sue

i got all choked up and i threw down my gun
and i called him my pa, and he called me his son
and i came away with a different point of view
and i think about him, now and then
every time i try and every time i win
and if i ever have a son, i think i'm gonna name him
bill or george! anything but sue! i still hate that name!

well, you wonder why i always dress in black
why you never see bright colors on my back
and why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
well, there's a reason for the things that i have on
i wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
i wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
but is there because he's a victim of the time
i wear the black for those who've never read
or listened to the words that jesus said
about the road to happiness through love and charity
why, you'd think he's talking straight to you and me
well, we're doing mighty fine, i do suppose
in our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
but just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
up front there ought to be a man in black
i wear it for the sick and lonely old
for the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
i wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
each week we lose a hundred fine young men
and i wear it for the thousands who have died
believing that the lord was on their side
i wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
believing that we all were on their side
well, there's things that never will be right i know
and things need changing everywhere you go
but 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
you'll never see me wear a suit of white
ah, i'd love to wear a rainbow every day
and tell the world that everything's okay
but i'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
until things are brighter, i'm the man in black

i was totin' my pack along the dusty winnemucca road
when along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
"if you're goin' to winnemucca, mack, with me you can ride"
and so i climbed into the cab and then i settled down inside
he asked me if i'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
and i said, "listen, i've traveled every road in this here land"

is it getting better
or do you feel the same?
will it make it easier on you, now
you got someone to blame?

you said one love, one life
when it's one need in the night
one love, we get to share it
it leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without

well, it's too late tonight
to drag the past out into the light
we're one, but we're not the same
we get to carry each other, carry each other
one

have you come here for forgiveness?
have you come to raise the dead?
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head?

did i ask too much? more than a lot
you gave me nothing, now it's all i got
we're one, but we're not the same
well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

you say love is a temple, love the higher law
love is a temple, love the higher law
you ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
and i can't be holding on to what you've got
when all you've got is hurt

one love, one blood
one life, you've got to do what you should
one life with each other
sisters, brothers
one life, but we're not the same
we get to carry each other, carry each other
one
one

there ain't no grave
can hold my body down
there ain't no grave
can hold my body down

when i hear that trumpet sound
i'm going to rise right out of the ground
ain't no grave
can hold my body down
well, look way down the river
and what do you think i see
i see a band of angels
and they're coming after me

ain't no grave
can hold my body down
there ain't no grave
can hold my body down

well, look down yonder, gabriel
put your feet on the land and sea
but gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
until you hear from me

there ain't no grave
can hold my body down
ain't no grave
can hold my body down

well meet me, jesus, meet me
meet me in the middle of the air
and if these wings don't fail me
i will meet you anywhere

ain't no grave
can hold my body down
there ain't no grave
can hold my body down

well meet me, mother and father
meet me down the river road
and mama, you know that i'll be there
when i check in my load

ain't no grave
can hold my body down
there ain't no grave
can hold my body down
there ain't no grave
can hold my body down

well i won't back down, no i won't back down
you can stand me up at the gates of hell
but i won't back down
going to stand my ground, won't be turned around
and i'll keep this world from dragging me down
going to stand my ground and i won't back down

hey baby, there is no easy way out
hey i will stand my ground and i won't back down

well i know what's right, i got just one life
in a world that keeps on pushing me around
but i stand my ground and i won't back down

everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
i think you only live to see the lights of town
i wasted my time when i would try, try, try
cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
you'll call for me but i'm gonna tell you: "bye, bye, bye!"
when i turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

you're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
when everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
you're gonna cry, cry, cry

i lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
you stay a little while and then you're gone again
every question that i ask, i get a lie, lie, lie
for every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

when your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
i'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: "why, why, why?"
when i remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

you're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
it'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
you're gonna cry, cry, cry

i want to live
i want to give
i've been a miner
for a heart of gold
it's these expressions
i never give
that keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
i've been to hollywood
i've been to redwood
i crossed the ocean
for a heart of gold
i've been in my mind
it's such a fine line
that keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
that keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
for a heart of gold
you keep me searching
for a heart of gold
i've been a miner
for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old

at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind will come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone
i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone
oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there
i wonder if she's sorry
for leaving what we'd begun
there's someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
i still miss someone
oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there
i wonder if she's sorry
for leaving what we'd begun
there's someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
i still miss someone

ten years ago on a cold dark night
someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
there were few at the scene, but they all agreed
that the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me

the judge said, "son, what is your alibi?
if you were somewhere else, you won't have to die"
i spoke not a word, though it meant my life
i'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
she stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
but some times at night when the cold wind calls
she comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me

nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me

an old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy drawl
their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
for he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
ghost riders in the sky

their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
he's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
on horses snortin' fire as they ride on, hear their cry
as the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"if you want to save your soul from hell from ridin' on our range
then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies"

yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
