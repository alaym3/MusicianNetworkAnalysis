everybody gets high sometimes, you know
what else can we do when we're feelin' low?
so take a deep breath and let it go
you shouldn't be drowning on your own

and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know...

i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight

'cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
it's how we learn and how we grow
and i wanna lay with you 'til i'm old, o-old
you shouldn't be fighting on your own

and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know...
i won't let go
and i won't let go, no-no, no-no, no i won't
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight

come on, come on
save me from my rocking boat
i just wanna stay afloat
i'm all alone
and i hope, i hope someone's gonna take me home
somewhere i can rest my soul (rest my soul)
i need to know you won't let go

and i won't let go, no-no, no-no, no, i won't
i'll be your lifeline tonight
you won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight

i won't let go, no no, no no, no, i won't
i'll be your lifeline tonight
you won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight 

do you recall, not long ago
we would walk on the sidewalk?
innocent, remember?
all we did was care for each other
but the night was warm
we were bold and young
all around, the wind blows
we would only hold on to let go
blow a kiss, fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
all we need is somebody to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
all-all-all we need is somebody to lean on

(hey, hey, hey, hey)
(hey, hey, hey, hey)
what will we do when we get old?
will we walk down the same road?
will you be there by my side?
standing strong as the waves roll over
when the nights are long
longing for you to come home
all around, the wind blows
we would only hold on to let go
blow a kiss, fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
all we need is somebody to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss, fire a gun
all-all-all we need is somebody to lean on

você prepara, mas não dispara
você repara, mas não encara
se acha o cara, mas não me para
tá cheio de maldade, mas não me encara
você já tá querendo e eu também
mas é cheio de história e de porém
virou covarde, tô com vontade
mas você tá demorando uma eternidade

se você não vem eu vou botar pressão
não vou te esperar, tô cheia de opção
eu não sou mulher de aturar sermão
me encara, se prepara

sometimes i think we're the brightest stars
and i try to believe we'll find a way
will life change, will our hearts turn colder? (major lazer)
all the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
we can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
all the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

only love will make us ache
only love is worth the chase
all my love, i know we're waiting for this
on the rocks up on the mountaintops

all my love
all my love
all my love
up on the mountaintop

all the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
we're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
i would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
all the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
only love will make us ache
only love is worth the chase
all my love, i know we're waiting for this
on the rocks up on the mountaintops

all my love
all my love
all my love
up on the mountaintop
all my love
all my love

you're always on my mind
oh, there'll come a day
day where we can fly
reach the glory haze, oh, hey
high up in the sun in the brighter sky
sun in the brighter sky

only love will make us ache
only love is worth the chase
all my love, i know we're waiting for this
on the rocks up on the mountaintops
all my love
all my love

mai tú pareces de island
hay algo en ti que no es normal
y a mí ése algo me encanta

en su juego siempre quiere ganar

no sabe cómo parar
cuando su cuerpo mueve, más ella pide
no conoce el final, ah ah ah, hey, yeah
no te dejo de mirar
ay, ya parezco tu detective
buscando huellas para encontrarte
y tú más desapareces

ya no me aguanto más yo la quiero tener
su vibra poderosa la quiero entender
de misteriosos ojos me enamoré, ya, oh oh
y quería ganar
de lejos la vi rechazando botellas
no le importaba nada sólo quería bailar
le dijeron que balvin quería conocerla
pero poco le interesaba
no sabe cómo parar
cuando su cuerpo mueve, más ella pide
no conoce el final, ah ah ah, hey, yeah
no te dejo de mirar
ay, ya parezco tu detective
buscando huellas para encontrarte
y tú más desapareces
