ooooooooooh 

i look in your eyes and i can see
we've loved so dangerously
you're not trusting your heart to anyone
you tell me you're gonna play it smart
we're through before we start
but i believe that we've only just begun
when it's this good, there's no saying no
i want you so, i'm ready to go

through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever, come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire

i know you're afraid of what you feel
you still need time to heal
and i can help if you'll only let me try
you touch me and something in me knew
what i could have with you
now i'm not ready
to kiss that dream goodbye
when it's this sweet, there's no saying no
i need you so, i'm ready to go
through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever, come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire

through the test of time

through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever, come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire

to the wire, to the limit
through the fire, through whatever
through the fire, to the limit
through the fire, through whatever
through the fire, to the limit
through the fire, through whatever

captured effortlessly
that's the way it was
happened so naturally
i did not know it was love
the next thing i felt was you
holding me close
what was i gonna do?
i let myself go
and now we're flyin' through the stars
i hope this night will last forever
i've been waitin' for you
it's been so long
i knew just what i would do
when i heard your song
filled my heart with your bliss
gave me freedom
you knew i could not resist
i needed someone
and now we're flyin' through the stars
i hope this night will last forever
oh oh oh oh
ain't nobody
loves me better
makes me happy
makes me feel this way
ain't nobody
loves me better than you
i wait for night time to come
and bring you to me
i can't believe i'm the one
i was so lonely
i feel like no one could feel
i must be dreamin'
i want this dream to be real
i need this feelin'
i make my wish upon a star
and hope this night will last forever
oh oh oh oh
ain't nobody
loves me better
makes me happy
makes me feel this way
ain't nobody
loves me better than you
first you put your arms around me
then you put your charms around me
i can't resist this sweet surrender
oh my nights are warm and tender
we stare into each other's eyes
and what we see is no surprise
got a feeling most would treasure
and a love so deep we cannot measure
ain't nobody
loves me better
makes me happy
makes me feel this way
ain't nobody
loves me better than you 

i would love you anyway
even if you cannot stay
i think you are the one for me
here is where you ought to be
i just want to satisfy you
though you're not mine, i can't deny it
don't you hear me talking, baby?
love me now, or i'll go crazy
oh oh, sweet thing
oh, you know you're my everything
oh oh, sweet thing
oh, you know you're my everything
yes, you are
i wish you were my lover
but you act so undercover
to love you, child, my whole life long
be it right or be it wrong
i'm only what you make me, baby
don't walk away, don't be so shady
don't want your mind, don't want your money
these words i say, they may sound funny but
oh oh, sweet thing
oh, you know you're my everything
oh oh, sweet thing
oh, you know you're my everything
yes, you are

all night and day
just chippin' away
it's all in a day's work
tryin' hard to defend
the time that i spend alone
the time that you lose
exploiting the blues
won't get the job done
as hard as it bites
i'm keepin' my sights on you
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
when the chips are down
in the cool of the night
when nothing seems right
the feeling can take you
strange as it seems
you make your own dreams come true
if you try to conceal
the way that you feel
you're asking for trouble
just as sure as i cry
i'm keeping my eye on you
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
when the chips are down
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
what cha' gonna do for me
when the chips are down
you don't have to tell me
i'm to blame for this
'cause what you hold against me
is what i miss

troubled little angel
inconsistent flying blind most of the time
drama queen
preening and untangling
feathers in her wings
captured by her dreams
desperately, she sings
needy little baby
open up your heart
don't you be afraid to feel
needy little baby
hiding deep inside
don't you know your love can heal
troubled little angel
inconsistent flying blind most of the time
don't know who to be, yeah
always rearranging the
wreckage of her life
ever holding tight
to the hope that she'll be free
needy little baby
open up your eyes
don't you be afraid to feel
needy little baby
hiding deep inside
don't you know that love can heal
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, ah!
talking to you, angel
angel
deep inside
of me
talking to you, angel
angel
one day you'll be free
angel (angel)
angel (angel)
deep inside
of me (inside ... inside)
angel (angel)
angel (angel)
one day
you'll be
free
one day you'll open your wings
one day you'll fly
one day you'll fly 

when your heart is free
its easy to make a decision
when your head is clear
you know you have good judgment
but when your life is turning topsy turvey
and you have no reasons for whats disturbing
remember these words my father said to me
(chorus)
he said: keep your head up dont say you love him
(keep your head)
walk away from all that has hurt you
(find your power)
find your power you know your strong
take that step and it will help you along
when your mind's at peace
(at peace)
sleep comes so very peacefully
when you start to dream
they are wonderful and so very sweet
but when your life is turning topsy turvey
and you have no answers for whats disturbing
remember these words a preacher said to me
(chorus)
he said: keep your head up dont say you love him
(keep your head up)
walk away from all that is hurting
(find your power)
find your power you know your strong
(take that step)
make that step and it will help you along (2x)
why give up this time you can win
(you can win)
why give up this battle is within
(is within)
why stay when you don't know what he's gonna do
why choose him when its time to choose you
keep your head up dont say you love him
walk away from all that is hurting
find your power you know your strong
make that step it will help you along (2x)
keep your head up (6x) 

here is my hand for you to hold
here's the part of me they have not sold
i've wandered far, i've had my fill
i need you now, do you love me still
only you have seen the hidden part of me
call me foolhardy if you will
but i loved you when, do you love me still
so many smiles and lies surround me
empty expectations, faceless fears
sometimes this life is a bitter pill
i love you now, do you love me still
you have been mine since time untold
our love is immortal, don't you know
others will come, and they will go
but i loved you young, i love you old
only you have seen, the other side of me
call me naive, i think you will
but i loved you then, do you love me still
here are the eyes that only see you
here is the mouth that only calls your name
here is the soul that can not kill
i love you now, do you love me still 

a faded photograph i mailed to you
with feelings i don't want to face
and a love song of surrender in blue
i remember when you took my breath away

chanson papillon, we were very young
like butterflies, like hot butterfly
chanson papillon, we had just begun
we let it slide on by
we didn't realize

all our memories are burning in time
like a bittersweet perfume
can you tell me how a love that's so fine
could have climaxed in a single afternoon


gone are the days of instant romance
and the nights of slow goodbyes
that was a time of life when foxy was the dance
but then you got wise to all my lies

chanson papillon, chanson
chanson papillon, chanson
chanson papillon, chanson
chanson papillon, chanson

i just want to remind you
oh, do you remember?
do you remember? 

my funny valentine
sweet, comic valentine
you make me smile with my heart
ohhhhh
your looks are laughable
unphotographable
yet
you're my favorite work of art
is your figure less than greek?
is your mouth a little bit weak?
when you open it to speak
are you smart?
ohhhhhh
don't, baby
don't change your hair for me
not if you care for me
stay
stay little valentine
stay
each day is valentine's day
each day is valentine's day
ohhhh
ummm
mmmmm
stay little valentine
stay
stay
stay
ahh, yeah
each day is valentine's
each day is valentine's day
valentine's day

when you walked into my lonely life tonight
i saw my destiny, i saw eternity tonight
and the moment i held you i knew it
what we do is decided before we do it
fate, this could only be
fate, i never thought i'd believe in
fate, now i understand
it's part of the plan
i was meant to be your woman
time stood still, and we lost on words to say
and though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
oh we knew it was love we were feeling
we were destined to give it a whole new meaning
fate, this could only be
fate, i never thought i'd believe in
fate, now i understand
it's part of the plan
i was meant to be your woman
in my heart i feel i've loved you all my life
i was in the dark, but now i think i've seen the light
i rang like a bell with your laughter
something tells me i'll love you forever and ever
fate (this could only be)
it was fate (this could only be)
it's part of the plan
i was meant to be your woman
(it's part of the plan)
i'll love you forever and ever 

(clouds)
different shapes and sizes
hiding the horizon
(clouds)
in the distance, coming to change my plans
all my dreams will melt like sand
(clouds)
the moment that you say goodbye
they're gonna rush right to the sky

baby, baby, please don't go
it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain down tears
of heartaches and fears
it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain i know for sure
'cause you don't reach for me no more
it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain down tears
of heartaches and fears
it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain
there in the distance
is that number one pain

(clouds)
thunder is the warning
so dark and so alarming
(clouds)
go away, go away
go, don't take away my sunny days


(clouds)

it's getting so dark out i just can't see
(clouds)
go away, go away

a long time ago in the 40's
dizzy and bird gave us this song
they called it "a night in tunisia"
and the melody still lingers on
it was new and very strange
blew the squares right off the stage
few could play along
but the melody still lingers on
max and miles to name just two
together they grew
the music was young and strong
and the melody still lingers on
they paved the way for generations
from coltrane to stevie
no one could stop the winds of change
without them where'd we be?
the duke and the prez were there before
the past you can't ignore
the torch is lit, we'll keep the flame
and the melody remains the same
in the 40's
a night in tunisia
in the 40's
a night in tunisia
in the 40's
a night in tunisia
in the 40's
a night in tunisia
