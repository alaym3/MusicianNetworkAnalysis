hey there, people, i'm bobby brown
they say i'm the cutest boy in town
my car is fast, my teeth is shiney
i tell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
here i am at a famous school
i'm dressin' sharp and i'm actin' cool
i got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
let her do all the work and maybe later i'll rape her

oh god i am the american dream
i do not think i'm too extreme
an' i'm a handsome son of a bitch
i'm gonna get a good job and be real rich
(get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good job)

women's liberation
came creepin' all across the nation
i tell you people, i was not ready
when i fucked this dyke by the name of freddie
she made a little speech then
aw, she tried to make me say when
she had my balls in a vise, but she left the dick
i guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick

oh god i am the american dream
but now i smell like vaseline
an' i'm a miserable sonofabitch
am i a boy or a lady... i don't know which
(i wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)

so i went out and bought me a leisure suit
i jingle my change, but i'm still kinda cute
got a job doin' radio promo
and none of the jocks can even tell i'm a homo
eventually me and a friend
sorta of drifted along into s&m
i can take about an hour on the tower of power
as long as i gets a little golden shower

oh god i am the american dream
with a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
an' i'll do anything to get ahead
i lay awake nights sayin,' "thank you, fred!"
oh god, oh god, i'm so fantastic!
thanks to freddie, i'm a sexual spastic
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now; i'm goin' down

and my name is bobby brown
watch me now; i'm goin' down
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now; i'm goin' down
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now; i'm going down
haha, yeah, i knew you'd be surprised

a boring old garage in a residential area with a teen-age band rehearsing in it. joe (the main character in the central scrutinizer's special presentation) sings to us of the trials and tribulations of garage-band husbandry...

we take you now, to a garage, in canoga park...
(it makes its own sauce...)

it wasn't very large
there was just enough room to cram the drums
in the corner over by the dodge
it was a fifty-four
with a mashed up door
and a cheesy little amp
with a sign on the front said "fender champ"
and a second hand guitar
it was a stratocaster with a whammy bar

at this point, larry (a guy who will eventually give up music and earn a respectable living as a roadie for a group called toad-o) joins in the song...

we could jam in joe's garage
his mama was screamin'
his dad was mad
we was playin' the same old song
in the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
play it all night long
it was all we knew, 'n' easy too
so we wouldn't get it wrong
all we did was bend the string like...

hey!
down in joe's garage
we didn't have no dope or lsd
but a coupla quarts'a beer
would fix it so the intonation
would not offend your ear
and the same old chords goin' over 'n' over
became a symphony
we would play it again 'n' again 'n' again
cause it sounded good to me
one more time!

we could jam in joe's garage
his mama was screaming
"turn it down!"
we was playing' the same old song
in the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
play it all night long
it was all we knew, and easy too
so we wouldn't get it wrong
even if you played it on the saxophone

we thought we was pretty good
we talked about keepin' the band together
'n' we figured that we should
cause about this time we was gettin' the eye
from the girls in the neighborhood
they'd all come over 'n' dance around
like...
(twenty teen-age girls dash
in and go stomp-clap
stomp-clap-clap...)
so we picked out a stupid name
had some cards printed up for a couple 'a bucks
'n' we was on our way to fame
got matching suits 'n' beatle boots
'n' a sign on the back of the car
'n' we was ready to work in a go-go bar

one, two, three, four
let's see if you got some more!

people seemed to like our song
they got up 'n' danced 'n' made a lotta noise
an' it wasn't 'fore very long
a guy from a company we can't name
said we ought'a take his pen
'n' sign on the line for a real good time
but he didn't tell us when
these "good times" would be somethin'
that was really happenin'
so the band broke up
an' it looks like
we will never play again
guess you only get one chance in life
to play a song that goes like...

*and, as the band plays their little song
mrs. borg (who keeps her son sy
in the closet with the vacuum cleaner)
screams out the window...*

turn it down!
turn it down!
i have children sleeping here...
don't you boys know any nice songs?

well the years was rollin' by, yeah
heavy metal 'n' glitter rock
had caught the public eye, yeah
snotty boys with lipstick on
was really flyin' high, yeah
'n' then they got that disco thing
'n' new wave came along
'n' all of a sudden i thought the time
had come for that old song
we used to play in "joe's garage"
and if i am not wrong
you will soon be dancin' to the-

the white zone is for loading and unloading only
if you gotta load or unload, go to the white zone

well the years was rollin' by
the years were rollin' by (i'm calling the police!)
the years were rollin' by
the years were rollin' by (i did it! they'll be here, shortly!)
the years were rollin' by (this is the police...)
(i'm not joking around anymore!)
the years was rollin' by (we have the garage surrounded)
(give yourself up)
(we will not harm you, or hurt you neither)
the years were rollin' by
you'll see them, there they are, they're coming!)
(this is the police)
the years were rollin' by
(give yourself up)
(we will not harm you)
(listen to that mess, would you?)
(this is the police, give yourself up)
(we have the garage surrounded!)
(everyday this goes on around here!)
the years were rollin' by
(we will not harm you, or maim you)
the years were rollin' by
(swat team 4, move in!)
(he used to cut my grass! he was a very nice boy!)
(this is the police, come out with your hands up!)
(that's disgusting...)

this is the central scrutinizer...
that was joe's first confrontation with "the law"...
naturally, we were easy on him
one of our friendly counsellors gave him a donut
and told him to stick closer
to church-oriented social activities...

a festive cyo party with crepe paper streamers, contestants for the broom dance, the hokey pokey, baked goods, & father riley making sure the lights don't go down too low...

catholic girls (at the cyo)

joe had a girlfriend named mary
she used to go the church club every week
they'd meet each other there
hold hands and think pure thoughts
but one night at the social club meeting-

the muffin man is seated at the table
in the laboratory of the utility muffin research kitchen...
reaching for an oversized chrome spoon
he gathers an intimate quantity of dried muffin remnants!
and, brushing his scapular aside
proceeds to dump these inside of his shirt
he turns to us and speaks:
"some people like cupcakes better. i, for one care less for them!"
arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot
of a fully charged icing-anointment utensil
he poots forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
near- ha, ha
let's try that again-
he poots forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
near the summit of a dense-but-radiant muffin
of his own design
later he says:
"some people, some people like cupcakes exclusively
while i myself i say there is naught
nor ought there be nothing so exalted
on the face of god's grey earth
as that prince of foods... the muffin!"

girl, you thought he was a man
but he was a muffin
he hung around till you found
that he didn't know nuthin'

girl, you thought he was a man
but he only was a-puffin'
no cries is heard in the night
as a result of him stuffin'


girl, you thought he was a man

i want a nasty little jewish princess
with long phony nails and a hairdo that rinses
a horny little jewish princess
with a garlic aroma that could level tacoma
lonely inside
well, she can swallow my pride
i need a hairy little jewish princess
with a brand new nose, who knows where it goes
i want a steamy little jewish princess
with over-worked gums, who squeaks when she cums
i don't want no troll
i just want a yemenite hole
i want a darling little jewish princess
who don't know shit about cooking and is arrogant looking
a vicious little jewish princess
to specifically happen with a pee-pee that's snappin
all up inside
i just want a princess to ride
awright, back to the top...everybody twist
i want a funky little jewish princess
a grinder; a bumper, with a pre-moistened dumper
a brazen little jewish princess
with titanic tits, and sand-blasted zits
she can even be poor
so long as she does it with four on the floor
(vapor-lock)
i want a dainty little jewish princess
with a couple of sisters who can raise a few blisters
a fragile little jewish princess
with roumanian thighs, who weasels n lies
for two or three nights
won't someone send me a princess who bites
won't someone send me a princess who bites
won't someone send me a princess who bites
won't someone send me a princess who bites

i couldn't say where she's coming' from
but i just met a lady named dinah-moe humm
she stroll on over, say look here, bum
i got a forty-dollar bill say you can't make me cum
(y'jes can't do it)
she made a bet with her sister who's a little bit dumb
she could prove it any time all men was scum
i don't mind that she called me a bum
but i knew right away she was really gonna cum
(so i got down to it)
i whipped off her bloomers 'n stiffened my thumb
an' applied rotation on her sugar plum
i poked 'n stroked till my wrist got numb
but i still didn't hear no dinah-moe humm
dinah-moe humm
dinah-moe humm
dinah-moe humm
where's this dinah-moe
comin' from
i done spent three hours
an' i ain't got a crumb
from the dinah-moe, dinah-moe, dinah-moe
from the dinah-moe humm
got a spot that gets me hot, ow!
an' you ain't been to it
(no no no no!)
got a spot that gets me hot, ow!
an' you ain't been to it
(no no no!)
got a spot that gets me hot
but you ain't been to it
(no no no no no!)
got a spot that gets me hot
but you ain't been to it
cause i can't get into it
unless i get out of it
an' i gotta get out of it
before i get into it
cause i never get into it
unless i get out of it
an' i gotta be out of it
to get myself into it
(she looked over at me with a glazed eye
and some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area
and she said . . . )
just get me wasted
an' you're half-way there
cause if my mind's tore up
then my body don't care
i rubbed my chinny-chin-chin
an' said my-my-my
what sort of thing
might this lady get high upon?
i checked out her sister
who was holdin' the bet
an' wondered what kind of trip
the young lady was on
the forty-dollar bill didn't matter no more
when her sister got nekkid an' laid on the floor
she said dinah-moe might win the bet
but she could use a little ______ if i wasn't done yet
i told her
just because the sun
want a place in the sky
no reason to assume
i wouldn't give her a try
so i pulled on her hair
got her legs in the air
an' asked if she had any cooties in there
(whaddya mean cooties! no cooties on me!)
she was buns-up kneelin'
buns up!
i was wheelin' an dealin'
wheelin' an' dealin' an' ooooh!
she surrender to the feelin'
she sweetly surrendered
an' she started in to squealin'
dinah-moe watched from the edge of the bed
with her lips just a-twitchin' an' her face gone red
some drool rollin' down
from the edge of her chin
while she spied the condition
her sister was in
she quivered 'n quaked
an' clutched at herself
while her sister made a joke
about her mental health
till dinah-moe finally
did give in
but i told her
all she really needed
was some discipline
kiss my aura . . . dora
m-m-m . . . it's real angora
would y'all like some more-a?
right here on the flora?
an' how 'bout you, fauna?
y'wanna?
mmm . . . sound like you're chokin' on somethin'
did you say you want some more?
well, here's some more
(oh, baby . . . )
oh, sure . . . look
d'you think i could interest you
in a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers?
mmm . . . tweezers!
wait a minute, lemme sterilize 'em
gimme your lighter
i couldn't say where she's coming' from
but i just met a lady named dinah-moe humm
she stroll on over, say look here, bum
i got a forty-dollar bill say you can't make me cum
(y'jes can't do it)
i whipped off her bloomers 'n stiffened my thumb
an' applied rotation on her sugar plum
i poked 'n stroked till my wrist got numb
an' you know i heard some dinah-moe humm
some dinah-moe humm
dinah-moe humm
dinah-moe humm

she had that camarillo brillo
flamin' out along her head
i mean her mendocino bean-o
by where some bugs had made it red

she ruled the toads of the short forest
and every newt in idaho
and every cricket who had chorused
by the bush in buffalo

she said she was
a magic mama
and she could throw a mean tarot
and carried on without a comma
that she was someone i should know

she had a snake for a pet
and an amulet
and she was breeding a dwarf
but she wasn't done yet
she had gray-green skin
a doll with a pin
i told her she was awright
but i couldn't come in
(i couldn't come in right then...)

and so she wandered
through the door-way
just like a shadow from the tomb
she said her stereo was four-way
an' i'd just love it in her room

well, i was born
to have adventure
so i just followed up the steps
right past her fuming incense stencher
to where she hung her castanets

she stripped away
her rancid poncho
an' laid out naked by the door
we did it till we were un-concho
an' it was useless any more

she had a snake for a pet
and an amulet
and she was breeding a dwarf
but she wasn't done yet
she had gray-green skin
a doll with a pin
i told her she was awright
but i couldn't come in
(actually, i was very busy then)

and so she wandered
through the door-way
just like a shadow from the tomb
she said her stereo was four-way
an' i'd just love it in her room

well, i was born
to have adventure
so i just followed up the steps
right past her fuming incense stencher
to where she hung her castanets

she said she was a magic mama
and she could throw a mean tarot
and carried on without a comma
that she was someone i should know

is that a real poncho? i mean
is that a mexican poncho or is that a sears poncho?
hmmm, no foolin'...

shortly after his liaison with the taco stand lady, joe makes a horrible discovery...

why does it hurt when i pee?
why does it hurt when i pee?
i don't want no doctor
to stick no needle in me
why does it hurt when i pee?

i got it from the toilet seat
i got it from the toilet seat
it jumped right up
and grabbed my meat
got it from the toilet seat

aaaaah!

my balls feel like a pair of maracas
my balls feel like a pair of maracas
oh god, i probably got the
gono-co-co-coccus!
my balls feel like a pair of maracas
ai-ee-ai-ee-ahhhh!

why does it, why does it
why does it, why does it hurt when i peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?

whoa, are we moving too slow
have you seen us, uncle remus
we look pretty sharp in these clothes (yes, we do)
unless we get sprayed with a hose
it ain't bad in the day if they squirt it your way
except in the winter when it's froze
and it's hard if it hits on your nose (on your nose)

just keep your nose to the grindstone they say
will that redeem us, uncle remus
i can't wait 'til my fro is full grown
i'll just throw away my du-rag at home
i'll take a drive to beverly hills just before dawn
and knock the little jockeys off the rich people's lawn
and before they get up i'll be gone, i'll be gone
before they get up i'll be knocking the jockeys off the lawn
down in the dew

stunned by joe's command of its native tongue, a gleaming model xqj-37 nuclear powered pan-sexual roto-plooker named sy borg, previously thought to be the son of the lady who called the police on cut two, side i, spindles over to joe and says

pick me! i'm clean!
i am also programmed for conversational english!
may i have this dance?
i've got a better idea

whereupon, in order to prove to joe that he is no ordinary appliance, sy quotes a few lines of traditional american love poetry

what's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?
do you come here often?
wait a minute
i've got it
you're an italian

joe and his date are going back to the apartment
to have a little party

after a few weeks on the bus, being porked by toad-o's road crew, and being too exhausted to do their laundry on a regular basis, mary is dumped in miami. with no money (and no other famous rock groups due into the area for at least three weeks), she tries to pick up a few bucks by entering the wet t-shirt contest at the brasserie..

looks to me like something funny
is going on around here
people laughin' 'n dancin' 'n payin'
entirely too much for their beer

and they all think they are clean outta-site
and they're ready to party cause the sign outside says it's
wet t-shirt nite
and they all crave some hot delight

well the girls are excited because in a minute
they're gonna get wet
and the boys are delighted because all the titties
will get 'em upset

and they all think they're reety-alright
and they're ready to boogie cause the sign outside says it's
wet t-shirt nite
'n they all crave some pink delight

when the water gets on 'em their ninnies get rigid
'n look pretty bold
it's a common reaction that makes an attraction
whenever it's cold

an' all of the fellas they wish they could bite
on the cute little nuggets
the local girls are showin' off tonight
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
and it's wet t-shirt time again!
i know you want someone to show you some tit!
big ones!
wet ones!
big wet ones!

at this point, father riley (who had been recently de-frocked for not meeting his quota, and has grown his hair out and bought a groovy sport coot and moved to miami and changed his name to buddy jones) steps onto the crowded bandstand in his exciting new role as a wet t-shirt contest emcee...

ah, thanks, ike
yes, it's wet t-shirt time again
here at the brasserie, home of the tits... huh huh
and it's the charming mary from canoga park
up next in her bid for the semi-finals
hi, mary... how'ya doin'?
(having been fucked senseless by the boys in the crew, mary does not recognize the former religious personage from her nights in the rectory basement during which she acquired her basic manual skills. confounded by his sport coat, she replies..)
hi!
(realizing that she no longer recognizes him... or even appreciates the patient religious training he had given her in the past, buddy jones, like a true wet t-shirt emcee type person, proceeds to say various stupid things to waste time, making the contest itself take longer, thereby giving the mongoloids squatting on the dance floor an opportunity to buy more exciting beverages. . . liquid products that will expand their consciousnesses to the point whereby they might more fully enjoy the ambiance of miami by night...)
where ya from?
ah, the bus
which one?
you know... the last tour
you know... leather
oh, you were the girl that was stuck to seat 38
on phydeaux iii
why don't you get in position now and take a deep breath
because this water is very, very cold
but it's goin' to be so stimulating
and mary's the kind
of red-blooded american girl who'll do anything
anything
i said anything for fifty bucks, that's right!
i really need the fifty bucks you know
i gotta get home!
yeah, i know, your father is waiting for you in the tool shed...
that's right, you heard right...
our big prize tonight is fifty american dollars
to the girl with the most exciting mammalian protruberances!
here i am!
...as viewed through a thoroughly soaked
stupid looking white sort of male person's conservative
kind of middle-of-the-road cotton undergarment!
whoopee! and here comes the water!
ah!
no, you'd squeak more if the water got on you...
sounds like you just got an ice pick in the forehead...
and here comes the ice pick in the forehead!
oooh, ha ha
a million laughs, mary!
anyway; good golly, what a mess, she's totally soaked
totally-
i love it
yeah, totally committed to the fifty bucks
that's it just step into the spotlight
let the guys get a good look at ya, honey!
here i am!
whaddya say, fellas? nice setta jugs?
now mary, how's about shakin' it around a little?
ooooh!
oh my goodness, look at her go!
oooh! i'm dancing!
ain't this what living is really all about?
here's your fifty bucks, mary...
oh great! now i can go home! oooh!
home is where the heart is
on the bus!

but one night, at the social club meeting
mary didn't show up
she was sucking cock backstage at the armory
in order to get a pass
to see some big rock group for free

backstage at the local armory, mary, in her little white dress, is wiping the remnants of her performance off the side of her mouth as larry (the guy from the garage who quit the band in order to make an honest living) zips up the front of his stinking boiler suit and sings to the same teen-age girls who were stomping and clapping a little while ago, as they kneel with their little pink mouths open near the crew bus, hoping to save the price of admission by performing acts of hooverism on the jolly lads who set up the p. a. system

hey, hey, hey all you girls in these industrial towns
i know you're prob'ly gettin' tired of all the local clowns
they never give you no respect, they never treat you nice
so perhaps you oughta' try a little friendly advice

and be a crew slut
hey, you'll love it
be a crew slut
it's a way of life
be a crew slut
see the world
don't make a fuss, just get on the bus
crew slut
add water, makes its own sauce
be a crew slut
so you don't forget, call before midnite tonite
the boys in the crew are just waiting for you

you never get to move around, you never go nowhere
i know yer prob'ly gettin' tired of all the guys out there
you always wondered what it's like to go from place to place
so, darlin', take a little ride on the mixer's face

and be a crew slut
just follow the magic footprints
be a crew slut
hey, you'll love it!
be a crew slut
it's a way of life
i ain't gonna squash it and you don't need to wash it!
crew slut
hey, i'll buy you a pizza
be a crew slut
of course i'll introduce you to warren
the boys in the crew are only waiting for you

at this point, the road crew, as all road crews must from time to time, borrow some of the big rock group's equipment and have a blues jam session, indicating to the kneeling maidens that they are endowed with a great deal of raw talent, as well as massive meat. obviously impressed with larry's ability to suck so hard on his harmonica that screeching little noises come out of it, mary kneels again and reaches upward in gestures of supplication, listening intently as larry continues to sing..


well you been to alabama, girl, 'n georgia too
and all the boys in the crew is bein' good to you
i know you're sayin' to yourself "this is the way to go"
cause when you need a little extra they will give you some mo'

cause you're the crew slut
i'm into leather
that's good!
crew slut
a lot of the boys in the crew love leather
and rubber?
crew slut
yeah, they like rubber too... shrink-tubing with a hair dryer
trade your spot on the bench for a guy with a wrench
and be a crew slut
ha ha ha
you like that, huh?
crew slut
i told you you'd love it
it's a way of life!
the guys in the crew
have got a present for you!
a present for me?
we got a present for you!
whaddya got?
whaddya gonna give me?
it looks just like a telefunken u-47
you'll love it
with leather?

eh errr, eh eh... this is the central scrutinizer, again
and so mary was enticed away from joe
by an evil barbarian with a wrench in his pocket
lured into a life of sleazery....
with the entire road crew of some famous rock group...
i don't know whether it was really toad-o or not...
i don't know... i'll check it out-
again we see music causing big trouble!

i'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back
pair a khaki pants with my shoe shined black
got a little lady, walk that street
tellin' all the boys that she can't be beat
twenty dollar bill, i can set you straight
meet me on the corner boy and don't be late
man in a suit with a bow-tie neck
wanna buy a grunt with a third party check
standin' on the porch of the lido hotel
floozies in the lobby love the way i sell:

hot meat, hot rats
hot cats, hot rits
hot roots, hot soots


hot meat, hot rats
hot cats, hot rits
hot roots, hot soots

the mystery man came over
an' he said: "i'm outta sight!"
he said, for a nominal service charge
i could reach nirvana tonight
if i was ready, willing and able
to pay him his regular fee
he would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs
and devote his attention to me

but i said
look here brother
who you jivin' with that cosmik debris?!
now who you jivin' with that cosmik debris?
look here brother
don't you waste your time on me

the mystery man got nervous
an' he fidget around a bit
he reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
and he whipped out a shaving kit
now, i thought it was a razor
and a can of foamin' goo
but he told me right then when the top popped open
there was nothin' his box won't do
with the oil of aphrodite
an' the dust of the grand wazoo
he said:
"you might not believe this, little fella
but it'll cure your asthma too!"

and i said
look here brother
who you jivin' with that cosmik debris?!
now what kind of a geroo are you anyway?
look here brother
don't you waste your time on me
don't waste yer time

i've got troubles of my own, i said
an' you can't help me out
so take your meditations and your preparations
an' ram it up yer snout
"but i got a kristl bol!," he said
an' held it to the light
so i snatched it all away from him
an' i showed him how to do it right
i wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
so i'd look like i was deep
i said some mumbo jumbos then
an' told him he was goin' to sleep
i robbed his rings and pocket watch
and everything else i found
i had that sucker hypnotized
he couldn't even make a sound
i proceeded to tell him his future then
as long as he was hanging around
i said "the price of meat has just gone up
an' yer ol' lady has just gone down..."

look here brother
who you jivin' with that cosmik debris?
now is that a real poncho or is that a sears poncho?
don't you know?
you could make more money as a butcher
so don't you waste your time on me
don't waste it, don't waste your time on me
ohm shanti, ohm shanti, ohm shanti-ohm
shanti

this is the central scrutinizer...
it is my responsibility to enforce all the laws
that haven't been passed yet
it is also my responsibility to alert each and every one of you
to the potential consequences
of various ordinary everyday activities
you might be performing which could eventually lead to
the death penalty - or affect your parents' credit rating...
our criminal institutions are full of little creeps like you
who do wrong things
and many of them were driven to these crimes
by a horrible force called music!
our studies have shown that this horrible force
is so dangerous to society at large
that laws are being drawn up at this very moment
to stop it - forever!
cruel and inhuman punishments are being carefully described
in tiny paragraphs
so they won't conflict with the constitution...
which, itself, is being modified in order to accommodate
the future!
i bring you now a special presentation
to show what can happen to you
if you choose a career in music
the white zone is for loading and unloading only...
if you have to load or unload, go to the white zone...
you'll love it... it's a way of life
hi, it's me, i'm back...
this is the central scruuuuuutinizer...
the white zone is for loading and unloading only...
if you gotta load or if you gotta unload
go to the white zone, you'll love it, it's a way of life
that's right! you'll love it, it's a way of life, that's right
you'll love it, a way of life, right, love it...
this is the central scrutinizer...

[desperate nerds in high offices all over the world have been known to enact the most disgusting pieces of legislation in order to win votes (or, in places where they don't get to vote, to control unwanted forms of mass behavior)
environmental laws were not passed to protect our air and water... they were passed to get votes. seasonal anti-smut campaigns are not conducted to rid our communities of moral rot...they are conducted to give an aura of saintliness to the office-seekers who demand them. if a few key phrases are thrown into any speech (as the expert advisors explain to these various heads of state) votes will roll in, bucks will roll in, and, most importantly, power will be maintained by the groovy guy (or gal) who gets the most media coverage for his sleaze. naturally, his friends in various businesses will do okay too
all governments perpetuate themselves through the daily commission of act which a rational person might find to be stupid or dangerous (or both). naturally, our government is no exception... for instance, if the president (any one of them) went on tv and sat there with the flag in the background (or maybe a rustic scene on a little backdrop, plus the flag) and stared sincerely into the camera and told everybody that all energy problems and all inflationary problems had been traced to and could be solved by the abolition of music, chances are that most people would believe him and think that the illegalization of this obnoxious form of noise pollution would be a small price to pay for the chance to buy gas like the good ol' days. no way? never happen? records are made out of oil. all those big rock shows go from town to town in fuel-gobbling 45 foot trucks...and when they get there, they use up enormous amounts of electrical energy with their lights, their amplifiers, their pa systems...their smoke machines. and all those synthesizers...look at all the plastic they got in 'em...and the guitar picks...you name it...
joe’s garage is a stupid story about how the government is going to try to do away with music (a prime cause of unwanted mass behavior)! it's sort of like a really cheap kind of high school play...the way it might have been done 20 years ago, with all the sets made out of cardboard boxes and poster paint. it's also like those lectures that local narks used to give (where they show you a display of all the different ways you can get wasted, with the pills leading to the weed leading to the needle, etc., etc.). if the plot of the story seems just a little bit preposterous, and if the idea of the central scrutinizer enforcing laws that haven't been passed yet makes you giggle, just be glad you don't live in one of the cheerful little countries where, at this very moment, music is either severely restricted...or, as it is in iran, totally illegal.]

i might be movin' to montana soon
just to raise me up a crop of dental floss

but i'd be raisin' my lonely dental floss
raisin' my lonely dental floss
raisin' my lonely dental floss

well i might ride along the border
with my tweezers gleamin' in the moon-lighty night
and then i'd get a cuppa cawfee
'n give my foot a push
just me 'n the pygmy pony
over by the dental floss bush
'n then i might just
jump back on
an' ride like a cowboy
into the dawn to montana

i am gross and perverted
i'm obsessed 'n deranged
i have existed for years
but very little has changed
i'm the tool of the government
and industry too
for i am destined to rule
and regulate you
i may be vile and pernicious
but you can't look away
i make you think i'm delicious
with the stuff that i say
i'm the best you can get
have you guessed me yet?
i'm the slime oozin' out
from your tv set
you will obey me while i lead you
and eat the garbage that i feed you
until the day that we don't need you
don't go for help . . . no one will heed you
your mind is totally controlled
it has been stuffed into my mold
and you will do as you are told
until the rights to you are sold
that's right, folks
don't touch that dial
well, i am the slime from your video
oozin' along on your livin' room floor
i am the slime from your video
can't stop the slime, people, lookit me go
i am the slime from your video
oozin' along on your livin' room floor
i am the slime from your video

dreamed i was an eskimo
(buh-buh-dah-dah-dah-dah-bah-duh-duh)
frozen wind began to blow
(buh-buh-dah-dah-dah-dah-bah-duh-duh)
under my boots and around my toes
(buh-buh-dah-dah-dah-dah-bah-duh-duh)
the frost that bit the ground below
(buh-buh-ah-eh-ay-ay)
it was a hundred degrees below zero...
(buh! buh-buh-dah-dah-dah-dah-bah-duh-duh)

and my mama cried
(uh-uh-hoo-hoo)
and my mama cried
(nanook, a-no-no, no-no
nanook, a-no-no, no-no)
don't be a naughty eskimo
(buh-buh-dah-dah-dah-dah-bah-duh-duh)
save your money, don't go to the show

well, i turned around and i said "ho, ho" (buh!)
well, i turned around and i said "ho, ho" (buh!)
well, i turned around and i said "ho-ho"
and the northern lights commenced to glow
and she said (buh-buh-dodo), with a tear in her eye

"watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow"
"watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow"

it was the blackest night
there was no moon in sight
you know the stars ain't shinin'
cause the sky's too tight
i heard the scarey wind
i seen some ugly trees
there was a werewolf honkin'
'long the side of me
i'm mean 'n i'm bad, y'know i ain't no sissy

i said, "gimme summa that what yer suckin' on . . . "
but there was no reply
cause she was gone
"where's those titties i like so well, 'n my goddamn beer!"
is what i started to yell, then i heard this noise

'n like a sulphur reek

like it was titty skin
i said, "you sonofabitch!"
cause i was mad at him
well he just got out his floss
'n started cleanin' his fang
so i shot him with my shooter
said: bang bang bang
then the sucker just laughed 'n said:

terry: wait a minute . . . a tinge of doubt crosses my mind when you say that you want to make a deal with me
fz: that's very, very true
terry: wait . . . you ain't supposed to wanna make a deal with me
fz: ah, but i'm slightly different than your average customer, devil
terry: but, wait . . . but most people don't want to make a deal with me . . . wha
fz: yeah
terry: what's your story?
fz: well, most people are afraid of you, see? they don't know how stupid you are . . . i happen to know that you jack off to a picture of punky meadows when you get home
terry: grrah . . . stupid . . . grrh
fz: you know . . . ever since that guy told you that he contained more fluid than jeff beck you've been tryin' to outdo him . . . awright, look, i'm gonna say one thing to you . . . this may not register right away, but let me say this . . . leave your pickle alone for a couple of nights, you know what i mean . . . ? now, come on! i'm only interested in a couple of things . . . (wait, is that a note for me? is somebody passing me a note? what does this say . . . ? "frank, please do me a favour, i can't find a brother of mine, i could dig it if you could call him from stage. his name is dirty tom nomads m.c.," signed "thanks, bear" or "bean," i can't tell . . . well, if he's out there . . . dirty tony de la nomads m.c. get in touch with bean or bear . . . ) and as i was sayin', devil, i'm an average sort of a person, i'm . . . you wouldn't believe it, but . . . i'm very much like the people here in this audience tonight

fz: see if you can guess what they are
terry: i would think . . . uh . . . let's see, maybe . . . uh
fz: well, i'll give you
terry: stravinsky . . . and, uh
fz: i'll give you two clues
terry: . . . let's see . . . uh
fz: let go of your pickle
terry: what?
fz: let go of your pickle!
terry: i'm not holding my pickle
fz: well, who's holding your pickle then?
terry: i don't know . . . ha! she's out in the audience . . . hey, dale, would you like to come up here and hold my pickle to satisfy this weird man out here on the stage?
fz: you're probably wondering why we call it a pickle
ray: ha ha ha!
terry: oh, no
fz: i don't . . . i hate . . . i hate to squeal on you, bozzio, i mean, devil . . . but, look, i'm only interested in two things

fz: . . . titties and beer, titties and beer, titties and beer
terry:
no! don't sign it! give me time to think
i mean
fz: alright!
terry:
hold on a second, boy
cause that's magic ink!
and then the devil let go of his pickle
'n out jumped m'girl
they heard the titties plop-ploppin'
all around the world, she said:
"i got me three beers 'n a fist fulla downs
an' i'm gonna get ripped, so fuck you clowns!"
then she gave us the finger
it was rigid 'n stiff
that's when the devil, he farted
an' she went right over the cliff
(whoa . . . tinsel time!)
well, the devil was mad
i took off to my pad
i swear i do declare!
how did she get back there?
i swear i do declare!
how did she get back there?
i swear i do declare!
how did she get back there?
i swear i do declare!
how did she get back there?
i swear i do declare!
how did she get back there?
i swear i do de
fz: awright . . . awright, that . . . that's enough for the devil and his famous pickle . . . we're goin' to make another dramatic if . . . if somewhat . . . rickety segue into another song called cruisin' for burgers, wait a minute
