sometimes, i try to do things
and it just doesn't work out the way i want it to
and i get real frustrated
and like, i try hard to do it
and i like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way i want it to
it's like i concentrate on it real hard
but it just doesn't work out
and everything i do and everything i try
it never turns out
it's like, i need time to figure these things out
but there's always someone there going
"hey mike, you know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately, you know?
you should maybe get away
and like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better"
and i go, "no it's okay, you know, i'll figure it out
just leave me alone, i'll figure it out, you know?
i'm just working on myself"
they go, "well you know, if you want to talk about it, i'll be here, you know
and you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it
so why don't you talk about it?"
i go, "no i don't want to, i'm okay! i'll figure it out myself!"
but they just keep bugging me
they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside

so you're gonna be institutionalized
you'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
you won't have any say
they'll brainwash you until you see their way

i'm not crazy! (institution!)
you're the one that's crazy! (institution!)
you're driving me crazy! (institution!)
they stick me in an institution
and said it was the only solution
to give me the needed professional help
to protect from the enemy, myself

i was in my room
and i was just like, staring at the walls thinking about everything
but then again, i was thinking about nothing
and then my mom came in, and i didn't even know she was there
she called my name and i didn't hear her
and then she started screaming, "mike! mike!"
and i go, "what? what's the matter?"
she goes, "what's the matter with you?"
i go, "there's nothing wrong mom"
she goes, "don't tell me that, you're on drugs!"
i go, "no mom, i'm not on drugs, i'm okay, i'm just thinking, you know? why don't you get me a pepsi?"
she goes, "no! you're on drugs!"
i go, "mom, i'm okay, i'm just thinking"
and she goes, "no! you're not thinking, you're on drugs!
normal people don't act that way!"
i go, "mom, just get me a pepsi, please? all i want's a pepsi"
and she wouldn't give it to me
all i wanted was a pepsi
just one pepsi
and she wouldn't give it to me
just a pepsi!

they give you a white shirt with long sleeves
tied around your back, you're treated like thieves
drug you up because they're lazy
it's too much work to help a crazy

i'm not crazy! (institution!)
you're the one that's crazy! (institution!)
you're driving me crazy! (institution!)
they stick me in an institution
said it was the only solution
to give me the needed professional help
to protect from the enemy, myself

i'm sitting in my room, and my mom and my dad came in
they pulled up a chair and they sat down
they go, "mike, we need to talk to you"
and i go, "okay, what's the matter?"
they go, "me and your mom, we've been noticing lately you've been having a lot of problems
and you've been going off for no reason
and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody
and we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself,
so we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you somewhere you could get the help that you need"
and i go, "wait! what are you talking about?
we decided?! my best interest?!
how do you know what my best interest is?
how can you say what my best interest is?
what are you trying to say? i'm crazy?!
when i went to your schools
i went to your churches
i went to your institutional learning facilities!
so how can you say i'm crazy?!

they say they're gonna fix my brain
alleviate my suffering and my pain
but by the time they fix my head
mentally, i'll be dead

i'm not crazy! (institution!)
you're the one that's crazy! (institution!)
you're driving me crazy! (institution!)
they stick me in an institution
said it was the only solution
to give me the needed professional help
to protect from the enemy, myself

it doesn't matter, i'll probably get hit by a car anyway

what the hell's going on around here?
first off-let's take it from the start
straight out-can't change what's in my heart
no one-can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me
you ain't-never seen no one like me
prevail-regardless what the cost might be
power-flows inside of me, you can't bring me
never-fall as long as i try
refuse-to be a part of your lie
even-if it means i die, you can't bring me
you...can't...bring...me...down!
who the hell you calling crazy? you wouldn't know what crazy was if charles manson was eating fruit loops on your front porch....
time out-let's get something clear
i speak-more truth than you want to hear
scapegoat-to cover up your fear, you can't bring me
you ain't-never seen so much might
fight for-what i know is right
what up-you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me
stand up-we'll all sing along
together-ain't nothin' as strong
won't quit-we ain't in the wrong, you can't bring me
you...can't...bring...me...down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
bring me down-you can't bring me down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!
tell them what's up rocky!
you...can't...bring...me...down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
bring me down-you can't bring me down!
bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!
so why you trying to bring me?
well you can't bring me down...no, no, no, no
can't bring me down....no, no, no, no, no, no
can't bring me down....no, no, no, no, no, no
can't bring me down....no, no, no, no, no, no
so why you trying to bring?
well you can't bring me down
just cause you don't understand what's going on don't mean it don't make no sense
and just cause you don't like it, don't mean it ain't no good
and let me tell you something;
before you go taking a walk in my world
you better take a look at the real world
cause this ain't no mister roger's neighborhood
can you say "feel like shit"?
yea maybe sometimes i do feel like shit
i ain't happy 'bout it, but i'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit!
and if i offended you, oh i'm sorry...

bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!
can't bring me down!
can't bring me down!
can't bring me down!
suicidal!

yesterday, as i went out the house
i saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
lying face down in the sewer
i got up closer and realized that i knew her
all her organs coming from her insides
slashed up skin, sliced up hide
turned her over and saw the tar tracks on her head
that's when i realized she was dead

i saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
i saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead

twisted body, chopped-off feet
her body was minced meat
bugs crawling on her arms
she's dead can't do no harm
gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
her last breath has been spent

i wonder how much you had to pay
to get your mom killed in such a bloody way

i saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
i watched her as she bled
chewed-off toes on her chopped-off feet
i took a picture 'cause i thought it was neat
but the thing i liked seeing the best
was the rodents using her hair as a nest

i saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
i saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead

twisted body, chopped-off feet
her body was minced meat
bugs crawling on her arms
she's dead can't do no harm
gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
her last breath has been spent

i know it's your allowance that you'll really miss
but make it look good at her funeral and give her little kiss

i saw your mommy,and your mommy's dead
i saw her lying in a pool of red
i think it's the greatest thing i'll ever see
your dead mommy lying in front of me
i'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
i hope she dies twenty times more

i saw your mommy, and your mommy is dead
i saw your mommy, and your mommy is dead

twisted body, chopped-off feet
her body was minced meat
bugs crawling on her arms
she's dead can't do no harm
gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
her last breath has been spent

i wonder how much you had to pay
to get your mom killed in such a bloody way (ah!)

you tell me what i want to hear
i hear it all with my ears
but that won't do me any use
so i use my eyes to see the truth

i've got cyco vision
i use cyco vision
i see with cyco vision
i've got cyco vision
it doesn't matter what you say (bullshit)
it only matters what you do (no shit)
you cannot take the easy way with me
'cause i've got cyco vision
cyco!
vision!
you put a smile on your face (don't you?)
to try to hide behind your lies (don't you?)
but that just magnifies the pain in your soul
i see with my cyco vision

i've got cyco vision
i use cyco vision
i see with cyco vision
i've got cyco vision
when you think with all your might (you change)
right to wrong and wrong to right (don't change)
but it stays the same to me
because i've got cyco vision

war inside my head
war inside my head
war inside my head
war inside my head

war inside my head ain't a pretty sight
but i don't want no sympathy
it's happened a thousand times before
it's just a harsh reality

can you hear the war inside my head
war inside my head
war inside my head

the only thing real is the way i feel
and that's the pain that's deep inside
the battle from within is gonna begin
and there ain't nowhere to hide

war inside my head - can you sense it
war inside my head - can you feel it
war inside my head - can you fix it
war inside my head
can you see my - pain
can you feel my - pain
can you taste my - pain

can you see the war inside my head

war inside my head every night and day
i never get no piece of mind
it ought to be a sin, i just can't win
and pure hell is all i find
war inside my head
war inside my head
war inside my head ain't a pretty sight
but i don't want no sympathy
it's happened a thousand times before
it's just a harsh reality

war inside my head - can you sense it

suicide's an alternative!


well, i've got a little story to tell
about a man, said he came from hell
he said satan's been lookin', especially after me
he said satan's got a paper, gonna set my body free

he said, "power and glory, rich is the story
all in your name, and all for you to stay
oh yeah
power be your name, glory and fame
i see the gold and all of the riches in your head
oh yeah

he said, "power, fame, all in your name
all that you wanted, all that you need
all that you want to answer your dream
anything that you ever could need"

"just sign the paper, that's all you do
just sign the paper, it's ready to
anything  it's all for you
just sign the paper

uh, let me see if i got this right
when i sign the paper, then i get all these things?
it's gotta be something else happening
i don't know, man
besides, it's like… coward

well, i don't care too much about gold
and i don't really give a fuck about what you've been told
and i don't really care, or need anyone looking after me
besides, i'm a meaner son of a bitch than that fuck-wit ever could be

here i sit and watch my world
come crumbling down
i cry for help but no one's around
silently screaming as i bang my head
against the wall
it seems like no one cares at all
always an emotion
but how could i explain?
how can i explain?
kind of like the scent of a rose
with words i can't explain
the same with my pain
caught up in emotion
goes over my head
goes over my head
sometimes i got to think to myself
"is this life or death?
am i living or am i dead?"
the clock keeps ticking
but nothing else seems to change
problems never solved, just rearranged
and when i think about
all the times that i've had
some were good, most were bad
i search for personality
and i look for things i cannot see
love and peace flash through my mind
pain and hate is all i find
find no hope in nothing new
and i never had a dream come true
lies and hate and agony
and through my eyes that's all i see
if i'm gonna cry
will you wipe away my tears?
if i'm gonna die
lord, please take away my fear
before i drown in sorrow
well i just want to say
how will i laugh tomorrow
if i can't even smile today?
today, today, today
when i can't even smile today
today, today, today
when i can't even smile today
how will i laugh tomorrow
when i can't even smile today?
how will i laugh tomorrow
when i can't even smile today?
you think something's funny?
laugh at this!
so when i look outside my room
i see the world, but not the reason
what is done to me is not fair
you call it fair, i call it treason
but i know not what to do
give me a sign i'll take whatever
but if you want me here i am
ain't gonna die forever
and i tried to hold ya
but you just turned away
and i tried to tell ya
but not a word i say
i cried out so loudly
but you just covered your ears
and gave me all the signs
that you ignored my tears
so if you want me here i am
i sit here waiting your decision
but my body fights my mind
i'm headed straight for a collision
so am i getting near or am i still
looking in all the wrong places?
but the only thing that seems to change
are the looks on the faces

doesn't anyone?
seems like no one cares at all
i search for personality
and look for things i cannot see
(does anyone even care at all?)
love and peace flash through my mind
pain and hate is all i find
(seems like no one cares at all)
find no hope in nothing new
when i never had a dream come true
(does anyone even care at all?)
lies and hate and agony
through my eyes that's all i see
(seems like no one cares at all)
how will i laugh tomorrow?
how will i laugh tomorrow?
how will i laugh tomorrow?
how will i laugh tomorrow
when i can't even smile today?
today, today
when i can't even smile today
today, today
when i can't even smile today
how will i laugh tomorrow
when i can't even smile today?
how will i laugh tomorrow
when i can't even smile today?

father, forgive me
for i know not what i do
i tried everything
now i'll leave it up to you
i don't wanna live
i don't know why
i don't have no reasons
i just wanna die

i'm a suicidal failure
i've got to have some help
have suicidal tendencies
but i can't kill myself

tired of this way of life
my patience has expired
i'm barely just nineteen
but my life, i will retire
i went down to a rifle store
i bought myself a gun
i pointed it at my head
but i couldn't get the job done

i'm a suicidal failure
i've got to have some help
have suicidal tendencies
but i can't kill myself

took all my mothers sleeping pills
i jumped off a freeway bridge
i drank three kinds of poisons
and drove my car off a ridge
i beat myself with a bat
put a noose around my head
i'm overdosed on heroin
but i'm still not dead

i'm a suicidal failure
i've got to have some help
have suicidal tendencies
but i can't kill myself

death may not be the answer
it can't be all great
but me, i'm not into living
with life, i can't relate
by some masochistic reasoning
i think that it'll be fun
i want to start my second life now
so shoot me with your gun

i'm looking forward (suicidal)
i'm really bored (suicidal)
you wanna die (suicidal)
then die (suicidal)
on the street (suicidal)
at the game (suicidal)
at the beach (suicidal)
at my school (suicidal)

i shot reagan!

i shot reagan
i shot sadat
i'm gonna shoot you
in heaven, you'll rot

you'll rot in heaven

'cause you're forgiven in hell

i shot lennon

i'm not anti-society, society's anti-me
and i'm not anti-religion, religion's anti-me
and i'm not anti-tradition, tradition's anti-me
and i'm not anti-anything, i just wanna be free

fascist state, no freedom
unless you control yourself
use self-expression, lose your freedom
you're undesirable, you go straight to jail!

two-sided politics!
one for them, another for me!


kill someone in a war
get a medal, you're a hero
protect yourself in everyday war
you're a minority, you go straight to jail!

two-sided politics!
one for them, another for me!

i'm not anti-reagan, reagan's anti-me!
and i'm not anti-government, government's anti-me!
and i'm not anti-politics, politics is anti-me
and i'm not anti-anything, i just wanna be free!

innocent, never guilty
high-class lawyer, you are rich
if you're poor, must be guilty
even if innocent, you go straight to jail!

two-sided politics!

there are some things you're not supposed to talk about, like all the things i ever think about
i guess i'll try, i just wanna sleep
slip away in a trance so deep
feel my soul floating free, no more pain left in me
and then i sleep until tomorrow, when i wake again i wake up in sorrow
another person, another day
i probably won't remember it anyway, well...
seems like the world is leaving me behind, when i try to explain you say i've lost my mind
you say i need some help, well how else do you think it's going to help until you you get to know it's true
no help from you
so i sit and think about the things that i'm not supposed to talk about
i think and i think and i think and i think and, never no progress
i know i'm not the only one....
wake up!
why do i wake up in the morning? - nothing has changed since the day of my birth
why do i wake up in the morning? - i make no difference on this earth
strength has left - has to be - something has died inside of me
if i don't wake up in the morning - at my funeral world anyone even care?
if i don't wake up in the morning - would anyone even be there?
you can put me down - you can put me out, you can try to ignore
but now you're gonna hearing me when i shout wake up
wake up! (x2)
why should i wake up in the morning? - it'll be just another wasted day
why should i wake up in the morning? - don't do nothing right anyway
that was then - not anymore - now i go blasting out the door
i'm gonna wake up in the morning - i'll prove you wrong i will not fail
i'm gonna wake up in the morning - i'm gonna blaze a brand new trail
might not be smart, but if i'm strong
i know for sure that no one ever will prove me wrong
i'll still wake up in the morning

tense atmosphere in the air
riot written everywhere
riot squads coming from over there
it's time to go home if you're square

riot squad, bash their heads
kick their ass until they're dead
i won't be a fascist pig!
love to fight, what a thrill
we don't stop until we kill
i won't be a fascist pig!

throw a bottle in the air
put 'em up to their dare
we'll just laugh while they stare
and let 'em hit me, see if i care

riot squad, bash their heads
kick their ass until they're dead
i won't be a fascist pig!
love to fight, what a thrill
we don't stop until we kill
i won't be a fascist pig!

get attacked by them, you'll never heal
they'll rob your conscience, your sanity they'll steal
they'll beat your brains until they spill
that's the fascists' favorite meal

riot squad, bash their heads
kick their ass until they're dead
i won't be a fascist pig!
love to fight, what a thrill
we don't stop until we kill
i won't be a fascist pig!

i won't be a fascist pig!

here i sit and watch my world come crumbling down
i cry for help but no one's around
silently screaming i bang my head against the wall
it seems like no one cares at all
always an emotion, but how can i explain-how can i explain
kind of like the scent of a rose, with words i can't explain-
the same with my pain
caught up in emotion-goes over my head-goes over my head
sometimes i got to think to myself is this life or death
am i living or am i dead

today today-when i can't even smile today
today today-when i can't even smile today
how will i laugh tomorrow-when i can't even smile today
how will i laugh tomorrow-when i can't even smile today

trippin
i gotta gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip out of this place
i gotta gotta get away, get away from the human race
i don't know what i'll see, don't even know what i'll find
i don't know what to pack, never been to a trip at the mind
chorus:
trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
do you know what i'm saying?
trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
well, i'm going insane
i took a wrong turn and i ended up at my heart
it could barely even pump no blood it was so thrashed and torn apart
thank it for working overtime in pain and misery
then i set back on the trail, headed for my destiny
chorus:
trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
do you know what i'm saying?
trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
well, i'm going insane
well, fly with me
flying free
tripping
you must be tripping
trip, trip, trip, trip, tripping
tripping
i cannot stop this trip, i forgot to pack the brakes
crashed straight into a concrete wall of my mistakes
ended up in a cemetary of a thousand wasted days
but that's alright with me, 'cause that's where most of my memory lays
gotta get away…
gotta get away…
i'm gonna take that trip
welcome
'cause i'm the host with the most
now here's a little toast
take your messages and put you're mind on coast
i'll exorcise your fears
make your nightmares disappear
you can talk all you want
but nothing do i really hear
a situation, this operation
a simple demonstration in experimentation
i slip, trip, slip, trip every little dip
there's nothing like a lobotomy
to keep a person free of pain
financial gain
for your personal pain
well it's so insane
but won't you keep all the pain
and slip, fly, trip
got caught up in another trap
so pay another shrink
buy his wife another mink
let me tell what i think think
i think, i think...
i gotta, gotta get away gotta get away, gotta get away
i'm just trippin' trippin' trippin'
never volatile, wanna sin with me?
you gotta get away, they say they're gonna freak
but that's between the cheek, gotta trip, gotta trip, gotta trip, gotta...
gotta make a sound
it's a dance mom
gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip
the real trip ain't about gettin' hip
gotta trip
tripa tripa tripa tripa ha
sins go slam, goin down at the chest
gotta get away gotta get away away
gotta trip with no permission, mind evaluation
take your head, add a little crazy
take that trip to the brain
take that trip to the brain
everybody gotta get get off
you gotta gotta gotta take the trip to the brain!

when i go down the street
the people watch me shiver and shake
i'm a prisoner of a demon
i think my head's about to break
it stays with me wherever i go
i can't break away from its hold
this must be my punishment
for selling my soul

too much pressure, my pulse is rising
my heart is pounding, my head really hurts
i can't take it, all this pressure
from all these things inside of me
everywhere i look, i see them
everywhere i go, they're at
what did i do to deserve this?
why won't they just leave my body?

are they people, or are they spirits?
do they belong to the human race?
why do they want me so bad?
why won't they come out of their hiding place?
i can't see them, but i know they're here
i can feel it in my veins
all this pressure on my body
is causing all my strength to drain

too much pressure, my pulse is rising
my heart is pounding, my head really hurts
i can't take it, all this pressure
from all these things inside of me
everywhere i look, i see them
everywhere i go, they're at
what did i do to deserve this?
why won't they just leave my body?

am i crazy, or am i insane?
have i already lost my mind?
is it real, or is it fake?
or am i in a permanent bind?
am i in power, or am i a slave?
who the hell is in control?
am i still living, or am i dead?
do i still have a soul?

too much pressure, my pulse is rising
my heart is pounding, my head really hurts
i can't take it, all this pressure
from all these things inside of me
everywhere i look, i see them
everywhere i go, they're at
what did i do to deserve this?
why won't they just leave my body?

i know i can't keep going this way
i have to give my mind some leisure
if i keep on going like this
i never again will taste pleasure
if they will not break the oath
i will have to disband
i have lost all control
this thing has now taken command

possessed!
possessed!
possessed!
possessed!


possessed!

i got a story to tell, now listen up real well
pay attention this way to what i got to say
took it to the street, rap to the people we meet
now we're rocking out hard to the suicidal beat
tried to deny our right, so we're putting up a fight
just doing our thang, they tried to call it a gang
saw the way we look, that's all that it took
that's all she wrote, they had their scapegoat
dressed down, homeboyz, minority-join the army
we're the few, we're the proud, we like to jam it loud
the music we play won't have it any other way
we're armed to the bone with our music and our tone
recruiting on the street with the sound of our beat
growing larger every day and every time we play
don't need no college plan, we're just a hard-rocking band
we like our music to please but we ain't gonna appease
no pressure's too much to make us change our touch
hardcore, metal, the new wave
we're not a gang-join the army
don't be no fool, don't let your prejudice rule
don't judge us by your fear, judge us by your ear
can't believe every word of every story that you've heard
just play the song, i know you'll start to rock along
well i don't care 'bout the clothes you wear
it's the size of your heart, not the length of your hair
don't make no difference to me, the color that you be
black, white or brown, it's all the same to me
well if you still don't believe you best get up and leave
do what you must do, but this ain't the place for you
you got no right but if you start a fight
we'll be rockin' your head but with our fists instead
i'll fight it with the band, right down till the end
ask anyone i've met, this ain't no idle threat
don't flap no fit and it won't come to this
but as for me, i'm down with the army
new york, london, venice
why join a gang?
join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-i want you to join the army-s.t
new york, london, venice
why join a gang?
join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-join the army
suicidal rock-i want you to join the army-s.t

baby, don't you be blue
you know that i'll always be true
and you know that i'll always love you
and we'll always be together, too

over a thousand things i can say to you
half of which would be untrue
but the one thing for sure i can say
is that i won't fall in love today

baby, when you hold me tight
you know everything will be alright
so let's not take any time to fight
'cause i love you with all my might

over a thousand things i can say to you
half of which would be untrue
but the one thing for sure i can say
is that i won't fall in love today


you make me feel like a man
when we're rolling in the sand
so come and take me by the hand
and do the things you know we can

over a thousand things i can say to you
half of which would be untrue
but the one thing for sure i can say
is that i won't fall in love today, yah!

in times of trouble, i fall to my knees and look to the sky
'cause me, me, i want more
the classification of my heart's a sin
'cause me, me, i want more

don't wanna pump nobody's gas
i want more!
don't wanna kiss my boss's ass
i want more!
don't wanna take the first job i find
i want more!
don't wanna dig coal out of a mine
i want more!

slaving in a factory, a different kind of insanity
feels like i'm locked in a cage
working like a maniac, giving myself a heart attack
for a job that pays minimum wage

i want more!
don't wanna work at the golden arches
i want more!
don't wanna wash no rich man's car
i want more!
don't wanna be nobody's gardener
i want more!
don't wanna be a garbage man
i want more!

slaving in a factory, a different kind of insanity
feels like i'm locked in a cage
working like a maniac, giving myself a heart attack
for a job that pays minimum wage

i sit and reflect about all that i've learned and all that i've seen
'cause me, me, i want more
the memories come and they go away
'cause me, me, i want more

don't wanna pump nobody's gas
i want more!
don't wanna kiss my boss's ass
i want more!
don't wanna take the first job i find
i want more!
me, i want more!

i talk through my eyes, the words pourin' down
nobody hears
you ask me what's wrong, but what can i say
nobody hears

i try to tell you, i try to show you
how else can i tell you, how else can i show you

i'm screaming inside, why can't you hear
nobody hears
you're looking right though me like i'm not here
nobody hears

when the last tear falls down
nothing gets washed away
another plea put to rest
as nobody hears, nobody hears

so what did i do to you
that makes you run from me
now i'm sitting here screaming inside myself
don't understand why nobody hears

you figured it out, shaped it to your perfection
nobody hears
subtracted my feelings from this equation
nobody hears

is it all in my mind (all in my mind)
then it would be easy to find

when the last tear falls down
nothing gets washed away
another plea put to rest
as nobody hears, nobody hears

so what did i do to you
that makes you run from me
now i'm sitting here screaming inside myself
don't understand why nobody hears


so if it's all, if it's all in my mind
then wouldn't it, wouldn't it
wouldn't it be so easy to find

when the last tear falls down
nothing gets washed away
another plea put to rest
as nobody hears, nobody hears

so what do i have to do
to make you comfort me
now i'm sitting here screaming inside myself
don't understand why nobody hears

so i'm sitting here screaming inside myself
well i'm sitting here crying inside myself
so i'm sitting here screaming to nobody else
don't understand why nobody hears
and nobody hears
nobody hears
nobody hears
(nobody hears)
