and all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

it's just the way it is
and maybe it's never gonna change
but i got a mind to show my strength
and i got a right to speak my mind
and i'm gonna pay for this
they're gonna burn me at the stake
but i got a fire in my veins
i wasn't made to fall in line
no, i wasn't made to fall in line, no

show some skin, make him want you
'cause god forbid you
know your own way home
ask yourself why it matters
who it flatters
you're more than flesh and bones

seems like it was yesterday when i saw your face
you told me how proud you were, but i walked away
if only i knew what i know today
ooh, ooh

i would hold you in my arms
i would take the pain away
thank you for all you've done
forgive all your mistakes
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to hear your voice again
sometimes i wanna call you
but i know you won't be there

oh, i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself by hurting you

some days i feel broke inside, but i won't admit
sometimes i just wanna hide 'cause it's you i miss
and it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ah

would you tell me i was wrong?
would you help me understand?
are you lookin' down upon me?
are you proud of who i am?
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to have just one more chance
to look into your eyes
and see you looking back

oh, i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself
oh, oh

if i had just one more day
i would tell you how much that i've missed you since you've been away
oh, it's dangerous
it's so out of line
to try and turn back time

i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself
by hurting you

don't look at me

every day is so wonderful
then suddenly it's hard to breathe
now and then i get insecure from all the pain
i'm so ashamed

i am beautiful no matter what they say
words can't bring me down
i am beautiful in every single way
yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
so don't you bring me down today

to all your friends, you're delirious
so consumed in all your doom
trying hard to fill the emptiness
the pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
is that the way it is?

words can't bring you down, oh no
'cause you are beautiful in every single way
yes, words can't bring you down, oh no

full of beautiful mistakes
and everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
the sun will always shine

(and tomorrow, we might wake on the other side)

'cause we are beautiful no matter what they say

time is up 'cause i've had enough
you were there by my side
always down for the ride
but your joy ride just came down in flames
'cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

after all of the stealing and cheating
you probably think that i hold resentment for you

'cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
i wouldn't know just how capable
i am to pull through
so i wanna say thank you, 'cause it

makes me that much stronger

made my skin a little bit thicker
makes me that much smarter
so thanks for making me a fighter
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

all of your backstabbing
just so you could cash in on a good thing
before i realized your game, aha
i heard you're goin' 'round
playin' the victim now
but don't even begin feeling i'm the one to blame
'cause you dug your own grave

after all of the fights and the lies
guess you're wanting to hold me
but that won't work anymore (no more, a-ha, it's over)
'cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
i wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
so i wanna say thank you, 'cause it

makes me that much stronger
makes me work a little bit harder
it makes me that much wiser
so thanks for making me a fighter
made me learn a little bit faster
made my skin a little bit thicker
makes me that much smarter
so thanks for making me a fighter

how could this man i thought i knew
turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
could only see the good in you
pretended not to see the truth
you tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
through living in denial
but in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
i am a fighter and i (i'm a fighter)
i ain't gon' stop (i ain't gonna stop)
there is no turning back
i've had enough

my heart and i, we're buried in dust
free me, free us

you're all i need, when i'm holding you tight
if you walk away, i will suffer tonight

can't you see that i'm bound in chains?
i finally found my way
i am bound to you

walls i built up, became my home
i'm strong and i'm sure there's a fire in us
sweet love, so pure

and i brace myself
please, don't tear this apart

i finally found my way

i embrace my fears
all that i have been carrying all these years
do i risk it all?
come this far just to fall, fall, oh-oh-oh

i am terrified to love for the first time
can't you see that i'm bound in chains?
and finally found my way
i am bound to you

look at me
you may think you see who i really am
but you'll never know me
every day
it's as if i play a part
now i see
if i wear a mask, i can fool the world
but i cannot fool my heart

who is that girl i see
staring straight back at me?
when will my reflection show
who i am inside?

i am now
in a world where i have to hide my heart
and what i believe in
but somehow
i will show the world what's inside my heart
and be loved for who i am

who is that girl i see
staring straight back at me?
why is my reflection someone i don't know?
must i pretend that i'm someone else
for all time?
when will my reflection show
who i am inside?

there's a heart that must be free, to fly
that burns with a need to know the reason why
why must we all conceal
what we think, how we feel?
must there be a secret me
i'm forced to hide?

i won't pretend that i'm
someone else for all time
when will my reflection show
who i am inside?

when will my reflection show
who i am inside?

so, what, am i not 'sposed to have an opinion?
should i keep quiet just because i'm a woman?
call me a bitch 'cause i speak what's on my mind
guess it's easier for you to swallow if i sat and smiled
when a female fires back
suddenly big talker don't know how to act
so he does what any little boy would do
makin' up a few false rumors or two
that for sure is not a man to me
slanderin' names for popularity
it's sad you only get your fame through controversy (it's so sad)
but now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

this is for my girls all around the world (around the world)
who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (whoa)
thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (whoa)
so what do we do girls? shout louder!
lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (stand our ground)
lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (whoa)
take a deep breath and say it loud (whoa)
never can, never will, can't hold us down

nobody can hold us down (hold us down)
nobody can hold us down (hold us down)
nobody gonna hold us down (hold us down)
never can, never will

so, what, am i not 'sposed to say what i'm sayin'?
are you offended with the message i'm bringin'?
call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what i sing
if you look back in history
it's a common double standard of society
the guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
while the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
i don't understand why it's okay
the guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
all my ladies come together and make a change
and start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

this is for my girls all around the world (around the world) (yeah)
who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (respect your worth)
thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(you can't get rid of us)
so what do we do girls? shout louder!
lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(we standin' our ground on this one)
lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (whoa)
take a deep breath and say it loud
never can, never will, can't hold us down (check it)

here's something i just can't understand
if a guy have three girls then he's the man
he can even give her some head, then sex her raw
if a girl do the same, then she's a whore
but the tables 'bout to turn, i bet my fame on it
cats take my ideas and put they name on it
it's alright though, you can't hold me down
i got to keep on movin'
to all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
do it right back to him and let that be that
you need to let him know that his game is whack
and lil' kim and christina aguilera got your back

you're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
you must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
you must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
this is for my girls!

this is for my girls all around the world, oh
who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(respect your worth, oh)
thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
so what do we do girls? shout louder! (shout louder!)

lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (whoa)
take a deep breath and say it loud
never can, never will, can't hold us down (whoa)
this is for my girls all around the world (all my girls)
who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (around the world)
thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (yeah)
so what do we do girls? shout louder!
lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (stand our ground)
lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (whoa)
take a deep breath and say it loud

my address today, l.a. by the way
above sunset strip, the hills all the way
my rings are by webster, they make their heads twirl
they all say, "darling, what did you do for those pearls?"
what? i am a good girl

b.h. i adore, rodeo l'amore
breakfast polo lounge, and poolside for sure
the chateau for cocktails, the courtyard at nine
dan tana's for dinner, the helen's divine

they all say my feet never do touch the ground
what? i am a good girl

i am a good girl
uhh, ooh, uhh, yeah, uhh

never wanted to feel weak in love, give up control
never wanted to let down my guard, be vulnerable
never wanted to feel helpless or too comfortable
i’ll make it on my own, hey
i've been thinking a lot about the way that people change
the most beautiful beginnings can go down in flames
it's inevitable, and that's what's got me so afraid
i'd rather be alone

i don't want no white picket fence
dozen roses and a wedding dress
fairy tales or fake happiness
but here we are and i must confess

yeah, i'm in over my head feeling confused
i'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'cause i don't want to get married
unless it's with you, unless it's with you

you came into my life when i wasn't trying to find
anybody to love, hiding what i felt inside
but you opened me up and now i finally realize
i'll be your girl for life

we don't need a big audience
thousand people we never met
me and you and a couple of friends
and here we are and i must confess

yeah, i'm in over my head feeling confused
i'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'cause i don't want to get married
unless it's with you, unless it's with you
and oh, i know that it's scary
but i know that it's true, i'm saying "i do"
'cause i don't want to get married
unless it's with you, unless it's with you

beating heart and trembling hands
take me just the way i am
'cause all that i want is one and the same
for the rest of my days, for the rest of my days
you can ask me in a hundred years
if i would still be standing here
when we're old and gray, i'd answer the same
our love will remain, oh, our love will remain

yeah, i was over my head feeling confused
been losing my mind, don't know what to do
'cause i don't want to get married
unless it's with you, unless it's with you
and oh, i know that it's scary
(but i know that it's true, i'm saying "i do")
'cause i don't want to get married
unless it's with you, unless it's with you
unless it's with you
