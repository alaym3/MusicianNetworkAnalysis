there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
there's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

ooh, makes me wonder
ooh, makes me wonder

there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking

ooh, it makes me wonder
ooh, really makes me wonder
and it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter

oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
there's still time to change the road you're on

and it makes me wonder
ohh, woah

your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all
to be a rock and not to roll

and she's buying a stairway to heaven 

â€‹
(2, 3, 4)

ahh! ahh!
we come from the land of the ice and snow
from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

the hammer of the gods
will drive our ships to new lands
to fight the horde, sing and cry
valhalla, i am coming

on we sweep with threshing oar
our only goal will be the western shore

ahh! ahh!
we come from the land of the ice and snow
from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

how soft your fields so green
can whisper tales of gore
of how we calmed the tides of war
we are your overlords
on we sweep with threshing oar
our only goal will be the western shore

so now you'd better stop
and rebuild all your ruins
for peace and trust can win the day
despite of all your losing

ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ah, ah
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 

oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
with stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler of both time and space
to be where i have been
sit with elders of the gentle race
this world has seldom seen
talk of days for which they sit and wait
all will be revealed

talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
whose sounds caress my ear
but not a word i heard could i relate
the story was quite clear
oh, oh
oh, oh

ooh, baby, i been flying
no yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
oh, ooh, yeah i've been flying
mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying
oh, all i see turns to brown
as the sun burns the ground
and my eyes fill with sand
as i scan this wasted land
trying to find, trying to find, where i've been

oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
like thoughts inside a dream
here is the path that led me to that place
yellow desert stream
my shangri-la beneath the summer moon
i will return again
sure as the dust that floats high in june
when movin' through kashmir

oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
across the sea of years
with no provision but an open face
along the straits of fear
oh, oh
oh, oh

spent my days with a woman unkind
smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
made up my mind to make a new start
going to california with an aching, in my heart
someone told me there's a girl out there
with love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair

took my chances on a big jet plane
never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
the sea was red and the sky was grey
wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
the mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

seems that the wrath of the gods
got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
i think i might be sinking
throw me a line, if i reach it in time
i'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

to find a queen without a king
they say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la la
ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...
ah, ah, ah, ah 

the leaves are falling all around, time i was on my way
thanks to you, i'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
but now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
for now i smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
ah, sometimes i grow so tired
but i know i've got one thing i got to do

ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
to sing my song, i'm going 'round the world, i gotta find my girl
on my way, i've been this way ten years to the day
ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

got no time to for spreading roots
the time has come to be gone
and though "our health" we drank a thousand times
it's time to ramble on

ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
to sing my song, i'm going 'round the world, i gotta find my girl
on my way, i've been this way ten years to the day
i gotta ramble on, i gotta find the queen of all my dreams
i tell you no lie

mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom i hold dear
how years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'twas in the darkest depths of mordor, i met a girl so fair
but gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
her, her, yeah
ah, there's nothing i can do now
i guess i'll keep on

ramblin', i'm gonna shake (sing my song)
i gotta find my baby
i'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
gonna work my way, going 'round the world
baby, baby (ramble on)
do do do do do do do do, my baby
i can't stop this feeling in my heart
every time i think about my baby i think "we gots to part"
gotta keep on searching for my baby
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
i gotta keep on searching for my baby
my, my, my, my, my, my, baby
i can't find my bluebird!
i listened to what my bluebird said, but i, i can't find my bluebird!
i keep rambling, baby 

been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
wanted a woman, never bargained for you
lots of people talk and few of them know
soul of a woman was created below, yeah

you hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
run 'round, sweet baby, lord, how they hypnotize
sweet, little baby, i don't know where you've been
gonna love you, baby, here i come again

if you're going to san francisco
be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
if you're going to san francisco
you're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

everyday, i work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
try to love you, baby, but you push me away
don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
sweet little baby, i want you again


been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
wanted a woman, never bargained for you
take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
tongue wag so much when i send you the bill 

if the sun refused to shine
i would still be loving you
when mountains crumble to the sea
there will still be you and me

kind woman, i give you my all
kind woman, nothing more

little drops of rain whisper of the pain
tears of loves lost in the days gone by
my love is strong
with you there is no wrong
together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
an inspiration is what you are to me
inspiration - look, see


and so today, my world, it smiles
your hand in mine, we walk the miles
and thanks to you it will be done
for you to me are the only one
alright, yeah
happiness, no more be sad
happiness - i'm glad
if the sun refused to shine
i would still be loving you
when mountains crumble to the sea
there will still be you and me 

babe, baby, baby, i'm gonna leave you
i said, "baby, you know i'm gonna leave you"

i said that's when it's calling me back home 

if it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
if it keeps on raining, the levee's going to break

when the levee breaks, we'll have no place to stay

mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan, oh
mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan

it's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
oh well, oh well, oh well
ooh

oh, don't it make you feel bad
when you're trying to find your way home
you don't know which way to go
if you're going down south, they got no work to do
if you're going north to chicago
ah, ah, ah, hey

ay, yeah
ay, yeah
ay, yeah
crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
no, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good

when the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh

thinking about my baby and my happy home
oh-ho

oh
going down, going down now
going down, going down now
going down, going down now
going down, going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
ooh, ooh 

should i fall out of love, my fire in the light
to chase a feather in the wind
within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
there moves a thread that has no end

for many hours and days that pass ever soon
the tides have caused the flame to dim
at last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
is this to end or just begin?

all of my love, all of my love
all of my love to you, now
all of my love, all of my love
oh, all of my love to you, now

the cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
one voice is clear above the din
proud arianne one word, my will to sustain
for me, the cloth once more to spin
oh, all of my love, all of my love
oh, all of my love for you now
all of my love, all of my love, yes
all of my love to you, child


yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
his is the force that lies within
ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
he is a feather in the wind

oh, all of my love, all of my love
oh, all of my love to you, now
all of my love, oh yes
all of my love to you
all of my love, all of my love
all of my love!
sometimes, sometimes
hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
it's all all all
all of my love, all of my love
all of my love to you, now
all of my love, all of my love
all of my love to you, now
i get a little bit lonely
just a little, just a little
just a little bit lonely
just a little bit lonely 

the queen of light took her bow
and then she turned to go
the prince of peace embraced the gloom
and walked the night alone
oh, dance in the dark of night
sing to the morning light
the dark lord rides in force tonight
and time will tell us all
oh, throw down your plow and hoe
rest not to lock your homes
side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all
oh-oh

i hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
i'm waiting for the angels of avalon
waiting for the eastern glow

the apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
the ground is rich from tender care
repay, do not forget, no, no
dance in the dark of night
sing to the morning light
the apples turn to brown and black
the tyrant's face is red
oh, war is the common cry
pick up your swords and fly
the sky is filled with good and bad
mortals never know, oh
oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
tired eyes on the sunrise
waiting for the eastern glow

the pain of war cannot exceed
the woe of aftermath
the drums will shake the castle wall
the ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
sing as you raise your bow (ride on)
shoot straighter than before
no comfort has the fire at night
that lights the face so cold
oh dance in the dark of night
sing to the morning light
the magic runes are writ in gold
to bring the balance back
bring it back

at last the sun is shining
the clouds of blue roll by
with flames from the dragon of darkness
the sunlight blinds his eyes!
ahhhhh
ahhhhhhhhhh
bring it back, bring it back
bring it back, bring it back
bring it back, bring it back
bring it back, bring it back
oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
oh now, oh now, oh now
bring it back, bring it back
bring it back, bring it back
oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
oh now, oh now, oh now
bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it 

close the door, put out the light
you know they won't be home tonight
the snow falls hard and don't you know?
the winds of thor are blowing cold
they're wearing steel that's bright and true
they carry news that must get through

they choose the path where no-one goes
they hold no quarter
they hold no quarter
aaaah!



walking side by side with death
the devil mocks their every step, ooh
the snow drives back the foot that's slow
the dogs of doom are howling more
they carry news that must get through
to build a dream for me and you, oh
they choose the path where no-one goes
they hold no quarter
they ask no quarter
they hold no quarter
they ask no quarter
oh!
the pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
they ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
they give no quarter (giving me, giving me no...)
oh (i hear the dogs of doom are howling more!) 

been working from seven
to eleven every night
really makes life a drag
i don't think that's right

i've really been the best, the best of fools
i did what i could, yeah
cause i love you, baby, how i love you, darling
how i love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl

but baby, since i've been loving you, yeah
i'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

everybody trying to tell me
that you didn't mean me no good
i've been trying, lord, let me tell you
let me tell you, i really did the best i could

i've been, i've been working from seven
to eleven every night
i said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now
since i've been loving you, yeah
i'm about to lose my worried mind
watch out


i said i've been crying, yeah
oh, my tears they fell like rain
don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

do you remember, mama, when i knocked upon your door?
i said you had the nerve to tell me
you didn't want me no more, yeah
i open my front door, i hear my back door slam
you know, i must have one of them newfangled
newfangled back-door men

i've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
to eleven, eleven every night
it kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
ah yeah! it makes it a drag
baby, since i've been loving you
i'm about to lose, i'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
oh yeah
just one more, just one more, ooh, yeah
since i've been loving you, i'm gonna lose my worried mind 

it is the springtime of my loving
the second season i am to know
you are the sunlight in my growing
so little warmth i've felt before
it isn't hard to feel me glowing
i watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh


it is the summer of my smiles
flee from me, keepers of the gloom
speak to me only with your eyes
it is to you i give this tune
ain't so hard to recognize, oh
these things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
oh, oh

ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
hey!
i've felt the coldness of my winter
i never thought it would ever go
i cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
but i know that i love you so, ohhhh, oh
but i know that i love you so
these are the seasons of emotion
and like the winds they rise and fall
this is the wonder of devotion
i see the torch we all must hold
this is the mystery of the quotient quotient
ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
just a little rain, oh yeah
uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah 

hey lady, you got the love i need
maybe more than enough
oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
oh, you've got so much, so much, so much
many have i loved, and many times been bitten
many times i've gazed along the open road
many times i've lied, and many times i've listened
many times i've wondered how much there is to know
many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
i live for my dream and a pocketful of gold


mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
many, many men can't see the open road
many is a word that only leaves you guessing
guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
i really ought to know
oh, you know i should, you know i should
you know i should've known 

it's been a long time since i rock and rolled
it's been a long time since i did the stroll
ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
let me get it back, baby, where i come from

it's been a long time, been a long time
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
yes, it has

it's been a long time since the book of love
i can't count the tears of a life with no love
carry me back, carry me back
carry me back, baby, where i come from
whoa, whoa, oh

it's been a long time, been a long time
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time


oh! seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
making vows that just can't work right
oh yeah, open your arms, opens your arms
open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
yeah!
it's been a long time, been a long time
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
ooh yeah, ooh yeah
ooh yeah, ooh yeah
it's been a long time, been a long time
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time 

in the days of my youth, i was told what it means to be a man
and now i've reached that age, i've tried to do all those things the best i can
no matter how i try, i find my way into the same old jam

good times, bad times, you know i've had my share
when my woman left home with a brown eyed man
but i still don't seem to care

sixteen, i fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
it only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
she swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
but when i whispered in her ear, i lost another friend, oh

good times, bad times, you know i've had my share
when my woman left home for a brown eyed man
but i still don't seem to care


good times, bad times, you know i've had my share
when my woman left home for a brown eyed man
but i still don't seem to care
i know what it means to be alone
i sure do wish i was at home
i don't care what the neighbours say
i'm gonna love you each and every day
you can feel the beat within my heart
realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part 

hey fellas, have you heard the news?
you know that annie's back in town
it won't take long, just watch and see
how the fellas lay their money down

her style is new, but the face the same
as it was so long ago
but from her eyes, a different smile
like that of one who knows

well, it's been ten years or maybe more
since i first set eyes on you
the best years of my life gone by
here i am alone and blue

some people cry and some people die
by the wicked ways of love
but i'll just keep on rolling along
with the grace of the lord above

people talking all around
about the way you left me flat
i don't care what the people say
i know where their jive is at
one thing i do have on my mind
if you can clarify, please do
it's the way you call me by another guy's name
when i try to make love to you, yeah
i try to make love but it ain't no use
give it to me, give it


work so hard i couldn't unwind
get some money saved
abuse my love a thousand times
however hard i tried

heartbreaker; your time has come
can't take your evil way
go away, heartbreaker
heartbreaker!
heartbreaker!
heart!
