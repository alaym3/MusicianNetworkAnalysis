backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'til i talked to my daddy, he say
he said, "you ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
i met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
all the times i could reminisce
'cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
only started with a little kiss, like this


see-saw swinging with the boys in the school
with your feet flying up in the air
singing "hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
of the swing like i didn't care."
so i took a big chance at the high school dance
with a missy who was ready to play
wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
and i knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"walk this way, talk this way"
"walk this way, walk this way"
"walk this way, walk this way"
"walk this way, talk this way"
ah, just give me a kiss
like this


schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
little skirt's climbing way up her knee
there was three young ladies in the school gym locker
when i noticed they was looking at me
i was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'til the boys told me something i missed
then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
so i gave her just a little kiss, like this


see-saw swinging with the boys in the school
with your feet flying up in the air

tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

tell me what it takes to let you go (ooh)
tell me how the pain's supposed to go (oh yeah)
tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
without thinking you lost everything that was
good in your life to the toss of the dice

tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
no, no, no, no, 'cause i don't want to burn in paradise
ooo
let go, let go, let go
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
let it go, let it go, let it go
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
i don't want to burn, i don't want to burn
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

i'm dreaming tonight, i'm living back home

yeah yeah

take me back to a south tallahassee
down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
can't stand up on my feet in the city
got to get back to the real nitty gritty

yes sir, no sir
don't come close to my
home sweet home
can't catch no dose
of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
sweathog ready to make a silk purse
from a j paul getty and his ear
with her face in her beer

home sweet home

get out in the field
put the mule in the stable
ma she's a cooking
put the eats on the table
hate's in the city
and my love's in the meadow
hands on the plow
and my feets in the ghetto

stand up, sit down
don't do nothing
it ain't no good when boss man's
stuffing it down their throats
for paper notes
and their babies cry
while cities lie at their feet
when you're rocking the street

home sweet home
mama, take me home sweet home

i was the last child
i'm just a punk in the street
i was the last child
i'm just a punk in the street

you're so bad you're so bad you're so
you're so bad you're so bad you're so

you think you're in love
like it's a real sure thing
but every time you fall
you get your ass in a sling
you used to be strong
but now it's "ooh baby please"
because falling in love is so hard on the knees

you're so bad you're so bad you're so
you're so bad you're so bad you're so

we was making love when you told me that you loved me
i thought ol' cupid, he was taking aim
i was believer when you told me that you loved me
and then you called me someone else's name
yeah!

there ain't gonna be no more begging you please
you know what i want
and it ain't one of these
you're bad to the bone
and your girlfriend agrees
that falling in love is so hard on the knees

you're so bad you're so bad you're so
you're so bad you're so bad you're so

chip off the old block
man, you're so much like your sister
my fantasizin' must be outta luck
my old libido has been blowin' a transistor
i feel like i have been hit by a fuck, yeah

i'm jonesing on love
yeah, i got the dt's
you say that we will
but there ain't no guarantees
i'm major in love
but in all minor keys
'cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
yeah!

what are you looking for
it's got to be hardcore
must be some kind of nouveau riche
is this your only chance
or some hypnotic trance
let's get you on a tighter leash
own it own it own it


you're so bad you're so bad you're so
you're so bad you're so bad you're so

you ain't that good
is what you said down to the letter
but you like the way i hold the microphone
sometimes i'm good, but when i'm bad
i'm even better
don't give me no lip
i've got enough of my own

there ain't gonna be no more begging you please
you know what i want
and it ain't one of these
you're bad to the bone
and your girlfriend agrees
that falling in love is so hard on the knees

i'm jonesing on love
yeah, i got the dt's
you say that we will
but there ain't no guarantees
i'm major in love
but in all minor keys
'cause falling in love is so hard on the knees

got me the strangest woman
believe me this trick's no cinch
but i really get her going
when i whip out my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
well a band that plays the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

last night i tried to tease her
i gave my love a little pinch
she said now stop that jivin'
now whip out your big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
well a band that plays the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

i, i, i cover her with kisses
and when we're in a lover's clinch
she gets all excited
when she begs for my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
well a band that plays the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues


my girl don't go for smoking
and liquor just make her flinch
seems she don't go for nothing
'cept for my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
band that plays the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

yeah-yeah!

well, i woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
and how i got to thinkin' about all those things you said
about ordinary people and how they make you sick
and if callin' names kicks back on you, then i hope this does the trick

'cause i'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
and i'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
and i just can't see no humor about your way of life
and i think i can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
eat the rich; i take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich; i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich; i take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

so i called up my head shrinker, and i told him what i'd done
he said "you'd best go on a diet, yeah i hope you have some fun
and-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food"

now they're smokin' up the jail bonds, and then they go get stiff
and they're dancin' in the yacht club with muff and uncle biff
but there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
eat the rich; i take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich; i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich; i take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!


believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie
i believe in rags to riches, your inheritance won't last
so take your grey pompon my friend and shove it up your ass!

eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
eat the rich; i take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich; i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich; i take one bite now, spit out the rest!
eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
eat the rich; i take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich; don't stop me now i'm going crazy
eat the rich; that's my idea of a good time baby
