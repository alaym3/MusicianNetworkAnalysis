bury all your secrets in my skin
come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

so if you love me, let me go
and run away before i know
my heart is just too dark to care
i can't destroy what isn't there
deliver me into my fate
if i'm alone i cannot hate
i don't deserve to have you
ooh my smile was taken long ago
if i can change i hope i never know

i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i couldn't face a life without your light (without your light)
but all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

so save your breath, i will not hear
i think i made it very clear
you couldn't hate enough to love
is that supposed to be enough?
i only wish you weren't my friend
then i could hurt you in the end
i never claimed to be a saint
ooh my own was banished long ago
it took the death of hope to let you go

oh, oh

so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i won't listen to your shame
you ran away, you're all the same
angels lie to keep control
ooh my love was punished long ago
if you still care, don't ever let me know
if you still care, don't ever let me know

ooh, yeah

i did my time, and i want out
so effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
the reckoning, the sickening
packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
sinking in, getting smaller again
i'm done, it has begun, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

there are cracks in the road we laid
but where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
this is nothing new, but when we killed it all
the hate was all we had
who needs another mess? we could start over
just look me in the eyes and say i'm wrong
now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
i think we're done, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial


the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead

fake anti-fascist lie (psychosocial)
i tried to tell you, but (psychosocial)
your purple hearts are giving out! (psychosocial)
can't stop a killing idea (psychosocial)
if it's hunting season (psychosocial)
is this what you want? (psychosocial)
i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
if the pain goes on

i have screamed until my veins collapsed
i've waited as my time's elapsed
now all i do is live with so much fate
i've wished for this, i've bitched at that
i've left behind this little fact
you cannot kill what you did not create

i've gotta say what i've gotta say
and then i swear i'll go away
but i can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
i guess i'll save the best for last
my future seems like one big past
you're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it!

put me back together or separate the skin from bone
leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
tell me the reality is better than the dream
but i found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it!

all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane!
all i've got, all i've got is insane!
all i've got, all i've got is insane!
all i've got, all i've got is insane!

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it!

all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane!
all i've got, all i've got is insane!

oh, i'll never kill myself to save my soul
i was gone, but how was i to know?
i didn't come this far to sink so low
i'm finally holding on to letting go
(i'll never kill myself to save my soul)
i'm finally holding on to letting go
(i didn't come this far to sink so low)
i'm finally holding on to letting go

i'm just weathering a rough patch
another villain with an itch to scratch
denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
why does the hell make you feel so cold?
make a move and you pay for it
pick a lord and you pray to it
you're so demanding when you want the truth
but your stories don't read for me

oh, i'll never kill myself to save my soul
i was gone, but how was i to know?
i didn't come this far to sink so low
i'm finally holding on to letting go

indecision overload
keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
reaching out for the hand of god
but did you think you'd shake your own?
this killing field is all grown over
the motherfucker wants it wild
go sow your oats in alphabetical order
the anti-antagonist is back in style
myopic, cannot see straight
dystopic, one sin too late
you gotta lie if you wanna believe
but your bibles don't work on me

oh, i'll never kill myself to save my soul
i was gone, but how was i to know?
i didn't come this far to sink so low
i'm finally holding on to letting
go

did you think you could win? and fill me in?
did you think you could do it again? i'm not your sin
i was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
i was more than you thought i could be
so i'm setting you free, i'm setting you free
you've killed the saint in me
how dare you martyr me
you've killed the saint in me

oh, i'll never kill myself to save my soul
i was gone, but how was i to know?
i didn't come this far to sink so low
i'm finally holding on to letting go

you've killed the saint in me
how dare you martyr me?
you've killed the saint in me
how dare you martyr me?

undo these chains, my friend
i'll show you the rage i've hidden
perish the sacrament
swallow, but nothing's forgiven
you and i can't decide
which of us was taken for granted
make amends
some of us are destined to be outlived

step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil anymore

under the words of men
something is tempting the father
where is your will, my friend?
insatiates never even bother
you and i, wrong or right
traded a lie for the leverage
in between the lens in light
you're not what you seem

step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil
i'm not your devil anymore

your station is abandoned
fooled you 'cause i know what you've done
sensation, depravation
you should've burned when you turned on everyone

so, step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
i know you'll find your answers in the end
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil anymore

so, step inside
step inside
see the devil in i
see the devil in i

pain
(here comes the pain!)

enemy, show me what you wanna be
i can handle anything even if i can't handle you
readily, either way, it better be
don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
what the hell am i saying? i don't know about malevolent
sure as hell decadent, i want somebody to step up, step off
walls, let me fall, fuck you all
get a grip, don't let me slip till i drop the ball

fuck this shit, i'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
fuck it!

who the fuck am i to criticize your twisted state of mind?
you're leaving me suspect, i'm leaving you grotesque
feels like a burn from which you never learn
cause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer

fuck this shit, i'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
go

i've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
i've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
i've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
i've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
you can't kill me 'cause i'm already inside you
you can't kill me 'cause i'm already inside you
you can't kill me 'cause i'm already inside you
you can't kill me 'cause i'm already inside you

sick, sick, sick, sick
yeah

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

goodbye

i wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
everything is 3d blasphemy
my eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
this is not the way i pictured me
i can't control my shakes, how the hell did i get here?
something about this, so very wrong
i have to laugh out loud, i wish i didn't like this
is it a dream or a memory?

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

get outta my head 'cause i don't need this, why didn't i see this?
but i'm a victim, manchurian candidate
i have sinned by just
making my mind up and taking your breath away

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

goodbye!

you haven't learned a thing
i haven't changed a thing
the flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free
you haven't learned a thing
i haven't changed a thing
the flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

and it waits for you

watch this

i'm never enough
you bleed me dry, using me up
dissatisfied and used
another key to the empty spot in you
i'm sick as a fuck
i'm in my prime, what do you want?
i guess it's time to see
if you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
ooh, wade through hate and fear
i haven't felt like this in years
not much left, so uprooted
fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
and i know where i need to go
but the voice of reason can't say no
it's in the eyes and heart
just the latest psycho off the charts

that's what you do best

a home like yours is upside down

got that, right?

today, up on this hill, i'm counting all the killers
they sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
they mutter as the body loses warmth
they pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
and take great care to not take care of you
here’s an unexplainable one
here's an unexplainable one

while i was learning to live, we all were living a lie
i guess you got what you wanted
so i will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
it's always somebody else, somebody else was me
you want the real smile?
or the one i used to practice not to feel like a failure?

i don’t need you to do it for me
i don't need you to understand
i don't need you to hide it from me
i just wanna feel like any other man
i won't show you the whole story
i won't show you the aftermath
i won't show you my allegory
don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

here’s an unexplainable one
here’s an unexplainable one

i'm not ahead of my time, i just drew the first breath
if i’m alive tomorrow
i will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
i found my bottom line dead on the front lines
i know i'll never go home
so set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

i don't need you to do it for me
i don't need you to understand
i don’t need you to hide it from me
i just wanna feel like any other man
i won't show you my whole story
i won't show you the aftermath
i won't show you my allegory
don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

what have you done?
what have you done?
yeah

oh, while i was learning to live, you taught me how to die
i guess i got what i wanted
another needle in the back through purified scarification
it wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
you want a real smile?
i haven't smiled in years

did you never give a damn in the first place?
maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'cause in the interest of all involved, i got the problem solved
and the verdict is guilty…

man nearly killed me, steppin' where you fear to tread
stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!
big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
are you scared of me now? then you're dumber than i thought
always is, and never was
foundation made of piss and vinegar
step to me, i'll smear ya - think i fear you? bullshit!
just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
is there any way to break through the noise?
was it something that i said that got you bent?
gotta be that way if you want it
sanity, literal profanity - hit me!

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor fodder
keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
step up, fairy
i guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome straight to the dome
you heard me right, bitch, i didn't stutter
and if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
backstab - don't you know who you're dissin'?
sideswipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'!

biggity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway houser
don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
come up and you get a face full o' tactic
lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
you got no pull, no power, no nothin'
now you start shit? well ain't that somethin'?
payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
but i'll find you - comin' up behind you!

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

'bout time i set this record straight
all the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate
sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
where you gonna be in the next five years?
the crew and all the fools and all the politics
get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
you got dick when they passed out the good stuff
bam - are you sick of me? good enough - had enough

what a world, the horizon's
coming like a hell-bent killing machine
can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
burn it all again at a million degrees
calling all the adamant upper-level
undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
the enemy is here, i said stop

give it to three
i'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what i mean
one by one against, give me the name
all you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
you hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
i know you heard me, i fucking told you

old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
no hard feelings, i'm tired of being right about everything i've said
yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
we are not your kind
no excuses, i challenge you to all out fucking life

drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
children are afraid of the gods
raise your hands and show me what's impossible
that makes us even, never tell me the odds
what a bore, i'm getting stuck in a metaphor
i don't wanna go to sleep
i need a breakdown quick in negotiations
get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

give it to three
i'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what i mean
drive by violence, more of the same
i can see where you're going, and i'm really ashamed
do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
i gotta know now, you better tell me

old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
no hard feelings, i'm tired of being right about everything i've said
yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
we are not your kind
i challenge you to all out life

we are gathered here today to get it right
repeat after me:
"i will not celebrate mediocrity
i will not worship empty shells
i will not listen to worthless noises
i will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
my time, my attention
my quality should not be bought and sold
for convenience's sake, ever"

we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind
we are not your kind

old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
no hard feelings, i'm tired of being right about everything i've said
yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til i really feel alright
old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
no hard feelings, i'm tired of being right about everything i've said
yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
we are not your kind
no excuses, i challenge you to all out fucking life

all out life, yeah
i challenge you to all out fucking life, yeah
live, live, live, life

go!

stapled shut, inside an outside world and i'm
sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
claustrophobic, closing in and i'm catastrophic, not again
i'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
i wear you like a stain yet i'm the one who's obscene
catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
i've got no time to lose, i'm just caught up in all the cattle

fray the strings…
throw the shapes…
hold your breath…
listen!

i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!

i'm ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt and i
wear you like a stitch yet i'm the one who's hurt
pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
i've got no right to win, i'm just caught up in all the battles

locked in clutch…
pushed in place…
hold your breath…
listen!

i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!

my end, it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road
and my end, it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road!

i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that!

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!

you're wasting it
you're wasting it
you're wasting it
you're wasting it
you're wasting it

yeah!

look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new…

she's sticking needles in her skin, i turn with an ugly grin
her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
but her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
it's so confusing, the methods that she's using
she knows she shouldn't leave a mark that i can see
will she ever find one million of a kind?
it's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her

oh, she's beautiful, a little better than a man deserves
oh, i'm not insane, please tell me she won't change

maybe i should let her go
but only when she loves me (she loves me)
how can i just let her go?
not until she loves me (she loves me), oh

she's drowning in herself again, my god, what a lovely sin
i guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
she can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
she smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
lost inside my dirty head, something tells me i'm the one who's kept

oh, so volatile, a little better than a man defiled
ooh, i need the pain, please tell me she won't change

maybe i should let her go
but only when she loves me (she loves me)
how can i just let her go?
not until she loves me (she loves me), oh

we were meant to be together
now, die and fucking love me
we were meant to hurt each other
now, die and fucking love me
die and fucking love me
die and fucking love me
die and fucking love me

she seemed dressed in all of me
stretched across my shame
all the torment and the pain
leaked through and covered me
i'd do anything to have her to myself
just to have her for myself
now, i don't know what to do
i don't know what to do when she makes me sad

she is everything to me
the unrequited dream
a song that no one sings
the unattainable
she's a myth that i have to believe in
all i need to make it real is one more reason
i don't know what to do
i don't know what to do when she makes me sad

but i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me

i catch in my throat, choke
torn into pieces
i won't, no
i don't wanna be this

but i won't let this build up inside of me
(i won't let this build up inside of me)
i won't let this build up inside of me
(i won't let this build up inside of me)
i won't let this build up inside of me
(i won't let this build up inside of me)
i won't let this build up inside of me

(i won't let this build up inside of me)
(i won't let this build up inside of me)
(i won't let this build up inside of me) she isn't real
(i won't let this build up inside of me) i can't make her real
(i won't let this build up inside of me) she isn't real
(i won't let this build up inside of me) i can't make her real

she seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
so fragile yet so devious, she continues to see
climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
enter the night that she came home, forever
oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!

she is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic
my dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me
i get nervous, perverse, when i see her, it's worse, but the stress is astounding
it's now or never she is coming home, forever
oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!
(what am i doing here?
she's my imagination come alive
what am i doing? what am i doing here?
she's my imagination come alive
my imagination come alive, come alive)

hard to say what caught my attention
fixed and crazy, aphid attraction
carve my name in my face (in my face) to recognize
such a pheromone cult to terrorize

i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me!

yeah!

i'm a slave, and i am a master
no restraints and unchecked collectors
i exist through my need (i exist) to self-oblige
she is something in me (i despise) that i despise

i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me (i won't let this build up inside of me)
i won't let this build up inside of me
won't let this build up inside of me
won't let this build up inside of me
won't let this build up inside of me!

she isn't real!
i can't make her real!
she isn't real!
i can't make her real!
she isn't real (she isn't real)
i can't make her real (i can't make her real)
she isn't real (she isn't real)
i can't make her real (i can't make her real)

no one can stop me

yeah, i wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
'cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean
my wormwood meets your pesticide
you'll never get out 'cause you were never alive
i am infinite, i am the infant finite
come a little closer, and i'll show you why

no one is safe
noises, noises, people make noises
people make noises when they're sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing
no one is safe
noises, noises, people make noises
people make noises when they're sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing

oh, how does it feel to be locked inside another dream
that never had a chance of being realized?
what the fuck are you looking at?
i'll tell you what you're looking at
everyone you ever fucking laughed at
oh, look in my eyes for the answers typical
i can feel it underneath like a miracle
everybody in the world needs more than
lies and consequences to power them
once again, it's me and no one else
i can't remember if there was a someone else
it's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
and it's shaking, you'll never take me

no one is safe
noises, noises, people make noises
people make noises when they're sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing
no one is safe
noises, noises, people make noises
people make noises when they're sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing

nothing
nothing
oh, come on

(hate) hate ain't enough to describe me
(scream) somewhere between screaming and crying
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be
(why) when do i get to know why?
(bitter) bitter as the stink of when i try
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be
no

pull your hands away, i'm gone, goodbye, it's so depressing
withering away, take a look inside, my soul is missing
all i have is dead, so i'll take you with me
i feel like i'm erased, so kill me just in case
i feel like i'm erased, so kill me just in case
so kill me just in case

(covet) everything around me's mine
(stay) can't see through the sties in my eyes
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be
(down) scratching and clawing all the way
(stay) you won't let me fucking stay
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be
(live) is there another way to live?
(die) 'cause it's the only way to die
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be, come on
no, no, no
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be
i'm not supposed to be here
i'm not supposed to be

how 'bout this one?
de-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat
de-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat

yeah
yeah
rise
half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
for encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
due to the prolific nature of this statement
listener aggression is advised

it's strange, whenever i see a gun, i think about just how petty you are
and it blows my fucking mind, yeah it blows my fucking mind
these days, i never seem to get enough, i'm tired of this shit, i wanna go home
don't waste my fucking time, don't waste my fucking time
because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
with jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
this planet isn't special, collections made of clay
i'm waiting for the punishment, i know it's on my way

cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up

irreverence is my disease
it's second hand, but you know me
the son of a bitch is on his knees
the last man standing gets no pity

somewhere on a toilet wall, i read the words
"you form a line to formalize the former lies," and i finally saw the truth
something so profound, and it was sitting there surrounded by
the garbage and the stains, another victim of the refuse
now i've been saying this for years, but you don't comprehend it
i fight hell and i fight fear because i understand it
androgyny and insults, you try so hard to be difficult
you wanna win the war? know what you're fighting for

cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up and fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up
cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up and fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up

irreverence is my disease
it's second hand, but you know me
the son of a bitch is on his knees
the last man standing gets no pity
with angel eyes and demon seeds
you're missing what you really need
when all is said and done, you see
the last man standing gets no pity
no pity, no pity, no pity, no pity, no pity

cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up and fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up
cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up and fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up

fuck!

fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
i'm going to burn, so i better tell you everything
the competition, the superstition
nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
it's a crisis, just how you like it
the same drama in a different disguise
i'm bound to walk with a target on my back
at least i'm ready for another attack

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
yeah

svengali, why are we the enemies?
i never follow, and i never make apologies
your dementias are gonna get ya
because your walls can't support each other
settle for the cynical, you're so political
you're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
reciprocity, somebody's listening
what did we learn from our time in captivity?

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
i hope you live to see the day
when your world goes up in flames
and as you die, you see my face
you're the only one to blame
yeah
fuck

the prescient, the nascent, the quotient
they all will fall
the cystic, symbolic, condition
systemic
egregious, replete with these lesions
contaminate
succumb to the selfish creation
your failure

no accountability, divisibility
i point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
the centipede's pulling on the mechanism
unearthing scars of the cataclysm
when the innocent begin to circumvent
the color fades, but the picture is vibrant
what do you believe? does it matter now?
turn away, the killer is disavowed

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
i hope you live to see the day
when your world goes up in flames
and as you die, you see my face
you're the only one to blame
the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one
the negative one
the negative one
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
yeah
