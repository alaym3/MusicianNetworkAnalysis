it's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
everything is fucked, everybody sucks
you don't really know why, but you wanna justify
rippin' someone's head off
no human contact, and if you interact
your life is on contract
your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
it's just one of those days

it's all about the he says/she says bullshit
i think you better quit lettin' shit slip
or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
it's all about the he says/she says bullshit
i think you better quit talkin' that shit

it's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
first one to complain leaves with a blood stain
damn right, i'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'cause i'm fuckin' up your program!
and if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
next in line to get fucked up
your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
it's just one of those days

it's all about the he says/she says bullshit
i think you better quit lettin' shit slip
or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
it's all about the he says/she says bullshit
i think you better quit talkin' that shit
punk, so come and get it

i feel like shit
my suggestion is to keep your distance
'cause right now i'm dangerous
we've all felt like shit and been treated like shit
all those motherfuckers that want to step up
i hope you know i pack a chainsaw
i'll skin your ass raw
and if my day keeps goin' this way
i just might break somethin' tonight
i pack a chainsaw
i'll skin your ass raw
and if my day keeps goin' this way
i just might break somethin' tonight
i pack a chainsaw
i'll skin your ass raw
and if my day keeps goin' this way
i just might break your fuckin' face tonight!
give me somethin' to break
give me somethin' to break
just give me somethin' to break
how 'bout your fuckin' face?
i hope you know i pack a chainsaw (what?)
a chainsaw (what?)
a motherfuckin' chainsaw (what?)
so come and get it

it's all about the he says/she says bullshit
i think you better quit talkin' that shit, punk
so come and get it

no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
and no one knows what it's like
to be hated
to be fated
to telling only lies

but my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance that's never free

no one knows what it's like
to feel these feelings
like i do
and i blame you
no one bites back as hard
on their anger
none of my pain and woe
can show through

but my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance that's never free

discover
l-i-m-p, say it, discover
l-i-m-p, say it, discover
l-i-m-p, say it, discover
l-i-m-p, say it, discover

no one knows what it's like
to be mistreated
to be defeated
behind blue eyes
and no one knows how to say
that they're sorry
and don't worry
i'm not tellin' lies

but my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance that's never free

no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes

who could be the boss? look up to the cross
stranded in the land of the lost
standin' up, i'm sideways
i'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
a lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
i'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
as reinforcement for the fight
and that alone'll keep john gotti on the phone
i'm tangled in the zone, i got the bees on the track
where the fuck you at? (tical!)
let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (shut the fuck up!)
i'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
over a million the last time i checked it
thank god, i'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
wait until the second round and knock 'em out

they call me big john studd, my middle name mud
dirty water flow, too much for you thug
they can't stand the flood – what up, doc?
hold big gun like elmer fudd,  the sureshot
mr. meth i'm unplugged (learn!)
temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
playin' wit' minds that get you state time
locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug
brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
love is love all day, 'til they throw slugs
and take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
same shit different day, father forgive us
they know not what they do, all praise is due
i'm big like e-z and big bambu

headstrong, dead calm, dead by dawn
dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on
twelve rounds of throw down – who hold crown?
protect land wit' four pound, limp bizkit
get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
word on the street is, they bit my thesis
knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
where'd you find that monster? she beautiful
wu-tang and limp bizkit, roll on the set
kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet

mic check, so what's it all about? and where we gonna run?
maybe we can meet up on the sun
discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
we limpin' on the track with the method
so get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
until you dissolve, i revolve around everything you got
from outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
i told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
so shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'cause all your shit's wack (doo doo is doo doo)
when its weighed out like that
burnin' up your brain like a piston
so all those that didn't listen
never even knew what they were missin'
and never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
wu-tang-clan for the crown

what's that? i didn't hear you
shut the fuck up!
come on, a little louder!
shut the fuck up!
everybody in together now
shut the fuck up!
what, huh?

distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak
life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
i'd love to be the one to disappoint you when i don't fall down

but you don't understand when i'm attempting to explain
because you know it all and i guess things will never change
but you might need my hand when falling in your hole
your disposition, i'll remember when i'm letting go
of you and me, we're through and rearranged

it seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
so you leave, and i can't believe all the bullshit that i find

you make believe
that nothing is wrong until you're crying
and you make believe
that life is so long until you're dying
you make believe
that nothing is wrong until you're crying, crying on me
you make believe
that life is so long until you're dying, dying, dying on me!
you think that everybody's the same
i don't think that anybody's like you
(you ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
you think that everybody's the same (thank god it’s over, and i won’t be the same)
(you ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
i don't think that anybody's like you (thank god it’s over, and i won’t be the same)

just think about it
you'll get it

why's everybody always picking on me?
(why's everybody always picking on me?)
does anybody really know a thing about me?
(does anybody really know a thing about me?)

from a slip disk from a limp bizkit disk
i just missed the gift list for christmas gifts

little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
so step back while i prep up to pimp this bitch
so i say to the girl, i'm like, "what up, girl? shut up, girl!"
then i showed her a cut up squirrel
she screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
she slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
i moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"yo, baby, what are you on?"
i looked at 'em both and i was like, "look
check this out, toots, i'm lookin' for cookie puss
i need to speak to him immediately
they played my video on mtv last week"
and just when i was thinking i was all that and then some
here comes fred durst, "now shady, let me get some"

who knows what galaxy i came from?
one where a bass drum hung from my high chair
now i'm a nightmare, you stay right there
i got the fever for the flavor of a single
see, me and shady, i think we got it locked down
shocked by the sound, i got you crusin' with your top down
these two blondes i offered them both a drink
and this you would think could get the party started
but instead the girls turned their heads
opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
so it was time for me to move on
shady said the living room was a dance floor
so turn me loose, i was cuttin' the rug with this chick
bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
i spilled a drink on his shirt
but no, he insisted we should go
and before i could drop him, shady had to clock him
the music stopped, the party stood in shock
i looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

turn me loose
turn me loose
turn me loose
this party's going my way
or no way at all
why don't you...

turn me loose
you better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til i puke
then fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
i'm sitting at the bar and i'm not being approached
‘cause fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"yo, fred, save me some"
i walked to these siamese twins
and asked to have a threesome
i told them two heads are better than one
plus i respect how y'all roll together as one
got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
stood up, like, "wait, where are you goin'?!"
well, three strikes and i'm out
and i just struck out two times in a row (ow!)
i ain't trying no more, fuck it, i'm chillin'
did a shot of jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

who knows what galaxy i came from?
one where a bass drum hung from my high chair
now i'm a nightmare, you stay right there
i got the fever for the flavor of a single
see, me and shady, i think we got it locked down
shocked by the sound, i got you crusin' with your top down
these two blondes i offered them both a drink

opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted

yeah, ah, check this!
kid (come on!)
check this! (fuck you!)

wakin' up, aggravated
stupid shit, man, i hate it
bitches lyin', bitches cryin'
suicidal, get in line
gettin' mine, bouncin' freaks
losin' sleep, countin' sheep
absolute, cash and loot
man in black, packin' heat
born and blazin', rotten raisin'
fingers up, time to wave 'em
show these players playin'
that they better get their ass to prayin'
they won't be nothin' but dice
after the cuttin', i'm guttin' 'em
like a fish, they're gonna wish
they never pushed my button

the door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
you're gettin' nothin' while i rock here in hollywood
i'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
i don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra

oh, that's right!
yeah, that's right! (shut the fuck up!)

feelin' korn, goin' blind
free as hell, doin' time
i'm insane, can't complain
flush you turds down the drain
down the hatch, throwin' craps
throwin' matches on the gas
check the math, check the wheels
check the ride, pay the bills
burnin' miles, harder smile
if you're feelin' versatile
verses wild, flippin' bitches
grindin' trucks, skatin' ditches
hatin' hard, but hardly hatin'
knife and slice your shit like bacon
sick and tired, you is fired
i'm the truth, and you's the liar

the door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
you're gettin' nothin' while i rock here in hollywood
i'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank

holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra

oh yeah, listen what i'm tellin' you (i'm telling you)
there's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you
oh yeah, listen what i'm tellin' you (i'm telling you)
there's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you (yeah!)

holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, golden cobra
