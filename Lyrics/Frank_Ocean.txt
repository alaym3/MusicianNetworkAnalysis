hopped into my car; drove far
far's too close and i remember my memory's no sharp
butter knife, what a life, anyway
i'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am i, hemingway?
she had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
if models are made for modelin'
thick girls are made for cuddlin'
switch worlds and we can huddle then
who needs another friend? i need to hold your hand
you'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

the feeling still deep down is good

if i could see through walls, i could see you're faking
if you could see my thoughts, you would see your face is
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then
i ain't a kid no more
we'll never be those kids again
we'd drive to syd's

ooh, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you, meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
it's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

the start of nothin'
had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
and we started from nothin'
ooh, i could hate you now
it's alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

if the sky is pink and white
if the ground is black and yellow
it's the same way you showed me
nod my head, don't close my eyes
halfway on a slow move
it's the same way you showed me
if you could fly, then you'd feel south
up north's getting cold soon
the way it is, we're on land
still, i'm someone to hold true
keep you cool when it's still alive
won't let you down when it's all ruin

just the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here

in the wake of a hurricane
dark skin of a summer shade
nosedive into flood lines
tall tower of milk crates
it's the same way you showed me
cannonball off the porch side
older kids trying off the rooves
just the same way you showed me (you showed)
if you could die and come back to life
up for air from the swimming pool
you'd kneel down to the dry land
kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined

that's the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here

remember life, remember how it was
climb trees, michael jackson, all ends here
say what up to matthew, to shoob

bending up my nikes
running out of melpomene, nicotine
stealing granny cigs (take it easy)
gimme something sweet
bitch, i might like immortality
this is life, life immortality

bad luck to talk on these rides

white ferrari, had a good time
(sweet sixteen, how was i supposed to know anything?)
i let you out at central
i didn't care to state the plain
kept my mouth closed
we're both so familiar
white ferrari, good times

you were fine, you were fine here
that's just a slow body
you left when i forgot to speak
so i text the speech, lesser speeds, texas speed, yes

ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

i care for you still and i will forever
that was my part of the deal, honest
we got so familiar
spending each day of the year
white ferrari, good times
in this life (life), in this life (life)
one too many years
some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(thought you might want to know now)
mind over matter is magic, i do magic
if you think about it, it'll be over in no time
and that's life
(love)

i'm sure we're taller in another dimension
you say we're small and not worth the mention
you’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
we could vacay, there's places to go
clearly, this isn't all that there is
can't take what's been given (no way)
but we're so okay here, we're doing fine
primal and naked
you dream of walls that hold us in prison
it's just a skull, least that's what they call it
and we're free to roam

bed full of women, flip on a tripod
little red light on shootin'
i'm feelin' like stanley kubrick

but it keeps on movin'
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty with a rack like wow

and ever since i've been tryna get it back
and pick it up and put it back

but there's no drug around
quite like what i found in you, you
i still can't feel my face
what am i smokin' anyway? (ahh)
she said, "don't let the high go to waste" (ooh)
but can you taste a little taste?

my fingertips and my lips
they burn from the cigarettes
forrest gump
you run my mind, boy
running on my mind, boy
forrest gump

i know you, forrest
i know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
but you're so buff and so strong
i'm nervous, forrest

hand me a towel, i'm dirty dancing
by myself, gone off tabs of that acid
form me a circle, watch my jagger
might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
we too loud in public, them police turned down the function
now we outside and the timing's perfect
forgot to tell you
gotta tell you how much i vibe with you
and we don't gotta be solo
now stay away from highways
my eyes like them red lights
right now, i prefer yellow
redbone, so mellow
fuck 'round, be cutting you
think we were better off solo
i got that act right in the windy city that night
no trees to blow through, but blow me and i owe you
two grams when the sun rise
smoking good, rolling solo
solo (solo), solo (solo)
s-solo (solo), s-solo (solo)

it's hell on earth and the city's on fire
inhale, in hell, there's heaven
there's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale, in hell, there's heaven
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
solo
solo
solo
solo

i'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
and catch a solo, on time
white leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
and that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and i know it
even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
but you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
now your baby mama ain't so vicious
all she want is her picket fence
and you protest and you picket sign
but them courts won't side with you
won't let you fly solo, yeah
i wanted that act right in colorado that night
i brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
stayed up 'til my phone died
smoking big, rolling solo

it's hell on earth and the city's on fire
inhale, in hell, there's heaven
there's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale, in hell, there's heaven
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh

the markings on your surface
your speckled face
flawed crystals hang from your ears
i couldn't gauge your fears
i can't relate to my peers
i'd rather live outside
i'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
maybe i'm a fool
maybe i should move and settle
two kids and a swimming pool
i'm not brave
(brave)
i'm not brave

i'm living over city
and taking in the homeless sometimes, i've
been living in an idea
an idea from another man's mind
maybe i'm a fool
to settle for a place with some nice views (nice views)
maybe i should move, settle down
two kids and a swimming pool
i'm not brave
i'd rather live outside
i'd rather live outside
i'd rather go to jail
i've tried hell
(it's a loop) what would you recommend i do?
(the other side of the loop is a loop)
this, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
this feels how molly must feel
this feels how molly must feel
how molly must feel
this feels how molly must feel
how molly must feel

this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
this is not my life
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
it's not what i'm like
it's just a fond farewell
(brave)

speaking of nirvana, it was there
rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
there with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
that could think of the dreamer that thought
that could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of god
i be dreaming of dreaming a thought
that could dream about a thought
that could think of dreaming a dream
where i cannot, where i cannot

less morose and more present
dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
one solar flare, we're consumed
so why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
high flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
see some colors, light hang glide off the moon

(in the dark)
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you, anything for you
(in the dark)
i'd do anything for you, anything for

i will always love you
how i do
let go of a prayer for you
just a sweet word
the table is prepared for you
wishing you godspeed, glory
there will be mountains you won't move
still, i'll always be there for you
how i do
i let go of my claim on you
it's a free world
you'll look down on where you came from sometimes
but you'll have this place to call home always

this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (until it's time)
this love will keep through blinding of the eyes (oh)
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (oh)
this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh, it's 'til it's time we die)
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

oh, oh
i'll always love you
until the time we die
oh, oh

that's a pretty big trunk on my lincoln town car, ain't it?
big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
now i'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
and every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
they never see them

and i've got this black suit on
roamin' around like i'm ready for a funeral
five more miles 'til the road runs out

i'm about to drive in the ocean
i'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good, and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good, and swim good, good

got some pretty good beats on this 808s cd, yeah
memory seats i'm sittin' on stay heated (yeah)
i woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
if i feel like a ghost, no swayze
ever since i lost my baby

i've had this black suit on
roamin' around like i'm ready for a funeral
one more mile 'til the road runs out, out

i'm about to drive in the ocean
i'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good, and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good, and swim good, good

i'm goin' off (oh, my pretty love)
don't try stopping me
i'm goin' off (throw me a line)
don't try saving (you broke my heart)
no flares (you broke my heart)
no vest (you drove my love)
and no fear
waves are washin' me out

i'm about to drive in the ocean
i'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good, and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good, and swim good, good

don't die

ayy
ayy, so now i'm

so low that i can see under the skirt of an ant
so low that i don't get high no more
when i geronimo, i just go, "heh"
solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
so low that i can admit
when i hear that another kid is shot by the popo
it ain't an event no more
so low that no more high horses, so hard to wear polo
when i do, i cut the pony off
now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
so low that i can give a fuck about what is trending
tryna cut down on my spending
regardless of winning, instead of pretending
and bending over backwards
over half of these hoes had work done
sayin' they want something real from a man
just saying it, we being real persons
i hate that it's like this, i feel for you, ant
i don't know what it's like with a skirt on
so pardon me if i am being insensitive
but darling, this only worsens
so low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
so low that when they throw pussy or pesos
don't pay no attention to it
so low that i am no rookie, but feel like a kid
lookin' at the other kids
with astonishment while i'm on punishment
watchin' the summer come close to an end
after twenty years in, i'm so naive i was under the im—
'pression that everyone wrote they own verses
it's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
i'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
i've stumbled and lived every word, was i working just way too hard?
