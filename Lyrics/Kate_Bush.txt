do you want to feel how it feels? (iyeh-yeh-yo)
do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (iyeh-yeh-yo)
do you want to hear about the deal that i'm making? (iyeh-yeh-yo)

you
it's you and me

and if i only could
i'd make a deal with god
and i'd get him to swap our places
be running up that road
be running up that hill
be running up that building
say, if i only could, oh

you don't want to hurt me (iyeh-yeh-yo)
but see how deep the bullet lies (iyeh-yeh-yo)
unaware i'm tearing you asunder (iyeh-yeh-yo)
ooh, there is thunder in our hearts (iyeh-yeh-yo)
is there so much hate for the ones we love? (iyeh-yeh-yo)
tell me, we both matter, don't we? (iyeh-yeh-yo)

you
it's you and me
it's you and me, won't be unhappy

and if i only could
i'd make a deal with god
and i'd get him to swap our places
be running up that road
be running up that hill
be running up that building (iyoh)
say, if i only could, oh

you (iyeh-yeh-yo)
it's you and me
it's you and me, won't be unhappy (iyeh-yeh-yo)

oh come on, baby (iyeh)
oh come on, darling
let me steal this moment from you now
oh come on, angel
come on, come on, darling
let's exchange the experience, oh, uh-oh

and if i only could
i'd make a deal with god
and i'd get him to swap our places
i'd be running up that road
be running up that hill
with no problems

say, if i only could
i'd make a deal with god
and i'd get him to swap our places
i'd be running up that road
be running up that hill
with no problems

say, if i only could

and i'd get him to swap our places
i'd be running up that road
be running up that hill
with no problems

say, if i only could
be running up that hill
with no problems
if i only could, be running up that hill
if i only could, be running up that hill

out on the wily, windy moors
we'd roll and fall in green
you had a temper like my jealousy
too hot, too greedy
how could you leave me
when i needed to possess you?
i hated you, i loved you too

bad dreams in the night
they told me i was going to lose the fight
leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
wuthering heights

heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window
heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window

ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
on the other side from you
i pine a lot, i find the lot
falls through without you
i'm coming back, love, cruel heathcliff
my one dream, my only master

too long i roam in the night
i'm coming back to his side to put it right
i'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
wuthering heights

heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window
heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window

ooh, let me have it!
let me grab your soul away
ooh, let me have it!
let me grab your soul away
you know it's me, cathy!

heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window
heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold
let me in-a-your window
heathcliff, it's me, cathy
i’ve come home, i'm so cold...

babooshka
babooshka

she wanted to test her husband
she knew exactly what to do:
a pseudonym to fool him
she couldn't have made a worse move
she sent him scented letters
and he received them with a strange delight
just like his wife
but how she was before the tears
and how she was before the years flew by
and how she was when she was beautiful
she signed the letter:

"all yours
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
all yours
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya"

babooshka

she wanted to take it further
so she arranged a place to go
to see if he
would fall for her incognito
and when he laid eyes on her
he got the feeling they had met before
uncanny how she
reminds him of his little lady
capacity to give him all he needs
just like his wife before she freezed on him
just like his wife when she was beautiful
he shouted out:

"i'm all yours
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
all yours
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
all yours
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya"

babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
babooshka, babooshka, babooshka-ya-ya
babooshka-ya-ya
babooshka
babooshka
babooshka
babooshka

pray god you can cope
i stand outside this woman's work
this woman's world
ooh, it's hard on the man
now his part is over
now starts the craft of the father

i know you have a little life in you yet
i know you have a lot of strength left
i know you have a little life in you yet
i know you have a lot of strength left

i should be crying, but i just can't let it show
i should be hoping, but i can't stop thinking
of all the things i should've said
that i never said
all the things we should've done
that we never did
all the things i should've given
but i didn't
oh, darling, make it go
make it go away

give me these moments back
give them back to me
give me that little kiss
give me your hand

i know you have a little life in you yet
i know you have a lot of strength left
i know you have a little life in you yet
i know you have a lot of strength left

i should be crying, but i just can't let it show
i should be hoping, but i can't stop thinking
of all the things we should've said
that were never said
all the things we should've done
that we never did
all the things that you needed from me
all the things that you wanted for me
all the things that i should've given but i didn't
oh, darling, make it go away
just make it go away now

i still dream of orgonon
i wake up crying
you're making rain
and you're just in reach
when you and sleep escape me

you're like my yo-yo
that glowed in the dark
what made it special
made it dangerous
so i bury it
and forget

but every time it rains
you're here in my head
like the sun coming out
ooh, i just know that something good is gonna happen
i don't know when
but just saying it could even make it happen

on top of the world, looking over the edge
you could see them coming
you looked too small
in their big black car
to be a threat to the men in power

i hid my yo-yo
in the garden
i can't hide you
from the government
oh, god, daddy
i won't forget

'cause every time it rains
you're here in my head
like the sun coming out
ooh, i just know that something good is gonna happen
i don't know when
but just saying it could even make it happen


and every time it rains
you're here in my head
like the sun coming out
look, your son's coming out
ooh, i just know that something good is going to happen
i don't know when
but just saying it could even make it happen, oh
ooh, just saying it could even make it happen

yeah, yeah, yay-yo
"we're cloudbusting, daddy"
yeah, yeah, yay-yo
yeah, yeah, yay, yo
yeah, yeah, yay-yo
yeah, yeah, yay, yo

the sun's coming out
yeah, yeah, yay-yo
your son's coming out
yeah, yeah, yay-yo

it's in the trees
it's coming

when i was a child, running in the night
afraid of what might be
hiding in the dark, hiding in the street
and of what was following me
now hounds of love are hunting
i've always been a coward
and i don't know what's good for me

oh, here i go
it's coming for me through the trees
oh, help me, someone, help me, please
take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
and i'll be
two steps on the water

i found a fox, caught by dogs
he let me take him in my hands
his little heart, it beat so fast
and i'm ashamed of running away
from nothing real, i just can't deal with this
i'm still afraid to be there
among your hounds of love
i feel your arms surrounding me
i've always been a coward
and never know what's good for me

oh, here i go
don't let me go
hold me down
it's coming for me through the trees
oh, help me, darling, help me, please
take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
and i'll be two steps on the water

i don't know what's good for me
i don't know what's good for me
i need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
yeah, yo-, yeah, yo-your love
take your shoes off and throw them in the lake
do you know what i really need?
do you know what i really need?
i need love, love, love, love, love, yeah

out in the garden there's half of a heaven
and we're only bluffing - we're not ones for busting through walls
but they've told us unless we can prove that
we're doing it we can't have it all
i want it all

he's gonna wangle a way to get out of it
she's an excuse and a witness who'll talk when he's called
but they've told us unless we can prove that
we're doing it we can't have it all
i want it all, i want it all
we can't have it all
i want it all

"i caught a glimpse of god, all shining and bright..."

suddenly my feet are feet of mud
it all goes slow-mo
i don't know why i'm crying
am i suspended in gaffa?
not until i'm ready for you
not until i'm ready for you
can i have it all?

i try to get nearer, but as it gets clearer
there's something appears in the way - it's a plank in me eye
with a camel who's trying to get through it
am i doing it? can i have it all now?
i want it all

i pull out the plank and say, "thank you for yanking me
back to the fact that there's always something to distract
but sometimes it's hard to know if i'm doing it right"
can i have it all now?
i want it all
can i have it all now?
i want it all
can i have it all?
i want it all
i can't have it all

"we all have a dream... maybe"

suddenly my feet are feet of mud
it all goes slow-mo
i don't know why i'm crying
am i suspended in gaffa?
not until i'm ready for you
not until i'm ready for you
can i have it all?

i won't open boxes that i am told not to
i'm not a pandora, i'm much more like
that girl in the mirror between you and me
she don't stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
i want it all
not anywhere at all
i want it all
no, not a thing
i want it all
she can't have it all

"mother, where are the angels? i'm scared of the changes"

suddenly my feet are feet of mud
it all goes slow-mo
i don't know why i'm crying
am i suspended in gaffa?
not until i'm ready for you
not until i'm ready for you

suddenly my feet are feet of mud
it all goes slow-mo
i don't know why i'm crying
am i suspended in gaffa?
not until i'm ready for you
not until i'm ready for you
can i have it all now?

little light shining
little light will guide them to me
my face is all lit up
my face is all lit up

if they find me racing white horses
they'll not take me for a buoy
let me be weak, let me sleep
and dream of sheep

"attention shipping information in sea areas...bell rock, tiree, cromaty, gale east...malin, sellafield…"
"come here with me now"

ooh, i'll wake up to any sound of engines
every gull a seeking craft
i can't keep my eyes open
wish i had my radio

i'd tune into some friendly voices
talking 'bout stupid things
i can't be left to my imagination
let me be weak, let me sleep
and dream of sheep

ooh, their breath is warm
and they smell like sleep
and they say they take me home
like poppies, heavy with seed
they take me deeper and deeper

our little army boy
is coming home from b.f.p.o
wave a bunch of purple flowers
to decorate a mammy's hero
mourning in the aerodrome
the weather warmer, he is colder
four men in uniform
to carry home my little soldier

what could he do?
should have been a rock star
but he didn't have the money for a guitar
what could he do?
should have been a politician
but he never had a proper education
what could he do?
should have been a father
but he never even made it to his twenties
what a waste, army dreamers
oh, what a waste of army dreamers

tears o'er a tin box
oh, jesus christ, he wasn't to know
like a chicken with a fox
he couldn't win the war with ego
give the kid the pick of pips
and give him all your stripes and ribbons
now he's sitting in his hole
he might as well have buttons and bows

what could he do?
should have been a rock star
but he didn't have the money for a guitar
what could he do?
should have been a politician
but he never had a proper education
what could he do?

"the, uh, tracking data, map data, and pre-planned trajectory are all one line on the block"

hello, earth
"hello, earth"
hello, earth
"hello, earth"
with just one hand held up high
i can blot you out, out of sight
peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, little earth
with just my heart and my mind, i can be driving, driving home
and you asleep on the seat

i'd get out of my car
step into the night
and look up at the sky
and there's something bright
traveling fast

just look at it go
just look at it go


hello, earth
hello, earth
watching storms start to form
over america
can't do anything
just watch them swing with the wind out to sea

all you sailors
get out of the waves, get out of the water!
all life-savers
get out of the waves, get out of the water!
all you cruisers
get out of the waves, get out of the water!
all you fishermen head for home
go to sleep, little earth

i was there at the birth
out of the cloudburst, the head of the tempest
murderer!
murderer of calm!

why did i go?
why did i go?


tiefer, tiefer
irgendwo in der tiefe
gibt es ein licht
go to sleep, little earth...

hello, old lady
i know your face well
i know it well

she says
"ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
i'll be sitting in your mirror
now is the place where the crossroads meet
will you look into the future?"

"never, never say goodbye
to my part of your life
no, no, no, no, no!"
"let me live!"
she said, "c'mon and let me live, girl!"
she said, "c'mon and let me live, girl!"
"c'mon and let me live!"

"this moment in time,"
she said
"it doesn't belong to you,"
she said
"it belongs to me."

"and to your little boy and to your little girl
and the one hand clapping:
where on your palm is my little line
when you're written in mine
as an old memory?
ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na"

"never, never say goodbye
to my part of your life
oh no, no, no, no, no!
never, never, never, never, never let me go!"
she said, "c'mon and let me live, girl!'
"c'mon and let me live!"
she said, "c'mon and let me live, girl!"
"c'mon and let me live!"


i put this moment... here
i put this moment... here
i put this moment
over here!
over here!

can't you see where memories are kept bright?
tripping on the water like a laughing girl
time in her eyes is spawning past life
one with the ocean and the woman unfurled
holding all the love that waits for you here
catch us now for i am your future
a kiss on the wind and we'll make the land
come over here to where when lingers
waiting in this empty world
waiting for then, when the life spray cools
for now does ride in on the curl of the wave
and you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
we are of the going water and the gone
we are of water in the holy land of water
and all that's to come runs in
with the thrust on the strand

mmh, yes
then i'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth
going deep south, go down, mmh, yes
took six big wheels and rolled our bodies
off of howth head and into the flesh, mmh, yes

he said, "i was a flower of the mountain, yes
but now i've powers o'er a woman's body, yes"

stepping out of the page into the sensual world
stepping out

to where the water and the earth caress
and the down of a peach says, "mmh, yes"
do i look for those millionaires like a machiavellian girl would
when i could wear a sunset, mmh, yes

and how we'd wished to live in the sensual world
you don't need words, just one kiss, then another

stepping out of the page into the sensual world
stepping out off the page into the sensual world


and then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech, mmh, yes
and then he whispered, "would i, mmh, yes
be safe, mmh, yes, from mountain flowers?"
and at first with the charm around him, mmh, yes
he loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts
he'd rescue it, mmh, yes

and his spark took life in my hand and, mmh, yes
i said, "mmh, yes", but not yet
mmh, yes
mmh, yes

you can't hear me
you can't hear me
you can't hear what i'm saying
you can't hear what i'm saying to you

here in the room with you now
you can't hear what i'm saying

there's a ghost in our home just watching you without me
but i'm not here
but i'm not here
but i'm not here

you don't hear me
you can't hear what i'm saying

don't ignore, don't ignore me

"it's cold out here!"

woman, let me in!
let me bring in the devil dreams!
i will not let you in!
don't you bring back the reveries
i turn into a bird
carry further than the word is heard
woman, let me in!
i turn into the wind
i blow you a cold kiss
stronger than the song's hit
i will not let you in
i face towards the wind
i change into the mule
i change into the mule
let me in

i hear him before i go to sleep
and focus on the day that's been
i realise he's there when i turn the light off
and turn over
nobody knows about my man
they think he's lost on some horizon

and suddenly i find myself
listening to a man i've never known before
telling me about the sea
all his love, 'til eternity

ooh, he's here again
the man with the child in his eyes
ooh, he's here again
the man with the child in his eyes

he's very understanding
and he's so aware of all my situations
and when i stay up late
he's always waiting, but i feel him hesitate
oh, i'm so worried about my love
they say, "no, no, it won't last forever."

and here i am again, my girl
wondering what on earth i'm doing here
maybe he doesn't love me
i just took a trip on my love for him

ooh, he's here again
the man with the child in his eyes
ooh, he's here again
the man with the child in his eyes

"bang!" goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van
see the light ram through the gaps in the land
many an aborigine's mistaken for a tree
'til you near him on the motorway and the tree begin to breathe
see the light ram through the gaps in the land

come in with the golden light
in the morning
come in with the golden light
is the new man
come in with the golden light
is my dented van
woomera

the civilised keep alive the territorial war
see the light ram through the gaps in the land
erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for ore
or dangle devils in a bottle and push them from the pull of the bush
see the light ram through the gaps in the land
you find them in the road
see the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
in the road

come in with the golden light
in the morning
come in with the golden light
with no warning
come in with the golden light
we bring in the rigging
dig, dig, dig, dig away

d'you know what?
i love you better now

i am falling
like a stone
like a storm
being born again
into the sweet morning fog
d'you know what?
i love you better now

i'm falling
and i'd love to hold you now
i'll kiss the ground
i'll tell my mother
i'll tell my father
i'll tell my loved ones
i'll tell my brothers
how much i love them
