uh, i'm sorry for your loss
it's a body dead in the car and it's prob'ly one of yours
the writing all across the window and the walls
whether it was true or false, we shouldn't have got involved
remember, we walked past the teacher, take the chalk and laugh
we wrote punishments: "i will not talk in class."
now it's pistols punishin' people for talkin' fast
and all these innocent bystanders is haulin' ass
i hate to say i told y'all, but i told y'all
things fall apart when the center too weak to hold y'all
i'm just collectin' what you owed to my old jawn
you 'bout to get swooped down on and stoled on
fools swear they wise, wise men know they foolish
well, we was headed for the web, even before computers
i never thought you'd give me a reason to do this
cain and abel, jesus and judas
caesar and brutus, i see intruders, avert your eyes
i told you keep out of the hood: circumcise
how could you sleep? i thought you always was the first to rise
ayo, you heard the line, "everybody plays the fool"?
well, i'll be that exception to the rule
the principal that hand-deliver lessons to the school
i was makin' major moves, my dollar déjà vu
my mission when my ambition was brandishin' a tool
to be a icon, wearin' slippers made of python
get mine quicker 'cause i'm slick as a pipeline
transportin' the oil, tribulation and toil
hit the operation, but i'm back in the soil
got my crown tilted, my gown quilted, silk with cashmere
burnin' rome down in a minute, built it last year
newsflash, i dodged the bullet that killed the cashier
my homie told me to come with him to the masjid
them brothers said, "don't go from written bars filled with rage
to primetime television and your gilded cage
then forget there's people in the world still enslaved."
i barbwired my wrist and let it fill the page
gun fire and flares, sirens glare
i'm in a iron chair where people who care don't get the lion's share
when i don't give a fuck then i ain't fair
i'm on a higher tier with people gettin' money like the financier
catch the herald, i'm fresh chopped and beveled
rap on a doctorate level, so f. scott fitzgerald
maybe i'm the new rakim, maybe i'm fat pharaohe
undergarments of armor be my intimate apparel
pre-kardashian kanye, my rhymeplay immaculate
same cadence as d.o.c. pre-accident
maybe my acumen's on par with kool g. rap and them
give me the proper respect, mothafucka, we back again
for a couple things we lost in a fire
the drive, the desire to perform on a higher
plateau, i'm at that show lost in a mire
wonderin' how we got so far from inspired
look, when photos were sepia-toned
and record players were somethin' you would keep in your home
yo, the traveler, the meaning of tariq he was known
for the exemplary performance uniquely his own
i made the twenty-one pound for some a newfound religion
where money's put down, it's only one sound that make
ogs and young lions equally proud to listen
the secret amalgamism, a algorithm
comin' from where only kings and crowns permitted the darkness
where archaeologists found my image in parchment
rolled into a scroll, holdin' a message for you
it said, "the only thing for sure is taxes, death and trouble."
the anomaly sworn solemnly, high snobbidy
freakonomics and war policy, dichotomy
that's heaven and hades, tigris and euphrates
his highness, the apple of the iris to you ladies
as babies we went from similac and enfamil
to the internet and fentanyl
when all consent was still against the will
i got that detox for y'all
the microphone doctor, black deepak chopra
i'm a griot that make you wanna peacock your arm
every heavy dignitary payin' me top regards
boy, i'm three optics far from your binoculars
so that smart money finna get the heat out the car
yo, i'm k.dot lamar meets 2pac shakur
got profiled by a few cops, too hot to charge
listen, somebody said a price tag was on a rapper's head
so we gon' see a nice bag when a rapper dead
the mask black, the flag green, black and red
they'll probably wave a white flag after plasma shed
no doubt, yo the game went they own route
i can't explain what these lame kids is talkin' 'bout
or how they fit they whole foot into they own mouth
i put a couple bodies in a brown bag, then i'm en route
i'm sneaker shoppin' with my son, a size 8
prior to they release 'cause why wait?
look, in my estate i got electrified gates
for these blasé guys hatin' at a high rate
'cause i dodged fate, then got great, the fly's straight
if we ain't family or friends then we don't vibrate
and i'm that gun in y'all face, none of y'all safe
if i catch you at the right time in the wrong place
slippin', sippin' on somethin' with a strong taste
like whiskey or bootleg bourbon with a corn base
my levante resemble a vehicular threat
the mic i spray resemblin' the sickle of death
it ain't strenuous to come from a continuous breath
i set fire to the venue, i'ma spin you and step
rinse, repeat, you checkin' for the sound of the beast
i'm the hound, i'ma creep, i get down, i'ma eat
i'ma keep somethin' to lay a naysayer to sleep
playin' with heat, nobody and nothin' fuckin' with 'riq
yo, these weaklings is claimin' they cuttin' up in the street
nigga peace, you ain't workin' with nothin' but the police
listen, you ain't finna be nothin' but the deceased
listen, you in interment with a permanent crease
i strike fear in the hearts of rap figures
who mind bare the stigmas of time, no black privilege
from boom bap niggas to trap niggas
you in the trap with us, when the lines is as vivid
as the walls on the graph, autographed by the lord of wrath
i reside between the seconds on the chronograph
how much more cb4 can we afford?
it's like a shariah law on "my cherie amour"
how much hypocrisy can people possibly endure?
but ain't nobody workin' on a cure, my young bull
y'all just regular, i'm an apex predator
brim stay fresh, feathered up, etcetera
nevertheless, i got a message and left
one dead messenger, yep
my pen is henry kissinger, buzz bissinger
look, my caporegime is to no redeem
and my oldest son ahmir saleem out of new orleans
took a golf cart to the baccarat from the waldorf
what was on the wall? that depend on what you call art
i'ma say 300k ain't even in the ballpark
i charge more just for awkward small talk
so yes, who's fuckin' with it if it's not the best?
i get the lobby painted fresh upon my request
it's kafka-esque, his holiness, stop the press
that cobalt blue, reminiscent of makkaresh
lord, we got padma lakshmi for you
let her massage your back with black seed oil
the foundation is firm, the flags need soil
me? i need royalty because i bleed royal
go through the veins to the brain, fabulous and strange
my journalistic range is a catalyst for change
it got anybody that listen pissin' flame
and 'cause the hall of fame got so many missin' names
i'll acknowledge the original people's not oliver
y'all go get the next challenger for excalibur
i'm more policed for my core beliefs
they tried to capture me
and brand me on the cheek with a fleur-de-lis
the side of my heart'll be more discreet
i'm international, my passport page is like war and peace
i've always played my part from the start
back in philly where the triggers is mandatory to spark
with a slightest inflammatory remark
i have you and the livin' a category apart
listen, a grain of salt'll tip the scales, it never fails
walk on egg shells, sleep on a bed of nails
criminal records like record sales
makin' heads or tails, we like henrietta lacks up in the cells
my mother was a working class, very lovin' woman
who struggled, every dinner coulda been the last supper
i come home, chasin' good-for-nothin' half-cousins
and then walk in the crib to the smell of crack cookin'
she was introduced to that substance abuse
on some of the strongest drugs that the government produced
look, i even got excused by the principal
my story is out of the dub dub interview
i've seen some ice-cold summers, hot winters too
i never thought i'd win grammy awards with the roots
i never thought i would be gettin' long in the tooth
my ogs told me, "boy you better go and live your truth!"
i am a walking affirmation, that imagination
and focus and patience gets you closer to your aspiration
and just 'cause they give you shit don't mean you have to take it
my words capture greatness, sworn affidavits
yours truly, the celestial bein'
you stay seein' pullin' up in the fresh european
high-steppin' out of it dressed to a t and
not another got more soul, 'less you korean
i’ve been havin' visions of nat turner holdin' his master’s head
like yorick and horatio in hamlet
smackin' it like a tennis racket, underhanded
send a message through the gram: ''the eagle has landed.''
dressed in a military jacket made of canvas
i am no guerilla, i just make 'em go bananas
outstandin', red, black and green bandanas
cocked hammers, hairs on my chin is outstanding
can't manage the weight of war, they're just out ballin'
look, i'll fall up from the sky to see my callin'
i'm not crawlin', i'm a free man like morgan
seein' manhood in the hood is a damn good bargain
if a black man don't tap dance
and every girl that got a fat booty don't lapdance
well, i guess it's somethin' wrong, huh?
niggas completely uninformed
i don't burn bridges, yo i keep the haters' runnin' for em'
i ain't one of y'all peers, i'm the sum of all fears
somebody stronger than me? who that? i'm all ears
like obama, i wish he had another four years
y'all some jolly good hollywood squares
i'm like, ahem, approach the altar with your offering
i spoil rappers rotten like my only offspring
being his excellency gets to be exhausting
you in the residency of the one they call king
dada, ali baba, the talented mr. trotter
inside of my right palm, the mark of the stigmata
big poppa, wig chopper, emperor jaffe joffer, muhfucka
i'm stronger than the coffee out in kaffa
all y'all niggas vagina-hot, remind me of icona pop
i step in the booth, i'm a bull inside a china shop
mollywhoppin', watch another cotton pickin' body drop
every time we rock, yo they actin' like it's mardi gras
'til the party stop, skirt off like she that ferrari drop
soul cycle pumpin' that earth, wind & fire ba-di-ah
coolin' 'pon the dock, à la marina, hard body yacht
you seen another rapper cleaner, mami? prob'ly not
how it feel to be the best that did it, i admit it
i'm visitin' from planet bring-these-niggas-death-in-minutes
and y'all know i'm exquisite, wicked as wilson pickett
the sickness i exhibit, i'm too legit to quit it
i don't fake it 'til i make it, i take it to the limit and break it
never timid, what i'm 'bout, i represent it
infinite just like chace is, been a million places
conversation is how beautiful my face is
people hated on how sophisticated my taste is
then i pulled up on these mothafuckas in a spaceship
pantomime, i'm made of elements you can't combine
i'm at a level of intelligence you can't define
einstein, shakespeare, voltaire, tesla
recording artist slash psychology professor
i preach for the east, never fold under pressure
the beast from the east and i glide like clyde drexler
ayo, my new name is eighty five x's
'cause i'm the rap game certified specialist
when i was reckless i was worried 'bout the guest list
i'm helpin' rappers everywhere fulfill a death wish
yo, flex, i'm glad we made contact
my nigga, also know this shit for combat
brain matter contain too much data
i tell a story like fingerprints and blood splatter

"hey dis
c'est pas vrai, dis
pince-moi, dis (twofifteen)
c'est comme si je n'avais jamais dansé avant"

yo, the big wheel keep turnin' like ike's and anna mae's
the church kitchen hustlin' dinners every saturday
pull over, let me grab a plate, i tend to gravitate
towards how fish dinners from a styrofoam platter taste
my granddaddy sported plaid donny hathaways
hustlin' for everything we had 'til he passed away
when i would ask him 'bout what path to take
he used to laugh and say, "no man is an island but i'm a castaway"
casualties, i seen 'em like the french foreign legion
on the streets, they used to carry out bizarre procedures
in jean jackets and jabbar adidas
back when local r&b was just as soulful as orthopedics
me and my man twistin' up some reefer and wishin'
we knew all the town hitmen and the likes of sam christian
on the edge of existence, man, listen
understand, respect and fear was the all-american ambition
for badass kids in the laundromat, foldin' a load
well, lo and behold, a whole 'nother fork in the road
my wish for them is that the truth is eventually told
out on the corner, where whatever you can sell is sold
i heard murder ran this vast, deserted land
since back when burning man was blacks in birmingham
before the presidential election diversion scam
matter fact, before they clapped franz ferdinand
you gossip on jay and beyoncé or kim and kanye
but keep risin' to the top, what my mind say
picture my daughter drinkin' water where the sign
say, "for colored girls," i ain't talkin' ntozake shange
who said it’s senegal? i was a king in general
rich in every resource, precious metal and mineral
before the devil entered the land of the plentiful
with that jamaican funk, gotta get it into who
for generations under god, indivisible
psych ward patients, vampires in a interview
become institutionalized, what a nigga do
but what we had to do to survive, none of them could do
who the technical culprit? i don't mess with no vultures
i'm electrical voltage, not the regular dosage
too obsessive compulsive, i'm a fuckin' explosive
mixed message in a bottle, i left with the postman
i'm that arachnophobia, black petroleum
ceremoniously holy when at the podium
even though it's hotter than weapons-grade plutonium
the people tryna check for the return of the ichiban
obi-wan, universe, you owe me one solid
my homie gonzalez, only know gun violence
on the corner where they probably on they 21 savage
catch two in your cabbage, young cesar chavez
division one, yo, wait a min', where we get our rhythm from?
continuum, still swingin' like a pendulum
here the women come, sing it like sarah vaughan
heard 9th up in a house from north carilon'
ain't no mannequin challenge, but y'all paralyzed
it's gettin' cold outside, a word from the wise
y'all niggas better bundle up
but i bet it be a hotter summer, not for nothin'
yo, the cops get down, especially when it come to us
nigga better be a rockefeller
get that out your pocket fella, sang acapella
ain't a damn thing really changed as far as i can tell it
another soul with no name, the helicopters hunted
look like a couple of days before the doctor comin'
but that's my little cousin, watch him for me
i think the world tryna sock it to me
it kinda feel like everything is out of pocket for me
who keep it a hundred when everything's partial?
dignity and sanity is what the game cost you
wake up to the paddles on your chest, we had lost you
i'm just paintin' a picture like kerry james marshall
i'm just takin' a picture like carrie mae weems
so smile and say cheese, we in 2018
in a pyramid scheme, nightmares and day dreams
from the runaway slave to a modern day king

"hey dis
c'est pas vrai, dis
pince-moi, dis
c'est comme si je n'avais jamais dansé avant"

twofifteen
twenty-one pound
uh...

i'm not a typical arrogant american on prescribed medicine
i'm sick as i ever been
rollin' out of the dealership in a mclaren
these rappers is peter pan, i'm pan-african
space invader blackin' ‘em
mixin' alexander mcqueen with haider ackermann
real rapture in the form of a living man
i don't give a damn, not a mortal could test me
see, i don't get examed
i'm a high priest and a wild beast
once warrior, now chief—the mouthpiece of the foul east
and i’ma rock ‘em, sock 'em robot hof, i drop bombs
any flow i got come at you like .coms
you should know i'm not, for the run of the mill drill
i'm still trill, the flame thrower, the real deal
i don’t coincide with the oddness
your highness is where the pantheon of the gods is, i promise
i'm known for being brutally honest
if lyricism is spiritual to you then rewind this
i'ma kill 'em but it ain't about to be with kindness
i believe the industry about to see a conquest
changin' of the mindset
money just a concept, never been a object
even when my mother was livin' up in the projects
now my ratin' is higher than young richard pryor get
still speakin' my mind, just in a different dialect

it takes two to make anthropology
the student and the studied
that being the case, it is time for the studied to examine the student and to evaluate its own self

i said, i seen it all, i had it all and i ain't mad at all
this rapper toss gravitas like a cannonball
stayin' up all night, throwin' my sleep pattern off
i need a doctor on call to keep adderall
position of my commission is trilateral
you fuckin' with me, you trippin' for tryin' that at all
i mess around, make the call, get the gat involved
i know people, it's a small world after all
my credit card say it's onward at the mall
my broad lookin' like she cinderella at the ball
reborn every january like a capricorn
from downtown, no ryan lewis and macklemore
it's yours truly, i'm paul mooney, i'm george clooney
i'm fully immersed in the craft, bringin' awards to me
the bass player said he gon' sue me
i gave the finger to him, the lord gave a round of applause to me
my soul winnin', i've been goaltendin'
cold sentence, scroll pennin’, nigga gone 'til it’s no limit
the vision came to me so vivid
my observation was if money for the takin', i'ma go and get it
y'all know my everyday lay no costume
i murk rappers and they can't play no possum
another studio but it's the same old outcome
i told my nigga spon vicious, "baby, we got one"
listen

accurate scholarship and free, dedicated artists would reveal a singularly important thing
racism was and is not only a mark of ignorance
it was and is a monumental fraud

yeah, the universe let the planets align
spent 10k and the card didn’t decline
bartender, one casamigos  and lime
i'm celebrating gracefully, getting better with time
i ain't even halfway through this incredible ride
but like, i'm kind of doing an incredible job
when i was eighteen living beyond my means
i was afraid of my dreams, looking at the finer things
wishing i could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip
upgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip
cash rules everything, i just wanted a taste of it
fast food hurrying, saving time, not wasting it
self-saboteur, speaking it to my paramour
torch rappers like i'm igniting the aerosol
maintaining the wherewithal that embarrass y'all
game-changer, the way i shredded your cabbage off
explaining is changing apples to applesauce
when we were young, innocence was ours, but that was lost
where i reside is the dark side of the glory
the fury i manipulate is the arc of the story
written without a ghostwriter to author it for me
this is crime and punishment, i'm the judge and the jury
listen, dostoyevsky

i swam with crocs, fished with sharks
may never pop charts, but i know i'm popular
i was built to run the game, i came up playing guard
with young niggas between 5'5" and 6 foot 4
i banked over both, tryna bank over some more
and ball out in something gorgeous that'll keep me in court
where they’ll judge like y'all does, y'all don't know me enough
y'all still owe us for what all y'all did to the cold crush
to my donuts, i'm shooting j dillas and what
i wanna cop when i get loot and recoup
i had to go through hella doors so in short that's why i only want two
but i ain't got jay number, i cc 'em the proof
'cause everything i pictured in my head has always come true
they say you need vision to see eye to eye with the druids
spent 25 hundred on sheep skin, let it seep in
i ain't turn starboy in a weekend
it took more like 7 years, make a sane man drink everclear
it ain’t ever clear if we ever guaranteed a year
fruits of your labor, huh, you work hard to get it
jamla stitched on the motherfucking roc fitted
before the big lights it had to start with the scrimmage
know that it'd come sooner or later, i'm trae young, nigga
huh, i'm trae young, nigga

uh, i said dostoyevsky meets joe pesci
tired of staring at a glass half empty
turning me from dr. sebi to cocking semi
it got me clutching my machete from the serengeti already
wild styles and fab five freddy
i'm a stranger in moscow, don't ask how deadly is the ummah
patrice lumumba, kwame nkrumah
to the tripoli shores from the halls of montezuma
stop intruder, i'm built on facts, i'm not your rumor
a malignant tumor, slid through in a suede puma
the steady heavy legendary, all praise is overdue
same cloth as the chosen few, rap noble drew
i guarantee you know more music by the suckers
it's not a victimless crime if anybody suffers
in a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us
well, what’s the use of 'em trying when can’t nobody touch us?
unless it's fabricated, probably drug related
but love or hate it, i will not be subjugated
when they screamin' “you the greatest that did it,” what’s underrated?
as if every other player who spit it was unrelated
if every man's a temple, the circumstance is simple
so to be transcendental, i do enhance the mental
this is elder statesmen conversation
take a look into them books from down in the basement, yeah

i said, outer space the place that i’m parkin’ in
my marketin’, when you see the sky darkenin'
rhyme artisan from the crew that's bipartisan
hi haters a 5th grader you're not smarter than
alpha & omega you betas i march harder than
batteries, y'all ain't included, you're not a part of it
i just took a flight to france to cop cardigans
at lanvin
i'm that primetime buju banton
and i'm just trying to get it on 'til i die
am i wrong if i'm living like the laws don't apply?
making music out of nothing, know that boy's bonafide
it's disturbing when a murderer enjoys homicide
talented mr. trotter squad, beyond qualified
multiplying the dollar sign, the grind is real it's palestine
my sidekick came from columbine
that fly shit came from saint laurent
surprise, bitch! i never lived a false moment in time
riddle me, what kind of omen am i? you know the slogan is ride
i said a weapon should be chosen to fire
only the ghetto beethoven replied, the ninth wonder maker
thunder breaker send these toys to the undertaker
my pen smoking like a rude boy from jamaica
while i'm erasing every fuckboy from the face of the earth
what's up, boys? it's time for you to get your weight up
yo, i probably began in the rift valley
in places untraceable by rand mcnally
took a cobblestone trolley through a mercer street alley
to more championship rings than john salley
biochemically on par with salvador dali
i traveled to tijuana and smacked the federali
who packing avocado toast like mario batali?
i'm an ocean without a coast, going back to cali nigga
name some other body equally as ill
frequently i see the drama call me cecil b. demille
not a chink up in the armor though i'm lethally for real
people been telling me recently, "tariq, you need to chill!"
but picture that, the diplomat pistol slap aristocrats
any rapper coming for me, i'ma send a missile back
not too many legends got a legacy that's this intact
that equipment i'm grippin kept where the ammunition at
soul makossa like i'm manu dibango
wild as the democratic republic of the congo
i'm hunter s. thompson doing it gonzo
a rapper winds up as a john doe, i told niggas
sixty seconds to shine before i fold niggas
i must be out of my mind with it, gold diggers
here come the general for the quadricentennial
i'm a non-millenial what i rep is the old niggas

let's meet at the crossroads and toss o’s
and learn some things only the lord knows
break the law, it's the only law now, no one knows
got pies in the oven but no digiornos
we all got fucked but no pornos
we ain't growing corn but got cornrows
we ain't plant greens but we be spending it
lifespan is short, try extending it
if you ain't into reading,  i'm recommending it
i'm reading carter g. woodson when i'm in the woods
when the money's cut off, will we barter goods?
a lot of niggas is cowards and ran out of fatherhood
should we kill them or let 'em live?
i don't fuck with no suckers, i never did
mi amor, if you a moor
if i ever go to war it's the kids i do it for
i eat emcees they can send me a few of ya’ll
and by a few i mean way more than two
you can times that by twenty and tell 'em to come through
and watch ‘em get beat like african drums do
old soul, i probably gave lessons to sun tzu
lyrically i'm bruce lee mastering kung fu
rhyming with black thought possessing the black thought
i told you that i'm conscious but bet you i’ll clap off
i'ma be the one that they hold in a rap off
i ain't wrapped too tight, my nigga i snap off
or maybe i snap on
when i go for the ride my nigga then latch on
i'm hannibal on an elephant, animal but elegant
given you hell heaven sent
light a joint, i've been places you've never been
close my eyes, i could die then get wise
treat my life like a script, i'm getting it revised
used to keep the beat joint right up in the levi's
i'm the tenth wonder i told them to ask 9th
i'm the other black thought, the last ear bender
avatar ghost, the one who could bend time
the one who could bend rhymes, the one who could bend flows
repping for old niggas, little nigga you know
we the ones who made making of a murderer
fuck around, you could be in making of a murderer
ghost!

where i go, where i go from here?
oh i, know i, could be nowhere
and trust that all that money's good for nothin’ if you scared
singin', yeah, yeah

look
i am no fashion model but
i got fresh for photographers
the camo coat had the collar up
'cause my emotions was bottled up
and though the ocean did not erupt
it turned up ’til it's loud enough
to just make somethin' out of us
pass the shadow of a doubt in us
godly, geometry and calculus
that i can move any mountain with
a nigga gotta be an alchemist
tryna create another avenue of revenue
or several because i'm in love with havin' you
security is just a whole 'nother animal
i can't assume xanadu had a panic room
i wish the man in the moon had a manual
and gratitude for the wishes i granted you
a lifetime, finally i'm understandin’ you
the lifelines that delines in a hand or two
and how it’s difficult to undo the damage you've done
once the codes run under scanner too
so if you capture the flame and it’s painful
you just charge that to the game
'cause it's shameful to just fall back and complain
that you fractured the laws of attraction again
focus on the more passionate plane
no conception's immaculate, man

where i go, where i go from here?
oh i, know i, could be nowhere
and trust that all that money’s good for nothin' if you scared
singin', yeah, yeah

once again to the well, i went
while the soul man screamed bloody hell out there
i'm tryna decode the meaning of the spell i'm in
and i don't even know what fucking hotel i'm in
i checked in as the monarch of mel-a-nin
the el-a-phant, my body is a shell i'm in
piecin' myself together, teachin' myself to never
let one loss divorce my devel-op-ment
reminds me of ego trippin' like nikki giovanni
wishin' the system might deliver me a body
cum laude, the rug on the floor was from saudi
the message i'd hung on the door was unrowdy
no dowry, the price of it all was one cowrie
now we the last flophouse on the bowery
human traffickin', moving africans
still rapping with fantasies, fill the bracket in
and if you capture the flame, and it's painful
then just charge that to the game
'cause it's shameful to just fall back and complain
that you fractured the laws of attraction, again
focus on a more passionate plane
estimate a more accurate frame
of time, a frame of mind attached to the sane
no conception's immaculate, man

where i go, where i go from here?
oh i, know i, could be nowhere
and trust that all that money's good for nothin' if you scared
singin', yeah, yeah
where i go, where i go from here?
oh i, know i, could be nowhere
and trust that all that money's good for nothin' if you scared
singin', yeah, yeah

in just a few moments
we will hear from the most powerful black man in america today
uh (everybody)
(i don't think you heard me) ayo
the most powerful black man in the world

ayo, they ask why i seem so solemn
on the throne between three stone columns
you know the name, fuckin' up the game, no condoms
everybody got damn first world problem
the truth is inconvenient as non-believers
fearing daca dreamers instead of fema
bentley, benz, or a beamer, fiji or aquafina (everybody, every goddamn body)
we fuck around and be the next iwo jima
the tides risin' at the same time like they synchronized
for makin' art, for makin' love, for makin' hajj
the home is where the hatred lies, they takin' lives
but everybody just so saved and sanctified
then they rely upon, we the few defiant ones (everybody, every goddamn body)
communicating in higher forms than viacom
to dialogue before the roar of the riot horn
i wonder on which side of the lines i belong?
lady liberty face full of concealer
i'm half masta killa and half hugh masekela
latrophobia, that's a fear of the healer
kaepernick is an activist, y'all in fear of the kneeler
everything's obtuse, nothin' is obscene
another young life was lost on live stream
another great fell from grace in high esteem
then the clock struck thirteen, we in some kind of dream
first i'm handling first things, decipher what it means
to a planet of earthlings, where the question remains
am i a journal or journalist? herbal eternalist
olympic tournament level genius author, affirmative
though turnin' back and returnin', i'm not concerned with it
the permanent ink paved the way out the turbulence
my hands against the wall outside a billiards hall
i hear police discussin' whether to try and kill us all
i questioned if that'd matter, life is like a tree that falls
in the woods, even with iphone footage to see it fall
great men chose the papermate pen or state pen
the firin' pin of a pistol aimed at a playpen
we go from musket to a missile to a revelation (everybody, every goddamn body)
between heaven and satan, while i'm steady creatin'
and try to separate the truth from the lies that they told us
i even heard the soviet's, the 45th potus
that ain't the photo they showed us, or acceptin' the onus
did they washington us? my condolence to y'all diplomas
here's a bonus, the point of view to make things see through
if i'm a walking institution, i'm a hbcu
face the music, keepin' it moving's one of the great things we do
yo, the devil's tryna put together his gang, me too
and whether you come from lagos or trinidad and tobago
you can either stay broke or be wealthy as jeff bezos
if you just stay woke, i was in the dark then day broke (everybody, every goddamn body)
directin' questions to my ancestors until they spoke now
inherently rockin' the disco currently
bars is cryptocurrency, hypnotherapy
shittin' on everything, 5'9", 6'4" lyrically
crystal clarity, wonder how i spit so thoroughly
stay so hungry, rappers can't get no mercy (everybody, every goddamn body)
that's the reason any other one who spit won't versus me
it's so lonely in my own class "formerly known as"
and the inscription that your headstone has
on my own path, in my own world like disney's
i feel the fuckin' system fail just like kidneys
up steps the one who upsets all carriages
'cause it's imperative we change the narrative

(everybody) yeah, and that's thought vs everybody
(everybody) listen, check it out, that go to everybody
(everybody) yo, i got myself over everybody
(everybody, every goddamn body) yeah, every goddamn body

good morning
good morning
good morning
yeah (grind easy, bitches)
hey, good morning (woo)
hey, oh, good morning (woo)
yeah, ayy (good morning)

yo, i'm from the home of the ghosts-es, water plugs and wokeness
water bugs and roaches, drugs and overdoses
how you approach this? philly is where the dope is
my uncles reds and willie is still the goldsmiths
hold shit steady, we're close-knit and deadly as a heart attack
trust me, the pitbulls is petty
already infamous, limitless, getty images (woo)
foul temperament, you start shit, we endin' it (woo)
it's mad last wishes, gas mask kisses (oh)
the thin line between savants and savages (oh)
your life could depend on the laws of averages
the difference between black and white is mad privilege (fuck that shit)
for lucifer, son of the morning
who swore we'd ignored every one of them warnings
but try to run for cover under one of them awnings
'cause here the storm come
tell the lord time for his encore performance

good morning (woo)
hey, oh, good morning
yeah, ayy (good morning)
(good morning)
fuck that shit (hey, hey)
on the wakeup
dreaming every day of tryna get my cake up
yeah

i got four million in homes, three hours apart
drug dealer tastes, i think i glow in the dark
i only do features to keep hittin' my mark
and show you motherfuckers you ain't good as you thought (i am), let's go
panamera shopping in the pandemic
the work got grill lines when the pan's searing
give you the whole clip to let your mans hear it (oh)
them pallbearer next to them so they can all fear it (oh)
ulterior motives with the modus
bulletproof package like i'm potus
i'm just cashing in on what they owe us
they say the coming winter is the coldest
celine fur hangin' off the shoulder (woo)
what's worse, the gift or the curse? (hey)
the only way to celebrate a death is with a birth
that maybach sink can be converted to a hearse
i mean every word while you think it's just a verse (oh)
i'm gone

hey, good morning (woo)
hey, oh, good morning (woo)
yeah, ayy (good morning)
(hold on)

just as soon as the sun rise, the night dies
you was building pyramids and african empires
where pale-skin savages with straight hair and light eyes
was still eatin' raw meat and barely could light fires
before we ever sold cocaine, we civilized spain
you are not the first black man in the mediterrane'
shit, you lying to impress, you is just insane
i look at you with the disdain of an old shit stain
how you product of a god and you worship a man?
i was god in the flesh before i drove a mulsanne
five keys of gold sittin' on my neck in the frame
surrounded by black women, west african king
and i'm gonna go to ghana to reclaim my name
while these chump rappers rap about the shit they cop
man, i cop my block, and this shit don't stop
i'm the official, unofficial mayor of my city
learned my lesson from the crack trappin' school of high thoughts
push the d like pusha t and kept my mind black thought
michael render is the ender, what the fuck you thought?
michael render, he the ender, what the fuck you thought?
god

(haha)
ayo, it's the blues, i don't know if the crips even use it
something 'bout your whole album is crib-cleaning music

real drugs do real things
go to extremes, crash regimes and kill kings
in the last reprieve he still sings
how the task that the master needs reveals wings
and though he has to bleed, it still brings him heaven and hell
better believe the truth stings
tyin' his arm off with violin strings
his eyes and dreams diverted as the siren screams, eternal
over-dosage is a marketing scheme, that's just as dark as it seem when it's a part of your team
with the esteem of a savant, as smart as a genius
vanity carried the dope into the heart of a fiend
another destroyed life was meant to be more righteous in the face of this full-on opioid crisis
while the wolves pull the wool on and prey on vices
still the dogs with the hood on is way more frightenin'
for death, you're not ready
trust me, i'm deadly as the fentanyl that killed prince and tom petty
i would venture still into the trench and bomb heavy
every infidel will feel the strength of my medley
and so it begins as evil intends to start off slow, then graduate to needles and pins
you would have forsaken everybody, even your friends
and see where it ends, the visual's a reason to cringe
you watchin' this? he took a shot in the esophagus
he's in the zone and stoned like a sarcophagus
try stoppin' this, i'm on top of the metropolis
it's narcissist over narcotics anonymous
broken promises, broken jaws and dope whores
i separate the fact from the folklore
let's estimate the tracks that i spoke for
euphoria is the most that you could hope for
i ghost wrote for the greats and took the best out
a poker face from the estates, i had to stress out
but no complaints from me, a race that had to check-out
hey yo, i got a brand new bag for you to test out

yo, the shit crazy
this shit cra—

this shit crazy
two-fifteen

uh, i'm here seated at the helm
the black soundtrack to confusion is the film
i’m channelin' uncertainty and usin' it to tell the story of winnin' in life, then losin' it as well
the triumph was makaveli inspired
awaken a sleepin' giant, commander tariq ibn ziyad
fresh from the fire and into formal attire
that's from a foreign designer, i call the plug, supplier, but a high we got
try me not, that's the caveat
you'd probably get the same thing my last body got
poet laureate, swift chariot, the maserat'
the one to watch, born the year of the ox
i got more than a reason to revel like desus and mero
lyrical religious hero on jesus' level
the reason none of these heathens is even as thorough
we bare arms like idris or venus de milo
my blood is different than the blood that you bleed if it's yellow
i'm colder than paul robeson leadin' othello
i'm older than the barcode, it ain't easy to tell though
the rap john henry, they send me deep in the railroad
i'm heavy metal, the rock roller, the rebel without a pause
perspective is bipolar as ever, i gotta cross the bridge and then burnt it into ash
a reoccurin' dream and then turnt it into cash
the reoccurin' theme is the hurt lives in the past
but undeniable lessons i learned live in the stash
uh, the breadwinner, the dead center, the head-spinner
i heard life is a bitch, i went to bed wit' her
i once was told to know thy self
how can i grow myself, if i don't know myself?
the low-hangin' fruit for bottom feeders, no top-shelf
i chase demons for a lotta reasons, not just health
seated at the throne, summonin' the ghosts like a seance
i never take a day off work, it never pay off
i wish for more peace on this earth and never chaos
as long as classrooms gettin' sprayed with the ars
yeah

revelation of a blessin' in disguise
i looked hate in the face and read the message in his eyes
they clickbaited a nation and requested the response
and dictated the makings of another renaissance
but wait, the fate of it's what the government decides
and i don't mean the state, i mean this government of ours
the mark, ark of the covenant requires
frauds, i'm makin' a mockery of 'em with the bars alone
the population of the world has grown
and more people in the streets than live in gorgeous homes
a lotta heavy conflict zones, the swords are shown
i'm tryna study all the language on the georgia stones
to quote the classic joint, “what a fool believes”
and what the teachers of the school believes
is very different from what the thieves and the class in rule believes
i'm tryna give y'all some jewelries
we under pressure like a diamond mine
huntin' it somethin' like a phenomenon
and we losin' light like m. night shyamalan
them people searchin' for somethin' with body armor on
you never know who they wantin', that’s why we on the law
preparin' me, that isn’t necessary, what i'm haunted by is knowin' where the bodies are buried
yet, i'm taunted by the omen
knowin' my adversary, i'm gone to neveruary
it’s on, it’s gettin' heavy for real

we need each other, we have to have each other for our survival
from the revolutionaries to the conservatives, a black united front
(uh huh) is what we're about (yeah)

the makin' of the mob, the changin' of the guard
an angel from the lord in ceremonial garb
the big homie in charge, main culprit at large
emerged over the odds, the victory is ours
the talented mr. trotter, a midnight marauder
if there's blood in thе water, no stoppin' the top shotta
i drop bombs, multiple arms likе candelabras, on a mission
i'm chasing chicken like a chupacabra, nigga
salute your father, i'm headed back to wakanda
after the drama, rappers get medivac'ed to the trauma
to kill a lion separated from the pride
i rule zion, i am the most hated one alive
a gun was fired, another one expired
i represent the unwanted, undesired
wash my hands off it all, then raise one and testified
to lyrical manslaughter, i'm guilty but justified, nigga

i started running the streets when i was nine
when, when i started running around at nine
i knew what i was gonna do when i was ten

trust the vibe when it's the fly sinister
philly's certified finisher, the prime minister
in god's image the monument, the homage is to
the problem is acknowledgin' how to apply penance for the transgressions
that i've accepted in acquiescence of my own presence
as i inspected my loaded weapons (y'all just don't get it)
so stream it at your own discretion, every answered question
investment in your own protection
they be like: "black, well, who knew we'd be receivin' a new you
that's part zulu and farrakhan meets pharaoh khufu?"
misinterpret my level of genius and call it cuckoo
but the swahili meaning of freedom is still uhuru
to the booth guru, i deliver the truth to you
who got the nerve to act as if this isn't proof to you
that i will mobilize a militia then troop to you?
no tellin' what i got in the system to shoot through you
if it's too brutal, look the other way like i'm bribin' you
but surrender all your valuables as if i'm robbin' you
as i slide, the hassle to the side, like a tassel
the facade of the place i reside is like a castle
i'm the honorable pensée noir, my nom de guerre
i'm the czar, the peking-to-paris, is my kinda car
i'm the r, i'm the l, i'm the kane
all correlated, unadulterated power
the king been coronated, wake up
no masquerade, remove the make-up
it's no sleep, but my eyes refuse to stay shut
it's gatekeeper's responsible for this place
but historically, the authorities been morally bankrupt
enter the executioner, speaking of retribution
i will send shots to lucifer even to catch the future
me and the best producers out again, en route again
airborne audio spores, it's like an allergen, so
in conclusion, i wanna clear the confusion
any rumors the artist you're currently hearin' is human
the shapeshifter, weightlifter, i hate hitler
i'm the great victor behind the bars, state prisoner

don't even ask how the high feel
ask how do i feel, probably how the sky feel
jokers is coming in sideways like a sidefill
the grapes of wrath intertwined like a vine still
physically i'm ill, walking through a minefield
with a straw sticking out a molotov cocktail
twenty one grams of soul on a rock scale
probably burn like flaming coals on a hot grill
yo, if the afterlife is absolutely not real
then you diminish and you're finished, it's a done deal
beyond that, my heartbeat is like a drum still
it's like i'm living on the run with the gun still
well, bring the hero back, he's taking care of that
cause his words get at the ginsbergs and kerouacs
it's all stuck inside your head like it's ear wax
whole scene something out of hollywood, miramax
hush, yo, don't nobody say a flocking word
just put the sign on the door, the do not disturb
i'm bout to show these people how to kill a mockingbird
you hit his whole network, like mark zuckerberg
your witnesses confirm that gunshots occurred
apparently the triggerman smokes lots of herb
and he could bring your demise disguised as a word
but guarantee that be the last one you ever heard
you deaf, dumb, and blind
i'm emphasized like i'm underlined
my definition is, i'm undefined
cause i'm one of a kind, at the top of the line
at the top of the food chain when it come to the rhyme
and i'm cynical cause i'm at the pinnacle
jokers is ridiculous, they the ones i ridicule
if somebody acting like they want it, i'mma get at dude
have 'em in the middle of the drama like an interlude
yeah, they weigh a buck ten, soaking wet, fuck them
yo, i don't need new friends, i can't trust them
you best keep a weapon like a shirt tail, tucked in
because i'm taking niggas out like huck finn
this news just in: mass destruction, boy
presented to you by black inc. productions
yeah, righteous hustling, trife corruption
look how these ogs with the mics is muscling
i fight for justice, but minus the red cape
dollar short, year late, suckers is scared straight
they know i'm hotter than a box where the bread bake
and brought j. period to cut through the red tape

don't forget who i am, don't forget what i am
i am a black dude
and don't ever forget how i got here
my ancestors were kidnapped
i don't even know where the fuck i'm from
they were put on the bottom of boats
they sailed them across the atlantic
many of them died, only the strongest survived
and once they got here, they beat the humanity out of my people
they turned us into beasts of burdеns
they made us do their work, and thе irony is
hundreds of years later they're calling us lazy
we fought in the civil war, we damn near freed ourselves
now here we all are, 400-year nightmare
took us 400 years to figure out as a people
that white people's weakness the whole time
was kneeling during the national anthem.​

hahahaha, heh, heh, heh, aw shit
yo, give my regards to paris
i make 'em go bananas for the noble savage
steak 'em, let 'em have it, allow me to establish
the tone from a holdin' pattern above saturn
listen, they told me i was bound to lose
i had the crown to prove and fucked around and found the tools
coulda failed, but i'm more compelled, i torched the trails
of an orson welles, rock jewels big as oyster shells
to go from showman to shaman is not common
what's a goon to a goblin? what's a goblin to amen ra
when the god's been a problem? now get your fuckin' shine box
before i put your party in a pine box
remember we was broke as a promise
let's be honest, them hard times scattered behind us
yachting through the bahamas, 'bout to play st. thomas
cabernet sauvignon with fabergé egg omelets

uh, slide down
nigga gon' slide down fig' like
i parked the crooked 'cause the sig pokin', ayy
eye for an eye, gon' keep the tears rollin', yeah
i'm beethoven to the bass swollen, yeah
starin' in the mirror, i was god's bonus
yeah, i ain't ask for shit, i was chose for this
plot twist, one day if my gifts got the homies chillin'
grooviest, hood politics, the crips scholarships
gang foul, equal noose now, it ain't the same 'round
aw yeah, this lifestyle we livin', ayy
niggas turn to base heads from picture, ayy
and leaned into the crack, got out of business, huh
now blacks doin' coke, what's the difference now?
pigs turn my loc' to a witness now (shit, fuck, fuck)
the stakes raised, well done, salute, uh
this young loc done popped out the blue, uh
die young, i keep peace to shoot
we all knew this sixteen's the truth, yeah
blacked out and i find out the scoop, brrt, ayy, woo

uh
thanks for the memories
for 1st and 3rd of the month check deliveries
agencies in the early '80s for givin' cheese
to families with parents who had drug dependencies
masjids and storefront ministries
dinners from the chicken lady, miss genevieve
for every lesson i received as i live and breathe
and all the blessings i believed in and then achieved
thanks to my moms for never gettin' rid of me
and to my lady baby thank you for forgivin' me
i climbed from the lower level to the mezzanine
honestly, i really wanna say thanks for everything
images of strange fruits hangin' from the trees
laces on my gym shoes, skatin' from police
kids playin' on the stoops wearing dungarees
unbeknownst to them they livin' in the city under seige
two sierra leonians and a senegalese
honey and lemon teas, sincere sympathies
the power of positive energy as opposed
to hatred as a motivative, thank you to my enemies
from memphis, tennessee
and kitchen chemistry
atari centipede, heineken and hennessy
the barbershop that used to be at 6th and emily

i wanna thank you, thank you, thank you for givin' me
thank you for givin' me love
i wanna thank you, thank you, thank you for givin' me (yeah)
thank you for givin' me love

places that i've known
many of which i've outgrown, thanks for the ride home
some motherfuckas tried to make me give what's mine to 'em
thank goodness for my decent aim with one eye closed
gangsta and fly hoes, freaks and side shows
mistakes i've made in the past that only god knows
usually my preference would be to travel the high road
sometimes i strayed from the path, that's no surprise though
i had to use this expression of my gratitude
that my attitude didn't limit my latitude
in cases when i had to do, what i had to do
even though i was spazzin' boo, i wasn't mad at you
this unbroken token of appreciation
for frequencies and stations not keepin' the people waitin'
for players who supported, remainin' completely patient
and each and every record in the basement
listen, thank you

yeah, that shit hard

i said my cranium is vibranium, my brain is uranium and titanium
forty-fives, who aimin' 'em? organize the stadium
tell 'em, "take cover, i warned you not to play wit' 'em"
them borderline war crimes, you got away wit' 'em
who came to save the day and brought the k wit' 'em?
tariq the people's champ from the equal team
tryna keep it clean 'long as all my people solid deen
i've been in the music scene long as allen leeds
make they salaries, still accumulatin' calories
demonstratin' how to breathe, senegalese, genovese
i been a reason to freeze, reek g's in the league
on my own, gettin' cheese
i will hurt hercules, i will merc most mcs
i'm the last one to show up, the first one to leave the crime scene
the obscene, salam theme, the ridiculous rhyme scheme
the stick to the grind gene, the hell with the hygiene
it's a dirty bomb, word to seven thirty time
disaster level nine eleven meets the eleven nine
catastrophe beyond incredible, i redefine the seventh sign
faster, scarier, mass hysteria from damascus, syria
to middle america, school cafeterias and cul-de-sacs
i told you that the boss is back, know what i'm sayin'?

in these streets that i call home
unless you're blind, you'll see it all
in these streets it's cold at night
sirens screamin' by, gunshots all the time

yo, omertà code meets the hippocratic oath
observin' his whole circus from a diplomatic post
my word and his whole purpose, a cinematic scope
the earth and its whole surface, i consider that his toast
same as sammy davis, bellafonte, quincy jones
mahatma gandhi, james balwdin, jesse owens
runnin' from a cop car, me and akbar
i changed from a rock boy to a rock star
hijack the elevator to the top floor
i'm takin' everything that's left like a southpaw
crash and burn and learn through osmosis
and watch the word spread like tuberculosis
i took a snapshot but it hurt to post it
i had a black thought and they called it wokeness
overdoses, water bugs and roaches
forty cals and holsters, all halal and kosher
twenty thousand jokers, one ain't playin'
i'm claude brown, man-child in the promised land

in these streets that i call home
unless you're blind, you'll see it all
in these streets it's cold at night
sirens screamin' by, gunshots all the time

uh, la, uh huh, chi town, philadelphia, pa
hey now, uh, la, yeah, chi town, philadelphia, pa

listen, pick any city, the south side, the outside
it isn't pretty, the tots cryin’ and shots fired
protection there be the lopsided, cop kind
you see the scene of a crime like every stop sign
my section of twenty-one pound is downtown
they walkin' 'round wit’ the guns out, it's wild how
the youngings dumb proud, followin' the crowd now
leading the blind with they minds up in the soundcloud
ain't a lotta sunshine when you on a frontline
listenin' to that ghetto drumline, duckin' one-time
thinkin' how the devil doesn't tire, even sometimes
wonderin’ how the fuck could one’s rhyme be this unkind
everybody cold to me, seeming through this bullshit
the only thing that sold to me bein' told, we should hold on
gettin’ old to me i'm about to buckle
'cause holdin' tight got my hands fully white-knuckled
and to be honest, tomorrow is not promised
whether you on the streets of chicago or botswana
you gotta be rock solid, not to be outsmarted
the rise from rock-bottom to one of the top scholars
i never ask what’s the secret of success
with a target on your back and a scarlet on your chest
listen, just get it, not a minute to rest
this is not a test, settle for the best, nothin' less, dig it

pick any city, the south side, the drought side
where e-m-s has arrived, well, it's about time
people who just get they tops fried get outlined
minutes and seconds go clockwise but not mine

where i'm from it's a war scene
where more fiends scream for morphines, zoloft and thorazine
we don't subscribe to the grand scheme
the plans seems to be keepin' us all sick, sellin' them vaccines
ain't a lot of fun time when your only son dyin'
and the world's comin' untied from the inside
that's between affection and depression, it's a thin line
stress and pressure here is multiplied ten times
everything is blurred to me, lessons deferred for me
fam said it's been a long term since they heard from me
my lil' homie never made it out of surgery
sometimes i feel like south philly tryna murder me

first, everybody's upset 'cause you died
they like, "wait a minute, man
i ain't the ones who's dead, he's the one that's brown bread"
hah, so in comes the second lie, ya dig?

same story, same target, different time
cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
same story, same target, different time
cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
started out at like twelve
trapped in a belly of hell
grew into a man inside of a cell
yo, anger just swell up
at a early age that develop
hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
they said he's on a road to become a felon
but instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
he did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
started making noise but they tried to mute it
they put him through it
for him to make the system look stupid, 
they rather look you in the face and shoot it
and leave your spot looted 
or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
when you scream at it and do it
with sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid
don't understand the point that you at
or how the hell you came to it?
flashback to images of that night, out in patterson
they pulled him over heading home from a gathering
and when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

hurricane
accuse a hurricane
ain't change a damned shame
it's life for hurricane, hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could y'all stand the weather?
could you hold it together?
you tell me that you know the pain
yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could ya'll stand the weather?
you built for that weather?
yo, know what'm saying?
know what'm saying?

you gotta fight for what you believe in

nobody knows the troubles seen
this flick left me wondering
“what can become of kings and young kids?”
summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
a freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
the cops, y'all know what they be on
a nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
natural lifer, a soul he had to fight
learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising
developing his knack to write
never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
what he loved on the outside world, detached himself
you know the cards blacks get dealt by the system
he drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
this picture proved to be bigger than black and white
a young soul named lesra brought him back to life
it's amazing to a man what a book could do
and how certain books seem to look for you
this is the story of a champion's fall and rise
the story left me wiping my eyes
peace ru

hurricane
accuse a hurricane
ain't change a damned shame
it's life for hurricane, hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could y'all stand the weather?
could you hold it together?
you tell me that you know the pain
yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could ya'll stand the weather?
you built for that weather?
yo, know what'm saying?
know what'm saying?

yes, i am the inescapable, the irresistable
the unnegotiable, the unchallenged 
i am time
i scroll in measurements, control the elements
i hold the evidence, i tell the story 
i am time
i know no prejudice, i bare no sentiments
for wealth or settlement, i move forward 
i am time
you can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me
retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me
you can't do much for me besides serve
me well and have good dividends returned to you
or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
many have wasted me but now they are facing me
treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully
plaintively, i wait to see what history will shape to be
who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
angel's scribe the page for me
keep a full account of all the names for me
and make a special mark for hurricane who (?) patiently

hurricane
accuse a hurricane
ain't change a damned shame
it's life for hurricane, hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could y'all stand the weather?
could you hold it together?
you tell me that you know the pain
yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
forever, imagine your locked down forever
could ya'll stand the weather?
you built for that weather?
yo, know what'm saying?
know what'm saying?

the clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
god placed it in a man on the day he was born
convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
framed for manslaughter, the hurricane carter rising
from out the south water, like torrential rains
in the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
you can't believe the world we live in's injust
all i see is more proof, there's no place for us
they had my man carter locked in a cage, like an animal
drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
or works by remote control
it was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul
either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
there's no where to run, no where to hide
in a six-by-six a guilty man cries
for repentance and lost is what innocence is

same story, same target, different time
cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
same story, same target, different time
cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

hey, yo

i been pennin' the iliad and the odyssey
a premonition i really had, it was prophecy
back in the kitchen, now where we at it's monopoly
the mathematician i entered the system properly
this officially a philly jawn, once again it's on
i was born ringing alarms like tenor saw
my track record is what i ain't got a blemish on
unless i remember wrong
well, either way i'm 'bout to finish strong
redemption songs of a genghis khan
revenge is sworn later on, though the gang is called
you hit the nail on the head, bro, we don't bang wit'cha'll
your team different, we don't move with the same decorum
what i reflect is still a real feel temperature
symptoms show i'm physically ill and still emperor
track whisperer, carbon colored conquistador
kiss the jawns and make 'em cry, it's not difficult
whoa, a lot of rappers is rollin', in fear of trotter
they far from rock solid, they soldiers terracotta
of my philosophy, i'm the father like aristotle
i will put a end to your whole saga, you harry potters is soft
your rhymes e-m-o, mines is non-g-m-o
i'm a vessel, a vehicle, y'all don't see it though
i'm comin' for the riches you stole like king leopold
and keep the whole world on watch while history unfolds

hey, yo

welcome to america
where you can dream, as long as you can breathe
you can be the muh'fuckin' president of united states
and get murdered right on these streets
welcome to america

the sins of the father my pop gave me to suffer
the friends i would follow was crack babies and hustlers
it's steel sharpen steel in the block, made me a cutler
my pen is from the future like octavia butler (wеlcome to america, oh)
my grandmother suturеd a flag from bloody cotton
the fruits of her labor alas already rotten (welcome to america, yeah, ayy)
my man said, "yo, it's crazy how fast that we've forgotten
that we used to pull boxes and plows like we were oxen
and cows", without an option, and now it's this glorious
victorious, story only pitched
for me to shut it down, they sold some of us down the rivers
it's such a poor level of thought, i get the shivers
it's insidious and it's always been hideous
i had to tread water and run, be amphibious
they do you so dirty for one, yo, what's cleanliness?
they make you wanna let off a gun into the emptiness like

preach now, lover, preach now, lover
that we runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
welcome to america

yo, i'm ill-fated and hated, i'm hella melanated
blackness is my religion to that i'm dedicated (welcome to america)
i follow the laws of nature by which i'm regulated
the universe my university, i'm educated
this one is for my very revolutionaries
after keeping it a hundred even though the truth is heavy
who stand firmly and see their life is a journey
that either god or the gurney, my public defender burned me
so did the district attorney in a turbulent trial
they told me that time is master, well i'm serving it now
tell my family i'll be making my return in a while
and every symbol of oppression, i'll be burning it down

welcome to america (yeah)
where you can dream, as long as you can breathe (long as you breathe)
you can be the muh'fuckin' president of united states (that's right)
and get murdered right on these streets (doo, doo)
welcome to america
land of the brave (yeah) and home of the free (that's bullshit, man)
you can be a saint or a sinner or a billionaire (yeah)
or just stand on your feet
welcome to america (keep on runnin', runnin')
america, oh lord (keep on runnin', runnin')
welcome to america (keep on runnin', runnin')
america, oh yeah

'cause when it's over, the world ain't over (the world ain't over)
what they say is what we'll do (it's what we gon' do now)
we outpowered, still have power (still got power)
and that's what we cannot lose

runnin' in the shadows, got my eye on the sparrow
tomorrow may not come, at least my soul felt this love (uh)
if i let you go, at least my soul felt this love
hey now, hang now, hey now, hang now

now, a black soul never passes alone
if its blood spilled on the ancestor's ashes and bone
from a pure heart, the lord fashioned after his own
went packaged and flown to the essence of his african throne
for every lost body, crossed, tarred, feathered, and tossed
it's no way i could measure the course or ever exhaust
but whether it's yours or mine, this american cloth
has never been soft, while history was running its course
i ran hard from jamestown with slaves, found jesus
and foul demons that never be charged with malfeasance
i sat through they revival, though i never found credence
i found that we had never known shit about freedom
i've been charged with treason, i've been scarred and freezin'
i've been called a nigga and then called a heathen
when hounds found me, they couldn't even tell if i was breathin'
in america where on black men, it's open season

shit crazy

dark room with the cloak draped over the mic
colloquium light, the smoke from the opium pipe
silk road is a code so the only advice
to bring truth to the light, play this only at night
if it's over your life, it's not only a fight
my homie called it a plight and my homie was right
how to speak truth to power is refuse to cower and teach youth
the hour of reckonin' is upon us, there's enemies among us
essentially in more than recent memory, they hung us
public assembly to watch death become us
better believe it but if not, check the numbers
gramps told my father they sold his papa for gold and copper
even though he was the strongest cropper
now am i wrong if i teach my son to properly hold a choppa
and how to bring down a helicopter?
what's the concept? the industrial prison complex
for niggas in the projects with they eyes shut
that still walk around blind to the conquest
that haven't really realized what's the time yet
no due process, the price is no object
when sentences match the crime, they do not yet
it's been a war on the heavily melanated
for your own security, you better be educated, listen

and if you don't see what's happenin', you just can't see
