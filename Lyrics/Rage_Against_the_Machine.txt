with the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
of the power dons, that five-sided fistagon
the rotten sore on the face of mother earth gets bigger
the triggerâ€™s cold, empty your purse

rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

standin' with the fury that they had in '66
and like e-double "i'm mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
hoover, he was a body remover
i'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
to the rage built up inside of me
fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
movements come and movements go
leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
departments of police, (what!) the judges (what!), the feds
networks at work, keeping people calm
you know they went after king when he spoke out on vietnam
he turned the power to the have-nots
and then came the shot

yeah
yeah, back in this

with poetry my mind i flex
"flip" like wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
what do i got to, what do i got to do to wake you up?
to shake you up, to break the structure up?
'cause blood still flows in the gutter
i'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
set the groove, then stick and move like i was cassius
rep the "stutter step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
yeah, several federal men
who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
you better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
networks at work, keepin' people calm
ya know they murdered x and tried to blame it on islam
he turned the power to the have-nots
and then came the shot

what was the price on his head?

or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?

now check this out, uh

in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
so-called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
yo, we gotta take the power back
bam, here's the plan
motherfuck uncle sam, step back, i know who i am
raise up your ear, i'll drop the style and clear
it's the beats and the lyrics they fear
the rage is relentless
we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract
we gotta take the power back

yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on
we gotta take the power back

the present curriculum, i put my fist in 'em
eurocentric, every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white, and blue disguise
with lecture i puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
one-sided stories for years and years and years
i'm inferior? who's inferior?
yeah, we need to check the interior
of the system who cares about only one culture
and that, is why we gotta take the power back

yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on
we gotta take the power back
ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
break it, break it down, aw shit

uh

the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the student's eyes don't perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his composure is well kept
i guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit
and listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
europe ain't my rope to swing on
can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
'cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
we gotta take the power back

yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on
we gotta take the power back

no more lies

them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
the clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
we hungry but them belly full
the structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
in the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
the remains left chained to the powder war

can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
so make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse

a thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
fuck the g-ride, i want the machines that are makin' 'em
our target straight with a room full of armed pawns

but i'ma drop it at a higher level
'cause i'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
but i learned to burn that bridge and delete
those who compete at a level that's obsolete
instead, i warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
to recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
see through the news and the views that twist reality

same bodies buried hungry but with different last names
these vultures rob everything, leave nothing but chains
pick a point on the globe, yes, the picture's the same
there's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse
a mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
there's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame
a white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
and the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?

same bodies buried hungry (uh-huh), but with different last names (uh-huh)
them vultures robbin' everyone, leave nothing but chains
pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
there's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
there's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent
there's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
the numb black screen that be feelin' like home
and the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?

there's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
there's a country's soul that reads post no bills
there's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
there's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
there's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
there's a country's soul that reads post no bills
there's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill

silence, something about silence makes me sick
'cause silence can be violent sorta like a slit wrist
if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
but if ya bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
some speak the sounds but speak in silent voices
like radio is silent though it fills the air with noises
its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal
and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
yeah

and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
with a fistful of steel
('cause i know the power of the question)
with a fistful of steel
with a fistful of steel
(and i won't stop 'cause i know the power of the question)

it's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
if ya will it, i will spill it and ya out
just as quick as ya came
not a silent one, but a defiant one
never a normal one 'cause i'm the bastard son
with the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
but to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
groovin', playin' that game called survival
the status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
the silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
give you a glimpse of the reality i'm grippin'
steppin' into the jam and i'm slammin' like shaquille
mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
yeah

and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
with a fistful of steel
('cause i know the power of the question)
with a fistful of steel
with a fistful of steel
(and i won't stop 'cause i know the power of the question)
aw shit

(and i won't stop, 'cause i know the power of the question!)

and if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
but if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
yeah
come on

a .44 full of bullets
face full of pale
eyes full of empty
a stare full of nails
the roulette ball
rolls alone on the wheel
a mind full of fire
and a fistful of steel
and if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
but if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'

yeah
with a fistful of steel, uh
come on
uh, with a fistful of steel
uh

the main attraction, distraction
got ya number than number than numb
empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
what ya need is what they selling
make you think that buying is rebelling
from the theaters to malls on every shore
the thin line between entertainment and war
the frontline is everywhere
there be no shelter here
spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
memories erased, burned and scarred
trade in ya history for a vcr
cinema, simulated life, ill drama
fourth reich culture, americana
chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
the thin line between entertainment and war

there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)

hospitals not profit full
the market bulls got pockets full
to advertise some hip disguise
view the world from american eyes
the poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
the thin line between entertainment and war
they fix the need, develop the taste
buy their products or get laid to waste
coca-cola is back in the veins of saigon
and rambo too, he's got a dope pair of nikes on
godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
to keep ya eyes off the real killer
cinema, simulated life, ill drama
fourth reich culture, americana
chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
the thin line between entertainment and war

there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)

american eyes, american eyes
view the world from american eyes
bury the past, rob us blind
and leave nothing behind
american eyes, american eyes
view the world from american eyes
bury the past, rob us blind
and leave nothing behind

just stare
just stare

a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
a world of violent rage but it's one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes, i dwell in hell, but it's a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain in an existence mundane
i got a nine, a sign, a set, and now i got a name

read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
death is on my side
suicide

a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
a world of violent rage but it's one that i can recognize

yes, i dwell in hell, but it's a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain in an existence mundane
i got a nine, a sign, a set, and now i got a name

read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
caught between my culture and the system
genocide
read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
if ignorance is bliss
then knock the smile off my face
yeah


if we don't take action now
we'll settle for nothing later

rebel, rebel and yell
'cause our people still dwell in hell
locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
mad is the story i tell
how long can we wait?
come on, seein' what's at stake
action for reaction
if your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
this is a stick up
our freedom, or your life
lord, i wish i could be peaceful
but there can be no sequel
now freedom must be fundamental
in johannesburg, or south central
on the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
to kick in the township rebellion
yeah, what about that, sucka?

yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
that fill your mind
thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
yes, i'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
raise my fist and resist!
asleep though we stand in the midst of the war
gotta get mine, gotta get more
keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'cause what does it offer me?
i think often it's nothin' but a coffin
gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
from here to the cape of no hope
now freedom must be fundamental
in johannesburg, or south central
on the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
to kick in the township rebellion

my fears hunt me down
capturing my memories
the frontier of loss
they try to escape across the street where
jesus stripped bare
and raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture
in the name of my
in the name of my

born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man

like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
an empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
his thoughts like a hundred moths
trapped in a lampshade
somewhere within
their wings banging and burning
on through endless night
forever awake he lies shaking and starving
praying for someone to turn off the light

born of a broken man, never a broken man
born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
born of a broken man, but not a broken man

my fear is hunting me down
capturing my memories
the frontier of loss
they try to escape across the street where
jesus stripped bare
and raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture
in the name of my
in the name of my

born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
