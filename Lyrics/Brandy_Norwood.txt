but, you can't get to heaven half off the ground
everybody knows, almost doesn't count

i can't keep on loving you one foot outside the door
i hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
can't keep on tryin' if you're looking for more
than all that i could give you, than what you came here for

gonna find me somebody not afraid to let go
want a no doubt, be there kind of man - you came real close
but every time you built me up, you only let me down

maybe you'll be sorry, maybe you'll be cold
maybe you'll come running back, babe, from the cruel, cruel world
almost convinced me you're gonna stick around
but everybody knows (everybody knows), almost doesn't count

so maybe i'll be here, maybe i'll see you around
that's the way it goes, almost doesn't count

an angel has always been thought
to be one of god's most precious works
i guess that's how she had you fooled
because she was an angel in disguise
hurt and pain could never come from her
so you left me only to find that
hurt and pain involves her
but now you see your mistakes
and now you see your angel was a fake
but my love was never misplaced
see, baby, my love is true
and most importantly, still, i love you
(still, i love you)

an angel in disguise she was
but somehow you fell for her
and though she broke your heart that day
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you
an angel in disguise she was
but somehow you fell for her
and though she broke your heart that day
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you

i found it quite strange
the way you said her name
and when you look in her eyes
i see the lust you can't deny
it's more to this than what you said
'cause in your sleep, you called her name
you say she's just a friend
i knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh

an angel in disguise she was (yeah, yeah, yeah)
but somehow you fell for her (you fell for her)
and though she broke your heart that day (she broke your heart)
and left you in the rain (yeah)
but still, i love you (oh, i love you, baby)
an angel in disguise she was (oh, i'm with you, baby)
but somehow you fell for her (i'm ready for you, baby)
and though she broke your heart that day (and left you in the rain)
and left you in the rain (yeah)
but still, i love you

she seemed so familiar the day that i met her
who was she foolin'?
i had a clue of what she was doin'
thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
i fell in her game, and i'm so lost
please stop the rain, oh-ooh

an angel in disguise she was (oh, you hurt me, babe)
but somehow you fell for her (yeah, but i'm still here)
and though she broke your heart that day (still lovin' you)
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you (oh, i might be crazy, babe)
an angel in disguise she was (but i love you, babe)
but somehow you fell for her (somehow you fell)
and though she broke your heart that day (she left you in the rain)
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you

and when my music stops
and when my tears dry
and when the rain ends
my heart will beat again
and when my music stops
and when my tears dry
and when the rain ends
my heart will beat again (ooh baby, oh, darlin')

an angel in disguise she was (i know it hurts)
but somehow you fell for her (oh-ooh)
and though she broke your heart that day (broke your heart, oh)
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you (i love you)
an angel in disguise she was
but somehow you fell for her (somehow you fell for her)
and though she broke your heart that day (she left you in the rain)
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you

i love you
i will never do the things she did
take your heart and run away with it, no, no
'cause i really, really love you (still, i love you)
an angel in disguise she was

and though she broke your heart that day
and left you in the rain
but still, i love you

you, and your mans, and them just took over the floor
started doing your thing
and it made me notice you even more
the way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though
you must've somehow felt me staring on the low
something tells me you're the kind of guy i'd like to get to know

i ain't even gonna front
i ain't even gonna lie
since you walked up in the club
i've been giving you the eye
we can dance if you want
get it crackin' if you like

feel like one of those nights

why is this the first time that i'm seeing you around?
could you be visiting, or are you new in town?
yeah, whatever the case
i'm feeling you right here and right now
your smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you

after one conversation, this must be right

i ain't even gonna front (even gonna front)
i ain't even gonna lie (ooh, baby)

i went from helly hansen to mini mansions
the girls in aruba doing belly dancin'
spent half of my advance on jars from branson
to make it through my circumstances
but you know i'm wiser now

got a butter soft leather just to hide my pound
got a house in the valley, come and find me now
got enough dough to buy the town
so i might give a six to my chick
benz to my mom
crib so big, it look like the center gone
give her a couch just to spill henney on
and been a don since lotto's and benneton

some people say that i am not the same girl
they say i think that i am in my own world
what makes them think that i have changed, yeah
a little dough cannot erase my problems

a fairy tale and everything is so right
i wish that you could know the truth, yeah
my life is real, so please don't get it twisted
problems the same and gotta be dealt with
these are the things i wish you knew, ooh-oh

always in someone's eye, so many questions why
how is it to be down with me, with me
afraid to express myself, always me and someone else (i need)
i need to be free, but it's not that easy

i'm just tryna be me
doing what i gotta do
some people think that i'm
just sittin' on top of the world (sittin', sittin' on top of the world)

some people think that i'm (that i'm)
just sittin' on top of the world (sittin' on top of the world)
sittin' on top of the world

don't understand why (don't understand why)
people think i don't have friends (who knew me back when)
this was my dream (this was my dream, no, no, no)
but nothing has changed
i still do the same things

yo, we can cut the talking short
if it ain't about cake
i ain't sittin on top, i want a house on the lake
i'm that snotty nosed cat wit a new bm
if you mess wit brandy, i got to bruise your chin
i be with puff, the girls be like, "who's his friend?"
if i hit a chick once, she probably move me in
so you gotta tell me right now
either you wit the cats who make the hits
or the one that see the chips
(slow down ma$e, you're killing 'em)
but don't stop it
what's the use of buying weight
if i'mma have to chop it?
i used a leather lady till i learned her logic
she only mess wit ma$e, no the money ain't no object
if it ain't cris, he won't pop it
if it ain't platinum wit' ice, he won't rock it
if it don't cost 60, he don't drop it
if it don't come with tv's, he don't cop it
you can stop it

i'm just tryna be me
doing what i gotta do
some people think that i'm
(think that i'm just sittin' on top of the world)
just sittin' on top of the world
i'm just tryna be me
proving what i've gotta prove (proving what i've gotta prove)
