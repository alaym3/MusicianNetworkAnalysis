this is dj ez dicc
on the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick

when i met you last night, baby
before you opened up your gap
i had respect for you, lady
but now, i take it all back
'cause you gave me all your pussy
and you even licked my balls
leave your number on the cabinet
and i promise, baby, i'll give you a call
next time i'm feelin' kinda horny
you can come on over
and i'll break you off
and if you can't fuck that day, baby
just lay back and open your mouth
'cause i have never met a girl
that i love in the whole wide world

i'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
i gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me

it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
with a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
hoes recognize, niggas do too
'cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
what you gon' do? you really don't know
so i'd advise you not to trust that ho
silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
knowin' damn well i'm too caught up with my grip
now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
how many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named snoop?
doggy, i'm all the above
i'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
but see, it ain't no fun
if my homies can't get a taste of it
'cause you know i don't love 'em

woo! hey, now you know
inhale, exhale with my flow
one for the money, two for the bitches
three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
in my chevy, '64—red, to be exact
with bitches on my side and bitches on my back
so back up, bitch, because i'm strugglin'
just get on your knees and then start jugglin'
these motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
it's me, warren g, the nigga with the clout

it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

so listen close, to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day
i woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a stretch, up, a morning yawn, and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said "um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
who is the top dog of them all?"
there was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, "you are, you conceited bastard!"
well that's true! that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put some bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean, dry, was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks, with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
i went back in, "i forgot my indo!"
then i dilly (dally) i ran through a (alley)
i bumped into this smoker named (sally) from the (valley)
this was a girl playing hard to get
so i said "what's wrong?" cause she looked upset
she said um:

it's all because of you, i'm feeling sad and blue
you went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
i love you so, how much you'll never know
cause you took your dope away from me

damn, now what was i to do?
she's crying over me and she was feelin blue
i said, "um, don't cry, dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys"
her mean mother steps then says to me "hi!"
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong, the kids was gone
something was wrong i said, "what was goin on?"
i tried to break it up, i said, "stop it, just leave her!"
she said, "if i can't smoke none, she can't either!"
she grabbed me closely by my socks
and so i broke the hell out, and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
they started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
and saying "why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy, doggy, doggy, can't you see?
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg, your love is here to stay"
and on and on and on she kept goin'
the bitch been around before my mother's born!
i said "cheer up!" and i gave her a hit
i said, "you can't have me, i'm too young for you bitch!"
she said, "no you're not!" then she starts cryin'
i says i'm 19, she says, "stop lyin!"
i says, "i am, go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover"

6 feet deep in, fucking with the pound is

suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide

the cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
now you in the midst of the dogg pound crew
ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do

'cause i drops bombs like platoon
walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
i'll take you on a journey, and i promise i won't leave you
i won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
and when you do, that's when the mission
or survival becomes your every thought
keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
half stepping with your weapon on safety
now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
take this 211 to another level
i come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
now roam through the depths of hell
where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well

suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide

deep, deep like the mind of minolta
now picture this
let's picnic inside a morgue
not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets!
and i got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates
open and release them guts
then i release def cuts
brutal, jagged edged, totally rough-neck!
now everybody scream, 'nough respect to the x
'nough respect given
disrespect and you will not be living
word to momma, emma, drama, dilemma
