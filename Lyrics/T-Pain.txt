whoever thought a young'un' from a city full of rattlesnakes
was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
seven heels had me looking for a better deal
a hood nigga; i couldn't count on the nasdaq
coming home from school, i had tears in my eyes
they was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
now, i got enough hats to give away
it's better days, i refuse to have flashbacks
nobody thought i knew what i was doing
nobody believed, so nobody would walk me through it
but nobody achieved what i achieved
if only somebody could have just seen what i seen
said they praying for me, don't we all got needs?
'til i walk in the room, and they all just freeze
and they all look relieved, like, "shit
if faheem made it, now, we all got cheese"
nah, homie, that ain't the way it work
especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
now, they going crazy 'cause i made it first
see, homie, i just made it work
it's a cold world, ask my old girl
she feel my pain, and i ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
and my daddy proud of me
but he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
got that keyboard off the road, brought in the house for me
he coming to my shows, hanging in the crowd for me
man, i still love my niggas
the only thing that i ask is that they hold it down for me
i still rep the 850, yeah
i got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
but motherfuckers will say that you changed
and they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
don't get me wrong, i ain't saying i stayed the same
but i guarantee that i will never succumb to the fame
that's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
but i'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
life goes on and hopefully only great things
traveling the world and seeing shit that i ain't seen
then, one day, i look at my reflection
and realize how i been actin' and how i been dressing
i realize i can make an impression
but good lord, this is fuckin' depressin'
and good lord, i got some fuckin' questions
i think it's time for some motherfucking confessions
wake up call, wake up call
my answer to every question was "fuck y'all"
all i need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
i just need to find a seven with enough flaws
my last album ain't do numbers like i wanted to
but that was god tryna ask me what i'm gonna do
he said "i hate to put obstacles right in front of you
but you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"
hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
til' molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
now i'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
that liqour go to hittin', i'm in here reminiscing
how many niggas told me i was gonna fail?
'cause i got a list of niggas that can go to hell
they feel like i owe 'em something 'cause they know me well
calling me a sellout cause i won't come back and smoke a l
the same nigga that told me i had a hit
charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
'cause the whole time they knew that i was livin' out my whip
but now i see 'em, and i can't even take iit
cause he walk up to me and say:
"boy, i knew you was gon' make it"
and like, "motherfucker, do you not just recall?
i needed help, and you just left me sittin' on my balls"
that just wasn't the right life
so i told him bullshit, to have a nice life
and all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
like nigga, how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
fuck you bitches, i did what i did
now, i'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
but now, maybe my life is too sweet
like i woke up in that bugatti and went right back to sleep
deep, i was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
like crabs up in the bucket, but y'all just got defeated
and all these bitches, all just want my semen
the star collecting checks and ball up in the season
but ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
now, they got they hand out, asking me to give it up
and every time they ask me for something
they say, "now, you know that i ain't never asked you for nothin'"
i got loss, i got loss
credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
drinking every kind of liquor, then that molly got swallowed
i know i fucked up 'cause i'm a grown man
so now, i'm thinking like my old man
he said "you wanna make god laugh?
then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"
now, i see my niggas just want me to win
but i won't have 'em if i keep disrespecting my friends
they been through it, say they know the feel
so all i need is a trip up to stoicville

yay-ee
yeah, yeah
whoa-ooh-ooh
