el-shaddai, el-shaddai, el-elyon na adonai
age to age you're still the same
by the power of the name
el-shaddai, el-shaddai, erkahmka na adonai
we will praise and lift you high, el-shaddai

through your love and through the ram
you saved the son of abraham
through the power of your hand
turned the sea into dry land
to the outcast on her knees
you were the god who really sees
and by your might
you set your children free

el-shaddai, el-shaddai, el-elyon na adonai
age to age you're still the same
by the power of the name
el-shaddai, el-shaddai, erkahmka na adonai
we will praise and lift you high, el-shaddai

through the years you made it clear
that the time of christ was near
though the people couldn't see
what messiah ought to be
though your word contained the plan
they just would not understand
your most awesome work was done
through the frailty of your son
el-shaddai, el-shaddai, el-elyon na adonai
age to age you're still the same
by the power of the name
el-shaddai, el-shaddai, erkahmka na adonai
i will praise you till i die, el-shaddai

el-shaddai, el-shaddai, el-elyon na adonai
age to age you're still the same
by the power of the name
el-shaddai, el-shaddai, erkahmka na adonai
i will praise you till i die, el-shaddai 

hush now, my baby
be still love, don't cry
sleep as you're rocked by the stream
sleep and remember my last lullaby
so i'll be with you when you dream
drift on a river
that flows through my arms
drift as i'm singing to you
i see you smiling
so peaceful and calm
and holding you, i'm smiling, too
here in my arms
safe from all harm
holding you, i'm smiling, too
hush now, my baby
be still, love, don't cry
sleep as you're rocked by the stream
sleep and remember this river lullaby
and i'll be with you when you dream
here in my arms
safe from all harm
holding you, i'm smiling, too
i'll be with you when you dream 

i have traveled many moonless nights
cold and weary with a babe inside
and i wonder what i've done
holy father, you have come
and chosen me now to carry your son

i am waiting in a silent prayer
i am frightened by the load i bear
in a world as cold as stone
must i walk this path alone?
be with me now, be with me now

breath of heaven, hold me together
be forever near me, breath of heaven
breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
pour over me your holiness for you are holy
breath of heaven

do you wonder as you watch my face
if a wiser one should have had my place?
but i offer all i am
for the mercy of your plan
help me be strong, help me be, help me
breath of heaven, hold me together
be forever near me, breath of heaven
breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
pour over me your holiness for you are holy

breath of heaven, hold me together
be forever near me, breath of heaven
breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
pour over me your holiness for you are holy
breath of heaven, breath of heaven
breath of heaven 

my jesus, i love thee, i know thou art mine;
for thee all the follies of sin i resign
my gracious redeemer, my savior art thou;
if ever i loved thee, my jesus, 'tis now
i love thee because thou has first loved me
and purchased my pardon on calvary's tree
i love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
if ever i loved thee, my jesus, 'tis now
in mansions of glory and endless delight
i'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;
i'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
if ever i loved thee, my jesus, 'tis now 

shoulder to the wheel
for someone else's selfish gain
here there is no choosing
working the clay
wearing their anger like a ball and chain

fire in the field
underneath the blazing sun
but soon the sun was faded
and freedom was a song
i heard them singing when the day was done
singing to the holy one

lead me on, lead me on
to a place where the river runs
into your keeping, oh
lead me on, lead me on
the awaited deliverance
comforts the seeking, lead on

waiting for the train
labeled with a golden star
heavy hearted boarding
whispers in the dark
"where are we going--is it very far?"
bitter cold terrain
echoes of a slamming door
chambers made for sleeping forever
voices like thunder in a mighty roar
cryin' to the lord

lead me on, lead me on
to a place where the river runs
into your keeping, oh
lead me on, lead me on
the awaited deliverance
comforts the seeking, lead on

man hurts man
time and time, time again
and we drown in the wake of our power
somebody tell me why

lead me on, lead me on
to a place where the river runs
into your keeping, oh
lead me on, lead me on
the awaited deliverance
comforts the seeking, lead on
lead me on, lead me on
to a place where the river runs
into your keeping, oh
lead me on, lead me on
the awaited deliverance
comforts the seeking, oh, lead on

(lead me on)
lean on me
lead on, lead on
(lead me on)
it's the comfort i'm seeking
(lead me on) 

i may not be every mother's dream for her little girl
and my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world
but that's all right, as long as i can have one wish i pray
when people look inside my life, i want to hear them say
she's got her father's eyes
her father's eyes
eyes that find the good in things
when good is not around
eyes that find the source of help
when help just can't be found
eyes full of compassion
seeing every pain
knowing what you're going through
and feeling it the same
just like my father's eyes
my father's eyes
my father's eyes
just like my father's eyes
and on that day when we will pay
for all the deeds we have done
good and bad they'll all be had
to see by everyone
and when you're called to stand and tell
just what you saw in me
more than anything i know
i want your words to be
she had her father's eyes
her father's eyes
eyes that found the good in things
when good was not around
eyes that found the source of help
when help would not be found
eyes full of compassion
seeing every pain
knowing what you're going through
and feeling it the same
just like my father's eyes
my father's eyes
my father's eyes
just like my father's eyes
my father's eyes
my father's eyes
just like my father's eyes

we're marching to zion
beautiful, beautiful zion;

the thoughts of such amazing bliss

to fairer worlds on high

sometimes we make it harder than it is
we'll take a perfect night
and fill it up with words we don't mean
dark sides best unseen
and we wonder why we're feeling this way

sometimes i wonder if we really feel the same
why we can be unkind
questioning the strongest of hearts
that's when we must start
believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

that's what love is for
to help us through it
that's what love is for
nothing else can do it
melt our defenses
bring us back to our senses
give us strength to try once more
baby, that's what love is for

sometimes i see you
and you don't know i am there
and i'm washed away
by emotions i hold deep down inside
getting stronger with time
it's living through the fire
and holding on we find
that's what love is for
to help us through it
that's what love is for
nothing else can do it
melt our defenses
bring us back to our senses
give us strength to try once more
baby, that's what love is for

believing in the one thing
that has gotten us this far

that's what love is for
to help us through it
that's what love is for
nothing else can do it
round off the edges
talk us down from the ledges
give us strength to try once more
baby, that's what love is for
that's what love is for
that's what love is for
melt our defenses
bring us back to our senses
give us strength to try once more
baby, that's what love is for
that's what love is for
that's what love is for
that's what love is for 

if you see the moon
rising gently on your fields
if the wind blows softly on your face
if the sunset lingers
while cathedral bells peal
and the moon has risen to her place
you can thank the father
for the things that he has done
and thank him for the things he's yet to do
and if you find a love that's tender
if you find someone who's true
then thank the lord --
he's been doubly good to you
if you look in the mirror
at the end of a hard day
and you know in your heart you have not lied
and if you gave love freely
if you earned an honest wage
and if you've got jesus by your side
you can thank the father
for the things that he has done
and thank him for the things he's yet to do
and if you find a love that's tender
if you find someone who's true
thank the lord --
he's been doubly good to you
you can thank the father
for the things that he has done
and thank him for the things he's yet to do
and if you find a love that's tender
if you find someone who's true
thank the lord --
he's been doubly good to you....
thank the lord --
he's been doubly good to you 

it's a cold, cold world
that we walk in through
lay down the burden of your heart
but it's warm as toast
walking two by two
lay down the burden of your heart
lay down the burden of your heart
i know you'll never miss it
show your daddy where it hurts
and let your daddy lift it
it's a fine, fine line
betwixt love and hate
why, it's tough to tell the two apart
but you know it's love
that he offers you
lay down the burden of your heart
lay down the burden of your heart
i know you'll never miss it
ohh-ohh, show your daddy where it hurts
and let your daddy lift it

god loves a lullaby
in a mother's tears in the dead of night
better than a hallelujah sometimes

god loves the drunkard's cry
the soldier's plea not to let him die
better than a hallelujah sometimes
we pour out our miseries
god just hears a melody
beautiful, the mess we are
the honest cries of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah
the woman holding on for life
the dying man giving up the fight
are better than a hallelujah sometimes

the tears of shame for what's been done
the silence when the words won't come
are better than a hallelujah sometimes
we pour out our miseries
god just hears a melody
beautiful, the mess we are
the honest cries of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah
better than a church bell ringing
better than a choir singing out, singing out
we pour out our miseries
god just hears a melody
beautiful, the mess we are
the honest cries of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah

we pour out our miseries
god just hears a melody
beautiful, the mess we are
the honest cries of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah
better than a hallelujah sometimes
better than a hallelujah
better than a hallelujah sometimes

this is my father's world, and to my listening ears
all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres
this is my father's world, the birds their carols raise
the morning light, the lily white, declare their maker's praise
this is my father's world: i rest me in the thought
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
his hand the wonders wrought
this is my father's world. o let me ne'er forget
that though the wrong seems oft so strong, god is the ruler yet
this is my father's world: why should my heart be sad?
the lord is king; let the heavens ring!
god reigns; let the earth be glad!
this is my father's world: he shines in all that's fair;
in the rustling grass i hear him pass;
he speaks to me everywhere
in the rustling grass i hear him pass;
he speaks to me everywhere 

i see her as a little girl hiding in her room
she takes another bath and she sprays her momma's perfume
to try to wipe away the scent he left behind
but it haunts her mind

you see she's his little rag, nothing more than just a waif
and he's mopping up his need, she is tired and afraid
maybe she'll find a way through these awful years to disappear

ask me if i think there's a god up in the heavens
where did he go in the middle of her shame?
ask me if i think there's a god up in the heavens
i see no mercy and no one down here's naming names
nobody's naming names

now she's looking in the mirror at a lovely woman face
no more frightened little girl, like she's gone without a trace
still she leaves the light burning in the hall
it's hard to sleep at all

still she crawls up in her bed acting quiet as a mouse
deep inside she's listening for a creaking in the house
but noone's left to harm her, she's finally safe and sound
there's a peace she's found
ask her how she knows there's a god up in the heavens
where did he go in the middle of her shame?
ask her how she knows there's a god up in the heavens
she said his mercy is bringing her life again
ask me how i know there's a god up in the heavens
(how do you know?)
where did he go in the middle of her shame
(where did he go?)
ask me how i know there's a god up in the heavens
(how do you know?)
she said his mercy is bringing her life again
she's coming to life again

he's in the middle of her pain
in the middle of her shame
mercy brings life
he's in the middle
mercy in the middle

so ask me how i know
ask me how i know, yeah
ask me how i know there's a god up in the heaven
(how do you know?)
ask me how i know there's a god up in the heavens
(how do you know?)
yeah, ask me how i know
(how do you know?)
ask me
ask me
ask me how i know
(how do you know?)
there's a god up in the heavens
ask me how i know there's a god up in the heavens
