‘cause they live for some moments, and i live for a livin'
but this for the girls who barely let me get to first base

no matter how far ahead i get, i always feel behind in my mind
but fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
i said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
i grew up to em, b.i.g., and pac, bitch, and got ruined
so until i got the same crib b.i.g. had in that "juicy" vid
bitch, i can't motherfuckin' stop movin'

from the city where every month is may-day at home, spray your dome
niggas get sprayed up like a.k. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
yeah, i know that shit ain't fair
they say detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
you write your name with a sharpie, i write mine in stone
i knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
we on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
rep detroit, everybody, detroit vers' everybody
i'm so fuckin' first class i could spit up on every pilot
the city's my metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
and i'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
i'm one of the hottest because i flame drop
drop fire, and not because i'm namedroppin', hall of fame droppin'
and i ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're ogs
‘cause that ain't the way of a og
so i g-o collect mo' gs, every dollar
never changed though, i'm just the new version of old me
forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
clique so deep we take up the whole street
i need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
sean don

miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize

so many bombs, ring the alarm, like vietnam on this shit
so many bombs, make farrakhan think that saddam in this bitch
one at a time, i line them up
and bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
i'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
i'm important like the pope, i'm a muslim on pork
i'm makaveli's offspring, i'm the king of new york
king of the coast; one hand, i juggle 'em both
the juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
cartier bracelets for my women friends, i'm in vegas
who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
if phil jackson came back, still no coachin' me
i'm uncoachable, i'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
fuck y'all pictures! your instagram can gobble these nuts!
gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie kurupt
this the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(west, west, west, west, west, west)
i've seen niggas transform like villain decepticons
mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' lindsay lohan
a bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
playin' with barbies
wreck the porsche before you give them the car key
judgement to the monarchy, blessings to paul mccartney
you called me a black beatle, i'm either that or a marley
i don't smoke crack, motherfucker, i sell it!
i'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of elvis
i'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
you can't stomach me? you plan on stumpin' me?
bitch, i’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
bitch, i put one on yours, i'm sean connery
james bonding with none of you niggas
climbin' 100 mil in front of me
and i'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
and if you're in it, better run for pete's sake
i heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'bout who's the best mc: kendrick, jigga, and nas
eminem, andré 3000; the rest of y'all
new niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
and i ain't rockin' no more designer shit
white t’s and nike cortez, this red corvette's anonymous
i'm usually homeboys with the same niggas i'm rhymin' with
but this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
and that goes for jermaine cole, big k.r.i.t., wale
pusha t, meek millz, a$ap rocky, drake
big sean, jay electron', tyler, mac miller
i got love for you all, but i'm tryna murder you niggas
tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
they don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
what is competition? i'm tryna raise the bar high
who tryna jump and get it? you're better off tryna skydive
out the exit window of five g5's with five grand
with your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
with the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
bumpin' pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
that your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
west coast

you could check my name on the books
i earth wind & fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
the legend of dorothy flowers proclaimed from the roof
the tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
we live by every single word she ever told us
watch over your shoulders
and keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
the lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
put your trust in the lord, but tether your chevy nova
i’m spittin' this shit for closure
and god is my witness, so you could get it from hova
to all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
i’m solid as a rock, ‘cause i came from a rock
that’s why i came with the rock
then signed my name on the roc
draw a line around some earth, then put my name on the plot
‘cause i endured a lot of pain for everythang that i got
the eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
and the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
you go from blind sight to hindsight
passion of the christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
it take time to get your mind right
jay electricity, pbs mysteries
in a lofty place tanglin' with satan over history
you can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
it’s strictly by faith that we made it this far

on my way to sacramento, late night; arsenio
i'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
barely harley, i'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
i bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
i'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the statue of liberty
rest in pimp, pimp c, underground king of the south
i raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth

i guess drama makes for the best content
everything got a bad side, even a conscience
now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
feel me when you get a fine bitch
just don't forget to read the fine print
life got me meditatin' like i'm in the himalayas

this is that late night working after three, man

always down for the cause, never down for the count
i guess when your stars align
you do like the solar system and plan it out
so i'm going over time, on the overtime
yeah, i'm that invested, but you can't attest it
million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
the family never going anorexic
i pay my own mortgage and electric
never going under even with anesthetics
at the top of the rap game and progressin'
check after check, checking off my check list
try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
no mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
shit feel like shaq and penny got back together
you tore the game apart, who put it back together? i

i'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know i
i haven't had a good time in a long time, you know i

but last night i feel like probably ended all that
'cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
then another one tryna take it all back
saying "fuck you," "i miss you," or "i hate you so much"
'cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
i know, i know, i know
the highs, the lows it comes, it goes
you say "be real," i try, i don't
'cause you take anything and just make it everything (god)
kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?

thought i had the midas touch, and then i went platinum too
motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em!)
i've been talkin' to god like that's my therapist
i'm african-american in america, i ain't inherit shit
but a millionaire under 30 so he must be hearin' shit
don, don, don life, i do this for the crib, the d to flint
kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
from where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
only deals i had was from the sam's club
now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what i came for
born in a world goin' where they told me i can't go
in my lane though, i'm in the same boat as usain bolt
get ahead by any means so the head's what i aim for
when my grandma died i realized i got an angel
show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
look, i am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
that's my new lifetime policy
woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
how many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
the pictures we been paintin'? my nigga
connected to a higher power—how i know?
'cause i don't write this shit: i think it, my nigga
look, all i ever did was beat the odds
'cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
never stoppin' like we hypnotized
watch what we visualize on the rise

no taste buds, ho, later!
fuck you lookin' at, hater?
i saw them eyes like an ass raper
try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
i'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
when you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
so ahead of my time, "late" means i'm early
my age is reversing, i'm basically thirty
amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
they blame me for murdering jamie lee curtis
said i put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
a piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
it may be disturbing, what i'm saying's cringeworthy
but i'm urinating on fergie, call shady number 81
surely i'm turning into the aaron hernandez of rap
state of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
brady's returning, matter of fact i may be deserving
of a pat on the back like a patriots jersey
inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
like a fuckin' terrier hid in it
despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
like a missile, a thunder cloud
hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
and you'll get a round like digital underground
and fuck ann coulter with a klan poster
with a lamp post, door handle, shutter

i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all, just remember one thing
remember one thing, that one man could change the world
that one man could change the world

all i, all i wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that i had it
back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
but it's hard makin' those attachments
i'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
you know? my - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
outside the crib like it was trash day
no kim k, but he bagged yay (ye)
but when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
with all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
success is on the way, i feel it in the distance
used to look up at the stars
and be like, "ain't too much that's different"
i be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
what you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

and i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all, just remember one thing
remember one thing, one man could change the world
one man could change the world

my grandma told me, "if you write your name in stone
you'll never get the white-out"
i grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
standin' next to jim carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
i said you not the only one i know got rich wearin' masks
where i'm from, i swear they broke
they need way more than the cast
we need more than what you have
and then we need more than that
but how am i supposed to say i'm tired
if that girl from west virginia came up in conditions
that i couldn't survive?
went to war, came back alive
on top of that became a female black captain
when being black, you had to extra-extra try
way before james brown made us proud
she bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye
right there on outer drive, and she taught me how to drive
and she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
when i die, i hope you teach me how to fly
all my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all, just remember one thing
remember one thing, that one man can change the world
that one man can change the world

i know we ain’t close but, i gotta focus on blowing up
i know i promised that i’d be there, and really did i ever show up?
i know i wasn’t honest to ya girl
almost broke every promise to ya girl
brought problems to your world
and you said “how could you just lie to me? i thought you’d die for me?”
i was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
you the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
and when thanksgiving come around
i ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
so it’s back to the drama
“no i don’t know that number”

(let's go, royce)

name a nigga out of the d as solid as me
i unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
i did it all without a college degree
i went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to g
street lord, rock bottom, godfather, and p
d-boy, rottweiler, sean, sada, and tee
standin' on the corner three days
phone is on motorola prepaid
diadora or gold ellesses
these are ordered from the older east bays
she either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
a kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
a wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
i thought i told you motherfuckers i ain't need a budget
i ride with them guys that society begrudges
we been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'
we survived gettin' fronted by ilena cousin
before you could sell that cole and adele
or go nfl, be kobe or kells
the plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
the fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
and you know who postin' your bail? who promotin' your l?
who be hopin' you fail? nigga, oprah and gayle
ignore the hate, show the world that we love the opps
call lyor great while they make rape russell docs
nah

(okay, yeah)
(hit-boy)
yeah
(g. ry got me)

bitch, you have never said a clever line ever
you murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
rest assured, i'ma treat this roof like i'm peelin' off (what?)
the plastic on a pill bottle, i'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah
ripping rappers like they were wrapped in saran, bitch
and i'm strapped up with ammunition
and single-handedly takin' over the game like i had an actual hand missing
but i only need one to clap
animal ambition
the only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
bitch, if you pull up with the stick
it's a car with a manual transmission
the chances are low to none that i will overcome my bipolar one
voodoo dolls, i'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns
when i'm holdin' one, if i'm just fiddlin' with it
this motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
and i get off like an acquittal, i spit it, you critique it
it feels like i'm bein' belittled by midgets
it's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
and walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
you want smoke? i'm like hookah
man, i remember back when i used to get jumped for my fucking pumas
run home and go fuck my room up
these streets will try to vacuum you up
that's why the avenue where i grew up was 8 mile and hoover (what?)
'cause it sucked like a roomba
but even if i would've went the indie route
i don't have any doubt
i would still get blown like it's windy out
shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
this is the beginning of the ending, but i'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
if i dig deep down when i'm in my bag like fendi
who am i offending now?
got so many fucking detractors, feels like i'm gettin' plowed
had to put my money on a diet, i got too many pounds
you would think i'm turnin' pages the way that i'm flippin' paper
middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
i'm talkin' loot like i'm rioting
dick is so big, i can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
i don't think it would be logic for me to say that i'm retirin'
but i should say bye-bye, earthlings
'cause i'm back on uranus fuckin' up this "grindin'" beat, yeah
i took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
you listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
so when i'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
of how offensive i am, or just what a bitch that you are
like i never had to get my clothes at fucking st. vincent de paul
like i don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and i'm quick on the draw
yeah, so when i pull it, surprise (pull it, surprise), like kendrick lamar
you need to walk the yellow brick road and find the chick with the dog
'cause y'all are missing a heart
plus your bitch is giving out brain like the wizard of oz
this shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
y'all got detention tomorrow
i'm severe like benzo withdrawal
bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
i'm invincible, i've been through it all
like i never thought about just ending it 'til i got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
my back was against
now i rap like i'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law
oh
oh, fuck it

i think i’m ready to jump out the window
and turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
we already wasted too much time
and your time is the only thing i wish was mine
so yeah, oh yeah, i think i’m ready to jump out the window

straight up, straight up, look

you cried on my phone the whole night
that time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(oh i was there) i went to straighten his ass out
and you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
the question isn't, "do he love ya?" the question is, "do ya love yourself?"
you give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
remember when you used to come through and hit the mario kart
and you always picked the princess
i realized you was princess way back then
we the best thing that never happened, but

i think i'm ready to jump out the window
and turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
we already wasted too much time
and your time is the only thing i wish was mine
so yeah, oh yeah, i think i'm ready to jump out the window

you been up at night, sleep deprivation
what's the hesitation? what's ya reservation?
you been trippin', trippin' with no destination
you need separation, you need recreation
y'all been arguing every other day
ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
it's no need to turn this into kill bill, look
funny we ran into each other while we leaving
you walked in with a perm
and now yo' hair look like the weeknd's
i know that you been needin' clarity
don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
but you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

i think i'm ready to jump out the window
and turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
we already wasted too much time
and your time is the only thing i wish was mine
so yeah, oh yeah, i think i'm ready to jump out the window

look, i don't mean to sound like the jealous type
but you oughta know (oughta know)
i think me and you should get together sometimes

sometimes i wonder if you even know
how much you worth, i gotta know
sometimes i wonder if you even know
how much you worth, i gotta know
i don't mean to sound like the jealous type
but you oughta know (oughta know)
i think me and you should get together sometimes

this one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you

uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

okay i know what it feel like to be young and single
you know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
you know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
you know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
look, i know what it feel like to think you found the one
told mom that so many times that i'm sounding dumb
cause she started to mix ashley up with tanesha
and saying "hi britney" when i'm on the phone with lisa
fuck it, i got some new hoes, i mean some xxx girls
pussy get wet as an s-curl
then i started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
and how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
you know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(the number you dialed has been disconnected)
man, but before i started feeling bad
my nigga text me like "i got some hoes, hit me back"
fuck it

never got head while flaming up the blunt
you were my first, i'm just saying
more folks should try it, it's crazy
focus, selfish moments, on road, i done have my share
flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
sleepy arguments via texts while i buy my beer
and the air so tired i forget to recline my chair
picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause simon says

i'm like why nigga, why?
you supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
he like, "ahhh"
fuck it, we about to do therapy
aye, at least when i hit the doctor i'm carefree with no plan b's
you probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
i'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
but i'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
it’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in whole foods
or how when i'm with her i feel whole too
go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
fuck it, i started laughing and pretend like i ain't listen
even though he on target with everything i've been missing
the closest thing i had to that came in at 4 am and out at 8 for work
and i'm the reason we ain't make it work
that's what makes it worse
damn

oh i could let you down
when you trip, i'll take you anywhere, i take ya

voices in my head saying i could do better
(you always do the same shit)

(you're a fucking disappointment) 'til i wore 'em out, shit

voices in my head saying i could do better
(voices in my head saying that i could do better)
voices in my head saying that i knew better
(yeah, you know what's about to go down)
i done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
but i still, fuck
(that's your problem, you don't listen!)


voices in my head, conscience talking to me like

stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
stick to the, plan, to the plan
stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

so will everything else you notice
make sure all your inner actions end with actions

pay attention who you getting close with
distance yourself from negative energy
voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
i, i, i, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
i, i, i, been plotting this since elementary
i, i, i, no you need to buckle down
have people asking where you at
and wondering why you never wanna come around
you know that effort gon' come around
big face like zordon
you bought the watch but can't afford the time
even if you running out of breath
weight of the world doing lots of reps
time to get this generation
last one and then the next two outta debt
and they gon' pay you back with respect
just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
back when i rocked the white and blue grant hills
i realized there's no dream that i can't fill
i manifested all while i'm the man still
(bitch i'm the man)

voices in my head attacking what i'm thinking
bullet to the head might be the way to free it
if i leave my body i can free the spirits
swear to god my death of fear just keep on shrinking
wishing i could go back to the nineties
back when i was dreaming
me and my dog was on a mission like we kel and kenan
early 2000s detroit might as well been the hell with demons
wondering when i started losing it, the losing grip
feeling like i'm in the middle of the ocean
you either drown or canoe through it
voices in my head said i'm used to it
some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
when i talk to myself i'm confused on who's who it
i know in life you either blow it or blew it
and at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
i just hope by then i cut the voices in my head

do or die, nigga
i'mma keep poppin' this champagne
don't worry about shit
finally famous, nigga

man, i look up to god, i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep, deep, deep
man, i swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

man, i swear to god it get so deep though
that sometimes i  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
and wonder what if all the shit i reaped then got repoed
and the girl i gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
see, i got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
as long as i know the g code
being paranoid done turned me to a creep
you ain't got that metal on your side
police gon' work it like magneto if they need to, it get deep
deep, deeper than telekinesis
deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
the deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
but pressure make diamonds
and my name is sean cause i shine, it's self explanatory
i architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
you know the story
if my back against the ropes, then i'll finish stone cold it
my opponent probably praying for postponement
you fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it
it's written in the stars, man, the sky is the author
i pulled the sword out of the stone, i'm king arthur
motherfuck your armor, nigga, only weapon i'm scared of is karma
you watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
nigga, that shit just get deep

man, i look up to god, i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep, deep, deep
man, i swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

been going hard all day
wish a nigga would fuck with me
then i blow the candles out on my cake
and niggas always thinking it's a game
til we ran them out the arcade
stunting in my southernplayerlistic cadillac, andre
i talk that cash money shit
ym plus cmb, you can do the math for me, bitch
jail time, a slap on the wrist
cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips
you can tell i'm grinding by my wrist
anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
well, tell them i'll be waiting in suspense
i got some miles on me, but it's cool cause i never give an inch
and i don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
cause this shit is deeper than rap, i cannot say
that shit enough times like somebody rewind me
like shit is deeper than rap, i cannot say that shit enough times
i feel like sean, don't get enough shine
is it because he ain't got the tattoos? he ain't throwing up signs
well, let me throw up mine
and also let me show this vision of mine
fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
and if getting your point across crosses the line
some of the time then cross it with pride
that's real, my nigga, remember that
and it ain't about if they remember you, they remember rap
so just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
cause this shit is deep, deep
deep as empty pockets, nigga
we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets, slime
that shit get deep

man, i look up to god, i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep, deep, deep, deep
man, i swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
that shit get deep, deep, deep
(deep as empty pockets)
deep, deep
(we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets)
yeah, oh my god is just so deep, yeah, yeah
(deep as empty pockets)
(we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets)
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep

i am ready right now
uh huh
i look up i don't even know no more
i think it's funny how it go down
i don't even know no more, official shit

i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me, she been mad at me

i'm the livin' proof
that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
people passin' faster than i'm passin' weed
my daddy tell me, "stay strong, son
and be the man you have to be
holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
brrrt! paper on my phone line
it's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
but i don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'cause actually, i realized time's the most valuable, actually
so i'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
and as for me, i'ma text the room number right now
so you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
don't ask for me, don't ask for me
don't ask for me
lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
so don't ask for me

i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me, she been mad at me

she been mad, i've been on the go, on the road
on a roll more than a roller coaster
they can't throw me off track or slow
if i did, i got a long list of hoes on hoes
that quote on quote, say i told you so
heaven on earth, every night is paradise
i pray i didn't die or overdose, never that
i kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
on a quest for more money, more hungry
just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
yeah i got the force but never force nothin'
do it for the love, i'm forrest gumpin'
in my city i'm warren buffett
i mean business, the shirt is tucked in
the gun's tungsten, fuck it, i'm who not to fuck with
who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
my stock's risin', i'm goin' public, if i write it, it's gon' publish
you're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

so disgusting
it's that 3 and a third shit
straight up

i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me, she been mad at me
she been mad
