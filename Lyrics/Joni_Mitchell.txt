they paved paradise and put up a parking lot
with a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

they took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
and they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

hey farmer, farmer, put away the ddt now
give me spots on my apples
but leave me the birds and the bees, please

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

late last night, i heard the screen door slam
and a big yellow taxi took away my old man

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
i said, don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot

just before our love got lost you said
"i am as constant as a northern star"
and i said, "constantly in the darkness
where's that at?
if you want me i'll be in the bar"
on the back of a cartoon coaster
in the blue tv screen light
i drew a map of canada
oh, canada
with your face sketched on it twice

oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
and i would still be on my feet
oh, i would still be on my feet

oh, i am a lonely painter
i live in a box of paints
i'm frightened by the devil
and i'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
i remember that time you told me, you said
"love is touching souls"
surely you touched mine
'cause part of you pours out of me
in these lines from time to time

oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
still i'd be on my feet
i would still be on my feet

i met a woman
she had a mouth like yours
she knew your life
she knew your devils and your deeds
and she said
"go to him, stay with him if you can
but be prepared to bleed"

oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
you're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
still i'd be on my feet
i would still be on my feet

rows and floes of angel hair
and ice cream castles in the air
and feather canyons everywhere
i've looked at clouds that way

but now they only block the sun
they rain and snow on everyone
so many things i would have done
but clouds got in my way

i've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down, and still somehow
it's cloud illusions i recall
i really don't know clouds at all

moons and junes and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way that you feel
as every fairy tale comes real
i've looked at love that way

but now it's just another show
you leave 'em laughing when you go
and if you care, don't let them know
don't give yourself away

i've looked at love from both sides now
from give and take, and still somehow
it's love's illusions i recall
i really don't know love at all

tears and fears and feeling proud
to say "i love you" right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds
i've looked at life that way

but now old friends are acting strange
they shake their heads, they say i've changed
well something's lost, but something's gained
in living every day

i've looked at life from both sides now
from win and lose and still somehow
it's life's illusions i recall
i really don't know life
at all

i've looked at life from both sides now
from up and down and still somehow
it's life's illusions i recall
i really don't know life
at all

it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
and singing songs of joy and peace
oh, i wish i had a river i could skate away on

but it don't snow here
it stays pretty green
i'm gonna make a lot of money
then i'm gonna quit this crazy scene
i wish i had a river i could skate away on

i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly
oh, i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i made my baby cry

he tried hard to help me
you know, he put me at ease
and he loved me so naughty
made me weak in the knees
oh, i wish i had a river i could skate away on

i'm so hard to handle
i'm selfish and i'm sad
now i've gone and lost the best baby
that i ever had
i wish i had a river i could skate away on

i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly
oh, i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i made my baby say goodbye

it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
and singing songs of joy and peace
i wish i had a river i could skate away on

blue
songs are like tattoos
you know i've been to sea before
crown and anchor me
or let me sail away

hey, blue
there is a song for you
ink on a pin
underneath the skin
an empty space to fill in

well, there's so many sinking now
you gotta keep thinking
you can make it through these waves
acid, booze, and ass
needles, guns, and grass
lots of laughs
lots of laughs
everybody's saying that
hell's the hippest way to go
well, i don't think so
but i'm gonna take a look around it, though
blue, i love you

blue, there is a shell for you
inside you'll hear a sigh
a foggy lullaby
there is your song from me

sitting in a park in paris, france
reading the news and it sure looks bad
they won't give peace a chance
that was just a dream some of us had
still a lot of lands to see
but i wouldn't wanna stay here
it's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

oh, but california
california, i'm coming home
i'm going to see the folks i dig
i'll even kiss a sunset pig
california, i'm coming home

i met a redneck on a grecian isle
who did the goat dance very well
he gave me back my smile
but he kept my camera to sell
oh, the rogue, the red red rogue
he cooked good omelets and stews
and i might have stayed on with him there

but my heart cried out for you, california
oh, california, i'm coming home
oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
i'm your biggest fan
california, i'm coming home

oh, it gets so lonely
when you're walking
and the streets are full of strangers
all the news of home you read
just gives you the blues
just gives you the blues

so i bought me a ticket
i got on a plane to spain
went to a party down a red dirt road
there were lots of pretty people there
reading rolling stone, reading vogue
they said, "how long can you hang around?"
i said a week, maybe two
just until my skin turns brown

then i'm going home to california
california, i'm coming home
oh, will you take me as i am
strung out on another man
california, i'm coming home

oh, it gets so lonely
when you're walking
and the streets are full of strangers
all the news of home you read
more about the war
and the bloody changes
oh, will you take me as i am?
will you take me as i am?
will you?
will you take me as i am?
hmmm mmmmm
take me as i am

i am on a lonely road and i am traveling
traveling, traveling, traveling
looking for something, what can it be?
oh, i hate you some, i hate you some, i love you some
oh, i love you when i forget about me
i want to be strong, i want to laugh along
i want to belong to the living
alive, alive, i want to get up and jive
i want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
do you want, do you want, do you want to dance with me, baby?
do you want to take a chance
on maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby?
well, come on

all i really, really want our love to do
is to bring out the best in me and in you too
all i really, really want our love to do
is to bring out the best in me and in you
i want to talk to you, i want to shampoo you
i want to renew you again and again
applause, applause, life is our cause
when i think of your kisses, my mind see-saws
do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
so i hurt you too
then we both get so blue

i am on a lonely road and i am traveling
looking for the key to set me free
oh, the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
it's the unraveling
and it undoes all the joy that could be
i want to have fun, i want to shine like the sun
want to be the one that you want to see
i want to knit you a sweater
want to write you a love letter
i want to make you feel better
i want to make you feel free
want to make you feel free
i want to make you feel free

born with the moon in cancer
choose her a name she will answer to
call her green and the winters cannot fade her
call her green for the children who've made her
little green, be a gypsy dancer

he went to california
hearing that everything's warmer there
so you write him a letter and say "her eyes are blue"
he sends you a poem and she's lost to you
little green, he's a non-conformer

just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow

child with a child pretending
weary of lies you are sending home
so you sign all the papers in the family name
you're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
little green, have a happy ending

just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow

my old man
he's a singer in the park
he's a walker in the rain
he's a dancer in the dark

we don't need no piece of paper
from the city hall
keeping us tied and true
my old man
keeping away my blues

he's my sunshine in the morning
he's my fireworks at the end of the day
he's the warmest chord i ever heard
play that warm chord, play and stay, baby

we don't need no piece of paper
from the city hall
keeping us tied and true
my old man
keeping away my blues

but when he's gone
me and them lonesome blues collide
the bed's too big
the frying pan's too wide

then he comes home
and he takes me in his loving arms
and he tells me all his troubles
and he tells me all my charms

we don't need no piece of paper
from the city hall
keeping us tied and true, no
my old man
keeping away my blues

but when he's gone
me and them lonesome blues collide
the bed's too big
the frying pan's too wide

my old man
he's a singer in the park
he's a walker in the rain
he's a dancer in the dark

we don't need no piece of paper
from the city hall
keeping us tied and true, no
my old man
keeping away my lonesome blues

the wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, carey
but it's really not my home
my fingernails are filthy
i got beach tar on my feet
and i miss my clean white linen
and my fancy french cologne

oh, carey, get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
oh, you're a mean old daddy
but i like you fine

come on down to the mermaid café and i will
buy you a bottle of wine
and we'll laugh and toast to nothing
and smash our empty glasses down
let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
a round for these friends of mine
let's have another round for the bright red devil
who keeps me in this tourist town

come on, carey, get out your cane
i'll put on some silver
oh, you're a mean old daddy
but i like you
i like you, i like you, i like you

maybe i'll go to amsterdam
or maybe i'll go to rome
and rent me a grand piano
and put some flowers 'round my room
but let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
the night is a starry dome
and they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
beneath the matala moon

come on, carey, get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
you're a mean old daddy
but i like you

the wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
but it's really not my home
maybe it's been too long a time
since i was scramblin' down in the street
now they got me used to that clean white linen
and that fancy french cologne

oh, carey, get out your cane
i'll put on my finest silver
we'll go to the mermaid café
have fun tonight
i said, oh, you're a mean old daddy
but you're out of sight

i came upon a child of god
he was walking along the road
and i asked him, "where are you going?"
and this he told me
i'm going on down to yasgur's farm
i'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
i'm gonna camp out on the land
i'm gonna try and get my soul free

we are stardust
we are golden
and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

then can i walk beside you?
i have come here to lose the smog
and i feel to be a cog in something turning
well maybe it is just the time of year
or maybe it's the time of man
i don't know who i am
but you know life is for learning

we are stardust
we are golden
and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

by the time we got to woodstock
we were half a million strong
and everywhere there was song and celebration
and i dreamed i saw the bombers
riding shotgun in the sky
and they were turning into butterflies
above our nation

we are stardust
billion year old carbon
we are golden
caught in the devil's bargain
and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
(to some semblance of a garden.)

the last time i saw richard was detroit in '68
and he told me, "all romantics meet the same fate someday
cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
"you laugh," he said, "you think you're immune
go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
you like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
all those pretty lies, pretty lies
when you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
only pretty lies, just pretty lies"

he put a quarter in the wurlitzer
and he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
and a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
and she said "drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close."
"richard, you haven't really changed," i said, it's just that
now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
you got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
when you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

richard got married to a figure skater
and he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
and he drinks at home now most nights with the tv on
and all the house lights left up bright
i'm gonna blow this damn candle out
i don't want nobody comin' over to my table
i got nothing to talk to anybody about
all good dreamers pass this way someday
hidin' behind bottles in dark cafés
dark cafés, only a dark cocoon
before i get my gorgeous wings and fly away
only a phase, these dark café days

yesterday a child came out to wonder
caught a dragonfly inside a jar
fearful when the sky was full of thunder
and tearful at the falling of a star

and the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go 'round and 'round and 'round
in the circle game

then the child moved ten times 'round the seasons
skated over ten clear frozen streams
words like "when you're older" must appease him
and promises of someday make his dreams

and the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go 'round and 'round and 'round
in the circle game

sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
and they tell him, "take your time, it won't be long now
'til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"

and the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go 'round and 'round and 'round
in the circle game

so, the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
there'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
before the last revolving year is through

and the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go 'round and 'round and 'round
in the circle game
and go 'round and 'round and 'round
in the circle game

no regrets coyote
we just come from such different sets of circumstance
i'm up all night in the studios
and you're up early on your ranch
you'll be brushing out a broodmare's tail
while the sun is ascending
and i'll just be getting home with my reel-to-reel
there's no comprehending
just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
and the lips you can get
and still feel so alone
and still feel related
like stations in some relay
you're not a hit and run driver no no
racing away
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

we saw a farmhouse burning down
in the middle of nowhere
in the middle of the night
and we rolled right past that tragedy
till we turned into some road house lights
where a local band was playing
locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
and the next thing i know
that coyote's at my door
he pins me in a corner and he won't take no
he drags me out on the dance floor
and we're dancing close and slow
now he's got a woman at home
he's got another woman down the hall
he seems to want me anyway
why'd you have to get so drunk
and lead me on that way
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

i looked a coyote right in the face
on the road to baljennie near my old home town
he went running thru the whisker wheat
chasing some prize down
and a hawk was playing with him
coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
he had those same eyes just like yours
under your dark glasses
privately probing the public rooms
and peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
where the players lick their wounds
and take their temporary lovers
and their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
no regrets coyote
i just get off up aways
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

coyote's in the coffee shop
he's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
he picks up my scent on his fingers
while he's watching the waitresses' legs
he's too far from the bay of fundy
from appaloosas and eagles and tides
and the air conditioned cubicles
and the carbon ribbon rides
are spelling it out so clear
either he's going to have to stand and fight
or take off out of here
i tried to run away myself
to run away and wrestle with my ego
and with this flame
you put here in this eskimo
in this hitcher
in this prisoner
of the fine white lines
of the white lines on the free free way

look out the left, the captain said
the lights down there, that's where we'll land
i saw a falling star burn up
above the las vegas sands
it wasn't the one that you gave to me
that night down south between the trailers
not the early one
that you can wish upon
not the northern one
that guides in the sailors

oh, starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin' that i like all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

you got the touch so gentle and sweet
but you've got that look so critical
now i can't talk to you, baby, i get so weak
sometimes i think love is just mythical
up there's the heavens
down there's a town
blackness everywhere and little lights shine
oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine

oh, starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin' that i like all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

i'm drinking sweet champagne
got the headphones up high
can't numb you out
can't drum you out of my mind
they're playing "goodbye, baby
baby, goodbye
ooh ooh, love is blind"
up go the flaps, down go the wheels
i hope you got your heat turned on, baby
i hope they finally fixed your automobile
i hope it's better when we meet again, baby

starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin' that i like all right
turn this crazy bird around
shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

i was driving across the burning desert
when i spotted six jet planes
leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
it was the hexagram of the heavens
it was the strings of my guitar
amelia  it was just a false alarm

the drone of flying engines
is a song so wild and blue
it scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
then your life becomes a travelogue
of picture post card charms
amelia it was just a false alarm

people will tell you where they've gone
they'll tell you where to go
but till you get there yourself you never really know
where some have found their paradise
others just come to harm
oh, amelia it was just a false alarm

i wish that he was here tonight
it's so hard to obey
his sad request of me to kindly stay away
so this is how i hide the hurt
as the road leads cursed and charmed
i tell amelia it was just a false alarm

a ghost of aviation
she was swallowed by the sky
or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
like icarus ascending
on beautiful foolish arms
amelia it was just a false alarm

maybe i've never really loved
i guess that is the truth
i've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
and looking down on everything
i crashed into his arms
amelia it was just a false alarm

i pulled into the cactus tree motel
to shower off the dust
and i slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
i dreamed of 747s
over geometric farms
dreams amelia - dreams and false alarms

i'm traveling in some vehicle
i'm sitting in some cafe
a defector from the petty wars
that shell shock love away
there's comfort in melancholy
when there's no need to explain
it's just as natural as the weather
in this moody sky today
in our possessive coupling
so much could not be expressed
so now i'm returning to myself
these things that you and i suppressed
i see something of myself in everyone
just at this moment of the world
as snow gathers like bolts of lace
waltzing on a ballroom girl

you know it never has been easy
whether you do or you do not resign
whether you travel the breadth of extremities
or stick to some straighter line
now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
they're either going to thaw out or freeze
listen
strains of benny goodman
coming through the snow and the pinewood trees
i'm porous with travel fever
but you know i'm so glad to be on my own
still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
can set up trembling in my bones *
i know no one's going to show me everything
we all come and go unknown
each so deep and superficial
between the forceps and the stone

well i looked at the granite markers
those tribute to finality to eternity
and then i looked at myself here
chicken scratching for my immortality
in the church they light the candles
and the wax rolls down like tears
there's the hope and the hopelessness
i've witnessed thirty years
we're only particles of change i know i know
orbiting around the sun
but how can i have that point of view
when i'm always bound and tied to someone
white flags of winter chimneys
waving truce against the moon
in the mirrors of a modern bank
from the window of a hotel room

i'm traveling in some vehicle
i'm sitting in some cafe
a defector from the petty wars
until love sucks me back that way

help me, i think i'm falling in love again
when i get that crazy feeling, i know i'm in trouble again
i'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
and a sweet taiking ladies man and you love your lovin'
but not like you love your freedom

help me, i think i'm falling in love too fast
it's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'cause i've seen some hot hot blazes
come down to smoke and ash
we love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
you dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
didn't it feel good
didn't it feel good

help me, i think i'm falling in love with you
are you going to let me go there by myself
that's such a lonely thing to do
both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
we love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

there's a man who's been out sailing
in a decade full of dreams
and he takes her to a schooner
and he treats her like a queen
bearing beads from california
with their amber stones and green
he has called her from the harbor
he has kissed her with his freedom
he has heard her off to starboard
in the breaking and the breathing
of the water weeds
while she was busy being free

there's a man who's climbed a mountain
and he's calling out her name
and he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
he calls again
he can think her there beside him
he can miss her just the same
he has missed her in the forest
while he showed her all the flowers
and the branches sang the chorus
as he climbed the scaly towers
of a forest tree
while she was somewhere being free

there's a man who's sent a letter
and he's waiting for reply
he has asked her of her travels
since the day they said goodbye
he writes "wish you were beside me
we can make it if we try"
he has seen her at the office
with her name on all his papers
through the sharing of the profits
he will find it hard to shake her
from his memory
and she's so busy being free

there's a lady in the city
and she thinks she loves them all
there's the one who's thinking of her
there's the one who sometimes calls
there's the one who writes her letters
with his facts and figures scrawl
she has brought them to her senses
they have laughed inside her laughter
now she rallies her defenses
for she fears that one will ask her
for eternity
and she's so busy being free

there's a man who sends her medals
he is bleeding from the war
there's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
there's a drummer and a dreamer
and you know there may be more
she will love them when she sees them
they will lose her if they follow
and she only means to please them
and her heart is full and hollow
like a cactus tree
while she's so busy being free

like a cactus tree
being free

i slept last night in a good hotel
i went shopping today for jewels
the wind rushed around in the dirty town
and the children let out from the schools
i was standing on a noisy corner
waiting for the walking green
across the street he stood
and he played real good
on his clarinet for free

now me i play for fortunes
and those velvet curtain calls
i got a black limousine and two gentlemen
escorting me to the halls
and i'll play if you have the money
or if you're a friend to me
but the one man band
by the quick lunch stand
he was playing real good for free

nobody stopped to hear him
though he played so sweet and high
they knew he had never been on their tv
so they passed his music by
i meant to go over and ask for a song
maybe put on a harmony
i heard his refrain
as the signal changed
he was playing real good for free
