nobody likes to but i really like to cry
nobody likes me, maybe if i cry

spelled out your name
and list the reasons, faint of heart, don't call me back
i imagine you when i was distant, not insistent
i follow suit and laid out on my back
imagine that
a million hours left to think of you and think of that

calm down, i'm calling you to say
i'm capsized, airing on the edge of safe
calm down, i'm calling back to say
i'm home now

build a wall of books between us in our bed
repeat, repeat the words that i know we both have said
relax into the need, we get so comfortable
remember when i was so strange and likable?

i just want back in your head
i just want back in your head
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray
when i get a little scared
when i get a little scared
when i get a little

when i jerk away from holding hands with you
i know these habits hurt important parts of you
remember when i was sweet and unexplainable?
nothing like this person, unlovable

i just want back in your head
i just want back in your head
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray
when i get a little scared
when i get a little scared
when i get a little scared
when i get a little

run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run

i just want back in your head
i just want back in your head
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray
i'm not unfaithful but i'll stray

i can't deny i'm begging for attention
dropping hints, hoping for some tension
getting tired of making all this racket
waiting on you to get your ass in gear
i didn't wanna be so invested
i played it cool and then i overdressed it
you were there, i was tired of this
nonsense when you pretend you don't

get me, feel me, want me
like me, love me, need me

tonight, if you fuel my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
i tried, but you're fuel to my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

in a minute, i'll be hoping that you're outside
another second, you'll be walking on my wild side
you know i'm ready for anything to happen
take this passion, turn it into action

get me, feel me, want me
like me, love me, need me

tonight, if you fuel my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
i tried, but you're fuel to my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

right where i want you, back against the wall
trust when i promise, never let you fall
right where i want you, back against the wall
you can trust me, i'll never let you fall

tonight, if you fuel my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
i tried, but you're fuel to my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
tonight, if you fuel my fire
you can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

i won't regret saying this
this thing that i'm saying
is it better than keeping my mouth shut?
that goes without saying

call, break it off
call, break my own heart

maybe i would have been something you'd be good at
maybe you would have been something i'd be good at
but now we'll never know
i won't be sad
but in case, i'll go there everyday
to make myself feel bad
there's a chance i'll start to wonder
if this was the thing to do

i won't be out long
but i still think it better if
you take your time coming over here
i think that's for the best

call, break it off
call, break my own heart

maybe i would have been something you'd be good at
maybe you would have been something i'd be good at
but now we'll never know
i won't be sad
but in case, i'll go there everyday
to make myself feel bad
there's a chance i'll start to wonder
if this was the thing to do
i'll start to wonder
if this was the thing to do

my life tethered like
like a twin or a son
scared to be severed right
right before we begun
doubled like a couple, we stood
stood out in the light, light
clutching each other like
knuckles turned white, white

i cried wolf
howled it at the moon
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two
i made us feel
feel unlucky too
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two

our love twisted up
like a chain or an eight
we square angles that
that always will ache
excuses for the bruises we wear
black and blue now, now
breaking each other like
knuckles in a fight, fight

i cried wolf
howled it at the moon
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two
i made us feel
feel unlucky too
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two

cry, cry wolf
i don't know what this howling will prove
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what i'm gon, what i'm gonna lose
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what this howling will prove
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what i'm gon, what i'm gonna lose

i cried wolf
howled it at the moon
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two
i made us feel
feel unlucky too
so luck be damned
break that mirror in two

cry, cry wolf
i don't know what this howling will prove
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what i'm gon, what i'm gonna lose
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what this howling will prove
cry, cry wolf
i don't know what i'm gon, what i'm gonna lose

i love you
i don't need a ring to prove that you're worthy
you're under my skin
it's easy, i don't need a lock to prove that you trust me
i walk the walk

to be with you
just to be with you
oh, to be with you
just to be with you

save your first and last dance for me
i don't need a white wedding
save your first and last born for me
we don't need a white wedding
all the girls i loved before
told me they signed up for more
save your first and last chance for me
cause i don't want a white wedding

i told you, i struggled to stay before
and i worry about letting you in
it's easy how quickly the false starts end when i'm happy
i stop the clock

to be with you
just to be with you
oh, to be with you
just to be with you

save your first and last dance for me
i don't need a white wedding

dark, you can't come soon enough for me
saved from one more day of misery
everything i love, get back from me now
everyone i love, i need you now
don't forget a million miles from me
safe and another day can pass by me
everything i love, get back from me now
everyone i love, i'd need you now

(so what?)
so i conned, i lied
i lie to me too
(so what?)
so i conned, i lied
i lie to me too
(so what?)

hold out for the ones you know will love you
hide out from the ones you know will love you
you, you too

right to the edge i'm barely there
slow to make my move, i'm almost there
everything i say, i say to me first
everything i do, i do to me first

(so what?)
so what, i lied
i lie to me too
(so what?)
so what, i lied
i lie to me too
(so what?)

hold out for the ones you know will love you
hide out from the ones you know will love you
you, you too

dark, you can't come soon enough for me

i went crazy thinking i was wrong
like a fool holding on too long
let it crumble, let the whole thing fall
you were someone i loved
then you were no one at all

it was cruel of me to do what i did to you, did-did-did to you
it was wrong of me to hurt such a big part of you, part-part of you

i swear i tried to leave you
at least a hundred times a day
i swear i tried to tell you
a thousand times, a different way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i swear i tried to tell you
at least a hundred times a day

you went silent watching as i packed
rehearsed the words you hoped would get me back
shout it out and let your whole world fall
i was someone you loved
then i was no one at all

it was cruel of me to do what i did to you, did-did-did to you
it was wrong of me to hurt such a big part of you, part-part of you

i swear i tried to leave you
at least a hundred times a day
i swear i tried to tell you
a thousand times, a different way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i swear i tried to tell you
at least a hundred times a day

oh i told you, that i, i needed out
and i, i couldn't stay
couldn't stay here one more day
oh i told you, that i, i needed out
and i, i couldn't say
couldn't tell you one more way

i swear i tried to leave you
at least a hundred times a day
i swear i tried to tell you
a thousand times, a different way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i need out, on my own, i don't wanna live this way
i swear i tried to tell you
at least a hundred times a day

do you remember i searched you out
how i climbed your city's walls
do you remember me as devout?
how i prayed for your calls

i stood still, it's what i did
love like ours is never fixed

i stuck around
i did behave
i saved you every time
i was a fool for love
i was a fool for love
i was a fool
i was a fool

then you blamed me and blocked me out
how long did you think i'd last?
then you disappeared for weeks to pout
how many times could i pack?

but (but) stand (stand) still is what i did
(it's all i did)
love (love) like (like) ours is never fixed
(it's never fixed)

still i stuck around
i did behave
i saved you every time
i was a fool for love
i was a fool for love
i was a fool (i was a fool for love)
i was a fool (i was a fool for love)

if you're worried that i might have changed
left behind all of my foolish ways
you best be looking for somebody else
without a foolish heart
a foolish heart

but (but) stand (stand) still is what we did
(it's all we did)
love (love) like (like) ours is never fixed
(it's never fixed)

i stuck around
i did behave
i saved you every time
i was a fool for love (i was a fool)
i was a fool for love
i was a fool (i was a fool for love)
i was a fool (i was a fool for love)
i was a fool (i was a fool for love)

put a little of you into my heart
took a chance and you tore it apart
i let a little light into the dark
caused a blackout inside of my heart

see your face makes it hard to move on
hear your voice, can't manage alone
tell me what you're doing now, where you live
tell me are you in love, how you been
i'm dying to know
is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
i'm dying to know, i'm dying to know
is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?

you've been on my mind again

nothing but a world of hurt
it kills me still
no matter what you might of heard

never been the type to leave much room for anyone to speak
always been about what i want, listen to me while i preach
never been the kind to make much space for emotions in a fight
anything i didn't wanna hear, i just preached 'til i was right

but you, you got me on the line
told me that you think it's time
make a change or this is gonna stall
shape up or you'll drop me like a call

now i wanna write a love song
even though you never ever asked me for one
write you a letter, send sweet poems
ask for forgiveness, tell you i was wrong
sit myself down, rein my pride in
start to focus, change who i've been
give me a second, let me u-turn
write you the love song you've earned

i been like this so long i can barely stand to think it now
every second of my life push back until i broke them down
i've been selfish so long i don't know why you would ever stay
every minute you've been here, i've been pushing you and your love away

but you, you got me on the line
told me that you think it's time
make a change or this is gonna stall
shape up or you'll drop me like a call

now i wanna write a love song
even though you never ever asked me for one
write you a letter, send sweet poems
ask for forgiveness, tell you i was wrong
sit myself down, rein my pride in
start to focus, change who i've been
give me a second, let me u-turn
write you the love song you've earned

every time i think i hurt you
all i have to do is think through
what i want, list your virtues
apologize, i don't deserve you
every time i know i hurt you
all i have to do is run through
what i need, list your virtues
apologize, i don't deserve you

now i wanna write a love song
even though you never ever ask me for one
write you a letter, send sweet poems
ask for forgiveness, tell you i was wrong
sit myself down, rein my pride in
start to focus, change who i've been
give me a second, let me u-turn
write you the love song you've earned
give me a second, let me u-turn
write you the love song you've earned

from hundreds of miles you cry like a baby
you plead with me, shout, scream, tell me i'm staying
i know i know i know, i'm still your love
back from the last place that i wanted to fake you
laugh with me, shout, scream now tell me you're staying
i know i know i know, you're still my love

the same as i love you, you'll always love me too
this love isn't good unless it's me and you

box after box and you're still by my side
the weather is changing and breaking my stride
i know i know i know, it's just this day
house after house, just like car after car
you see club after club and it all seems so far
i know i know i know, what else are we here for?

the same as i love you, you'll always love me too
this love isn't good unless it's me and you

stick your hands inside of my pockets
keep them warm while i'm still here
tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all

last night i was writing about you
i know my screaming and shouting won't keep you
i know i know i know, you're still my love
i wake up to the sound of you working
you're one room right over, stressing and loving me
i know i know i know, be still my love

the same as i love you, you'll always love me too
this love isn't good unless it's me and you

stick your hands inside of my pockets
keep them warm while i'm still here
tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all
stick your heart inside of my chest
keep it warm here while we rest
tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all

the same as i love you, you'll always love me too
this love isn't good unless it's me and you

stranded and i'm so lost, my mind is wired
overcome and overdone, my fate is on fire
eat the drugs and dance to screaming in my head
i'm so happy that we're friends, me and you

i never feel invisible when you're around
with you, i don't blend in with the millions
together in the light, i swear all for you
tonight in the dark, we're seeing colors

hey, i'm just like you
a little messed up and blue
hey, i'm just like you
not sure what the fuck i'm to do
we're headstrong tonight (tonight, tonight)
racing through the streets 'til we fly
gold-colored prisms of light (the light, the light)
headstrong tonight

sometimes, we get so tired of pretending like you're so strong
everyone you love has gone and decided that you're so wrong

i always feel invincible when you're around
you and me against the millions
together in the light, i swear all for you
tonight in the dark, we're seeing colors

hey, i'm just like you
a little messed up and blue
hey, i'm just like you
not sure what the fuck i'm to do
we're headstrong tonight (tonight, tonight)
racing through the streets 'till we fly
gold-colored prisms of light (the light, the light)
headstrong tonight

we're headstrong tonight (tonight, tonight)
racing through the streets 'til we fly
gold-colored prisms of light (the light, the light)
headstrong tonight

sick and tired of things getting tough
never gonna be enough
sick and tired of fights starting wars
never gonna be enough
say what i want, say what i need
(sick and tired of things getting tough)
say what i want, say what i need
nobody hurts you like me

when did i become that girl?
that girl i see
when did i become that girl?
that girl i see

getting fed up with the way you love
never gonna be enough
(sick and tired of things getting tough)
say what you saw, say what you heard
(sick and tired of things getting tough)
say what you felt, say where it hurts
nobody treats me like dirt

when did i become that girl?
that girl i see
when did i become that girl?
that girl i see

i never wanna be anyone's enemy
i just wanna let myself be
the girl that i once was
i never wanna be that girl i see
when did i fall so far?
barely recognise me
when do i move on?
so i recognise me
so i recognise me

when did i become that girl?
that girl i see
when did i become that girl?
that girl i see
when did i become that girl?
that girl i see

i never wanna be anyone's enemy
i just wanna let myself be
the girl that i once was
i never wanna be that girl i see
i never wanna be anyone's enemy
i just wanna let myself be
the girl that i once was
i never wanna be that girl i see
