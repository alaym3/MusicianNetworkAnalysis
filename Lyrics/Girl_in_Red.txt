i've been hiding for so long
these feelings, they're not gone
can i tell anyone?
afraid of what they'll say
so i push them away
i'm acting so strange

they're so pretty, it hurts
i'm not talking 'bout boys, i'm talking 'bout girls
they're so pretty with their button-up shirts

i shouldn't be feeling this
but it's too hard to resist
soft skin and soft lips
i should be into this guy
but it's just a waste of time
he's really not my type
i know what i like
no, this is not a phase
or a coming of age
this will never change

they're so pretty, it hurts
i'm not talking 'bout boys, i'm talking 'bout girls
they're so pretty with their button-up shirts
they're so pretty, it hurts
i'm not talking 'bout boys, i'm talking 'bout girls
they're so pretty with their button-up shirts
'cause i don't know what to do
it's not like i get to choose who i love
who i love, who i love, who i love

they're so pretty, it hurts
i'm not talking 'bout boys, i'm talking 'bout girls
they're so pretty with their button-up shirts
and they're so pretty, it hurts
i'm not talking 'bout boys, i'm talking 'bout girls
they're so pretty, it hurts 

oh, hannah, i wanna feel you close
oh, hannah, come lie with my bones
oh, hannah, don't look away
oh, hannah, just look at me the same

i don't wanna be your friend, i wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
i wanna kiss you until i lose my breath

i wanna kiss you until i lose my breath

i wanna kiss you until i lose my breath
oh hannah, oh hannah, oh hannah, oh hannah
i wanna kiss you until i lose my breath
i don't wanna be your friend

i don't wanna be your friend, i wanna be your bitch
and i wanna touch you, but not like this
the look in your eyes
my hands between your thighs
oh, this can't be real
it's all just a dream

i don't wanna be your friend, i wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
i wanna kiss you until i lose my breath (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

i don't wanna be your friend
lose my breath (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
i don't wanna be your friend
lose my breath 

smoking cigarettes on the roof
you look so pretty and i love this view

we fell in love in october
that's why, i love fall
looking at the stars
admiring from afar

you will be my world
my world, my world, my world
you will be my girl

smoking cigarettes on the roof

we're not going that way
at least i know, i am here to stay

we fell in love in october
that's why, i love fall
looking at the stars
admiring from afar

i'm running low on serotonin
chemical imbalance got me twisting things
stabilize with medicine
there's no depth to these feelings
dig deep, can't hide
from the corners of my mind
i'm terrified of what's inside

i get intrusive thoughts like cutting my hands off
like jumping in front of a bus
like how do i make this stop
when it feels like my therapist hates me?
please don't let me go crazy
put me in a field with daisies
might not work, but i'll take a maybe
oh, been breaking daily
but only me can save me
so i'm capitulating, crying likе a fucking baby
i don't wanna miss it, ba-da
i don't wanna be sick, ah-da
i don't, la-ba-deh-deh-ba-dеh
da-da-da-brah-la-da-da
i'm running low on serotonin
chemical imbalance got me twisting things
stabilize with medicine
there's no depth to these feelings
dig deep, can't hide
from the corners of my mind
i'm terrified of what's inside

i get intrusive thoughts
like burning my hair off
like hurting somebody i love
like, does it ever really stop?
when there's control, i lose it
incredibly impulsive
so scared i'm gonna end up doing something stupid
but i try to contain it
oh, it gets so draining
it's like my heart is failing
every night, i'm contemplating
my inner voice is saying "tough"
so i try to brush it off
yeah, i try to brush it off

i'm running low on serotonin
chemical imbalance got me twisting things
stabilize with medicine
but there's no depth to these feelings
dig deep, can't hide
from the corners of my mind
i'm terrified of what's inside
kan man egentlig, kan man kjenne det i hjertet at hvis man får blodpropp?
jeg følte liksom flere ganger at hjertet mitt slutta å slå og, sånn at-
liksom, at jeg følte at jeg ble helt sånn tung og rar i kroppen 

it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea 'cause now i'm even more lost
it was a bad idea to think you were the one
was such a bad idea 'cause now everything's wrong

you put your hands under my shirt
undid my bra and said these words
"darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"
you pushed me up against my wall
threw my clothes down on the floor
"darling, are you ready for more?"

it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea, i'm totally fucked
it was a bad idea to think i could stop
was such a bad idea, i can't get enough

it was a bad idea meeting you so late
was such a bad idea 'cause i can't think straight
it was a bad idea to bring you back home
was such a bad idea, i need to be alone
you put your hands under my shirt
undid my bra and said these words
"darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"
you pushed me up against my wall
threw my clothes down on the floor
"darling, are you ready for more?"

it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea, i'm totally fucked
it was a bad idea to think i could stop
was such a bad idea, i can't get enough

i know i don't want to
be the one that you run to
when you got nowhere else to go
when you need some love
i know i'm the last one
you try to call but
i always give in
to give you it all

oh-oh
i can't be your midnight love
oh-oh-oh
when your silver is my gold
oh-oh-oh
in this light, i swear i'm blind
oh-oh-oh
in this light, i swear you're mine

i hope that the right time one day arrives
so i'll be willing to let this die
able to look you right in the eyes
say i'm not your consolation prize
oh-oh
i can't be your midnight love
oh-oh-oh
when your silver is my gold
oh-oh-oh
in this light, i swear i'm blind
oh-oh-oh
in this light, i swear you're mine

i can't be your second best
close but not your favorite
i keep going back for more
where there's nothing from before

i can't be your midnight love
oh-oh-oh
when your silver is my gold
i can't be your second best
close but not your favorite
i keep going back for more
where there's nothing from before 

one, two, three, four

empty bottles everywhere
people sleeping on the stairs
got something stuck in my hair
no idea how it got there

this is the morning after
the house is such a disaster
but there's someone outside
that caught my eye

there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
i don't know what to do
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool

i can't stop staring at my face
my summer tan has begun to fade
is this real or is this fake?
a creepy dream i can't escape
this is the morning after
my mind is such a disaster
but there's someone outside
that caught my eye

there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
i don't know what to do
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool

i'm the dead girl in the pool
what the fuck is going on?
i'm the dead girl in the pool, whoa

this is the morning after
my mind is such a disaster
but there's someone outside
that caught my eye
there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
there's a dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool
i'm the dead girl in the pool 

i think back to when
life was good, i was content
but it's been so many years
i can't remember how it feels

i reach for me but i'm not there
it's so lonely but who cares
it's fine, it's okay
i'll die anyway
i reach for me but i'm not there
i always wonder why i'm here
it's fine, it's okay
i'll die anyway

i guess i could say
i've learned to live this way
but it's still hard to find
reasons to stay alive

accepting i'm pointless
isn't the hardest
when it's so
completely obvious
my questions are countless
looking for answers
so far i'm clueless
go back to sleep
i reach for me but i'm not there
it's so lonely but who cares
it's fine, it's okay
i'll die anyway
i reach for me but i'm not there
i always wonder why i'm here
it's fine, it's okay
i'll die anyway

i'll die anyway
i'll die anyway
i'll die anyway
i'll die anyway 

when i see you with her
it only gets worse
and oh, how it hurts
i can't say
'cause i'm all out of words
lost on this earth
just floating around
someone help me down

it's been so hard
ever since you broke my heart
but i'll never tell
honey, i'm not doing so well

it's not your fault
i could've done more
like being upfront
honest about what i want
but it's not like me
to just say what i feel
though i feel it, it's real
oh-oh
it's been so hard
ever since you broke my heart
but i'll never tell
honey, i'm not doing so well

honey, i'm not doing so well
honey, i'm not doing so well
oh, i'll never tell
honey, i'm not doing so well
i'm not doing so well 

you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yourself through my eyes
you're so fake, it's all lies
was she good? just what you like?
did you come? how many times?
tell the truth, wait, never mind

i can't forgive, i can't forget
i should have known you're full of it
i'm not upset, i'm fucking pissed
i spelled it out, you're illiterate
did you do the things you know i like?
roll your tongue, make her come twenty times?
don't tell me to relax or try to get me back
i'm packing up your bags

you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yoursеlf through my eyes
you're so fakе, it's all lies
was she good? just what you like?
did you come? how many times?
tell the truth, wait, never mind
never listen to a monologue
told by a lying fraud
i don't need to make sense
of all your bullshit reasons
did you listen to her heartbeat like you did with me?
was it more than sex, pure physicality?
don't bother giving me any more bad apologies

you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yourself through my eyes
you're so fake, it's all lies
was she good? just what you like?
did you come? how many times?
tell the truth, wait, never mind

she was a different kind, made you feel satisfied
momentary happiness makes you feel alive
you hide it all but you get easily seduced by
the things that ripped me apart
i'm a safe bet, but you get intrigued
'bout uncertainty and mystique
was i stupid enough to believe you
would change that for me? 

i've been in the deep end since i realized
there is a difference between body and mind
i've been at my lowest for the longest time
knowing my existence is not one of a kind

but i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down
yeah, i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down

i've been seeking solace in the strangest of things
gettin' my hands dirty while i beat out the kinks
i've been chasing everything that makes mе feel cold
practicing self-love is something i don't rеally know
so i suppose
i cannot live like this no more
filling a lifetime with remorse
i'm closing up the void
but i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down
yeah, i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down

been in the deep end since i realized
there is a difference between body and mind
if i could make it go quiet inside
get some rest for my weary eyes
tonight, i'm giving my all for a remedy
grant myself serenity
but if i don't leave it all behind

but i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down
yeah, i've had
my deepest cries for now
my heart's out
my guard's down 

the morning sun shines on your skin
'cause your white curtains, they are paper-thin
windows open, i can feel the breeze
but we're safe here, under the sheets

i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
ooh, oh
i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep, i'll watch you sleep

i never get bored of looking at you
'cause every time, i see something new
like the scar on your spine
you fell off a roof when you were nine
you lived a life before me

i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
ooh, oh
i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep, i'll watch you sleep
i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep, i'll watch you sleep
i don't ever wanna leave
i'll watch you sleep, i'll watch you sleep
i'll watch you sleep
i'll watch you sleep 

i'm thinking too much again
i can't sleep, it's 4 am
i gotta be somewhere tomorrow
i don't wanna go out tomorrow

i'm thinking too much again
how my life will end?
i have to live tomorrow
i don't wanna live tomorrow

i'm thinking too much again
i can't sleep, it's 4 am
i gotta be somewhere tomorrow
i don't wanna go out tomorrow

fuck my thoughts
i think too much
i think too much
fuck my thoughts
i think too much
i think too much 

hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey

you let the wrong people love you
(ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
but you don't see that, do you?
(no, no)
when you cry and need my comfort
(ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
i drop everything to come over
(ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

don't bite your lip or grit your teeth
just count to ten and try to breathe
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me
you don't know what you deserve
(ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
that's why you end up hurt
(ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
but you never listen
take my advice as criticism
then make the worst decisions
ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

don't bite your lip or grit your teeth
just count to ten and try to breathe
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me

don't bite your lip or grit your teeth
just count to ten and try to breathe
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
you stupid bitch, can't you see?
the perfect one for you is me 

i'm in new york, thinking of you
wondering what you are up to
from this lonely-ass hotel room
with a pretty good-looking view
i am somewhere in the states
going somewhere on a plane
it doesn't really matter as long as i'm always far away
or maybe on a bus for a month straight
shit's fun but i'm going insane
like it's been months since i've had sex
i'm just a horny little lovesick mess
and i don't wanna be the type of person who calls you up
every time i need to get off but
i guess that's who i'm turning into, oh fuck

down at times square in the rain
there's a billboard with my face
it's so weird how things have changed
think about it every day
if i ever make it back
will i find what we once had?
guess i ruined us pretty bad
oh-oh
i'm in the same city as you
but i still don't come through
'cause i've got so much to do
and that's the shittiest excuse
so don't ever take me back
let's just face the fact
i treated you like trash
and you deserve more than that

i'm wasting my life on pointless things
i sometimes think, "when does life begin"
i'm falling out of conversations
i can't pay attention, repeat the question

i need to be alone
or i'm gonna lose my shit
oh oh, oh oh
i need to be alone
or i'm gonna lose my shit
oh oh, oh oh

i'm waiting for something to change
'cause everyday just feels the same
it's getting harder to exist
i don't want to feel like this

i need to be alone
or i'm gonna lose my shit
oh oh, oh oh
i need to be alone
or i'm gonna lose my shit
oh oh

on christmas day
yeah, i'll kiss you anyway
on christmas day

i don't have a lot to give
but i would give you everything
all my time is yours to spend
let me wrap you in with my skin
with my skin

two queens in a king-sized bed
like angels in the snow
my only wish is one more year
and then i want them all
your freckled cheeks, our tangled feet
the closer, the better it gets
so let's stay right here
until forever disappears

i don't have a lot to give
but i would give you everything
all my time is yours to spend
let me wrap you in with my skin
with my skin
two queens in a king-sized bed (hmm)
there's no mistletoe above our heads
but i'll kiss you anyway
on christmas day
yeah, i'll kiss you anyway
on christmas day
