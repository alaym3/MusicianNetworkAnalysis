woe to you, o'er earth and sea
for the devil sends the beast with wrath
because he knows the time is short
let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
for it is a human number
its number is six hundred and sixty six

i left alone, my mind was blank
i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
what did i see? can i believe
that what i saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
just what i saw, in my old dreams
were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
cause in my dreams, it's always there
the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
yeah!

the night was black, was no use holding back
'cause i just had to see, was someone watching me?
in the mist, dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

666, the number of the beast
hell and fire was spawned to be released

torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky
in the night, the fires are burning bright
the ritual has begun, satan's work is done

666, the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight


this can't go on, i must inform the law
can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

666, the number of the beast
666, the one for you and me

i'm coming back, i will return
and i'll possess your body and i'll make you burn
i have the fire, i have the force
i have the power to make my evil take its course

i am a man who walks alone
and when i'm walking a dark road
at night or strolling through the park
when the light begins to change
i sometimes feel a little strange
a little anxious when it's dark

fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a constant fear
that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you're searching for the light?
sometimes when you're scared
to take a look, at the corner of the room
you've sensed that something's watching you

fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear
that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no-one's there?
and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you're sure there's someone there

fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear
that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there


fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark

watching horror films the night before
debating witches and folklore
the unknown troubles on your mind
maybe your mind is playing tricks
you sense, and suddenly eyes fix
on dancing shadows from behind

fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear
that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear
that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

when i'm walking a dark road
i am a man who walks alone

you'll take my life, but i'll take yours too
you'll fire your musket, but i'll run you through
so when you're waiting for the next attack
you'd better stand, there's no turning back
the bugle sounds, the charge begins
but on this battlefield, no one wins
the smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
as i plunge on into certain death

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

the horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
the mighty roar of the russian guns
and as we race towards the human wall
the screams of pain as my comrades fall
we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
and the russians fire another round
we get so near, yet so far away
we won't live to fight another day

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


we get so close, near enough to fight
when a russian gets me in his sights
he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow
a burst of rounds takes my horse below
and as i lay there, gazing at the sky
my body's numb and my throat is dry
and as i lay forgotten and alone
without a tear, i draw my parting groan

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

i'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
the sands of time for me are running low
running low, yeah

when the priest comes to read me the last rites
i take a look through the bars at the last sights
of a world that has gone very wrong for me
can it be that there's some sort of error?
hard to stop the surmounting terror
is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

somebody please tell me that i'm dreaming
it's not easy to stop from screaming
but words escape me when i try to speak
tears fall but why am i crying?
after all, i'm not afraid of dying
don't i believe that there never is an end?


as the guards march me out to the courtyard
somebody cries from a cell "god be with you"
if there's a god why has he let me go?
as i walk my life drifts before me
and though the end is near i'm not sorry
catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

mark my words believe my soul lives on
don't worry now that i have gone
i've gone beyond to seek the truth
when you know that your time is close at hand
maybe then you'll begin to understand
life down here is just a strange illusion


yeah, yeah, yeah... hallowed be thy name
yeah, yeah, yeah... hallowed be thy name
yeah

white man came across the sea
he brought us pain and misery
he killed our tribes, he killed our creed
he took our game for his own need
we fought him hard, we fought him well
out on the plains we gave him hell
but many came too much for cree
oh will we ever be set free?

riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
galloping hard on the plains
chasing the redskins back to their holes
fighting them at their own game
murder for freedom the stab in the back
women and children are cowards attack

run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives

soldier blue in the barren wastes
hunting and killing their game
raping the women and wasting the men
the only good indians are tame
selling them whiskey and taking their gold
enslaving the young and destroying the old

run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives


run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives

kill for gain, or shoot to maim
but we don't need a reason
the golden goose is on the loose
and never out of season
blackened pride still burns inside
this shell of bloody treason
here's my gun for a barrel of fun
for the love of living death

the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?

2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb

the blind men shout "let the creatures out
we'll show the unbelievers"
the napalm screams of human flames
of a prime time belsen feast, yeah!
as the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
we oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies

the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?

2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb


the body bags and little rags of children torn in two
and the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
as the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
to the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun

the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?

2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb

midnight
midnight
midnight
it's all night
midnight
midnight
midnight
it's all night

hear the rime of the ancient mariner
see his eye as he stops one of three
mesmerises one of the wedding guests
stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
and the music plays on, as the bride passes by
caught by a spell and the mariner tells his tale

driven south to the land of the snow and ice
to a place where nobody's been
through the snow, fog flies on the albatross
hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings
and the ship sails on, back to the north
through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

the mariner kills the bird of good omen
his shipmates cry against what he's done
but when the fog clears, they justify him
and make themselves a part of the crime
sailing on and on and north across the sea
sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

the albatross begins with its vengeance
a terrible curse, a thirst has begun
his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
about his neck, the dead bird is hung
and the curse goes on and on and on at sea
and the thirst goes on and on for them and me

"day after day, day after day
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink
water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"

"there," calls the mariner, "there comes a ship oâ€™er the line
but how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"
see... onward she comes
onward she nears, out of the sun
see, she has no crew
she has no life, wait but there's two

death and she life-in-death
they throw their dice for the crew
she wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
then... crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
she... she, life-in-death
she lets him live, her chosen one


"one after one by the star-dogged moon
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
and i heard nor sigh nor groan
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump
they dropped down one by one."


the curse it lives on in their eyes
the mariner he wished he'd die
along with the sea creatures
but they lived on, so did he

and by the light of the moon
he prays for their beauty not doom
with heart he blesses them
god's creatures all of them too

then the spell starts to break
the albatross falls from his neck
sinks down like lead into the sea
then down in falls comes the rain, hahaha


hear the groans of the long-dead seamen
see them stir and they start to rise
bodies lifted by good spirits
none of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
and revenge still is sought, penance starts again
cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

now the curse is finally lifted
and the mariner sights his home
spirits go from the long-dead bodies
form their own light and the mariner's left alone

and then a boat came sailing towards him
it was a joy he could not believe
the pilot's boat, his son, and the hermit
penance of life will fall onto him
and the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
and the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

the mariner's bound to tell of his story
to tell this tale wherever he goes
to teach god's word by his own example
that we must love all things that god made
and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
and the tale goes on and on and on and on

there goes the siren that warns of the air raid
there comes the sound of the guns sending flak
out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
got to get up for the coming attack
jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
remove all the wheel blocks
there's no time to waste
gathering speed as we head down the runway
got to get airborne before it's too late

running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving
run, live to fly
fly to live, do or die
won't you run, live to fly
fly to live, aces high


move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
let off a sharp burst and then turn away
roll over, spin round to come in behind them
move to their blindsides and firing again
bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
ten me-109s out of the sun
ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
heading straight for them i press down my guns

rolling, turning, diving
rolling, turning, diving, doing it again
rolling, turning, diving
rolling, turning, diving
run, live to fly
fly to live, do or die
won't you run, live to fly
fly to live, aces high!

across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
all that's left of what we were it's what we have become
once our empires glorious, but now the empire's gone
the dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
a land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

have you seen the writing on the wall?
have you seen that writing?
can you see the riders on the storm?
can you see them riding?
can you see them riding?

holding onto fury is that all we ever know
ignorance our judge and jury, all we've got to show
from hollywood to babylon, holy war to kingdom come
on a trail of dust and ashes when the burning sky is done

a tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
the earthquake is a-coming, but you don't want to hear
you're just too blind to see

have you seen the writing on the wall?
have you seen that writing?
can you see the riders on the storm?
can you see them riding?
can you see them riding?
riding next to you


have you seen the writing on the wall?
have you seen that writing?
can you see the riders on the storm?
can you see them riding?
have you seen the writing on the wall?
have you seen that writing?
can you see the riders on the storm?
can you see them riding?
can you see them riding?
riding next to you

from the coast of gold
across the seven seas
i'm travellin' on far and wide
but now it seems
i'm just a stranger to myself
and all the things i sometimes do
it isn't me but someone else

i close my eyes and think of home
another city goes by in the night
ain't it funny how it is?
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
and my heart is lying there
and will be 'til my dying day

so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up, make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years

too much time on my hands
i got you on my mind
can't ease this pain, so easily
when you can't find the words to say
it's hard to make it through another day
and it makes me wanna cry
and throw my hands up to the sky

so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up, make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years


so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up, make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years

so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up, make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years

let me tell you a story to chill the bones
about a thing that i saw
one night wandering in the everglades
i'd one drink but no more
i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
gazing up at the stars
not aware of a presence so near to me
watching my every move

feeling scared and i fell to my knees
as something rushed me from the trees
took me to an unholy place
and that is where i fell from grace
then they summoned me over to join in with them
to the dance of the dead
into the circle of fire i followed them
into the middle i was led

as if time had stopped still i was numb with fear
but still i wanted to go
and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
as i walked onto the coals
and i felt i was in a trance
and my spirit was lifted from me
and if only someone had the chance
to witness what happened to me

and i danced, and i pranced, and i sang with them
all had death in their eyes
lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
they had ascended from hell

as i danced with the dead
my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
below my undead body
just danced the circle of dead
until the time came to reunite us both
my spirit came back down to me
i didn't know if i was alive or dead
as the others all joined in with me

by luck then a skirmish started
and took the attention away from me
when they took their gaze from me
was the moment that i fled
i ran like hell, faster than the wind
but behind i did not glance
one thing that i did not dare
was to look just straight ahead


when you know that your time has come around
you know you'll be prepared for it
say your last goodbyes to everyone
have a drink and say a prayer for it

when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

to this day i guess i'll never know
just why they let me go
but i'll never go dancing no more
'til i dance with the dead

to ride the storm to an empire of the clouds
to ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
to ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
to ride the storm and damn the rest oblivion

royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
grey lady giant of the skies
you hold them in your arms
the millionth chance they laughed
to take down his majestyâ€™s craft
to india they say magic carpet float away
an october fateful day


mist is in the trees
stone sweats with the dew
the morning sunrise, red before the blue
hanging at the mast, waiting for command
his majestyâ€™s airship, the r101

sheâ€™s the biggest vessel built by man
a giant of the skies
for all you unbelievers, the titanic fits inside
drum roll tight her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come
the fury yet to come

in the gathering gloom
the storm rising in the west
the coxswain stared
into the plunging weather glass

we must go now
we must take our chance with fate
we must go now
for a politician, he canâ€™t be late

the airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch
but the ship is in their backbone
every sinew, every inch
she never flew at full speed, a trial never done
her fragile outer cover her achilles would become
an achilles yet to come

sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
loyal to the king and an airship creed
the engines drum, the telegraph sounds
release the cords that bind us to the ground

said the coxswain
â€œsir, sheâ€™s heavy, sheâ€™ll never make this flightâ€œ
said the captain
â€œdamn the cargo, weâ€™ll be on our way tonightâ€œ
groundlings cheered in wonder
as she backed off from the mast
baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft
now she slips into our past



fighting the wind as it rolls you
feeling the diesels that push you along
watching the channel below you
lower and lower into the night
lights are passing below you
northern france asleep in their beds
storm is raging around you
a million to one, thatâ€™s what he said


reaper standing beside her
with his scythe cuts to the bone
panic to make a decision
experienced men asleep in their graves
her cover is ripped and sheâ€™s drowning
rain is flooding into the hull
bleeding to death and sheâ€™s falling
lifting gas is draining away



â€œweâ€™re down ladsâ€œ came the cry
bow plunging from the sky
three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
the flares to guide her path, ignited at the last
the empire of the clouds
just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last

here lie their dreams as i stand in the sun
on the ground where they built and the engines did run
to the moon and the stars
now what have we done?
oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
dreams live on, dreams live on, on


now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
the empire of the clouds may rest in peace
and in a country churchyard laid head to the mast
eight and forty souls who came to die in france

i've been looking so long for you now
you won't get away from my grasp
you've been living so long in hiding
and hiding behind that false mask
you know, and i know that you ain't got that long to last
your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

you're standing in the wings
there you wait for the curtain to fall
and knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
now, i know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
and you know i'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah


i'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
you're the phantom of the opera
you're the devil, you're just out to scare
you damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
you haunt me, you taunt me
you torture me back at your lair

into the abyss i'll fall, the eye of horus
into the eyes of the night, watching me go
green is the cat's eye that glows
in this temple
enter the risen osiris, risen again

tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death

when i was living this lie, fear was my game
people would worship and fall
drop to their knees
so bring me the blood and
red wine for the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a god
and he will die too

tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death


now i am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
silent the terror that reigned
marbled in stone
a shell of a man, god preserved -
for a thousand ages
but open the gates of my hell
i'll strike from the grave

tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death

slave to the power of death...
slave to the power of death...

o, god of earth and altar
bow down and hear our cry
our earthly rulers falter
our people drift and die
the walls of gold entomb us
the swords of scorn divide
take not thy thunder from us
take away our pride


just a babe in a black abyss
no reason for a place like this
the walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
an easy way for the blind to go
a clever path for the fools who know
the secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips

the light of the blind, you'll see
the venom tears my spine
the eyes of the nile are opening, you'll see

she came to me with a serpent's kiss
as the eye of the sun rose on her lips
moonlight catches silver tears that i cry
so we lay in a black embrace
and the seed is sown in a holy place
and i watched and i waited for the dawn, oh

the light of the blind, you'll see
the venom tears my spine
the eyes of the nile are opening, you'll see

go!

bind all of us together
ablaze with hope and free
no storm or heavy weather
will rock the boat you'll see
the time has come to close your eyes
and still the wind and rain
for the one who will be king
the watcher in the ring

it is you, oh
it is you

maybe one day i'll be an honest man
up 'til now i'm doing the best i can
long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset
sunrise to sunset

dream on brothers, while you can
dream on sisters, i hope you find the one
all of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of time

spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night

dream on brothers, while you can
dream on sisters, i hope you find the one
all of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of time

sands are flowing and the lines
are in your hand
in your eyes i see the hunger and the
desperate cry that tears the night

spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night


spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night

spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night

dying swans, twisted wings
beauty not needed here
lost my love, lost my life
in this garden of fear
i have seen many things in a lifetime alone
mother love is no more
bring this savage back home
wilderness, house of pain
makes no sense of it all
close this mind, dull this brain
messiah before his fall
what you see, it's not real
those who know will not tell
all is lost, sold your souls
to this brave new world

a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world
in a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world

dragon kings, dying queens
where is salvation now?
lost my life, lost my dreams
rip the bones from my flesh
silent screams laughing here
dying to tell you the truth
you are planned and you are damned
in this brave new world

a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world
in a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world
in a brave new world
a brave new world
a brave new world
in a brave new world

dying swans, twisted wings
bring this savage back home

love is a razor and i walked the line on that silver blade
slept in the dust with his daughter
her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
and i will pray for her, i will call her name out loud
i would bleed for her, if i could only see her now

living on a razor's edge
balancing on a ledge
living on a razor's edge, oh
balancing on a ledge, oh
balancing on a ledge, oh
living on a razor's edge
balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

the evil that men do lives on and on
the evil that men do lives on and on

circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
the seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
and i will pray for you, some day i may return
don't you cry for me, beyond is where i learn

living on a razor's edge
balancing on a ledge
living on a razor's edge

time to speak with the shaman again
conjure the jester again
black dog in the ruins is howling my name
so here is the soul of a man

when the world was virgin before the coming of men
just a solar witness, the beginning of the end
from a world of magma to a cold rock face
the ascent of madness and a human race
we are strange believers all of us
there are stranger truths immortal lust
we rise from slumber he calls our name
recalls our number abide with pain

reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail

to godâ€™s illusion which i recall
was our delusion before the fall
the angels come and the angels go
but the lord of light shining below
eternal blackness beyond the stars
we think our wisdom will get that far
at the masterâ€™s table, the tableâ€™s bare
no land of plenty, devastation, despair

reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail


reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line at the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line at the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line at the ending of time
if eternity should fail

good day, my name is necropolis
i am formed of the dead
i am the harvester of the soul meat
and i suck the lives from around my bed
my own two sons i gave them breath
and i filled their living corpses with my bile
what humanity i knew i have long forgotten
for me eternity is nothing but a short while
