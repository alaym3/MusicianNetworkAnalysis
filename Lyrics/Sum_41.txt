the faster we're falling, we're stopping and stalling
we're running in circles again
just as things were looking up, you said it wasn't good enough
but still, we're trying one more time

maybe we're just trying too hard
when really, it's closer than it is too far

'cause i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
'cause i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
instead of going under

seems like each time i'm with you, i lose my mind
because i'm bending over backwards to relate
it's one thing to complain, but when you're driving me insane
well then, i think it's time that we took a break

maybe we're just trying too hard
when really, it's closer than it is too far
'cause i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
'cause i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
instead of going under (instead of going under)
instead of going under


i can't sit back and wonder why
it took so long for this to die
and i hate it when you fake it
you can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
so believe me, it's not easy
it seems that something's telling me

i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
'cause i'm in too deep, and i'm trying to keep
up above in my head, instead of going under
instead of going under

instead of going under again
instead of going under
instead of going under again
instead of going under again
instead of going under again 

storming through the party like my name was el niño
when i'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an el camino
as a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

i know i'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
never going, never showing up when we had to
attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
i'm sick of always hearing "act your age"

i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
but what would you expect with a conscience so small?
heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
maiden and priest were the gods that we praised

'cause we like having fun at other people's expense and
cutting people down is just a minor offense then
it's none of your concern, i guess i'll never learn
i'm sick of being told to wait my turn
i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

don't count on me to let you know when
don't count on me, i'll do it again
don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
don't count on me, 'cause i'm not listening

well i'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
back-packed, and i don't give a shit about nothing
you be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
but you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
'cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
you're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
i like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
the doctor said my mom should've had an abortion

i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down
(waste my time with them)
casualty of society
(waste my time with them)
victim of your conformity and back down 

i tried to be perfect, but nothing was worth it
i don't believe it makes me real
i thought it'd be easy, but no one believes me
i meant all the things i said

if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
that i'm better off on my own

this place is so empty, my thoughts are so tempting
i don't know how it got so bad
sometimes it's so crazy that nothing can save me
but it's the only thing that i have

if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
that i'm better off on my own
on my own!

i tried to be perfect, it just wasn't worth it
nothing could ever be so wrong
it's hard to believe me, it never gets easy
i guess i knew that all along

if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
that i'm better off on my own 

so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating?
can't find a good reason
can't find hope to believe in

drop dead
a bullet to my head
your words are like a gun in hand
you can't change the state of the nation
we just need some motivation
these eyes
have seen no conviction
just lies and more contradiction
so tell me what would you say
i'd say it's up to me

so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating?
can't find a good reason
can't find hope to believe in

ignorance
and understanding
we're the first ones to jump in line
out of step for what we believe in
but who's left to stop the bleeding?
how far
will we take this?
it's not hard to see through the fakeness
so tell me what would you say
i'd say it's up to me
so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating?
can't find a good reason
can't find hope to believe

this can't last forever
time won't make things better
i feel so alone
can't help myself
and no one knows
if this
is worthless
tell me (tell me, tell me)
so
what have we done
with a war that can't be won?
this can't be real
'cause i don't know what to feel, no

so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating?
can't find a good reason
can't find hope to believe
so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating?
can't find a good reason
for this world to believe 

i don't want this moment to ever end
where everything's nothing without you
i'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile
'cause it's true, i am nothing without you

through it all, i've made my mistakes
i stumble and fall, but i mean these words

i want you to know, with everything i won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul (so i hold on)
i'll hold on to this moment, you know
as i bleed my heart out to show, and i won't let go

thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
and pieces of memories fall to the ground
i know what i didn't have, so i won't let this go
'cause it's true, i am nothing without you

all the streets where i walked alone
with nowhere to go have come to an end
i want you to know, with everything i won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul (so i hold on)
i'll hold on to this moment, you know
as i bleed my heart out to show, and i won't let go

in front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
when you don't know what you're looking to find
in front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
when you just never know what you will find
what you will find, what you will find
what you will find, what you will find


i don't want this moment to ever end
where everything's nothing without you

i want you to know, with everything i won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul (so i hold on)
i'll hold on to this moment, you know
as i bleed my heart out to show, and i won't let go
i want you to know, with everything i won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul (so i hold on)
i'll hold on to this moment, you know
as i bleed my heart out to show, and i won't let go
 

everybody's got their problems
everybody says the same things to you
it's just a matter how you solve them
and knowing how to change the things you've been through
i feel i've come to realize
how fast life can be compromised
step back to see what's going on
i can't believe this happened to you
(this happened to you)

it's just a problem that i'm faced with; am i
not the only one who hates to stand by?
complications that are first in this line
with all these pictures running through my mind
knowing endless consequences
i feel so useless in this
get back, step back, and as for me
i can't believe

part of me, won't agree
cause i don't know if it's for sure
suddenly, suddenly
i don't feel so insecure
part of me, won't agree
cause i don't know if it's for sure
suddenly, suddenly
i don't feel so insecure anymore
everybody's got their problems
everybody says the same things to you
it's just a matter how you solve them
but what else are we supposed to do?

part of me, won't agree
cause i don't know if it's for sure
suddenly, suddenly
i don't feel so insecure
part of me, won't agree
cause i don't know if it's for sure
suddenly, suddenly
i don't feel so insecure anymore

why do things that matter the most
never end up being what we chose
now that i find no way so bad
i don't think i knew what i had
why do things that matter the most
never end up being what we chose
now that i find no way so bad
i don't think i knew what i had 

do you think about me cause i don’t have any doubt
you must in this life
even though you’re never there, i didn’t feel you disappear
from sight, you did it well

and now you and i share the same life missin' out
and so the story goes
that we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
i know that if i
i had the chance, i’d let you know that i understand
i’ve let you go

i don’t need you by my side i think by now i’m doin' fine
myself, on my own
and i feel you time to time, like you're sending out a sign
i can tell you're not alone

because you and i share the same life missin' out
and so the story goes
that we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
i know that if the
the chance appears i’d have no fears
we both share pain, we feel the same

and now you and i share the same life missin' out
and so the story goes
that we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
i know that if i
i had the chance, i’d let you know that i understand
i’ve let you go
you and i share the same life missin' out
so the story goes
that we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
i know that if the
the chance appears, well i’d have no fears
we both share pain, we feel the same 

i haven't been home for a while, i'm sure everything's the same
mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
sorry mom, but i don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
i'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
you'll never know what i've become, the king of all that's said and
done, the forgotten son
this city's buried in defeat, i walk along these no name streets
wave goodbye to all as i fall...

at the dead end i begin to burn the bridge of innocence
satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
on a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
a shallow grave i have dug all by myself

and now i've been gone for so long
i can't remember who was wrong
all innocence is long gone
i pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where i belong

a walking disaster, the son of all bastards
you regret you made me, it's too late to save me
(you regret you made me, it's too late to save me)

and he said, "far as i can tell, it's just voices in my head
am i talking to myself 'cause i don't know what i just said?"
and she said, "far is where i fell, maybe i'm better off dead
am i at the end of nowhere, is this as good as it gets?"

and now i've been gone for so long
i can't remember who was wrong
all innocence is long gone
i pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where i belong

a walking disaster, the son of all bastards
you regret you made me, it's too late to save me

to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(it's too late to save me)
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(it's too late to save me)
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(it's too late to save me)
to save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
to save me, to save me, to save me...
and now i've been gone for so long
i can't remember who was wrong
all innocence is long gone
i pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where i belong

a walking disaster, the son of all bastards
you regret you made me, it's too late to save me

i will be home in a while, you don't have to say a word
i can't wait to see you smile, wouldn't miss it for the world
i will be home in a while, you don't have to say a word
i can't wait to see you smile, wouldn't miss it for the world 

zero chances, no way out
no solutions, give in now
there's no point resisting, there's nobody listening
are we just sick? (sick)
are we just tired? (tired)
apathetic, uninspired
what's to believe in, there's nobody leading

so tell me what's real
i don't know if i can feel

all that we have is just slipping away
and i don't believe that it's gonna be okay
you can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
you're leaving us all behind with hell to pay

all of the dearly beloved
your time is up, they're out for blood
misery made us so hopelessly faithless (hey)
and now i can't believe (hey) a single word that you say (say)
secrets kept, a thin disguise, empty threats are full of lies (hey)
do what you will, you just add to your bill now
so tell me what's right
i don't see the light

all that we have is just slipping away
and i don't believe that it's gonna be okay
you can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
you're leaving us all behind with hell to pay
(pay, pay, pay)

silence, they don't hear you calling
the further down you fall
no, they're not there at all
'cause they're already gone


so tell me what's real
i don't know if i can feel
so tell me what's right
i don't see the light

all that we have is just slipping away
and i don't believe that it's gonna be okay
you can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
you're leaving us all behind with hell to pay 

so, what am i fighting for? everything back and more
and i’m not gonna let this go, i’m ready to settle the score

get ready, 'cause this is war

there are days that i think i’m crazy
other days, nothing seems to faze me
there’s nothing more, and nothing less, just
all the fears that i must confess, well
i’m afraid i believe in nothing
no hopes or dreams, you could’ve left me dead
naive and not to mention
i’m losing count of all my blessings (with all i've done...)

with all that i’ve done, it’s too late
i can’t take back all that i have become

so, all that i’m trying to say, i’m looking for a better way
some days, it just gets so hard, and i don’t wanna slip away
so, what am i fighting for? everything back and more
and i’m not gonna let this go, i’m ready to settle the score
get ready, 'cause this is war

another day in the right direction
i’m okay, but i’m left to question
how did i get so far behind the rest?
why am i so inclined to forget?
all the days that you made me crazy
nowadays, you don’t even faze me
it’s all the same, and i don’t stress none
sick and tired of all this tension (with all i've done...)

with all that i’ve done, it’s too late
i can’t take back all that i have become

so, all that i’m trying to say, i’m looking for a better way
some days, it just gets so hard, and i don’t wanna slip away
so, what am i fighting for? everything back and more
and i’m not gonna let this go, i’m ready to settle the score

get ready, 'cause this is war

get ready, 'cause this is war
get ready, 'cause this is war

all that i’m trying to say, i’m looking for a better way
some days, it just gets so hard, and i don’t wanna slip away
so, what am i fighting for? everything back and more

some days, it just gets so hard, and i don’t wanna slip away
get ready, 'cause this is war, everything back and more
and i’m not gonna let this go, i’m ready to settle the score
get ready, 'cause this is war... 

i never told you how i felt
though i thought i'd said it all
and i never knew you needed help
well, 'cause you always seemed so tough
but now i'm here alone
without you by my side
if only i had known
that you kept it all inside
now i'm trying to understand
just trying to find a way
but forgive you, i just can't
it's all just too much for me to take

and if i failed you, well, i swear i tried my best
but now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
just so you know
you meant the world to us, i know that it's too late
and all i want's another chance, i can't accept that you have left

look at all this damage done
are you happy with yourself?
and we thought the best was yet to come
and, and i thought i knew you oh so well
and the days just go by
while the moment seems to last
like catching fire
all is gone, and it all went up so fast
and if i failed you, well, i swear i tried my best
and now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
just so you know
you meant the world to us, i know that it's too late
and all i want's another chance, i can't accept that you have left
that you have left

and if i failed you, well, i swear i tried my best
but now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
just so you know
you meant the world to us, i know that it's too late
but all i want's another chance, i can't accept that you have left
that you have left 

one, two, three, four...

well, i won't be caught living in a dead-end job
while praying to my government, guns, and god
now it's us against them, we're here to represent
and spit right in the face of the establishment

and now i don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
that we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
and we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

a call across the underclass!

calling out loud with no respect
i'm not the one, i'm just another reject
i'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
unsung against the grain, i'm here to rise against
now i'm desensitized (i state my place in nowhere)
burning the flag (of the degeneration)
everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)

well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
that we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
and we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

may i have your attention please?
i pledge allegiance to the underclass as your hero at large!


one, two, three, four...
we're the saints of degeneration
we don't owe anyone an explanation
fuck elitists, we don't need this
we're the elite of just alright

well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
that we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
and we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you 

far in, ohhhh. wait, we singing?
take everything left from me!
all! to! blame!

how can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
bought in the land of the free (land, free)

and we're all to blame
we've gone too far, from pride to shame
we're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
we're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

we want it all with no sacrifice!

realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
how did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
a greed that we just can't resist (resist)
and we're all to blame
we've gone too far, from pride to shame
we're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
we're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

we want it all, everyone wants it all, with no sacrifice!

tell me now, what have we done
we don't know, i can't allow
what has begun to tear me down, believe me now
we have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

and now we're all to blame
we've gone too far from pride to shame
we're hopelessly blissful and blind, when all we need
is something true to believe

don't we all, everyone, everyone, we will fall

because we're all to blame
we've gone too far, from pride to shame
we're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
we want it all, everyone, don't we all... 

some say we're never meant to grow up
i'm sure they never knew enough
i know the pressures won't go away
it's too late
find out the difference somehow
it's too late to even have faith
don't think things will ever change
you must be dreaming...

think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
i can do this on my own, and if i fall, i'll take it all
it's so easy after all

believe me 'cause now's the time to try
don't wait, the chance will pass you by
time's up to figure it out
you can't say it's too late
seems like everything we knew
turned out were never even true
don't trust, things will never change
you must be dreaming, dreaming...

think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
i can do this on my own, and if i fall, i'll take it all
it's so easy after all

some say we're better off without
knowing what life is all about
i'm sure they'll never realize the way
it's too late
somehow it's different every day
in some ways, it never fades away
seems like it's never gonna change
i must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming...

think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
i can do this on my own, think before you make up your mind
you don't seem to realize, i can do this on my own
and if i fall, i'll take it all, it's so easy after all
believe me, it's alright, it's so easy after all
believe me, it's alright, it's so easy after all
 

you're something to few, but nothing to me
someone so twisted and sick as can be
it wasn't the plan, we gave it a shot
you've proven a real man is something you're not

so tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
a total abomination is what it looks like to me
no reasonable explanation, can't call it a declaration
a bigot to all, sick of it all, we all stand up, go

i believe that i
am losing faith in all of humankind
but then i realize it's plain to see
that a number is all you are to me

not worthy of name, a number you'll get
a symbol of meaningless, void of respect
a matter of time, you get what you've earned
we'll take pleasure in watching you burn

so tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
a total abomination's what it looks like to me
it's a masochist fascination, a character assassination
you're the fool on the hill, we're stuck with you 'til we all stand up, go
i believe that i
am losing faith in all of humankind
but then i realize it's plain to see
that a number is all you are to me

go

i believe that i
am losing faith in all of humankind
'cause then i realize it's plain to see
that a number is all you are to me
i believe that i
am losing faith in all of humankind
but then i realize it's plain to see
that a number is all you are to me
i believe that i
am losing faith in all of humankind
but then i realize it's plain to see
that a number is all you'll ever be

a number you get 

what happened to you?
you played the victim for so long now in this game
what i thought was true
is made of fiction and i'm following the same
but if i try to make sense of this mess i'm in
i'm not sure where i should begin
i'm falling
i'm falling

now i'm in over my head
for something i said
completely misread, i'm better off dead
and now i can see, how fake you can be
this hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

it's none of my concern
don't look to me 'cause i don't believe in fame
i guess you never heard
i met our makers they don't even know your name
but if i had to say goodbye to leave this hell
i'd say my time has served me well
i'm falling
i'm falling
and now i'm in over my head
with something i said, completely misread i'm better off dead
and now i can't see how fake you can be
this hypocrisy's beginning to get to

this came long before, those who suffer more
i'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
what's with my disgrace i've lost the human race
no one plans for it to, blow up in their face

who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
who said it was so easy to put back all these pieces?

now i'm in over my head
for something i said
completely misread, i'm better off dead
and now i can see, how fake you can be
this hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

over my head
better off dead
over my head
better off dead
alright 

what's the difference of never knowing at all
when every step i take is always too small?
maybe it's just something i can't admit
but lately, i feel like i don't give a shit

motivation's such an aggravation
accusations, don't know how to take them
inspiration's getting hard to fake it
concentration, never hard to break it
situation never what you want it to be

what's the point of never making mistakes?
self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break
it's all just a waste of time in the end
don't care, so why should i even pretend?

motivation's such an aggravation
accusations, don't know how to take them
inspiration's getting hard to fake it
concentration, never hard to break it
situation never what you wanted
nothing's new (everything's the same)
keeps on dragging me down (it's getting kind of lame)
falling further behind (there's nothing to explain)
no matter what you say, nothing's gonna change my mind


can't depend on doubt until the end
it seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend
and though i can't pretend, afraid to be this way
it's not the same, but who's to blame
for all those stupid things i never said?

motivation's such an aggravation
accusations, don't know how to take them
inspiration's getting hard to fake it
concentration, never hard to break it
motivation's such an aggravation
accusations, don't know how to take them
inspiration's getting hard to fake it
concentration, situation never what you want it to be

never what you want it to be
never what you want it to be 

where do i begin? 'cause my story's still untold
left to be unwritten like memories to unfold
and i don't believe the truth, it doesn't make me feel alive
the truth's just overrated, we've all got something to hide

cause lies make it so much fun
so sing the praise of insincerity
make this your last prayer
as the dream becomes your worst nightmare

i'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
i'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

pay me no more mind, have i really come undone?
i left the world this evening just to kill the sun
and i've got no more to bleed, all that's left will soon be gone
especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn
well i bet you got a lot to say
so have it your way and crucify me
make this your your last prayer
as the dream becomes your worst nightmare

i'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
i'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

breathless kiss to end all this, i fall, i say goodbye to all
close my eyes, oh, sweet demise, a love that no one understands

and i don't believe in redemption
and no one will be spared
there's 32 ways you can die here tonight
it's a fucking family affair


i'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
i'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head 

i'm not quite myself these days
guess we all come undone time to time in different ways, well
i have myself to blame
guess i don't understand, i need help in many ways

god's got a plan for me, well, i'm going to tell you one thing
i don't got the patience, or the time
what can i say, i'm no angel
i'm not forsaken, but i can bleed!

tear me open, i believe god will set you up to bleed
and no one can deceive what is meant to be
and "bloody murder!" we will scream

well, i guess it's time for me, tell me what i'm left to believe in
'cause i don't know the concept of the pain
i don't want the faith, i'll just lose it
i can prove it, watch me bleed!

tear me open, i believe god will set you up to bleed
and no one can deceive what is meant to be
and "bloody murder!" we will scream
god will set you up to tear me open!

'cause i'm (hey!) not giving up (hey!)
no self-control, suffocated to the plough
i'm my (hey!) worst enemy (hey!)
who can't be saved, i'm just his disgrace

tear me open, i believe god will set you up to bleed
and no one can deceive what is meant to be
and "bloody murder!" we will scream
god will set you up to tear me open!

these days are strange, it's true
there's not a thing that i would change, no mistakes that i'd undo... 

all bets are off, but you still think that you've got a right, well
your lucky days are numbered now, and you're to blame
you built a castle of sand, shaking the devil's hand well
at least i've still got my soul to sell

you've got to take me away, 'cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)
help me escape, 'cause i wanna be (i’ll take my last breath)
left to be free, i just wanna fake my own death

you played your part of the whore, you've got some kinda nerve
or have you forgot i don't forget? and you're too late
you walk beside the dead where the angels never tread well
at least i've still got a soul to sell

you've got to take me away, 'cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)
help me escape 'cause i wanna be (i’ll take my last breath)
left to be free, i just wanna fake my own death
there's nowhere to run from hell and above
i swear to god that someday there will be blood, shuh!


it all comes down in the end, in spite of me, you do it again
it all comes down in the end, in spite of you, i’ll do it again

you've got to take me away, 'cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)
help me escape, 'cause i wanna be (i’ll take my last breath)
left to be free, i just wanna fake my own death

shah!
