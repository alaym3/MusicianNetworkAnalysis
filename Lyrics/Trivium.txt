it's easy to be right
when everything repeats
it's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat

you always walk away
soon, you'll have to face it
your distance from reality
won't bury or erase it

living so complacent
but the problems wouldn't go away

i heard the passing bells calling out my name
i knew i'd never see another day
i couldn't swim against the tides of blame
i knew there was no other way
you better practice your lines
you better practice your words
i know that real monsters lie
between the light and the shade
it doesn't matter what you say or feel
when honest men become deranged
they'll genuflect to a lie
the sin and the sentence
penance in the fire

the flames grip your throat

guilty, but in the sight of fallen men
they bury you before you speak

these graves are cold and empty
he knew it's where we'd soon reside
the waves recede so gently
they only left the sands of time

(what have we done?)
to the future, we run
(what have we done?)
headlong without question
(what have we done?)
creations devised
(what have we done?)
to put an end to all life

a dead road
a dark sun
now waits beyond oblivion

appalled, he now averts his eyes
disgraced, he felt so empty

as i crawl through dirt and mud
i’m sinking under
in a grave of life that was
i saw a light

i turned my back on everything
i searched for half-remembered dreams
pulling me down with you
above my head, they’re circling
the vultures want what’s left of me
i sacrificed it all and i will fight

until the world goes cold
this battle’s burned all that i’ve known
until the world goes cold
nothing will keep me from this throne, i’ll fight
until the world goes cold
until the world goes cold

as i build my house of bones
you’re sinking under
for all your sins, you will atone
i burned it down
i turned my back on everything
i searched for half-remembered dreams
pulling me down with you
(i burned it down)
above my head, they’re circling
the vultures want what’s left of me
i sacrificed it all and i will fight

until the world goes cold
this battle’s burned all that i’ve known

nothing will keep me from this throne, i’ll fight

this battle has burned all
i’ll fight forevermore

i say betrayer
i swear i've given you so much
naysayer
i watched as you just lapped it up
unwilling
addicted to be without dignity
a cheater
you thrive on lechery
i don't know what i expected
was our time even real?
your callous heart never seemed affected
does a liar even know how to feel?

won't walk the earth a specter
won't hold my tongue from lashing out
this is my writ of honor
drawn by the blood that i have shed
the beasts will soon assemble (the beasts will soon assemble)
conjoining in their putrid flesh
their hearts don't beat desire
they pump violence and poison

flesh opens up, blood's retreating
flesh opens up, blood's retreating
death's embracing, all is ending
death's embracing, all is ending

time will not heal all of your pain
i cannot wait for it all to come crashing
down

the monsters walk among us (the monsters walk among us)
leeching the blood out from what's good
infecting at transmission
swallowing innocence from life
our time has come to stand forth (our time has come to stand forth)
the wretched womb from which they feed
behold the loathsome demons
send them into the hell they made
flesh opens up, blood's retreating
flesh opens up, blood's retreating
death's embracing, all is ending
death's embracing, all is ending

time will not heal all of your pain
i cannot wait for it all to come crashing
down on your face, ripping your veins out
your insides rend and kill you from within

and the seas will rise as serpents
spawned from the mouth of earth's surface
soon the skies will fall fast, burning
open wide and eat the suffering

the pulse is now quickening
softly, it's painstaking
look within to calm the storm
raging inside the form
there's no turning back
for i'm witness to the changing
take all you have brought to sacrifice
for you will lose much more
if you succeed in this battle
you still will lose so much more

time has come to face all evil
time has come to face all evil

now the seas rise up as serpents
spawned from the mouth of earth's surface
as the skies now fall fast burning
open wide and face the suffering

the inferno spews out hell's horde
casting the flames upon our world
as death eclipses all the light
we make our last stand, 'til death: fight
time will not heal all of your pain
i cannot wait for it all to come crashing
down!
time will not heal all of your pain

submerged in dirt, but it was never enough
to quell the fire in the back of my lungs
my bones are aching, and my head is a mess
they said to run, but i'm obsessed with the madness

this blood i bleed, i bleed for you
i paint the walls with my misery
this blood i bleed, i bleed for me
i cannot live if i can't breathe

the part i can't control, i can't destroy
the wretchedness inside
the wretchedness inside of you
the wretchedness inside of me

consigned to hurt, but it was never enough
to bury feelings that will surely return
my heart is aching, and my god, i'm a mess
i'll never run 'cause i'm obsessed with the madness

the face and the lips tremble as it rips
your breath quickening as heat rushes in

pull harder, strings, martyr
"stop!," you cry, "that's a lie!"
flush, gasping, white, reddening
you smile and destroy it, it's time that we end this

it's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings

clawing the skin, each kill, your weakness
annihilation, your masturbation, tyrant, i'll burn you down

he who walks the fire breathes!

he who walks the fire breathes
unlike the rest
living by the bloody creed
kiri-sute gomen

air of battle tasting stale
reeks of deceit
send the bitter straight to hell
kiri-sute gomen

in their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
unending, covetous hunger known as greed
as the last legion makes its way to the skies

i can see in their eyes
they've already died
inside, but as for the outside
i'll take their fucking heads
quake has bred with the storm
conceiving war
wicked stampeding hordes
kiri-sute gomen

in their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
unending, covetous hunger known as greed
as the last legion makes its way to the skies

i can see in their eyes
they've already died
inside, but as for the outside
i'll take their fucking heads
i can see in their eyes
they've already died
inside, but as for the outside
i'll take their fucking heads

i will never be what they
want me to
i live by my own path in life
no turning
back now, i won't be held down
forced into a shallow grave
built upon their empty ways
there's no turning back
there's hell to pay, such disarray
a bloodied mess, flesh masquerade
with all the blood making a flood
you made your path by crossing us


he who spits the fire seethes
all he detests
decapitating, bloody creed
kiri-sute gomen

in their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
unending, covetous hunger known as greed
as the last legion makes its way to the skies

i can see in their eyes
they've already died

a chasm grows
in the cavity of serpentine teeth (serpentine teeth)
hunger pangs strike
for the sweet feast of innocent blood
of innocent bloodshed
now here we go

the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
growing fat on the throne of an empire
tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

i've opened up my eyes
seen the world for what it's worth
tears rain down from the sky
they'll blow it all to bits
to prove whose god wields all the power
fire rains down from the sky

the gaping wounds
hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast (blood from which they feast)
eat us alive
consume to feed a hunger with no
a hunger with no end
let's fucking go
the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
growing fat on the throne of an empire
tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

i've opened up my eyes
seen the world for what it's worth
tears rain down from the sky
they'll blow it all to bits
to prove whose god wields all the power
fire rains down from the sky

this battle's not the same as they have led us to believe
a synthesis of propaganda, terror and deceit
we are the cattle; they the slaughter; our meat: gasoline
they pump us through the machine's valves to cleanse the world's "disease"
we are the ammunition that will cause all life to cease

annihilate
all those who stand in their way
obliterate
they'll rain their holocaust down from the sky
the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
the vampires feed on the wars of mankind
growing fat on the throne of an empire
tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

my anxiety's clawing
out from deep within me
it burns within as my throat
begins to cauterize
this negativity's leeching
any shred of composure
rationale has decayed and left
me bound in madness

i reach for calm
i starve for a balance unknown
this burden tortures me deep in my soul

i've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
nor will it take away the pain
i feel like this search is all in vain
and i struggle to find my way

how i yearn for the silence
for an end to the voices
the calamity grows and the
deafness leads to disarray
guilt buries me alive
in a coffin—criticized
i shouldered the blame and dug
this hole for me to lay in

i reach for calm
i starve for a balance unknown
this burden tortures me deep in my soul

i've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
nor will it take away the pain
i feel like this search is all in vain
and i struggle to find my way
i've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
nor will it take away the pain
i feel like this search is all in vain
and i struggle to find my way

i... i... i... i... i... i... i... i...

i've been waiting here on the outside
i've been watching you from afar
the color of your fear
confusion deep inside
resentment boils over
in me, you can confide
you say you've lost your world
you say you've lost your faith
i'll be the shelter in the dark
clothe you in my hate

profiteers and preachers
sycophants and leachers

the revanchist—his thoughts become mine
how deep they become intertwined
he said
"submit for salvation
submit for salvation"
the age-old lie
submit for salvation
i've been calling you from the twilight
i've been pushing you to the edge
the way you say my name
the poison on your tongue
the lies they tell—pay no mind
i am the only one
you never turned your back
you didn't need to see
'cause even in the dead of night
you found your way to me

profiteers and preachers
sycophants and leachers

in the court of the dragon
death of gods and world
in the court of the dragon
you will know your worth
hammer clenched
open mouth
living 'neath the tides of pain
surely any man would drown
horrid king
cries unheard
bathed in blood
you'll get what you deserved
burning home
only child
hidden from the deadly ones
hunted far but never found
nightmare past
haunting him
bides his time
sinks into the sea
in the court of the dragon
death of gods and world
in the court of the dragon
you will know your worth
final clash
beast and man
rising from the violent waves
with the bloodied head in hand
open mouth
swallowing the king
gods devoured whole
light extinguishing
no more
will the sun look down to illuminate the world
in spite of all the hate behind these eyes
i've seen that only one of us survives
i'm here to destroy you, i'm here to avenge
in the court of the dragon i descend
the stars have died and the heavens go up in flames
earth
sinks

my gospel of greed

i'd be thrown into the fire

i can't let go

what the dead men say
it's just between us
what the dead men say
you can't let go
what the dead men say
it's just between us
what the dead men say
you can't let go

is this the light
or a distant mirror?
you've kept me for yourself
that much is clear

what the dead men say
it's just between us
what the dead men say
you can't let go
what the dead men say
it's just between us
what the dead men say
you can't let go
what the dead men say
what the dead men say
you can't let go
what the dead men say
it's just between us
what the dead men say
you can't let go 

is it a sin
to miss the hell
that you survived
with best of friends
at worst of times?
i never got the answer
they never told me
if you're not careful
what doesn't kill you
can control you
now it defines me
and it reminds me
that it will never let me go

if we share the pain
then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

i try to change
but the dawn escapes again
i fight another endless night

when it gets dark
i cannot breathe
it's only the sound
of grinding teeth
afraid of the silence
and its lurking violence
your empty words
the feigned concern
we go through the motions
i'll never return
'cause it still defines me
and it reminds me
that it will never let me go

if we share the pain
then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

i try to change
but the dawn escapes again
i fight another endless night
i try to change
but the dawn escapes again
i fight another endless night

i try to change
but the dawn escapes again
i fight another endless night
is it a sin
to miss the hell
that you survived
with best of friends
at worst of times?
i fight another endless night

i try to change
but the dawn escapes again
i fight another endless night

when it gets dark
i cannot breathe
it's only the sound
of grinding teeth
afraid of the silence
i fight another endless night 

we're dreaming in color
believing no other
no other
we're dreaming in color
believing no other
no other

is there hope
to break through
all the walls
built around you?
you're like a song within a nightmare
a thought within a scream
dim the world
a glassy stare
face to face now
do you even care to try to understand
where we went wrong
or how it seems

we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds
we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds

broken mast
shipwrecked mind
future sinks
by design
you're like a song within a nightmare
a thought within a scream
lost our minds
lost our way
face to face now
do you even care to try to understand
where we went wrong
or how it seems

we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds
we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds

someone wake me from this nightmare
i can't even tell what's real
someone wake me from this nightmare
i can't even tell what's real

we're dreaming in color
but we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds
we're dreaming in color
but we're living in other worlds
we've lost our way in the other worlds

we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds
we're dreaming in color
believing no other
'cause we're living in other worlds
breathing in other worlds
