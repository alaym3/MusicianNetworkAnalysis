i grew up on the crime side, the new york times side
stayin' alive was no jive
had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i begin the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen
who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question, i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question, i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
catchin' keys from 'cross seas
rollin' in mpv's, every week we made forty g's
yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the tec-9
ch-chick-pow! move from the gate now

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all
cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all

it's been twenty-two long, hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not—
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned, i learned life is hell
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryna hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money

to set it off
(watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid)
the inspectah deck!

i smoke on the mic like "smokin' joe" frazier
the hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
terrorize the jam like troops in pakistan
swingin' through your town like your neighborhood spider-man
so uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
while i get ya flippin' off the shit that i'm kickin'
the lone ranger, code red, danger
deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
the vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're sayin' "goodbye" like tevin campbell
roughneck, inspectah deck's on the set
the rebel, i make more noise than heavy metal

the way i make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
rhymes rugged and built like schwarzenegger
and i'ma get mad deep like a threat
blow up your project, then take all your assets
'cause i came to shake the frame in half
with the thoughts that bomb shit like math
so if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'cause i grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, i got
goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh

it's the method man, for short mr. meth
movin' on your left, aah!
and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
i wanna break full, cock me back
small change, they puttin' shame in the game
i take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
and like fame my style'll live forever
niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
but i do, true, can i get a "suue"
enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
i mean o, yo check out the flow
like the hudson or pcp when i'm dustin'
niggas off, because i'm hot like sauce
the smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
oww, here comes my shaolin style
true b-a-ba-b-y-u
to my crew with the "suuuuue"

yeah, yeah, yeah (watch your step, kid)

(watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid)
yo, you best protect ya neck

first things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
i'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
i'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you step through to
the ol' dirty bastard straight from the brooklyn zoo
and i'll be damned if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
you can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
the ol' dirty bastard is dirty and stinkin'
ason unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
bite my style, i'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

for cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
not long is how long that this rhyme took me
ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stompin' grounds
i give an order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin' star
'cause who i are is livin' the life of pablo escobar
point-blank as i kick the square biz
there it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
it's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
feelin' mad hostile, wearing aeropostale
flowin' like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your fuckin' chin
slayin' boom-bangs like african drums, we'll be
comin' around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare, g-gka-genius
take us the fuck outta here

the wu is too slammin' for these cold killin' labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doin' artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for tryna blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors, they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a&r?
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
but he don't know the meanin' of dope
when he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight
matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

you best protect ya neck
you best protect ya neck
you best protect ya neck
you best protect ya neck

a game of chess is like a swordfight:
you must think first before you move
toad style is immensely strong
and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used it's almost invincible

raw i'ma give it to ya
with no trivia
raw like cocaine straight from bolivia
my hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
like the emancipation proclamation
weak mc's
approach with slang that's dead
you might as well run into the wall and bang your head
i'm pushin' force
my force you're doubtin'
i'm makin' devils cower to the caucasus mountains

well, i'm a sire
i set the microphone on fire
rap styles vary
and carry like mariah
i come from the shaolin slum
and the isle i'm from
is comin' through with nuff niggas
and nuff guns
so if you wanna come sweatin'
stressin', contestin'
you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
don't talk the talk
if you can't walk the walk
phony niggas are outlined in chalk
i'm mad vexed
it's what the projects made me
rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler with a drunk driver drivin'
there's no survivin'

rough like timberland wear
yeah!
me and the clan in 'yota landcruisers out there
peace to all the crooks
all the niggas with bad looks
bald heads, braids
blow this hook

nickel-plated mac's
black ac's
drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks

tryin' to be
a hip-hop mc
the law
in order to enter the wu-tang

represent the gza, abbot, rza, shaquan
inspectah deck
dirty ho gettin' low with his flow
introducin' the ghostface killah
no one could get iller

my peoples, are you with me? where you at?
in the front, in the back, killa beez on attack
my peoples, are you with me? where you at?
smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats

speakin' of the devil, psych!

mega trife, and yo, i killed you in a past life
on the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
you reneged, tried again and got blasted
half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
when i struck i had on timbs and a black mask

i know you don't remember jack
that night, yo i was hittin' like a spiked bat
until you thought i was bugged out and crazy
strapped for nonsense
after me became lazy
yo, nobody budge while i shot slugs
never shot thugs
i'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
so, grab your eight plus one
start flippin' and trippin'
niggas is jettin', i'm lickin' off, son

wu! tang! wu! tang!
wu! tang! wu! ta-a-ang!

homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
what justifies the homicide
when he dies
in his own iniquity?
it's the master of the mantis rapture comin' at ya
we have an apb
on an mc killer
looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates that his stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow
changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie, paralysin' the victim
you scream
as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
and injure
any motherfuckin' contender

my peoples, are you with me? where you at?
in the front, in the back, killa beez on attack
my peoples, are you with me? where you at?
smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats

and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used it's almost invincible
toad style is immensely strong
and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used it's almost invincible
when it's properly used

what? y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
i'm the osiris of this shit
wu-tang is here forever, motherfuckers
this like, this '97
aight my niggas and my niggarettes
let's do it like this
i'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
let's take it back to '79

i bomb atomically, socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
can't define how i be dropping these mockeries
lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
ultraviolet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets, queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight, incite a war
chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow, swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

as the world turns, i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life, standing firm
on foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan
into the fire, transform into the ghost rider
a six-pack and a streetcar named desire
who got my back? in the line of fire, holding back
what? my peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
what the blood clot? we smoke pot, and blow spots
you wanna think twice? i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums

i twist darts from the heart, tried and true
loop my voice on the lp
martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
vocabulary 'donna talking, tell your story walking
take cover, kid, what? run for your brother, kid
run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme
your thought is basic compared to mine
domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my thought
i got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to god

the saga continues
wu-tang, wu-tang

olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
we crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
judgment day cometh, conquer, it's war
allow us to escape hell, globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the shitty mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
my orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
my music sicily, rich california smell
an axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing, sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

march of the wooden soldiers, c-cypher-punks couldn't hold us
a thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like flare
escape from your dragon's lair
in particular, my beats travel like a vortex
through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat bass lines on novation
getting drunk like i'm fucking ducking five-year probation

war of the masses, the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls, engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for the acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
came one to represent the nation
this is a gathering of the masses
that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

yo, yo, yo, fuck that!
look at all these crab niggas laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend
bitches never heard you scream
you two-faces, scum of the slum, i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in '81
sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
hands like sonny liston, get fly permission
hold the fuck up, i'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
i humiliate, separate the english from the dutch
it's me, black noble drew ali, came in threes
we like the genovese, sazon season these degrees
it's earth, 93 million miles from the first
rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

a-yo, that's amazing
gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
connect thoughts to make my man child walk
swift notarizer, blue-tang, all up in the high-riser
new york yank visor, word tranquilizer
adjust the dosage, delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
tear down the beat, god, then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
track truck diesel, play the weed god substantiala
max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland

yeah, torture, motherfucker, what?
torture, nigga, what?
what? i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin' tie you to a fuckin' bedpost
with your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right?
put a hanger on a fuckin' stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like "tsss"
yeah, i'll fuckin', yeah, i'll fuckin' lay your nuts on a fuckin' dresser, just your nuts layin' on a fuckin' dresser, and bang them shits with a spiked fuckin' bat (blaow)
ooh wassup?
i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin', pull your fuckin' tongue out your fuckin'
mouth and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, blaow
i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin' hang you by your fuckin' dick off the fuckin' twelfth stor-story building out this motherfucker
i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin', sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you
yo, roll the dice, yo, roll the dice
yo, so it's goin' down like that, huh? yeah?

let's get technical; where's your bone at?

niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
back in the days, i'm 8 now
makin' a tape now, rae gotta get a plate now
ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'til i got (blaow! blaow! blaow!) felt one
yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
shootin' that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream
that's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
and niggas know that habit's behind me
day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
now i'm a weed fiend jettin' to palmetto
in medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
pushin' the big joint from down south
so if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
now my man from up north, now he got the loft
it's solid as a rock and crazy salt
no jokes, i'm not playin', get his folks
desert eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
and to know for sure, i got reck and rip shop
i pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(yo, rae, don't do that shit, man! don't do that shit!)
fuck that!

dedicated to the winners and the losers
(dedicated to all jeeps and land cruisers)
can it be that it was all so simple then?
dedicated to the 5's, 850i's
(dedicated to niggas who do drive-by's)
can it be that it was all so simple then?
dedicated to the lexus and the ac's
(dedicated to mpv's: phat!)

kickin' the fly clichés, doin' duets with rae and a
happens to make my day
though i'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
i'd rather flip shows instead of those
hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
i want to lamp, i want to be in the shade
plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
i want to have me a phat yacht
and enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
but for now it's just a big dream
'cause i find myself in a place where i'm last seen
my thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'cause times is changed and life is strange
the glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
yo, mad lives is up for grabs
brothers passin' away, i gotta make wakes
receivin' all types of calls from upstate
yo, i can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
the god left lessons on my dresser
so i can bloom and blossom, find a new way
to continue to make more hits with rae and a
sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
(peace to mankind, ghostface carry a black 9, nigga)
word up, it's all like that… yeah

you know what i'm sayin'? (word)

after laughter comes tears

check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
had a box, 'boom boom' the bass would blast
we was laughin' at all the girls that passed
conversation, brothers had began to discuss
(hey yo, rob, remember that kid you bust?)
aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'cause i dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
my little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
"hey, shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!"
but he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "no!"
money splattered him, bow! then he snatched the bag
hit his pockets, then he jetted up the ave
girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(hey, rakeem!) what? (your little brother got shot!)
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up, then i held him by his head
his eyes shut, that's when i knew he was…
aw man! how do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks, of us laughin' all the time
i taught him all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

after laughter comes tears

me and my man, my ace big moe from the shelter
'bout to hit the skins from this girl named thelma
now, thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
moe said he'll go first, i said i'll take next
here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
he seemed to ignore, i said, "be for real!
she's not even worth it to go raw deal."
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got butt-naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by, moe, i'm out without a doubt
i'm not pumpin' up, i am airin' out
hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
i'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
but he carried on with the same old stuff
with stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
moe tried to be down with o.p.p
ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the h.i.v
now no life to live, doc says two more years
so after the laughter i guess comes the tears

after laughter comes tears

reunited, double lp, world excited
struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
where i come from, getting visuals is habitual
you're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internal streamlined compartments
just consider the unparalleled advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
i smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
your treasure sunk, i be fucking bitches by the chunk

hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
attack when you least notice through explosive postage
i don't play, the rap souffle sauté for the day
ruler zig-zag-zig a leg leg arm head
spread like plague, we drink hennessy by the keg
i got the golden egg plus the goose
eighty proof absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
ginseng root, i got your neck in a noose
keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than kinko
grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
and we return like jesus when the whole world need us

is it appetite for destruction?
slap a murder rap on this production
i touch something, trust nothing
iron lung/twisted metal
i see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle

evergreen baggies, selling capsules, running in classrooms
slick bastards get cream, yelling 'cash rule!'

hold a mac 1-o, pumpin' up in 1 oak, the grammy hour
coke chemists taste the flow, it's numb, needs copper rum
blunting off the get back, salute me then one, i'm out

jammies carry nitrogen, light up a section like i'm on vicodin

online gangstas, i'm giving them screenshots
hard writing lyrics to god, right?
twisting the tale, sick as hell, christian bale from the dark knight

swayze at the road house, down for the bar fight

before the seahawks' 24, lord, i been on that beast shit
pussy, you wack, something like a cheap trick
mike in the billie jean vid, i got the streets lit
shining star, find another, you gon' find it hard
certain death, deck'll walk off with minor scars
firing squad, defying the odds
and the flow solitary, just me behind the bars

sparks up the bullet-proof, game face intensity
applying ingenuity, tec criminology
sharp mathematically
certified, recognized by every eye worldwide
back to the streets of the do or die hustler
i understand politics, consistent, never quit
superstar, i write hits
come have a listen y'all, getting money, flipping it
scripting it, record it, fans then applaud it
ship a hundred mil', they bought and took a snort of it
quotes like heroin coke mixed with dope

they stiff 'cause their wisdom was stripped when i'm attacking

dealing with the claim baby

they getting deals and... 'everybody got a deal and everybody happy and shit'
the wu-tang, we the best

yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
the young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world, the order slaughter men, women and children
ten feet gates surround the building, keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, except for threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performin' a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
tryin' to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too minute to dilute the scientist mind

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other divisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads to skin irritations
babies being born with disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces, there bear worry-ations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain
screams of terror are hidden by the passin' trains
this can't be little hussein
his uncle cries as he drops to his nephew's side, holdin' his cane
just give me a name
of who has inflicted this bitter sickness, and left us to witness

yo, curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
the wise shall flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
while we die, hard-livin' people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and killin' what's revealin'
it's a never endin' battle with no endin' or beginnin', listen
zero process, progress, become the hunted
america's most wanted, good life, flaunt it, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some wanna be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and it caught my little seed
can it be? the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

y'all bitches love dances, and pullin' down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spendin' up his advances
your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
the whole projects is trapped in six
you either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
ninety-nine cent beer drinkin', pussy stinkin'
fuckin' so much, your ass and titties start shrinkin'
new world order slave trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays?
inside my lab, i'm goin' mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breakin' down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn early light
why is sons fightin' for the stripe?

as we dwell through this concrete hell, callin' it home
mama say, "take your time, young man, and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searchin' for them glory days he never had"
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everythin' now, we goin' down
these babies lookin' up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, lust and hate separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer brothers, we unstable
like cain when he slew abel, killin' each other

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you

blowin hydro on a beach wit tamiko
my gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
one in the head, this is code red, man for dead
x amount of lead spray from the barrel
heat clear the street like connor o'carroll
fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
to make my niggas from east new york flip

yo, you may catch me in a pair of polo skipperys, matching cap
razor blades in my gums (bobby!)
you may catch me in yellow havana joe's goose jumper
and my phaser off stun (bobby!)

signin 7 and a sun (bobby!)

thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
get your shit together 'fore the fuck illuminati hit
dreams is free and escape is sleep
for a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
the rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
the sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
the whole babylon, times up, move on
kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
supposed through the gate, case closed things get froze
when it comes time, chosen ones will hold the guns
we take flight with no fright
and attack, never fear 'cause our words is clear
what's been done can't be undone, son, we can't care
'cause the last days and times are surely here
snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
divine minds bind, we unified as one
half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
our everlastin' essence stay flyin' over egypt

for you to defeat, the gods
impossible, you can never defeat the gods
impossible
for you to defeat, the gods

call an ambulance, jamie been shot, word to kimmy
don't go, son, nigga, you my motherfucking heart
stay still, son, don't move, just think about keeba
she'll be three in january, your young god needs ya
the ambulance is takin' too long
everybody get the fuck back, excuse me, bitch, gimme your jack
1-7-1-8, 9-1-1, low battery, damn
blood comin' out his mouth, he bleedin' badly
nahhh, jamie, don't start that shit
keep your head up, if you escape hell, we gettin' fucked up
when we was eight, we went to bat day to see the yanks
in '69, his father and mines, they robbed banks
he pointed to the charm on his neck
with his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
i opened it, seen the god holdin' his kids
photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
plus he dropped one
oh shit, here come his old earth with no shoes on
screamin', holdin' her breasts with a gown on
she fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
rubbed his hair, turned around, the ambulance was there
plus the blue coats, officer lough, took it as a joke
weeks ago he strip-searched the god and gave him back his coke
bitches yellin', beenie man swung on helen
in the back of a cop car, dirty tasha tellin'
but suddenly, a chill came through, it was weird
felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
laid on the stretcher, blood on his wally's like ketchup
deep like the paul assassination with a sketch of it
it can't be, from yoo-hoo to lee's
second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
finally, this closed chapter comes to an end
he was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at 12:10

now what my man is tryin' to tell y'all
is that across the whole globe
the murder rates is increasin', and we decreasin'
so at the same time, when you play with guns
when you play with guns, son
that causes the conflict of you goin' against your own
you hear me? so let's pay attention
straight up and down, 'cause this is only a story
from the real
