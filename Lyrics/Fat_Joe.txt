yo, yo, i stand alone in this cold world, could you believe that?
i've seen some good men get blown over g-packs
in the bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
and live niggas get it on with the d-techs, shit, my life's legendary
if i wrote down all in a book it would be very scary
what you know 16 beamers and benzes
rope chain down to my dick, the beef looks tremendous
me and my niggas flip holes in bitches
back then, when i wouldn't even pose for bitches
a-yo, you can ask dapper dan who was the man
back in 88, every other week tricked 30 grand
even my bitches wore gucci and louie
my peeps already in the crowd looking for groupies to screw me
exit the club, about to cruise up the block now
with the taj, stay frontin' with top down
see me in that new thing with my fiancee
ass so fat, making you say "muchos grande"
don't blame me, blame them, the white folk
for giving me ten mil, for possessin' the tight flow
whoa

joey crack is, the most official
toke the pistol for those who appose the issue
i hope i convinced you to back up, really you acted up, believe me
i could easily get your ass touched
and that sucks, ain't nobody could fuck with this
pull a suge move and make you take a bucket of piss
for runnin' your lips
got the fifth stuck in your ribs, don't make me...
splash your lungs right in front of your kids
i'm a basketcase, don't ever give this bastard space
or i'mma have your ass erased
i'm from the bronx amongst corrupt cops, we mothered this rap shit
but still don't get enough props
all i hear is "gangsta" you ain't build like that
don't make me have to pull a tool and really tilt your cap
i'm from crills to crack
you've been dealin' with rap
you ain't never run the streets, now i'm revealing your act
