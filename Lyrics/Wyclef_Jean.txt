she take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
so respect her, or pay up for the time used
and then she runs to the pastor
and he tells her there will be a new chapter
but she feels no different after
and then she ask him: "where my money at?"

(guan-tana-mera... guajira guan-tana-mera...)

yo, i wrote this in haiti, overlooking cuba
i asked her what's her name, she said, 'guantanamera'
remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
on his old forty-five when he used to be alive
she went from a young girl, to a grown woman
like a virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
pac woman better yet space invader
if your name was chun-li, we'd be playin street fighter
penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
a dime if you tell me that you love me

(guantanamera) hey yo i'm standing at the bar with a, cuban cigar
(guajira, guantanamera) hey, yo, i think she's eyeing me from afar
(guan-tana-mera... guajira guan-tana-mera...)
 
soy una mujer, sincera -do you speak english?)
de donde crecen las palmas -can i buy you a drink?
soy una mujer, sincera - uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
de donde creeeeeeecen las palmas
y antes de morir, yo quiero
cantar mis versos del alma - te quiero mama, te quiero!!

(guantanamera) hey yo i'm standing at the bar with a, cuban cigar
(guajira, guantanamera) hey yo john fortÃ©, she's eyeing me from far
(guan-tana-mera... guajira guan-tana-mera...)

yo, she was a rose in spanish harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
pure traits of genius, goddess of black venus
crab niggas angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
the lexicon of lexington, parents came from cuba
part mexican, pure sweet, dons fell to her feet
she like movado, and shook her hips like delgado
and broke niggas down from the grounds to apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
and waited patiently while the businessmen come
call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
and made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
this gentle flower, fertility was her power
sweet persona, venus flytrap primadonna
que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

(guantanamera) hey yo i'm standing at the bar with a, cuban cigar
(guajira, guantanamera) hey, yo, i think she's eyeing me from afar

if i was president
all blacks would have reparation no segregation
feed the nation so there's no famine
muslims, jews, christians, would all hold hands
every week on the beach, party by the sand
word up, take trips on air force one
only to bring the homeless with no sneaks the air force ones
better schools in the hoods, better teachers in the classes
making money paying no taxes
find the best scientists, tell them come up with the answer

and you're bout to smell what the rock is cookin'
yo, this is strictly a club record

and these tired bouncers would not let me in
youknowwhati'msayin?

(it doesn't matter!)
i just won the bingo bought a crib in rio
(it doesn't matter!)
cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

back in the days it was all about the clubs
and the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
the girls, they wouldn't say hey!
unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
me, i used to stand outside
hustlin my way in i'm on the guest list plus five!
who's performin' tonight? he said shabba
mister lover daddy he be the selector
(someone jump the rock's up in here)
disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
light up like vegas when it's time to gamble
girls scream for me like i was part of the beatles
but i'm not honey, but i could be your paul mccartney
and "ebony or ivory" into my jacuzzi
foundation like kool herc, or dj red alert goes bezerk
the needle ain't skip the record jerked
cause y'all jumpin' too hard
(hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!)

i got fifty bentley's in the west indies
(it doesn't matter!)
i got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(it doesn't matter!)

yo, rock i just bought a fresh bentley
(it doesn't matter you just bought a fresh bentley!)

how many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
and you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
and they start it off like this
electric slide on the dance floor
freaky-deaky like studio 54
girls!! until the irs raids it
drug money get converted into music
the dope man becomes an entertainer
leave that crack alone! i told the customers
i'm into bigger and better things mr. fiend
you want a hit? give me a guitar and a drum machine
and the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
i can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
{*cough cough*} excuse me i gotta cough
girl you wearing so much ice you could freeze new york
your man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(he works on wall street he's only home two nights a week)

think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
so i proceeded with the conversation, i said
can i offer you a glass of merlot mrs. no name?
(let's get it straight huh, my name's veronica)
she had the ass the size of south america
she said ain't you that kid that sing guantanamera
way before ricky martin sung "livin' la vida loca"
what hood you come from?
i was raised in brooklyn, but did my studies in jerusalem
the new jerusalem?
yup, that's short for new jersey
checked my watch it was a quarter to three
slid to her crib when we opened the door
her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

now what it look like, it ain't really that
(it doesn't matter!)
so he cocked the gat at my top hat
(it doesn't matter!)
are you crazy? you was married!
(it doesn't matter!)
'cause if you ain't sharin', people ain't carin'
come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin'

yeah, that's when shorty walked up to her man
and she said i gotta go i can't be here no more
and she said this
take me home, to the place
i belong at the refugee camp
and the booga basement
that's where i live, oh

instead of spending billions on the war
i can use that money, to feed the poor
i know some so poor, when it rains that's when they shower
when screaming "fight the power"
that's when the vulture devoured

on this planet that can replace rwandaâ€¦

oh we canâ€™t waste no time
these are the days of lives
when we will fall
just so we can rise
just so we can rise

a cinderellaâ€™s ball
last call for alcohol
the saints marching in
while us sinners play the drums
when the shackles are broken
thatâ€™s when we all will run free
and we will no longer worship the beast
what once was built
i seen sadness destroy
but it make my faith stronger
i believe in the joy
and passion has kicked in
like a thief in the night
and the touch feels like eternal life

weâ€™re on borrowed time
clock keeps ticking
days keep passing
oh we canâ€™t waste no time
these are the days of lives
when we will fall
just so we can rise
just so we can rise

uh huh, ice-cubes in my drink, itâ€™s a good day
seen a drive by turn to love parade
battleship turns to the love boat
refugees found our home that weâ€™re looking for
no more robberies, everybody equal
found the cure for the cancer, no more diseases
no bombs falling from the skyline
peace treaty, everybody co-sign
colorblind, we all one people
one love, like a bob marley sequel
iâ€™m sitting back listen to john lennon
imagined that it happened

weâ€™re on borrowed time
clock keeps ticking
days keep passing
oh we canâ€™t waist no time
these are the days of lives
when we will fall
just so we can rise
just so we can rise
weâ€™re on borrowed time

yo mona lisa, could i get a date on friday?
and if you're busy, i wouldn't mind taking saturday
right about now, if you are in your jeep, please turn up your radio
if you don't have a jeep, and you have a little hooptie, i still want you to crank up your volume
we want all the ladies to sit back, relax, let your hair out
wyclef presents the neville brothers in the house tonight

i know a girl, she ruled my world
whatever i need, she supplied
living in paradise
she ruled my heart, 'til death do we part (her love was like ecstasy)

at least that's how i thought it would be
(so neville brothers what you telling me)
at least that how i thought it would be
(one question, what was her name?)
mona lisa, you called my name
laid it apart but i did not respond
and you ask me what i am thinking of
in the morning i'll be gone, no more loving after dawn
no longer we can share the love that was never there
when the moon has lost its light
and the stars no longer bright
and no longer can we share, the love that was never there
(ain't no need to cry, girl, it's gonna be alright)

girl, don't you cry (girl, don't you cry)
please dry your eyes
all you ever been was faithful in my life
so i apologize
i hope the future brings us back together
at least that's how i thought it would be
at least that's how i thought it would be (yo, neville brothers, what was her name?)

at least that's how i thought it would be
(so neville brothers what you telling me)
at least that how i thought it would be
(one question, what was her name?)
mona lisa, you called my name
laid it apart but i did not respond
and you ask me what i am thinking of
in the morning i'll be gone, no more loving after dawn
no longer we can share the love that was never there
when the moon has lost its light
and the stars no longer bright
and no longer can we share, the love that was never there
(ain't no need to cry, girl, it's gonna be alright)

right about now if you are in dance, i want you to hold your girl real tight
we got the neville brothers in the house tonight alongside wyclef
you know how we do it, i want to apologize to you
i never wrote a love song, this is my first one
