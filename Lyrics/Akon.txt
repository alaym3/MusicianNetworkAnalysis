pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
the way she climbs up and down them poles
lookin' like one of them putty-cat dolls
tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
steps upstage, didn't think i saw her
creeps up behind me, and she's like "you're —"
i'm like, "i know, let's cut to the chase"
no time to waste, back to my place
plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
or more like a palace, shall i say
and plus, i got a pal if your gal is game
in fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (akon!)

oh, i'm so lonely

yo, this one here goes out
to all my players out there, man
you know, that got that one good girl, dawg
that's always been there, man
like, took all the bullshit
but then one day she can't take it no more
and decides to leave me

yeah, i woke up in the middle of the night
and i noticed my girl wasn't by my side
could've sworn i was dreamin'
for her i was feenin'
so i had to take a little ride
backtrackin' on these few years
tryin' to figure out what i do to make it go bad
‘cause ever since my girl left me
my whole life came crashin', and i'm so…

lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)

oh, i'm so lonely

can't believe i had a girl like you
and i just let you walk right out of my life
after all i put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side
what really hurt me is i broke your heart
baby, you a good girl and i had no right
i really wanna make things right
‘cause without you in my life, girl, i'm so…

lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)

oh, i'm so lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)
i have nobody (i have nobody)
for my own (to call my own, baby)
oh, i'm so lonely

been all about the world
ain't never met a girl
that could take the things that you been through
never thought the day would come
where you would get up and run
and i would be out chasin' you
‘cause ain't nowhere in the globe i'd rather be
ain't no one in the globe i'd rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be
so happy, but now so lonely

lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)
i have nobody (i have nobody)
for my own (to call my own, girl)
oh, i'm so lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)
i have nobody (i have nobody)
for my own (to call my own, girl)
oh, i'm so lonely

never thought that i'd be alone
i didn't think you'd be gone this long
i just want you to call my phone
so stop playin', girl, and come on home
baby girl, i didn't mean to shout
i want me and you to work it out
i never wished that i would ever hurt my baby
and it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause i'm so…

lonely (so lonely)
i'm mr. lonely (mr. lonely)
i have nobody (i have nobody)
for my own (to call my own, girl)
oh, i'm so lonely (so lonely)

as life goes on
i'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
and i realize that everything i do
is affecting the people around me
so i wanted to take this time out
to apologize for things that i've done
and things that haven't occured yet
and things that they don't want to take responsibility for

i'm sorry for the times that i left you home
i was on the road and you were alone
i'm sorry for the times that i had to go
i'm sorry for the fact that i did not know
that you were sitting home, just wishing we
could go back to when it was just you and me
i'm sorry for the times i would neglect
i'm sorry for the times i disrespect
i'm sorry for the wrong things that i've done
i'm sorry i'm not always there for my sons
i'm sorry for the fact that i'm not aware
that you can't sleep at night when i am not there
because i'm in the streets like every day
i'm sorry for the things that i did not say
like how you are the best thing in my world
and how i'm so proud to call you my girl

i understand that there's some problems and i'm not too blind to know
all the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
if i can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
i'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
said you could put the blame on me
said you could put the blame on me
said you could put the blame on me
you could put the blame on me

i'm sorry for the things that he put you through
and all the times you didn't know what to do
i'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from dad
when you would rather be home with all your kids
as one big family with love and bliss
and even though pops treated us like kings
he got a second wife and you didn't agree
he got up and left you there all alone
i'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
i'm sorry that i went and added to your grief
i'm sorry that your son was once a thief
i'm sorry that i grew up way too fast
i wish i would've listened and not be so bad
i'm sorry that your life turned out this way
i'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

i understand that there are some problems and i'm not too blind to know
all the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
if i can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
i'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
said you could put the blame on me
said you could put the blame on me (oh yeah)
said you could put the blame on me
you could put the blame on me

i'm sorry that it took so long to see
that they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
i'm sorry that it took so long to speak
but i was on tour with gwen stefani
i'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
for the embarrassment that she felt
just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
her daddy should've never let her out that young
i'm sorry for club zen getting shut down
i hope they manage better next time around
how was i to know she was underage?
in a 21-and-older club they say
why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
verizon backed out, disgracing my name
i'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
because i love my fans i'll take that blame

even though the blame's on you
even though the blame's on you
even though the blame's on you
i'll take that blame from you
and you can put that blame on me (on me)
and you can put that blame on me
you can put that blame on me (blame's on me)
and you can put that blame on me (blame's on me)
and you can put that blame on me
and you can put that blame on me

ghetto, ghetto
ghetto, ghetto livin'

these streets remind me of quicksand
when you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
and there's no one to hold on to
and there's no one to pull you out
you keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
so you end up self-destructin'
on the corner with the toolie on the waist line
just got up out the thing doin' state time
teeth marks on my back from the k-9
dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘cause they said that i wouldn't make it
i remember like yesterday
holdin' on to what god gave me

‘cause that's the life
when you're livin' in the (ghetto)
and eatin' in the (ghetto)

ghetto, that's the life
when you're livin' in the (ghetto)
and eatin' in the (ghetto)
oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

no need to cherish luxuries
‘cause everything come and go
even the life that you have is borrowed
‘cause you're not promised tomorrow
so live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
once you've moved forward
you can't go back just to remove your past
‘cause you gotta be willin' to pray
yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
a lot a niggas dead or locked away
teenage women growin' up with aids

‘cause that's the life
when you're livin' in the (ghetto)
oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
ghetto, that's the life
when you're livin' in the (ghetto)
oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
everyday is a fight in the (ghetto)

i wrote my first hit in the ghetto
yo mona lisa, can i get a date on friday-ay-ay
it's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
the night they blast my cousin, whoa
i had to find a way out the ghetto
picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
haters used to hate in the ghetto
said i would have never made it out the ghetto
i guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
even though annie said the sun come out tomorrow
but the ghetto stay dark
i never thought i'd ever see the billboard charts



been a long day, on my way
to my holy place to pray
give thanks for every blessing given to me
i know there's more to see, more to me
no more living in misery
cause this how i vision life to be
search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
i just know there's a sunny day
