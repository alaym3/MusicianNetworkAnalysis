in this time of desperation
when all we know is doubt and fear
there is only one foundation
we believe, we believe

in this broken generation
when all is dark, you help us see
there is only one salvation
we believe, we believe

we believe in god the father
we believe in jesus christ
we believe in the holy spirit
and he's given us new life
we believe in the crucifixion
we believe that he conquered death
we believe in the resurrection
and he's comin' back again
we believe

so, let our faith be more than anthems
greater than the songs we sing
and in our weakness and temptations
we believe, we believe
we believe in god the father
we believe in jesus christ
we believe in the holy spirit
and he's given us new life
we believe in the crucifixion
we believe that he conquered death
we believe in the resurrection
and he's comin' back again

let the lost be found and the dead be raised
in the here and now, let love invade
let the church live loud, "our god" we'll say
we believe, we believe
and the gates of hell will not prevail
for the power of god has torn the veil
now we know your love will never fail
we believe, we believe

we believe in god the father
we believe in jesus christ
we believe in the holy spirit
and he's given us new life
we believe in the crucifixion
we believe that he conquered death
we believe in the resurrection
and he's comin' back
he's comin' back again
he's comin' back again
we believe
we believe 

when did it become breaking a rule
to say your name out loud in school
when your names the only one that sets us free
when did it become incorrect
to speak the truth about life and death
when your life gave us all eternity

even if it gets me convicted
i'll be on my knees with my hands lifted

if serving you's against the law of man
if living out my faith in you is banned
then i'll stand right before the jury
if saying i believe is out of line
if i'm judged cause i'm gonna give my life
to show the world the love that fills me
then i want to be guilty

i'll rise up and honor you
i'll testify to all the good you do
'cause your grace and your mercy have overtaken me
so even if it gets me convicted
i'll still be on my knees with my hands lifted

if serving you's against the law of man
if living out my faith in you is banned
then i'll stand right before the jury
if saying i believe is out of line

guilty by association
guilty of being a voice proclaiming your ways
your truth
your life
i'll pay the price to be your light

i found myself lookin' into the mirror
knew i wasn't who i wanted to be
i was living life the way that i wanted
but my eyes reminded me i'm not free

believed a lie so everything that i know
says i gotta go, tired of going solo
but i'm never gonna go there again

this is what it is, this is who i am
this is where i finally take my stand
i didn't wanna fall, but i don't have to crawl
i met the one with two scarred hands
givin' him the best of everything that's left of
the life inside this man
i've been born again

i see you're walkin' like you're living in fear
havin' trouble even looking at me
wishin' they would give you more than words
sick of people tellin' how it should be (how it should be)
what'd ya download? where'd you get your info?
you saw their hype show, now you're in the in-know
gonna tell you what i believe
oh

this is what it is, this is who i am
this is where i finally take my stand
i didn't wanna fall, but i don't have to crawl
i met the one with two scarred hands
givin' him the best of everything that's left of
the life inside this man
i've been born again

we are the ones they call by name
i'm never gonna look back
let go, let go, the guilt, the shame
said, i'm never gonna look back
this is who i am

this is what it is, this is who i am
this is where i finally take my stand
i didn't wanna fall, but i don't have to crawl

dead men waking up to the sound of you

it's the song of the redeemed
rising from the african plain
it's the song of the forgiven
drowning out the amazon rain
the song of asian believers
filled with god's holy fire
it's every tribe, every tongue, every nation
a love song born of a grateful choir

it's all god's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns
it's all god's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns

let it rise about the four winds
caught up in the heavenly sound
let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
to the faithful gathered underground
of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
some were meant to persist
of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
none rings truer than this
it's all god's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns (4x)

and all the powers of darkness
tremble at what they've just heard
cause all the powers of darkness
can't drown out a single word

when all god's children sing out
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns
it's all god's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns
all god's people singing
glory, glory, hallelujah
he reigns, he reigns (8x) 

hold the milk, put back the sugar
they are powerless to console
we've gathered here to sprinkle ashes
from our late friend's cereal bowl
breakfast clubbers, say the motto
that he taught us to repeat:
"you will lose it in your gym class if you wait till' noon to eat."
back when the chess club, said our eggs were soft
every monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft
oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon
but before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:

when the toast is burned
and all the milk has turned
and cap'n crunch is wavin' farewell
when the big one finds you
may this song remind you
that they don't serve breakfast, in hell
breakfast clubbers, drop the hankies
though to some our friend was odd
that day he bought those pine pajamas
his check was good with god
those here without the lord
how do you cope?
for this morning we don't mourn
like those who have no hope
oh rise up, fruit loop lovers
sing out sweet and low
with spoons held high
we bid our brother "cheerio!"

when the toast is burned
and all the milk has turned
and cap'n crunch is wavin' farewell
when the big one finds you
may this song remind you
that they don't serve breakfast, in hell
when the toast is burned
and all the milk has turned
and cap'n crunch is wavin' farewell
when the big one finds you
may this song remind you
that they don't serve breakfast, in hell
when the toast is burned
and all the milk has turned
and cap'n crunch is wavin' farewell
when the big one finds you
may this song remind you
that they don't serve breakfast, in hell
when the toast is burned
and all the milk has turned
and cap'n crunch is wavin' farewell
when the big one finds you
may this song remind you
that they don't serve breakfast, in hell 

that's how you change the world
that's how you change the world

all my life i had big dreams to do
big things and make a change
and all the while, i just passed by
the simple needs right here next to me
'cause there's a breaking heart that's fallin' apart
and tear-filled eyes lookin' back at me
god, won't you help me to see

it's the prayer in an empty room
little things we do when nobody's around
a hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
it's the smallest spark that can light the dark
that's how you change the world
(change the world)
that's how you change the world
(change the world)

a million little drops of rain
can be enough to cause a tidal wave
a flood of your love
that no one can contain
'cause there's an empty soul that wants to be known
around me now that i can lead to you
revealing love that won't refuse

it's the prayer in an empty room
little things we do when nobody's around
a hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
it's the smallest spark that can light the dark
that's how you change the world
(change the world)
that's how you change the world
(change the world)

it's the kind words
a simple smile
more than showin' up
goin' the extra mile
it's givin' everything
when you've got nothin' left
sharin' a little hope
with a single breath
that's how you change the world
that's how you change the world
it's the prayer in an empty room
a hand reaching out to a heart in doubt

it's the prayer in an empty room
little things we do when nobody's around
a hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
it's the smallest spark that can light the dark
that's how you change the world
(change the world)
that's how you change the world
(change the world)

that's how you change the world
that's how you change the world 

one to another
do you remember me?
i feel so small
well are you listenin' tonight
so temporary
the things that i have seen
i ran so far
will you take me back again
entertaining angels
by the light of my tv screen
24-7 you wait for me
entertaining angels
by the time i fall to my knees
hosts of heaven, sing over me
one to another
the feelings in between
i won't let go
of all you taught me - alright
close as a brother
the way we used to be
i'll hold my breath
and i'll wait for you to breath
entertaining angels
by the light of my tv screen
24-7 you wait for me
entertaining angels
while the night becomes history
hosts of heaven, sing over me
entertaining angels
by the light of my tv screen
24-7 you wait for me
entertaining angels
by the time i fall to my knees
hosts of heaven, sing over me
entertaining angels
by the light of my tv screen

even if i run away
your love never fails
i know i'll still make mistakes
you have new mercy for me every day
cause your love never fails
oh no, no, no
you stay the same through the ages
your love never changes
there may be pain in the night
but joy comes in the morning
when the storm and the water's deep
i'm not alone here in these open seas
cause your love never fails
the chasm is far too wide
i never thought i'd reach the other side
your love ever fails
oh no, oh no
yeah, you stay the same through the ages
your love never changes
there may be pain in the night
but joy comes in the morning
and when the oceans rage
i don't have to be afraid
because i know that you love me
your love never fails
you make all things
work together for my good
(god, you never fail me)
you make all things
work together for my good
(no you never fail me)
you stay the same through the ages
your love never changes
there may be pain in the night
but joy comes in the morning
and when the oceans rage
i don't have to be afraid
because i know that you love me
your love never fails
cause your love never fails 

up to the hill of calvary
my savior went courageously
and there he bled and died for me
hallelujah for the cross

and on that day the world was changed
a final, perfect lamb was slain
let earth and heaven now proclaim
hallelujah for the cross

hallelujah for the war he fought
love has won, death has lost
hallelujah for the souls he bought
hallelujah for the cross

what good i’ve done could never save
my debt too great for deeds to pay
but god, my savior, made a way
hallelujah for the cross

a slave to sin, my life was bound
but all my chains fell to the ground
when jesus’ blood came flowin' down
hallelujah for the cross
hallelujah for the war he fought
love has won, death has lost
hallelujah for the souls he bought
hallelujah for the cross

hallelujah
hallelujah

and when i breathe my final breath
i’ll have no need to fear that rest
this hope will guide me into death
hallelujah for the cross (o-oh)

hallelujah for the war he fought
love has won, death has lost (o-oh)
hallelujah for the souls he bought
hallelujah for the cross
hallelujah for the war he fought
love has won, death has lost
hallelujah for the souls he bought
hallelujah for the cross
(hallelujah) hallelujah for the cross
(hallelujah) hallelujah for the cross 

i hear the savior say
thy strength indeed is small
child of weakness watch and pray
find in me thine all in all
jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow
lord, now indeed i find
thy power and thine alone
came and changed the leper's spots
and it melt the heart of stone
jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow
and when before the throne
i stand in him complete
jesus died my soul to save
my lips shall still repeat
jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow
oh, praise the one who paid my debt
and raises life up from the dead
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow 

dull as dirt
you can't assert the kind of light
that might persuade
a strict dictator to retire
fire the army
teach the poor origami
the truth is in
the proof is when
you hear your heart start askin'
"what's my motivation?" (—ation)
and try as you may, there isn't a way
to explain the kind of change
that would make an eskimo renounce fur
that would make a vegetarian barbecue hamster
unless you can trace this about-face
to a certain sign (sign)

shine
make 'em wonder what you've got
make 'em wish that they were not
on the outside lookin' bored
shine
let it shine before all men
let 'em see good works and then
let 'em glorify the lord
out of the shaker and onto the plate
it isn't karma, it sure ain't fate
that would make a deadhead sell his van
that would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons
oprah freaks
and science seeks a rationale
that shall excuse this strange behavior (behavior)
when you let it shine
you will inspire
the kind of entire turnaround
that would make a bouncer take ballet
even bouncers who aren't happy
but out of the glare
with nowhere to turn
you ain't gonna learn it on "what's my line?" (my line)

shine
make 'em wonder what you've got

you're in the moment now
a bitter root
a wandering eye and then
the ties that bind start wearing thin, thin
you're in the moment now
when all you've been blessed with
is not enough
here's where the ground gets loose
here's where the devils call your bluff
stay strong
you are not lost
come on and fix your eyes ahead
there's a new dawn to light our day, our day
you've gotta stay strong
you and i run
for the prize that lies ahead
we've come too far to lose our way, our way
we've seen the tragic flaws
the tortured souls
the saints with feet of clay
here's where sin becomes cliche'
we've come through wilderness and watched
the cloud by day
the burning sky into dawn
have you forgotten who you are?
did you forget whose trip you're on?
stay strong
you are not lost
come on and fix your eyes ahead
there's a new dawn to light our day, our day
we've gotta stay strong
you and i run
for the prize that lies ahead
we've come too far to lose our way, our way
get up, there's further to go
get up, there's more to be done
get up, this witness is sure
get up, this race can be won
this race can be won
we've gotta stay strong
you are not lost
come on and fix your eyes ahead
our father's dawn will light our day, our day
come on and stay strong
his grip is sure
and his patience still endures
there'll be no letting go today, no way
come on, and stay strong
you and i run
for the prize that lies ahead
we've come too far to lose our way, our way 

blessed be your name
in the land that is plentiful
where your streams of abundance flow
blessed be your name
and blessed be your name
when i'm found in the desert place
though i walk through the wilderness
blessed be your name
every blessing you pour out
i'll turn back to praise
when the darkness closes in, lord
still i will say
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your name
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your glorious name
and blessed be your name
when the sun's shining down on me
when the world's 'all as it should be'
blessed be your name
and blessed be your name
on the road marked with suffering
though there's pain in the offering
blessed be your name
every blessing you pour out
i'll turn back to praise
when the darkness closes in, lord
still i will say
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your name
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your glorious name
you give and take away
you give and take away
my heart will choose to say
lord blessed be your name
i will bless your name, lord

every blessing you pour out
i'll turn back to praise
when the darkness closes in, lord
still i will say
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your name
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your glorious name (name)
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your name
blessed be the name of the lord
blessed be your glorious name (name)
oh, you give and take away
you give and take away
but my heart will choose to say (oh lord!)
blessed be your name
you give and take away
you give and take away
but my heart will choose to say (oh lord!)
blessed be your name
