After 10 years of activity, having earned the most views by songifying the likes of [[Antoine Dodson]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Double Rainbow (viral video)|Paul Vasquez]] and [[Daymon Patterson]], their Schmoyoho channel reached three million subscribers in March 2017. In commemoration, the Gregory Brothers released a "mega-[[Mashup (culture)|mashup]]" of their work, in which they outlined their main goal of eliciting "the maximum amount of happiness for the maximum amount of time".<ref name="Facebook"/>

{{main|Songify the News}}
{{Prose|section|date=March 2017}}
The Gregory Brothers (using the YouTube username 'schmoyoho') first became well known for a series of [[YouTube]] videos, ''[[Songify the News|Auto-Tune the News]]'' (rebranded in 2011 as ''Songify the News''), in which recorded voices of politicians, news anchors, and political pundits were digitally manipulated to conform to a melody, making the figures appear to sing.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

National television networks featured the Gregory Brothers' early political satires in the spring of 2009, but the group did not achieve mainstream recognition until the summer of 2010, when they released episode 12b of ''Auto-Tune the News'', titled "[[Bed Intruder Song]]," which featured excerpts from an interview with alleged crime victims Kelly Dodson and her brother, [[Antoine Dodson]], was viewed approximately 50&nbsp;million times during its first six months online, making it the most-viewed YouTube video of 2010 (excluding major label music videos),<ref name="Google Blog">{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-rainbows-annoying-oranges-and.html|title=Official Google Blog: Double rainbows, annoying oranges and bed intruders: the year on YouTube|date=2010-12-12|work=The Official [[Google]] Blog|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|access-date=2010-12-15}}</ref> and currently has more than 150 million views.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMtZfW2z9dw&list=PL736C3116AD309B58&index=1&feature=plpp_video "Auto-Tune the News: BED INTRUDER SONG!!! (now on iTunes)"], March 22, 2012.</ref>

Largely non-political in content, it marked a departure from the Gregory Brothers' roots in political material. Following the mainstream success of that music video, the Gregory Brothers have generally produced a mixture of both political and non-political videos.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The band is best known for the ''Auto-Tune'' and ''Songify'' series, they have created several additional videos, independent of that series, which have received broad attention. The following videos are part of their first season of ''Auto-Tune the News'' for 16 episodes.<ref name="schmoyoho">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoyoho|title=schmoyoho's Channel|last=Gregory|first=Michael|author2=The Gregory Brothers|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2012-03-22}}</ref>

The Gregory Brothers began to retroactively apply the series name "Songify This" to certain previously series-independent videos in late 2010, and they have released a number of new videos under this branding as well. The table above reflects the new "Songify This" branding where applicable.

===83rd Annual Academy Awards===
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}
The Gregory Brothers created a musical segment for the [[83rd Academy Awards]] where they auto-tuned bits of 4 major motion pictures from 2010: ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[The Social Network]]'', and ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sibrius Cheder|title=Oscars Auto Tuned 2011 - Harry Potter, Toy Story 3, Social Network, Eclipse|date=2012-12-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk6hgTWjUu8|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>

Host [[James Franco]] comically introduced the segment as a tribute to a "great year for the movie musical." Characters who were autotuned included [[Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Sheriff Woody]], [[Sean Parker]], and [[Edward Cullen]]. On July 14, 2011 it was announced that this segment earned The Gregory Brothers a nomination for a 2011 Emmy award in the category "Outstanding Short-Form Picture Editing."<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/PressReleaseNoms2011emmys.pdf "2011 Emmy Nominations Press Release"], emmys.com, July 14, 2011.</ref> Only Michael and Evan are nominated as there is a two-person nomination limit in this category.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

While only those four aired, an alternative cut was released on the official 2011 Grammy Awards YouTube channel on February 27, 2011, featuring an auto-tuned version of ''[[The King's Speech]]'' in place of ''[[The Social Network]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==="Double Rainbow Song"===
In July 2010, the Gregory Brothers released an auto-tuned version of the [[Double Rainbow (viral video)|Double Rainbow]] viral video. The original video featured the overawed reaction of Paul "Hungry Bear" Vasquez to a double [[rainbow]] at [[Yosemite National Park]]. The Gregory Brothers turned Vasquez's astounded speech into a song and pledged all of the song's earnings to Vasquez and Yosemite.<ref name="Brown">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/07/14/double.rainbows/index.html|title=How the 'double rainbow' video blew up|last=Brown|first=Damon|date=16 July 2010|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=29 August 2010}}</ref>

For the period of July 15&ndash;22 2009, 47&ndash;54 days after its release, the EP was ranked as the top-selling album on [[Amie Street]] in the category of "Soul / R&B".<ref name="AmieStreetTop25July">{{cite web|url=http://amiestreet.com/browse/top|title=Amie Street Top 25|date=2009-07-22|publisher=[[Amie Street]]|access-date= 2009-07-22}}</ref>

Contributing musicians on the album include Doug Hulin (bass) and Justin Keller (saxophone).

===''Happy Sad Songs''===
A series of covers of popular songs were arranged, performed and shared by the Gregory Brothers through [[Vine (service)|Vine]], [[Facebook]] and YouTube. Somewhat uniquely, these covers switched the [[Key (music)|key]] of the song between [[major and minor]], giving otherwise happy songs a melancholy tone while sad songs sounded more joyful.<ref name=Mashable>{{Cite news|first=Jessica|last=Catcher|date=2014-03-28|title=Happy Songs Become Terribly Sad With One Simple Change|url=http://mashable.com/2014/03/27/happy-songs-made-sad/#tKJhQ9z8jqqR|publisher=Mashable|access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref><ref name=Gizmodo>{{Cite news|first=Casey|last=Chan|date=2014-03-26|title=Neat trick instantly turns happy songs into sad songs and vice versa|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/neat-trick-instantly-turns-happy-songs-into-sad-songs-a-1552546646|publisher=Sploid|access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref> In March 2014, and again in September 2016, the Gregory Brothers released [[compilation album]]s of some such covers.
