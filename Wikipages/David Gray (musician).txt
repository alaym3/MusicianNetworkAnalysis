==Career==
===Early life and career===
Gray was born in 1968 in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], [[Cheshire]], England, and lived in [[Altrincham]] near Manchester before moving with his family at the age of nine to [[Solva]], [[Pembrokeshire]], Wales, where his parents took over a gift shop and started a clothing business.<ref name=Indy>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-david-gray-musician-41-1780662.html|title=My Secret Life: David Gray, musician, 41|author=Charlotte Philby|date=5 September 2009|work=The Independent}}</ref><ref name=lighter>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/a-lighter-shade-of-gray-2072896 |title=A lighter shade of Gray |publisher=Walesonline |date=28 November 2009 |access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref> "I had an amazing time growing up there{{nbsp}}... My imagination could run wild{{nbsp}}... It was that which gave me the kind of insane self-belief I have, and had even then, that I could do something as unlikely as play music for a living."<ref name=lighter /> He went to [[Ysgol Dewi Sant]] high school in nearby St Davids and then on to [[Coleg Sir Gâr|Carmarthenshire College of Art]] and finally [[Liverpool School of Art]].<ref name=lighter />

Gray's first two albums, ''[[A Century Ends]]'' and ''[[Flesh (album)|Flesh]]'', were issued in 1993 and 1994 respectively and led to Gray becoming popular in folk-rock circles, but both failed in terms of commercial sales.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher=Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| page= 399| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> In 1996 Gray released his third album, ''[[Sell, Sell, Sell]]''.The album was recorded at Pyramid Sound Studios in Ithaca, NY. Despite his dislike of the album, Gray continued to maintain residence in Ithaca, NY on and off over the years. Despite critical acclaim,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} the album did not chart, but the song "[[Late Night Radio]]" received some airplay on alternative UK radio stations. On the 1997 [[Mary Black]] album ''[[Shine (Mary Black album)|Shine]]'', Gray contributed five songs.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===1998–2002: ''White Ladder'' and rise to fame===
The re-release of Gray's fourth record album, ''[[White Ladder]]'', in 2000 on [[ATO Records]], brought him commercial success and critical attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgray.com/about/bio/ |title=Biography |work=Official Community of David Gray |access-date=15 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021050441/http://www.davidgray.com/about/bio/ |archive-date=21 October 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> While his first three albums featured acoustic folk songs and guitar-based alternative rock, '''White Ladder''' introduced his now-trademark [[folktronic]] sound. The album included his best-known songs: "[[This Year's Love (song)|This Year's Love]]", "[[Babylon (David Gray song)|Babylon]]", "[[Please Forgive Me (David Gray song)|Please Forgive Me]]" and "[[Sail Away (David Gray song)|Sail Away]]". ''White Ladder'' was originally released on Gray's own label [[IHT Records]] in November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/david-gray/2555 |title=NME Album Reviews&nbsp;– ''White Ladder'' |work=NME |location=UK  |date=14 July 2000 |access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> After its re-release, combined with the release and success of single "Babylon", it sold 100,000 copies in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] alone, making it number one for six weeks,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-infinite-shades-of-gray-720989.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920213150/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-infinite-shades-of-gray-720989.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2011|title=The infinite shades of Gray|first=Pierre|last=Perrone|work=The Independent |location=London |date=16 April 2000|access-date=3 August 2010 }}</ref> and according to a 2012 report was the biggest-selling album ever in that country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/top-20-the-best-selling-albums-in-irish-history-462033-Jun2012/ |title=Top 20: The best-selling albums in Irish history|publisher=The Daily Edge |access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref> In June 2000, "[[Babylon (David Gray song)|Babylon]]" hit No.&nbsp;5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]; it remains his biggest UK hit to date. In the United States, the album received a boost from jam-band leader [[Dave Matthews]], who made it the first release by [[ATO Records]], the record company he co-founded. "Babylon" was also the first of three US chart entries for Gray to date.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[File:David Gray (227236934).jpg|thumb|220px|left|Gray performing an acoustic set on 17 August 2003]]
The album was No.&nbsp;1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], two years and five months after its original release,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78875/gray-climbs-ladder-to-no-1-in-the-uk|title=Gray Climbs 'Ladder' To No. 1 In The U.K.|work=Billboard.com}}</ref> spending a total of 151 weeks on the chart.<ref name=officialcharts>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=David Gray |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=24 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Aside from "Please Forgive Me", which charted at No.&nbsp;72 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], all other single releases charted within the Top 20:<ref name=officialcharts/> the re-released "Please Forgive Me" charted at number 18, and "Say Hello, Wave Goodbye" and "Sail Away" peaked at number 26.

The year 2001 also saw the release of a rarities [[compilation album|compilation]] of Gray's early works, ''[[The EPs 1992-1994]]'', as well as an album of previously unreleased songs recorded in 1999, ''[[Lost Songs 95-98]]'', both of which followed ''White Ladder'' into the [[Top 40|Top 20]] in the UK Albums Chart. Gray also provided vocals on the electronic-based band [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]]'s 2001 single "Illuminate".

In November 2002, Gray released the follow-up to ''White Ladder'', entitled ''[[A New Day at Midnight]]''. The new release did not receive the same critical acclaim as its predecessor, but still went straight in at number 1, famously beating ''Pop Idol'' runner-up [[Gareth Gates]]'s debut album ''[[What My Heart Wants to Say]]'' to the summit and selling nearly 150,000 copies in its first week of release. It went on to achieve platinum status within a year, eventually being certified four times platinum overall, and was the second-biggest selling album by a UK artist in 2002, behind ''Pop Idol'' winner [[Will Young]]'s debut album ''[[From Now On (Will Young album)|From Now On]]''. ''A New Day at Midnight'' produced two further UK Top 30 hits in "The Other Side" and "Be Mine" and a minor US hit with "Dead in the Water".

===Later career===
[[File:David Gray Rock am Ring 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|Gray and his band performing in 2006]]
After a three-year hiatus which saw him wind down his recording and touring schedule due to exhaustion, Gray returned with his seventh album, ''[[Life in Slow Motion]]'', in September 2005. Like its predecessor, it topped the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. After the much-criticised ''A New Day at Midnight'', ''Life in Slow Motion'' was hailed as a return to form by many critics. Lead single "[[The One I Love (David Gray song)|The One I Love]]" was a Top 10 hit in the UK in October 2005 and spent three months in the UK chart. Following the relative commercial failure of follow-up singles "[[Hospital Food (song)|Hospital Food]]" and "[[Alibi (David Gray song)|Alibi]]", Gray again went into hiatus during 2006.

In March 2007, Gray released the compilation album ''[[Shine: The Best of the Early Years]]''. On 7 July 2007, Gray performed with [[Damien Rice]] at the [[Live Earth concert, London|UK leg]] of [[Live Earth]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London. Gray released a compilation CD of live covers entitled ''[[A Thousand Miles Behind]]'' exclusively through his official website on 8 October that year on CD and digital download. On 13 November, Gray released the album ''[[Greatest Hits (David Gray album)|Greatest Hits]]'', which includes many of his best known songs as well as two new songs, including the lead single "[[You're the World to Me]]".

On 28 May 2009, Gray announced that his album ''[[Draw the Line (David Gray album)|Draw the Line]]'' would be released on 14 September in the UK and on 22 September in the United States. The album features guest appearances by [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Jolie Holland]]. The album's first single, "[[Fugitive (David Gray song)|Fugitive]]", was released on 7 September 2009, coinciding with the start of an expansive world tour. On 19 September, Gray performed his self-proclaimed first pool-side concert at the Rooftop Pool at The Colonnade Hotel in Boston for the Mix 104.1 ''End of Summer Bash''. Gray performed songs from the new album, including "Fugitive", "Draw the Line" and "Jackdaw".

In an interview for ''[[Hot Press]]'', released on 3 December 2009, Gray revealed to Jackie Hayden that he was working on his next album, ''[[Foundling (album)|Foundling]]''. Gray said that one of the tracks would be called "The Old Chair", which, according to Gray, "features just a drum kit and me on my Steinway piano. It's very quiet." ''Foundling'' was released in the UK on 16 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgray.com/music/discography/DG_AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=72f24b39-952c-4a87-af1b-10f820e94bfb&Cat=Albums|title=Discography – DavidGray.com|access-date=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228064455/http://www.davidgray.com/music/discography/DG_AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=72f24b39-952c-4a87-af1b-10f820e94bfb&Cat=Albums|archive-date=28 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and in the United States on 17 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgray.com/music/discography/DG_AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=f0670f7e-eed6-4e4f-a16a-4981e63f11de&Cat=Albums|title=Discography – DavidGray.com|access-date=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721191356/http://www.davidgray.com/music/discography/DG_AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=f0670f7e-eed6-4e4f-a16a-4981e63f11de&Cat=Albums|archive-date=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''Foundling'' is a double album: the first CD consists of 11 new songs and the second consists of eight previously unreleased songs.

David Gray signed a global agreement with [[Kobalt Label Services]] for the release of his 10th studio album, ''[[Mutineers (David Gray album)|Mutineers]]''. His first in four years, it was recorded at The Church Studios in London and produced by [[Andy Barlow (producer)|Andy Barlow]] ([[Lamb (electronic band)|Lamb]]). The release took place on 17 June 2014. It was announced that Gray would support the new release with a North American tour through April and May, followed by an eight-date UK tour in June and July that included a show at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brandle |first1=Lars |title=David Gray Inks Deal to Release 'Mutineers' Album, Debuts New Song |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6029446/david-gray-inks-deal-to-release-mutineers-album-debuts-new-song |magazine=Billboard |access-date=24 July 2014}}</ref>

''The Best of David Gray'' was released on CD, double CD and LP in October 2016, and included two new recordings. The album, released in conjunction with IHT Records, had already been released as a dynamic playlist on [[Spotify]] that automatically changed shape every week Gray commented: "What we have on our hands{{nbsp}} is an ever-evolving 'Best Of' that is different every week, every month, every year, every decade."<ref name="MBW">{{cite news|url=http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/kobalt-rethinks-the-greatest-hits-album-with-new-david-gray-best-of/|title=Kobalt rethinks the 'greatest hits' album with dynamic David Gray 'Best Of'|last=Ingham|first=Tim|date=18 August 2016|work=Music Business Worldwide|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="OCC best of">{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/david-gray-has-re-imagined-his-new-best-of-album-for-the-streaming-age__16083/|title=David Gray has re-imagined his new ''Best Of'' album for the streaming age|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=18 August 2016|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>

In March 2019, Gray released his 11th record, ''[[Gold in a Brass Age]]''. It was produced by Ben de Vries, son of producer Marius de Vries, and was seen largely as a return to his signature "folktronica" sound.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Ezell |first1=Brice |title=David Gray Brings Back the Folktronica on 'Gold in a Brass Age' |url=https://www.popmatters.com/david-gray-gold-brass-age-2632405060.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2 |magazine=Billboard |date=22 March 2019 |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref>

In the year 2020, Gray released a 20th anniversary edition of ''White Ladder''. A deluxe set with bonus tracks and demos was also made available on both CD and vinyl formats. He embarked on an international tour to celebrate the anniversary, starting in Europe in February, but it was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gray announced on 20 May 2020 via his social media channels that the tour had to be postponed, and he has yet to announce rescheduled dates.

In January 2021, Gray announced that his 12th studio album was to be released on 19 February 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2021/02/05/david-gray-announces-new-album-skellig/|title=David Gray Announces New Album: Skellig|date=5 February 2021}}</ref> Entitled ''Skellig'' (named after the [[Skellig Islands]] in [[County Kerry]], Ireland) it featured a title track and a single called "Heart and Soul".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/david-gray-skellig-review-babylon-singers-return-splendid-isolation/|title = David Gray: Skellig, review: Babylon singer's return to a splendid isolation|newspaper = The Telegraph|date = 18 February 2021|last1 = McCormick|first1 = Neil}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theupcoming.co.uk/2021/02/16/david-gray-skellig-album-review/|title=David Gray – Skellig &#124; Album review}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/david-gray-skellig-review-this-is-a-serene-career-highlight-1.4485359|title = David Gray: Skellig review.

==Musical style==
Gray's early music was in a contemporary [[folk-rock]], singer-songwriter mode; his primary instrument was [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], with occasional piano. 1996's ''[[Sell, Sell, Sell]]'' featured some rock arrangements and electric instrumentation. Starting with the release of ''[[White Ladder]]'', Gray began to make significant use of computer-generated music to accompany his voice and acoustic instrumentation. ''[[A New Day at Midnight]]'' continued this direction, although lyrically it was darker in tone than ''White Ladder'' and the instrumentation much more downbeat. In the liner notes, Gray dedicated the album to his father, who died in 2001. Despite the move to more complex music, Gray has used small-scale, often home-based, recording methods and equipment and espoused a [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] approach to music production. However, 2005's ''[[Life in Slow Motion]]'' was a collaboration with the record producer [[Marius de Vries]].
