'''Squid''' are [[cephalopod]]s in the superorder '''Decapodiformes''' with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight [[cephalopod limb|arms]] and two [[tentacle]]s. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, [[Symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], and a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. They are mainly soft-bodied, like [[octopus]]es, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like [[gladius (cephalopod)|gladius]] or pen, made of [[chitin]].

Squid diverged from other cephalopods during the [[Jurassic]] and occupy a similar role to [[teleost]] fish as open water [[predator]]s of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by [[Aquatic locomotion#Jet propulsion|jet propulsion]], and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of [[invertebrates]], with groups of [[Humboldt squid]] having been observed [[Pack hunter|hunting cooperatively]]. They are preyed on by [[shark]]s, other fish, sea birds, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[cetacea]]ns, particularly [[sperm whale]]s.

Squid can change colour for [[camouflage]] and [[Signalling theory|signalling]]. Some species are [[bioluminescent]], using their light for [[counter-illumination]] camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of [[cephalopod ink|ink]] to distract predators.

Squid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan, the Mediterranean, the southwestern Atlantic, the eastern Pacific and elsewhere. They are used in cuisines around the world, often known as "[[Squid as food|calamari]]". Squid have featured in literature since classical times, especially in tales of giant squid and [[sea monster]]s.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Squid are members of the class [[Cephalopod]]a, subclass [[Coleoidea]]. The squid [[Order (taxonomy)|orders]] [[Myopsida]] and [[Oegopsida]] are in the superorder [[Decapodiformes]] (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "ten-legged"). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] distinct from squids and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the [[bobtail squid]] of order [[Sepiolida]] and the [[ram's horn squid]] of the monotypic order [[Spirulida]]. The [[vampire squid]] (''[[Vampyroteuthis]] infernalis''), however, is more closely related to the octopus than to any squid.<ref name="Sanchez Setiamarga 2018">{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Gustavo |last2=Setiamarga |first2=Davin H. E. |last3=Tuanapaya |first3=Surangkana |last4=Tongtherm |first4=Kittichai |last5=Winkelmann |first5=Inger E. |last6=Schmidbaur |first6=Hannah |last7=Umino |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Albertin |first8=Caroline |last9=Allcock |first9=Louise |last10=Perales-Raya |first10=Catalina |last11=Gleadall |first11=Ian |last12=Strugnell |first12=Jan M. |last13=Simakov |first13=Oleg |last14=Nabhitabhata |first14=Jaruwat |title=Genus-level phylogeny of cephalopods using molecular markers: current status and problematic areas |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=6 |date=February 2018 |doi=10.7717/peerj.4331 |pmid=29456885 |pmc=5813590 |page=e4331}}</ref>

The [[cladogram]], not fully resolved, is based on Sanchez et al., 2018.<ref name="Sanchez Setiamarga 2018" /> Their [[molecular phylogeny]] used [[mitochondria]]l and [[nuclear DNA]] marker sequences; they comment that a robust [[phylogeny]] "has proven very challenging to obtain". If it is accepted that [[Sepiidae]] cuttlefish are a kind of squid, then the squids, excluding the vampire squid, form a [[clade]] as illustrated.<ref name="Sanchez Setiamarga 2018"/> Orders are shown in boldface; all the families not included in those orders are in the [[paraphyletic]] order "Oegopsida", except Sepiadariidae and Sepiidae that are in the paraphyletic order "Sepiida",

===Evolution===
Crown coleoids (the ancestors of octopuses and squid) diverged at the end of the [[Paleozoic]], in the [[Permian]]. Squid diverged during the Jurassic, but many squid families appeared in or after the [[Cretaceous]].<ref name="Tanner Fuchs Winkelmann Gilbert p=20162818">{{cite journal | last1=Tanner | first1=Alastair R. | last2=Fuchs | first2=Dirk | last3=Winkelmann | first3=Inger E. | last4=Gilbert | first4=M.

Four lines diverged from this, Spirulida (with one living member), the [[cuttlefish]]es, the squids and the [[octopus]]es. Squid have differentiated from the ancestral [[mollusc]] such that the body plan has been condensed antero-posteriorly and extended dorso-ventrally.

==Description==
[[File:Composite diagram illustrating basic squid features, ventral aspect.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Basic squid features (ventral aspect)]]

Squid are soft-bodied molluscs whose forms evolved to adopt an active predatory lifestyle. The head and foot of the squid are at one end of a long body, and this end is functionally [[anterior]], leading the animal as it moves through the water. A set of eight arms and two distinctive tentacles surround the mouth; each appendage takes the form of a [[muscular hydrostat]] and is flexible and prehensile, usually bearing disc-like suckers.<ref name=Ruppert/>

The suckers may lie directly on the arm or be stalked. Their rims are stiffened with chitin and may contain minute toothlike denticles. These features, as well as strong musculature, and a small ganglion beneath each sucker to allow individual control, provide a very powerful adhesion to grip prey. Hooks are present on the arms and tentacles in some species, but their function is unclear.<ref name=Hanlon/> The two tentacles are much longer than the arms and are retractile. Suckers are limited to the spatulate tip of the tentacle, known as the [[Manus (anatomy)|manus]].<ref name=Ruppert/>

In the mature male, the outer half of one of the left arms is [[hectocotylus|hectocotylised]] – and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. This is used for depositing a [[spermatophore]] inside the mantle cavity of a female. A ventral part of the foot has been converted into a [[siphon (mollusc)|funnel]] through which water exits the mantle cavity.<ref name=Ruppert/>

The main body mass is enclosed in the mantle, which has a [[Cephalopod fin|swimming fin]] along each side. These fins are not the main source of locomotion in most species. The mantle wall is heavily muscled and internal. The visceral mass, which is covered by a thin, membranous [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], forms a cone-shaped posterior region known as the "visceral hump". The mollusc shell is reduced to an internal, longitudinal chitinous "pen" in the functionally dorsal part of the animal; the pen acts to stiffen the squid and provides attachments for muscles.<ref name=Ruppert/>

On the functionally ventral part of the body is an opening to the mantle cavity, which contains the [[gill]]s (ctenidia) and openings from the excretory, digestive and [[reproductive system]]s. An inhalant siphon behind the funnel draws water into the mantel cavity via a valve. The squid uses the funnel for locomotion via precise jet propulsion.<ref name=Johnson1972>{{Cite journal | last1=Johnson | first1=W. | last2=Soden | first2=P. D. | last3=Trueman | first3=E.

===Camouflage===
Squid make use of different kinds of camouflage, namely [[active camouflage]] for background matching (in shallow water) and counter-illumination. This helps to [[Anti-predator adaptation|protect them from their predators]] and allows them to approach their prey.{{sfn|Cott|1940|p=32}}<ref name="Young Roper 1976"/>

The skin is covered in controllable [[chromatophore]]s of different colours, enabling the squid to match its coloration to its surroundings.{{sfn|Cott|1940|p=32}}<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gilmore, R. |author2=Crook, R. |author3=Krans, J.

Counter-illumination is also used by the [[Euprymna scolopes|Hawaiian bobtail squid]] (''Euprymna scolopes''), which has [[Aliivibrio fischeri|symbiotic bacteria]] (''Aliivibrio fischeri'') that produce light to help the squid avoid nocturnal predators.<ref name="Nyholm2004">{{cite journal | last1=Nyholm | first1=S.

Below there is a kind of [[iris (eye)|iris]], which has branches (diverticula) of its [[ink sac]], with a lens below that; both the reflector and lens are derived from [[mesoderm]]. The squid controls light production by changing the shape of its iris or adjusting the strength of yellow filters on its underside, which presumably change the balance of wavelengths emitted.<ref name="Jones 2004"/> Light production shows a correlation with intensity of down-welling light, but it is about one third as bright; the squid can track repeated changes in brightness.

===Predator distraction with ink===
[[File:Loligosepia aalensis 01.jpg|thumb|Fossil ''Loligosepia aalensis'' from the lower Jurassic; the [[ink sac]] is still full of black eu[[melanin]] pigment]]

Squid distract attacking predators by ejecting a cloud of [[Cephalopod ink|ink]], giving themselves an opportunity to escape.{{sfn|Cott|1940|p=381}}<ref name=Derby>{{cite journal |last1=Derby |first1=Charles D. |title=Escape by Inking and Secreting: Marine Molluscs Avoid Predators Through a Rich Array of Chemicals and Mechanisms |journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=274–289 |doi=10.2307/25066645 |pmid=18083967 |jstor=25066645|s2cid=9539618 }}</ref> The ink gland and its associated ink sac empties into the rectum close to the anus, allowing the squid to rapidly discharge black ink into the mantle cavity and surrounding water.<ref name=Hanlon>{{cite book|author1=Hanlon, Roger T. |author2=Messenger, John B. |title=Cephalopod Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nxfv6xZZ6WYC&pg=PA25 |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64583-6 |pages=25–26}}</ref> The ink is a suspension of [[melanin]] particles and quickly disperses to form a dark cloud that obscures the escape manoeuvres of the squid. Predatory fish may also be deterred by the alkaloid nature of the discharge which may interfere with their [[chemoreceptor]]s.<ref name=Ruppert/>

===Nervous system and sense organs===
{{see|Cephalopod intelligence}}

Cephalopods have the most highly developed nervous systems among [[invertebrate]]s. Squids have a complex brain in the form of a nerve ring encircling the [[oesophagus]], enclosed in a cartilaginous [[cranium]]. Paired cerebral [[ganglia]] above the oesophagus receive sensory information from the eyes and [[statocyst]]s, and further ganglia below control the muscles of the mouth, foot, mantle and viscera. [[Squid giant axon|Giant axons]] up to {{cvt|1|mm|in|2}} in diameter convey nerve messages with great rapidity to the circular muscles of the mantle wall, allowing a synchronous, powerful contraction and maximum speed in the jet propulsion system.<ref name=Ruppert/>

The paired eyes, on either side of the head, are housed in capsules fused to the cranium. Their structure is very similar to that of a fish eye, with a globular [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] that has a [[depth of focus]] from {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} to infinity. The image is focused by changing the position of the lens, as in a camera or [[telescope]], rather than changing the shape of the lens, as in the [[human eye]]. Squid adjust to changes in light intensity by expanding and contracting the slit-shaped [[pupil]].<ref name=Ruppert/> Deep sea squids in the family Histioteuthidae have eyes of two different types and orientation. The large left eye is tubular in shape and looks upwards, presumably searching for the silhouettes of animals higher in the [[water column]]. The normally-shaped right eye points forwards and downwards to detect prey.<ref>{{cite web | author1 = Young, Richard E. | author1-link = Richard E. Young | author2 = Vecchione, Michael | author2-link = Michael Vecchione | year = 2013 | title = ''Histioteuthidae'' Verrill, 1881. | url = http://tolweb.org/Histioteuthidae/19782/2013.11.03 | publisher = The [[Tree of Life Web Project]] |access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref>

The statocysts are involved in maintaining balance and are analogous to the inner ear of fish. They are housed in cartilaginous capsules on either side of the cranium. They provide the squid with information on its body position in relation to gravity, its orientation, acceleration and rotation, and are able to perceive incoming vibrations. Without the statocysts, the squid cannot maintain equilibrium.<ref name=Ruppert/> Squid appear to have limited hearing,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8095000/8095977.stm|title=The cephalopods can hear you |publisher=BBC|date=15 June 2009|first=Matt|last=Walker|access-date=2 April 2010}}</ref> but the head and arms bear lines of hair-cells that are weakly sensitive to water movements and changes in pressure, and are analogous in function to the [[lateral line]] system of fish.<ref name=Ruppert/>

===Reproductive system===
[[File:Onykia ingens with erect penis.jpg|thumb|left|Male ''[[Onykia ingens]]'' with penis erected to {{convert|67|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}]]

The sexes are separate in squid, there being a single [[gonad]] in the posterior part of the body with fertilisation being external, and usually taking place in the mantle cavity of the female. The male has a [[testis]] from which sperm pass into a single gonoduct where they are rolled together into a long bundle, or spermatophore. The gonoduct is elongated into a "penis" that extends into the mantle cavity and through which spermatophores are ejected. In shallow water species, the penis is short, and the spermatophore is removed from the mantle cavity by a tentacle of the male, which is specially adapted for the purpose and known as a [[hectocotylus]], and placed inside the mantle cavity of the female during mating.<ref name=Ruppert/>

[[File:Uroteuthis duvauceli hectocotylus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Hectocotylus]] of ''[[Uroteuthis duvauceli]]'': one tentacle of the male is adapted for transferring the [[spermatophore]]]]

The female has a large translucent [[ovary]], situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass. From here, eggs travel along the gonocoel, where there are a pair of white [[nidamental gland]]s, which lie anterior to the gills. Also present are red-spotted accessory nidamental glands containing [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria; both organs are associated with nutrient manufacture and forming shells for the eggs. The gonocoel enters the mantle cavity at the [[gonopore]], and in some species, receptacles for storing spermatophores are located nearby, in the mantle wall.<ref name=Ruppert/>

In shallow-water species of the [[continental shelf]] and [[epipelagic]] or [[mesopelagic zone]]s, it is frequently one or both of arm pair IV of males that are modified into hectocotyli.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cephalopoda_Glossary?acc_id=587 |title=Hectocotylus |author1=Young, R.

Like all cephalopods, squids are predators and have complex digestive systems. The mouth is equipped with a sharp, horny [[Cephalopod beak|beak]] mainly made of chitin and [[cross-link]]ed proteins,<ref name="Tan Hoon Guerette Wei pp. 488–495">{{cite journal | last1=Tan | first1=YerPeng | last2=Hoon | first2=Shawn | last3=Guerette | first3=Paul A. | last4=Wei | first4=Wei | last5=Ghadban | first5=Ali | last6=Hao | first6=Cai | last7=Miserez | first7=Ali | last8=Waite | first8=J.

The food [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]] is moved along the gut by waves of muscular contractions ([[peristalsis]]). The long oesophagus leads to a muscular [[stomach]] roughly in the middle of the visceral mass.

===Cardiovascular and excretory systems===
The squid mantle cavity is a seawater-filled sac containing three hearts and other organs supporting circulation, respiration, and [[excretion]].<ref name="hanlon">{{cite book |author1=Roger Hanlon |author2=Mike Vecchione |author3=Louise Allcock |title=Octopus, Squid, and Cuttlefish: A Visual, Scientific Guide to the Oceans' Most Advanced Invertebrates |date=1 October 2018 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226459561 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtmUswEACAAJ&pg=PA33 |access-date=12 December 2018}}</ref> Squid have a main [[systemic circulation|systemic]] heart that pumps blood around the body as part of the general [[circulatory system]], and two [[branchial heart]]s. The systemic heart consists of three chambers, a lower [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and two upper [[Atrium (heart)|atria]], all of which can contract to propel the blood. The branchial hearts pump blood specifically to the gills for oxygenation, before returning it to the systemic heart.<ref name=hanlon/> The blood contains the [[copper]]-rich protein [[hemocyanin]], which is used for [[oxygen transport]] at low ocean temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, and makes the oxygenated blood a deep, blue color.<ref name=hanlon/> As systemic blood returns via two [[vena cavae]] to the branchial hearts, excretion of [[urine]], [[carbon dioxide]], and waste [[solute]]s occurs through outpockets (called [[nephridiopore|nephridial appendages]]) in the vena cavae walls that enable gas exchange and excretion via the mantle cavity seawater.<ref name=hanlon/>

===Buoyancy===
[[File:Cranchiidae sp.jpg|thumb|The body of glass squids ([[Cranchiidae]]) is mainly filled by a transparent [[coelom]] containing [[ammonium]] ions for buoyancy.]]

Unlike nautiloids which have gas-filled chambers inside their shells which provide buoyancy, and octopuses which live near and rest on the seabed and do not require to be buoyant, many squid have a fluid-filled receptacle, equivalent to the [[swim bladder]] of a fish, in the [[coelom]] or [[connective tissue]]. This reservoir acts as a chemical buoyancy chamber, with the heavy metallic cations typical of seawater replaced by low [[Molecular mass|molecular-weight]] [[ammonium]] ions, a product of excretion. The small difference in density provides a small contribution to buoyancy per unit volume, so the mechanism requires a large buoyancy chamber to be effective. Since the chamber is filled with liquid, it has the advantage over a swim bladder of not changing significantly in volume with pressure. Glass squids in the family [[Cranchiidae]] for example, have an enormous transparent coelom containing ammonium ions and occupying about two-thirds the volume of the animal, allowing it to float at the required depth. About half of the 28 families of squid use this mechanism to solve their buoyancy issues.<ref name=Ruppert/>

==Development==
The eggs of squid are large for a mollusc, containing a large amount of yolk to nourish the embryo as it [[Direct development|develops directly]], without an intervening [[veliger]] larval stage. The embryo grows as a [[germinal disc|disc of cells]] on [[animal pole|top of the yolk]]. During the [[gastrulation]] stage, the margins of the disc grow to surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the animal's gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo grows. Some juvenile squid live higher in the water column than do adults. Squids tend to be short-lived; ''[[Loligo]]'' for example lives from one to three years according to species, typically dying soon after spawning.<ref name=Ruppert/>

In a well-studied bioluminescent species, the Hawaiian bobtail squid, a special light organ in the squid's mantle is rapidly colonized with ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'' bacteria within hours of hatching. This light-organ colonization requires this particular bacterial species for a symbiotic relationship; no colonization occurs in the absence of ''A. fischeri''.<ref name="Nyholm2004"/> Colonization occurs in a horizontal manner, such that the hosts acquires its bacterial partners from the environment. The symbiosis is [[Symbiosis#Obligate versus facultative|obligate]] for the squid, but facultative for the bacteria. Once the bacteria enter the squid, they colonize interior [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] in the light organ, living in [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypts]] with complex [[Microvillus|microvilli]] protrusions. The bacteria also interact with [[hemocyte]]s, macrophage-like blood cells that migrate between epithelial cells, but the mechanism and function of this process is not well understood. Bioluminescence reaches its highest levels during the early evening hours and bottoms out before dawn; this occurs because at the end of each day, the contents of the squid's crypts are expelled into the surrounding environment.<ref name="McFall-Ngai 2014">{{cite journal|last=McFall-Ngai|first=M.

==Behaviour==

===Locomotion===
[[File:Euprymna scolopes - image.pbio.v12.i02.g001.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Hawaiian bobtail squid swimming slowly by undulating its fins]]

Squid can move about in several different ways. Slow movement is achieved by a gentle undulation of the muscular lateral fins on either side of the trunk which drives the animal forward. A more common means of locomotion providing sustained movement is achieved using jetting, during which contraction of the muscular wall of the mantle cavity provides jet propulsion.<ref name=Ruppert/>

Slow jetting is used for ordinary locomotion, and ventilation of the gills is achieved at the same time. The circular muscles in the mantle wall contract; this causes the inhalant valve to close, the exhalant valve to open and the mantle edge to lock tightly around the head. Water is forced out through the funnel which is pointed in the opposite direction to the required direction of travel. The inhalant phase is initiated by the relaxation of the circular muscles causes them to stretch, the connective tissue in the mantle wall recoils elastically, the mantle cavity expands causing the inhalant valve to open, the exhalant valve to close and water to flow into the cavity. This cycle of exhalation and inhalation is repeated to provide continuous locomotion.<ref name=Ruppert/>

Fast jetting is an escape response. In this form of locomotion, radial muscles in the mantle wall are involved as well as circular ones, making it possible to hyper-inflate the mantle cavity with a larger volume of water than during slow jetting. On contraction, water flows out with great force, the funnel always being pointed anteriorly, and travel is backwards. During this means of locomotion, some squid exit the water in a similar way to [[flying fish]], gliding through the air for up to {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, and occasionally ending up on the decks of ships.<ref name=Ruppert/>

===Feeding===
Squid are [[carnivore]]s, and, with their strong arms and suckers, can overwhelm relatively large animals efficiently. Prey is identified by sight or by touch, grabbed by the tentacles which can be shot out with great rapidity, brought back to within reach of the arms, and held by the hooks and suckers on their surface.<ref name=Messenger/> In some species, the squid's saliva contains [[toxin]]s which act to subdue the prey. These are injected into its bloodstream when the prey is bitten, along with vasodilators and chemicals to stimulate the heart, and quickly circulate to all parts of its body.<ref name=Ruppert/> The deep sea squid ''[[Taningia danae]]'' has been filmed releasing blinding flashes of light from large photophores on its arms to illuminate and disorientate potential prey.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kubodera, T. |author2=Koyama, Y. |author3=Mori, K. |year=2006 |title=Observations of wild hunting behaviour and bioluminescence of a large deep-sea, eight-armed squid, ''Taningia danae'' |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=274 |issue=1613 |pages=1029–1034 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0236 |pmid=17301020 |pmc=2124471 |url=http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/proceedings_b/papers/RSPB20060236.pdf |access-date=13 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216024900/http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/proceedings_b/papers/RSPB20060236.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Ventouse calmar.jpg|thumb|The whip-like tentacles of ''[[Mastigoteuthis]]'' are covered with tiny suckers to catch small organisms like [[flypaper]]]]

Although squid can catch large prey, the mouth is relatively small, and the food must be cut into pieces by the chitinous beak with its powerful muscles before being swallowed. The radula is located in the buccal cavity and has multiple rows of tiny teeth that draw the food backwards and grind it in pieces.<ref name=Ruppert/> The deep sea squid ''[[Mastigoteuthis]]'' has the whole length of its whip-like tentacles covered with tiny suckers; it probably catches small organisms in the same way that [[flypaper]] traps flies. The tentacles of some [[bathypelagic]] squids bear [[photophore]]s which may bring food within its reach by attracting prey.<ref name=Messenger>{{cite book |author1=Hanlon, Roger T. |author2=Messenger, John B. |title=Cephalopod Behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nxfv6xZZ6WYC&pg=PA47 |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-64583-6 |pages=47–49}}</ref>

Squid are among the most intelligent invertebrates. For example, groups of [[Humboldt squid]] hunt cooperatively, spiralling up through the water at night and coordinating their vertical and horizontal movements while foraging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deepseanews.com/2012/06/coordinated-hunting-in-red-devils/ |title=Coordinated Hunting in Red Devils |publisher=Deep Sea News|author=Smith, Helena|date= 5 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611054534/http://deepseanews.com/2012/06/coordinated-hunting-in-red-devils/|archive-date=11 June 2012|access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref>

===Reproduction===
[[File:Squid colors 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'') employs a complex array of colour changes during courtship and social interactions]]

Courtship in squid takes place in the open water and involves the male selecting a female, the female responding, and the transfer by the male of spermatophores to the female. In many instances, the male may display to identify himself to the female and drive off any potential competitors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arnold, John M. |year=1965 |title=Observations on the Mating Behavior of the Squid ''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'' |journal=Bulletin of Marine Science |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=216–222 |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1965/00000015/00000001/art00008 }}</ref> Elaborate changes in body patterning take place in some species in both agonistic and courtship behaviour. The [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea''), for example, employs a complex array of colour changes during courtship and social interactions and has a range of about 16 body patterns in its repertoire.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hanlon, Roger T. |author2=Messenger, John B. |title=Cephalopod Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nxfv6xZZ6WYC&pg=PA42 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-64583-6 |page=42}}</ref>

The pair adopt a head-to-head position, and "jaw locking" may take place, in a similar manner to that adopted by some [[cichlid]] fish.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jackson, George D. |author2=Jackson, Christine H. |year=2004 |title=Mating and spermatophore placement in the onychoteuthid squid ''Moroteuthis ingens'' |journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=783–784 |doi=10.1017/S0025315404009932 |s2cid=86725399 }}</ref> The heterodactylus of the male is used to transfer the spermatophore and deposit it in the female's mantle cavity in the position appropriate for the species; this may be adjacent to the gonopore or in a seminal receptacle.<ref name=Ruppert/>

[[File:Squid Eggs (6997601241).jpg|thumb|Squid eggs<!--in the Philippines-->]]

The sperm may be used immediately or may be stored. As the eggs pass down the oviduct, they are wrapped in a gelatinous coating, before continuing to the mantle cavity, where they are fertilised. In ''[[Loligo]]'', further coatings are added by the nidimental glands in the walls of the cavity and the eggs leave through a funnel formed by the arms. The female attaches them to the substrate in strings or groups, the coating layers swelling and hardening after contact with sea water. ''Loligo'' sometimes forms breeding aggregations which may create a "community pile" of egg strings. Some pelagic and deep sea squid do not attach their egg masses, which float freely.<ref name=Ruppert/>

==Ecology==
Squid mostly have an annual life cycle, growing fast and dying soon after spawning. The diet changes as they grow but mostly consists of large [[zooplankton]] and small [[nekton]]. In Antarctica for example, [[krill]] is the main constituent of the diet, with other food items being [[Amphipoda|amphipods]], other small [[crustacean]]s, and large [[Chaetognatha|arrow worms]]. Fish are also eaten, and some squid are [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Nemoto.

As well as occupying a key role in the food chain, squid are an important prey for predators including sharks, sea birds, seals and whales. Juvenile squid provide part of the diet for [[Polychaete|worms]] and small fish. When researchers studied the contents of the stomachs of [[elephant seal]]s in South Georgia, they found 96% squid by weight.<ref name=Staaf/> In a single day, a sperm whale can eat 700 to 800 squid,<ref name=Staaf>{{cite book|author=Staaf, Danna |title=Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udIwDwAAQBAJ |year=2017 |publisher=University Press of New England |isbn=978-1-5126-0128-2 |page=2}}</ref> and a [[Risso's dolphin]] entangled in a net in the Mediterranean was found to have eaten [[Ancistroteuthis|angel clubhook squid]], [[Histioteuthis bonnellii|umbrella squid]], [[Histioteuthis reversa|reverse jewel squid]] and [[European flying squid]], all identifiable from their indigestible beaks.<ref name=Blanco>{{cite journal |author1=Würtz, M. |author2=Poggi, R. |author3=Clarke, Malcolm R. |year=1992 |title=Cephalopods from the stomachs of a Risso's dolphin (''Grampus griseus'') from the Mediterranean |journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom  |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=861–867 |doi=10.1017/S0025315400060094 }}</ref> ''[[Ornithoteuthis volatilis]]'', a common squid from the tropical Indo-Pacific, is predated by [[yellowfin tuna]], [[Alepisaurus ferox|longnose lancetfish]], [[Mahi-mahi|common dolphinfish]] and [[swordfish]], the [[tiger shark]], the [[scalloped hammerhead|scalloped hammerhead shark]] and the [[Smooth hammerhead|smooth hammerhead shark]].
