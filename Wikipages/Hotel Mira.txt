'''Hotel Mira''' (formerly known as '''JPNSGRLS''') – is an alternative rock band formed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] in 2010. The band consists of Charlie Kerr, vocalist/lyricist; Mike Noble on bass; Clark Grieve on guitar and keyboards; and Cole George on drums.

==History==
The band members are all originally from the [[Greater Vancouver]] area. Kerr and co-founding lead guitarist Oliver Mann formed a core project in 2007 while still in secondary school, with Christopher McClelland joining in 2009 and Graham Serl rounding out the lineup for JPNSGRLS in 2010.<ref>[http://www.asapmusicblog.ca/2013/10/18/interview-japanese-girls/ 'Interview:JPNSGRLS'] ASAP Music Blog, October 18, 2013, Retrieved April 3, 2015</ref> Live shows were integral to the band from its beginning, performing in battles of the bands, and packing out any venue that would allow teenage performers and their audiences.

Prior to 2010, JPNSGRLS was originally known as ''The Beauties'', but due to a name conflict with an existing band, changed its name to ''Japanese Girls''. This name was chosen as a tribute to another band they admired - an all-female Japanese indie band called [[Mass of the Fermenting Dregs]].<ref>[http://theflyingv.com/yvrlive-slug/japanese-girls-talk-band-name-the-sharkweek-ep-vancouvers-live-scene/ 'Japanese Girls talk band name, The Sharkweek EP, Vancouver’s live scene'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408185358/http://theflyingv.com/yvrlive-slug/japanese-girls-talk-band-name-the-sharkweek-ep-vancouvers-live-scene/ |date=2015-04-08 }} The Flying V Blog, July 23, 2013, Retrieved April 3, 2015.</ref> However, upon realizing it caused difficulty when searching for the band online, they stylized it to JPNSGRLS.

The band is a fixture on the Vancouver independent music scene, and is known for its hyperkinetic live shows. While Kerr is the sole lyricist, JPNSGRLS took a democratic approach with all members contributing to the building of the songs overall.

JPNSGRLS was nominated for the [[Sirius XM Canada]] Independent Music Award for 'Emerging Artist of the Year (English)' in April 2015.<ref>[http://indies.ca/2015-siriusxm-indie-awards-nominees-announced/ '2015 SIRIUSXM INDIE AWARDS NOMINEES ANNOUNCED'] Sirius XM Indie Nominees Website, April 8, 2015, Retrieved April 11, 2015</ref>

In January 2016, after the recording of the band's second full-length album ''Divorce'' was completed, Oliver Mann announced via Facebook that he was leaving the band for other pursuits. 'As some of you already know, 2016 will be a big change for me, in the fact that I have recently decided to leave JPNSGRLS. It was a tough decision to make, but something I had been thinking about for a long time,' he said. 'Being a part of JPNSGRLS was amazing, and I am sad to leave it. I got to see so much of the world and am very proud of what we had accomplished over the last 8 years.'<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/oliver.e.mann/posts/10154518024354922 |title=Oliver Mann's Facebook statement on leaving JPNSGRLS |last1=Mann |first1=Oliver |date=January 3, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}</ref> After the band mounted a search and auditioned several musicians, Colton Lauro, also from the Greater Vancouver area and having worked with several area acts as well as being a session musician, became the band's new lead guitarist in the spring of 2016.

In April 2018, Charlie Kerr announced via several social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and the new band website, that the band was retiring the name of JPNSGRLS, and renaming the band as Hotel Mira. He also announced a new iteration of the band line-up, as Serl and McClelland had left the band in January 2017 for personal reasons. Lauro would stay on as lead guitarist and Mike Noble was added as a new bass player. Along with these changes, the announcement also included a new single, 3AM Lullaby - the first as Hotel Mira.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/charlie.kerr.35/posts/10209460275497305 |title=Charlie Kerr's Facebook statement on Hotel Mira changes |last1=Kerr |first1=Charlie |date=April 6, 2018|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/hotelmiramusic/posts/1834792553250015 |title=JPNSGRLS Facebook statement on Hotel Mira changes |last1=Mira |first1=Hotel |date=April 6, 2018|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

After releasing a self-titled EP in August 2018, Hotel Mira released their first full-length album, ''Perfectionism'', on Valentine's Day, 2020. With the release of this album, the band was now rounded out by the addition of Clark Grieve on keyboards, and Cole George on drums - both of whom were previously session musicians working with several bands in the Vancouver area - including Grieve with Hillfolk with Lauro, and George with Andrew Phelan and The River and the Road, among others.<ref>[http://colegeorge.ca/shows/, 'Cole George'], Cole George website, No date of posting, Retrieved February 15, 2020</ref>Colton Lauro left the band in 2021.<ref>https://hollywoodlife.com/2021/08/19/hotel-mira-video-the-eyes-on-you/ 'Hotel Mira Bids Adieu To Perfectionism Era With Clever Bait & Switch In The Eyes On You'], Hollywood Life website, August 19, 2021, Retrieved August 19, 2021</ref>

===''Circulation (2014)'' as JPNSGRLS===

For their full-length debut, having now been fully signed by [[Light Organ Records]], the band went into Vancouver's [[Greenhouse Studios]] with producer [[Steve Bays]] ([[Hot Hot Heat]], [[Mounties (band)|Mounties]]), and engineer [[Greg Calbi]] ([[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[MGMT]], [[Tame Impala]], [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]]). ''Circulation'' was recorded in seven days without a [[click track]]. The album was released in North America on July 15, 2014.

Singles released from the album in North America were "Mushrooms", "Smalls", "Tiger", "Circulation" and "Southern Comforting", with official full videos released for "Mushrooms", "Smalls" and "Circulation".

Overall, reviews of ''Circulation'' were positive, and called particular attention to the record's energy and how it would translate live, and vice versa - noting the uplift of the rhythm section and the contrasting darker lyrical content.<ref>[https://issuu.com/discorder-magazine/docs/discorder_october_issuu/31?e=1265484/9574495 'Circulation Review'], Discorder Magazine, October 14 Issue, Page 31, Retrieved April 3, 2015</ref> Reviewers also noted that JPNSGRLS' combination of 90s alt-rock and post-punk revival created a complex modern rock sound that made it a 2014 musical peak.<ref>[http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/music/music-reviews/circulation-jpnsgrls-55 'Circulation Review'], Today Online, Singapore, July 17, 2014, Retrieved April 3, 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/review/183360-jpnsgrls-circulation 'JPNSGRLS:Circulation', Review], PopMatters.com, July 15, 2013, Retrieved April 3, 2015</ref> [[AbsolutePunk]]'s review indicated it was 'easily one of the best rock albums of 2014'.<ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3704242 JPNSGRLS Circulation, Review], Absolutepunk.net, July 15, 2015, Retrieved April 3, 2015</ref>

===''Divorce (2016)'' as JPNSGRLS===

JPNSGRLS' sophomore full album ''Divorce'' was released on July 22, 2016, with staggered releases set for the United States and the UK shortly thereafter. Once again, [[Steve Bays]] produced some tracks, along with [[Tom Dobrzanski]] ([[The Zolas]], [[Said the Whale]]) and David Schiffman - a well-known American producer/engineer who has worked on many iconic albums by [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], [[Biffy Clyro]] and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] - producing several other songs. Mastering was once more done by Greg Calbi. Recording took place in Vancouver's Monarch Studios and in Los Angeles.<ref>[http://daveschiffmanmusic.com/Site/Discography%20.html 'Dave Schiffmawen Discography'], Dave Schiffman website, no posting date, Retrieved June 19, 2016</ref>

Preview reviews for the album were positive and strong, with one reviewer pointing out the maturity and progression of the album from the time of ''Circulation''.  "Kerr moves away from predictable ‘indie-rock’ clichés, with ''Divorce'' being essentially a collection of unorthodox love songs; about letting go rather than holding on, about love as a two-way street, about what could have been, and about how we approach love in the modern world," said music website ''Circuit Sweet''. "The driving dominance of the Serl-McClelland rhythm section pumping out masterful and edgy layers, combined with the well-placed cross-section of electric guitar tones is a strand running throughout." It went on, "(The album) is of a more mature, melodic alternative-rock sound without losing any of JPNSGRLS infectious energy."<ref>[http://circuitsweet.co.uk/2016/05/jpnsgrls-announce-new-album-divorce-out-22-july-on-light-organ-records/ 'JPNSGRLS Announce New Album ‘Divorce’ out 22 July on Light Organ Records'], Circuit Sweet music website, May 29, 2016, Retrieved June 19, 2016</ref>

British music website FMS (FashionMusicStyle) went further in its take on Kerr's abilities as a lyricist, stating, "The tales of isolated youth, love and lust that filled their first album, ''Circulation'', make a welcome return, set apart from the pack by the quality of songwriting from lead singer Charlie Kerr... His songwriting captures elements of the witty social insight of [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], the sing-a-long choruses of the [[Oasis (band)|Gallagher]]'s and the honest emotion of [[Jesse Lacey]] and weaves it all together, as Kerr swings from vitriolic roar to crisp falsetto, singing with such passion that the listener cannot help but be pulled into his world...Whilst JPNSGRLS continue to experiment with their sound and influences, ''Divorce'' is a testament to the band's craftsmanship and talent as they create one of the best indie rock albums of the year so far."<ref>[http://fms-mag.com/jpnsgrls-the-thrill-of-imminent-divorce/ 'JPNSGRLS: The Thrill of Imminent Divorce'], FMS music website, June 18, 2016, Retrieved June 19, 2016</ref>

Post-release reviews of ''Divorce'' were also largely positive. "Stupid fun meets adult themes and wins in the end", said [[Muso's Guide]], who also gave the album "a thumbs up", called the track ''A Comprehensive List Of Things I Love'' "charmingly summer tinged" and stated the "band’s strength in depth is amply plumbed on subsequent track ''Circus'' as they slow things down just the right side of cornball".<ref>[http://www.musosguide.org.uk/k2-categories/albums/item/3132-jpnsgrls-divorce 'JPNSGRLS - Divorce'], Musos Guide music website, July 20, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>
[[Substream Magazine]] said that "''Divorce'' offers a wholly refreshing take on indie rock that traverses several areas of the genre and its adjacent variations...It’s catchy, structurally innovative, and sonically invigorating, with riffs riding riffs to victory, sure to accept its trophies atop ‘best of 2016’ podiums aplenty."<ref>[http://substreammagazine.com/2016/07/premiere-jpnsgrls-divorce/ 'PREMIERE: JPNSGRLS transcend genre boundaries with ‘Divorce’'], Substream Magazine music website, July 20, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>"The band have drawn clear influence from the likes of [[The Hives]] and [[Arctic Monkeys]] but added their own unique touch", said ''Clunk Magazine'' - giving it 7.5 stars out of 10, and going on to say that ''Divorce'' "is cohesive, infectious and has multiple layers of intelligence through the songwriting."<ref>[https://clunkmag.com/2016/07/21/music-review-jpnsgrls-divorce/ 'Music | Review | JPNSGRLS – Divorce'], July 21, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>

''Glide Magazine'' gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, also calling out the single "Oh My God" for particular attention, stating that "the song showcases what JPNSGRLS does best, combining post-punk’s energy and riffing with the raw power and emotion of grunge". The site went on to say that "relentless in its intensity and deceptive in its intelligence, ''Divorce'' serves as an apt follow up to JPNSGRLS’ critically acclaimed debut."<ref>[http://www.glidemagazine.com/166720/jpnsgrls/ 'JPNSGRLS Build Upon Promise With ‘Divorce’(ALBUM REVIEW)'], July 22, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref> In their review, the ''[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]'' print version also gave ''Divorce'' 8 out of 10 stars, and stated that "the thundering indie rock of ''A Girl From A Different Dimension'', cool guitar effects of ''Trojan Horse'' and infectious riff of ''Bully for You'' mark them out as witty, fun, and intense indie rock in the same league as [[The Strokes]] and [[The Libertines]]. Full of verve and energy, these are unorthodox love songs about letting go."

In mildly dissenting reviews, [[NME]] had the initial view that the album was "packing angst-ridden, power-chord-heavy rock played at breakneck speed" and that "''Divorce'' is sprinkled with enough inventiveness to make it a success" with "gems to mine here", but ended by stating that "''Divorce'' is by no means a bad record, but nor is it a particularly memorable or noteworthy one."<ref>[https://www.nme.com/reviews/various-artists/16525 'JPNSGRLS - 'Divorce' Review'], NME Music website, July 20, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref> Stuart Derdyn of the [[Vancouver Sun]] said in his review of the album that "Charlie Kerr has the requisite swagger in his voice and enough range to go from a seductive and detached lower register to high-pitched howling on ''A Girl From A Different Dimension''…While the group is mostly thrashing full-on, it displays a great sense of pop hooks on the super-catchy ''A Comprehensive List of Things I Love'' — complete with call-and-response girl-group-style choruses. It doesn’t all work.

JPNSGRLS debuted ''Divorce''{{'}}s first single "Bully for You" exclusively via the [[PopMatters]] website in April 2016, with wide release set for April 15. [[PopMatters]] called "Bully for You" "an empathetic expression of male sympathy over the every day misogyny that women must face."

Kerr's statement on the song was that it is "an observational protest song about the ceaseless, unfair treatment of women from the point of view of a cisgendered man."<ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/post/jpnsgrls-bully-for-you-audio-premiere/ 'JPNSGRLS - "Bully For You" (audio) (premiere)'] PopMatters website, April 13, 2016, Retrieved April 15, 2016</ref> In an interview with Jon Williams of The Zone 91.3, a radio station out of Victoria, BC in Canada, Kerr expanded on this first by referencing the historical trope of rock music misogyny and not wanting to be on the wrong side of that, but also saying that he was "frustrated by stories from female friends, of oppression and unfair treatment", and that "maybe it's not our place as men to comment on it, but I haven't seen men say much."<ref>[http://www.thezone.fm/now/jon-chats-with-charlie-of-jpnsgrls/ 'Jon chats with Charlie of JPNSGRLS'] 91.3 The Zone website, Log of live broadcast, April 11, 2016, Retrieved April 15, 2016</ref>

Venerable German alternative music site Visions noted the socio-critical theme of the single and shifts from the band's previous work, along with the band's continuing ability to segue seamlessly between indie, pop and blues rock.<ref>[http://www.visions.de/news/24799/VISIONS-Premiere-Jpnsgrls-streamen-neuen-Track-Bully-For-You 'VISIONS Premiere: Jpnsgrls streamen neuen Track "Bully For You" '] Visions, German Alternative Music Online Magazine, April 13, 2016, Retrieved April 15, 2016</ref> Other music sites also commented on the explosive nature, both musically and lyrically, of "Bully for You", with one stating it was 'raucous rock at its best...filled with intense riffs, impassioned lyrics and exciting instrumentation.'<ref>[http://www.gigslutz.co.uk/premiere-jpnsgrls-bully-for-you/ 'Premiere: JPNSGRLS – ‘Bully For You’] Gigslutz, April 13, 2016, Retrieved April 15, 2016</ref> The video for ''Bully for You'' was released simultaneously via the British music website [[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] and the American music website ''Impose''. Directed by Kevan Funk, it initially appears to be a violent fight in a boxing ring between two men, that then subtly and viscerally changes to an intimate dance. "We have created this piece from a place of hope empathy and compassion. The song "Bully For You" is essentially a protest song about the lack of gender equality in the world. And a big component of what society teaches boys, growing up, is to reject everything about themselves that is traditionally feminine, which ultimately leads to men seeing women as less than human," Kerr said.<ref>[http://www.clashmusic.com/videos/premiere-jpnsgrls-bully-for-you 'Premiere: JPNSGRLS - 'Bully For You'] Clash Magazine music website, July 11, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.imposemagazine.com/tv/jpnsgrls-bully-for-you 'JPNSGRLS, "Bully For You" (Embrace kindness, love and sensuality)'] Impose Magazine website, July 11, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>

On May 10, 2016, JPNSGRLS live-streamed a one-off video event via the [[Light Organ Records]] website. This served as a live-shot video for the second single "Oh My God", and also to announce the release date for the ''Divorce'' album. The Gondry-esque video showed Kerr, initially in a balaclava, being chased by a police officer through a purpose-built set in the Light Organ headquarters - half-destroying the set in the process - and ending up caught with the band while performing in studio.

The eponymous EP, released in August 2018, was the first with the new three-piece line-up of Kerr, Lauro and Noble, with session musicians used for percussion and keys, both in the studio and for touring. Speaking to [[BeatRoute]] magazine, Kerr characterised the new sound as being more 'streamlined', and that the continued involvement of Dave Schiffman as producer meant that 'he pushed me really hard to find better melodies, and do things that were more melodic, and find hooks in everything.' <ref>[http://beatroute.ca/2018/08/10/hotel-mira-open-business/ 'Hotel Mira is Open for Business'], BeatRoute magazine website, August 10, 2018, Retrieved January 6, 2019</ref>

''Perfectionism'', released on Valentine's Day 2020, and produced by [[Juno Award]] and [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[Eric Ratz]], spawned several singles and a slow burn sleeper airplay hit - ''This Could Be It For Me''. Singles released from the album, starting in October 2018, included: ''Jungle'', ''The Eyes on You'', ''This Could Be It For Me'', ''Speaking Off the Record'', and ''Better On Your Own'' - the latter released simultaneously with the album itself. On speaking with the [[Gauntlet (newspaper)]], Kerr characterised the choice of release date as deliberate but not for the obvious reason:'“I’ve always hated Valentine’s Day and what it stood for. It was cool to do something that I thought could be utilized for people who felt lonely that day, that they get a record to listen to instead of a diamond ring or some shit.'<ref>[https://thegauntlet.ca/2020/03/02/i-got-comfortable-with-the-fact-that-i-was-uncomfortable-hotel-miras-thoughts-on-perfectionism/ 'I got comfortable with the fact that I was uncomfortable: Hotel Mira’s thoughts on Perfectionism'], The Gauntlet website, March 2, 2020, Retrieved February 20, 2021</ref>

The iconic video for ''This Could Be It For Me'' - premiered on the ''Popdust'' website and directed by Zachary Vague and Sterling Larose - featured searing visuals that ran the gamut from a [[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)]] homage, to an underwater sequence with Kerr in chains around his neck, to a hard neon performance section under a bridge. ''Popdust'''s Matthew Apadula opined that 'but for all its surface glitz and familiar flavor, ''This Could Be It For Me'' is still more interested in grappling with the internal darkness inside each of us more than it's interested in darkness as a video aesthetic.'<ref>[https://www.popdust.com/hotel-mira-new-music-video-2640811645.html 'Hotel Mira Lives To Fight Another Day In New Video For "This Could Be It For Me"'], Popdust website, October 3, 2019, Retrieved February 23, 2020</ref> [[WXVU]] publication ''Barricade'' said the single 'flaunts Hotel Mira's immaculate pop sensibility along with producer Eric Ratz's prowess behind the board'.<ref>[https://wxvubarricade.com/2020/02/09/hotel-mira-perfects-power-pop-on-new-album-perfectionism/amp/ 'Hotel Mira Perfects Power Pop on New Album, Perfectionism'] Barricade website, February 9, 2020</ref>Kerr himself went on to say in a January 2021 interview with Adam Lisicky of ''Bringin' it Backwards'' in association with [[American Songwriter]] that 'our biggest radio single is like explicitly about...having suicidal thoughts, and having them come up at like very inopportune times - and then, you know, the big kind of silver lining is like, it will go away, but also, it might come back... it's probably going to come back, so there's that line of 'if it's not tonight/then it's still on my mind/how nice'.<ref>[https://www.bringinitbackwards.com/pod/hotelmira?rq=charlie%20kerr 'Interview with Hotel Mira'], Bringin' It Back website, January 27, 2021, Retrieved February 20, 2021</ref>By February 2021, YouTube views of that video sat at over 75000, as well as for the video of ''Better On Your Own'' - itself a Wes-Andersonesque animation by Callum Scott-Dyson.

The final video from ''Perfection'' for ''Eyes on You'', directed by Lindsey Blane, was released exclusively via the [[Hollywood Life]] website in August 2021. The song, about the deterioration of a relationship, resulted in highly metaphoric video, in which Kerr and his bandmates buried the ubiquitous pink jacket used during their ''Perfection'' era, setting up the next new start for the constantly evolving band.<ref>[https://hollywoodlife.com/2021/08/19/hotel-mira-video-the-eyes-on-you/ 'Hotel Mira Bids Adieu To Perfectionism Era With Clever Bait & Switch In The Eyes OnYou'], Hollywood Life website, August 19, 2021, Retrieved August 19, 2021</ref><ref>https://www.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=2262747 'Hotel Mira - Morning Jam'], CTV news website, August 19, 2021, Retrieved August 19, 2021</ref>

Hotel Mira have also long been a supporter of the [[LGBT]] community, women's rights and mental health issues, as evidenced by the singles "Brandon", "Mushrooms", and "Bully for You", along with several gigs they have played over the years supporting all of these causes. In May 2019, Charlie Kerr gave an interview to the ''British Columbia Schizophrenia Society'' about his own struggles with mental health and how music was a vital antidote to the very serious disorders he has suffered from for most of his life - and that right treatment also made all the difference. "I started treating myself with some kindness for the first time," he admitted. "I realized that since I didn’t have a neurotypical brain, it was okay if I experienced life a bit differently, and that was more freeing than defeating."<ref>[https://www.bcss.org/hotel-miras-charlie-kerr-puts-mental-illness-centre-stage/ 'Hotel Mira’s Charlie Kerr Puts Mental Illness Centre Stage'] British Columbia Schizophrenia Society Website, May 22, 2019, Retrieved May 22, 2019</ref>

As a band, we refuse to lend our name and music to any power structure unwilling to look at and change their racism' - pulling out of a local virtual municipal concert for this reason.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/hotelmiramusic/photos/a.189995907729696/3335360536526535 |title=Hotel Mira's statement on Racism|last1=Mira |first1=Hotel |date=June 19, 2020|accessdate=February 20, 2021}}</ref>

The German press remarked on JPNSGRLS' particular mix of influences and how they played out live, calling their sound 'a bit grungy, a little blues, a pinch of post-punk, the full program alt-rock - and implemented on a very unique, modern way'.<ref>[http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/heftarchiv/online-megazine/festivals-live-reviews/turbowolf-koeln-mtc.html 'Turbowolf/JPNSGRLS Review'] Rock Hard (German Language Music Website), May 9, 2015, Retrieved May 31, 2015</ref>

However, it was the British music press that were the most moved by the band's performances and indeed the anticipation of same. In Brighton, the band 'had a line down the street to try and witness their much lauded performances',<ref>[http://www.theaureview.com/reviews/highlights-from-day-one-of-the-great-escape-2015 'Highlights From Day One of The Great Escape'] The AU Review, May 15, 2015, Retrieved May 31, 2015</ref> while the Nottingham press declared that JPNSGRLS 'were not only a pleasure to watch, but a pleasure to listen to, playing an incredibly tightly-woven set of songs, full of intensity and gusto.' <ref>[http://www.nottinghamlive.co.uk/live/review-hit-the-deck-festival-nottingham-26-april-2015/ 'Review: Hit the Deck Festival – Nottingham – 26 April 2015'], Nottingham Live website, April 26, 2015, Retrieved May 31, 2015</ref> In Birmingham, Kerr drew particular attention as 'he gyrates and dances like Jagger, (and) wraps himself around the mic stand like Julian Casablancas'.<ref>[http://www.therockclubuk.com/index.php/reviews/live-reviews-72036/2184-jpngrls15 'JPNSGRLS, Wagon and Horses, Birmingham - 16 May 2015'], The Rock Club UK website, May 16, 2015, Retrieved May 31, 2015</ref>

It was JPNSGRLS' final date on this tour, in Liverpool at the Sound City Festival, which cemented their international live reputation. Kerr, already known for his physical dynamism onstage, accidentally split his head open on metal risers holding Serl's drums in place. Undeterred, both he and the band continued the set to a double encore with Kerr bleeding profusely, stating, "How's this for a deal? I bled for you, you can dance for me." It was coincidentally the day before Kerr's birthday and he ended the set by saying, "In just two hours I'm going to turn 24, and I can't think of any better place to be than here with you and a head trauma." This left the local press commenting on the 'insane beauty' of the band.<ref>[http://www.getintothis.co.uk/2015/05/liverpool-sound-city-2015-review-jpnsgrls-mouses-jesse-sheehan-close-talker-young-benjamins-ady-suleiman-his-new-atlas/ 'Liverpool Sound City 2015 review: JPNSGRLS, Mouses, Jesse Sheehan, Close Talker, Young Benjamins, Ady Suleiman, His New Atlas'], Get Into This website, May 23, 2015, Retrieved May 31, 2015</ref>

Throughout the rest of 2015 into early 2016, JPNSGRLS continued to perform at festivals, individual gigs and showcases across Canada and the United States - once again taking in [[CMJ Music Marathon]] and the [[Taste of Edmonton]], as well as new ones with Sofar, Breakout West, and the [[Pemberton Music Festival]].

Music site ''Gigs North East'' stated in their review of the Newcastle performance that 'JPNSGRLS have such a distinctive sound. What's impressive is how all their genre stylings mesh together to create real quality.' While in Germany, JPNSGRLS were interviewed, and played several unplugged songs for German music television institution [[Rockpalast]]. Their live concert performance in Cologne was recorded, and broadcast by Rockpalast in July 2016.<ref>[http://www.tenementtv.com/reviews/the-heavy-oran-mor-glasgow/ 'The Heavy @ Oran Mor 15/05/16'] Tenement TV website, May 17, 2016, Retrieved June 4, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.gigsnortheast.co.uk/live-review-the-heavy-nusu/ 'Live Review: The Heavy @ NUSU']{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Gigs North East website, No date listed for posting, Retrieved June 4, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/rockpalast/bands/banduebersicht-jpnsgrls-100.html 'JPNSGRLS - Garage-Rock aus Kanada'] Rockpalast website, May 22, 2016, Retrieved June 4, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/rockpalast/video-rockpalast-jpnsgrls-luxor-koeln--100.html 'Rockpalast: JPNSGRLS (Luxor, Köln 2016)'] Rockpalast website, Live Archive, July 11, 2016, Retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>

In Glasgow, music site Musicscramble observed the strength of a band late in a two-month tour playing to a small crowd - observing that the band were 'still thriving and feeding off the energy provided by a pocket of fervent gig-goers', continuing that the music itself was 'both manic and serene all at once.

In 2018, ''Hotel Mira'' debuted the new line up by their first gig at the Biltmore Hotel in April. This was quickly followed by several one-off gigs around Vancouver and Victoria. In May 2018, the band performed several gigs as part of [[Canadian Music Week]] (CMW), including but not limited to the then Adelaide Hall (now Radio).<ref>[https://cmw.net/music/artists/hotel-mira/ 'Hotel Mira'], CMW website, No posting date, Retrieved January 6, 2019</ref> On seeing the gig at Adelaide Hall, Peter Montreuil, writing for [[Bob Segarini]]'s blog, noted Kerr 'as a very animated frontman who has some powerful lyrics to work with', going on to muse: 'A picture paints a thousand words? He showed a documentary with less than 10 words and a gesture. I am so glad that I was there to witness that.'<ref>[https://bobsegarini.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/peter-beer-barrels-through-cmw-2018/ 'Peter (Beer) Barrels through CMW 2018'], Bob Segarini's Blog website, May 27, 2018, Retrieved January 6, 2019.</ref>

'So I booked an entire US tour by myself, that was gonna happen in the summer (of 2020)...and the day we were applying was the day before lockdown - so we were planning on touring all summer and stuff...but the saving grace is that ''This Could Be It For Me'' got on the radio and got past some gatekeepers and wound up charting and ended up charting quite well...so we've had radio success all through 2020 and a bit of 2021...so it's been super kind of bittersweet and weird...I'm really grateful, obviously.'<ref>[https://www.bringinitbackwards.com/pod/hotelmira?rq=charlie%20kerr 'Interview with Hotel Mira'], Bringin' It Back website, January 27, 2021, Retrieved February 20, 2021</ref>
