'''Sertab Erener''' (born 4 December 1964) is a Turkish singer, songwriter and composer. With her [[coloratura soprano]] voice, she started working as a backing vocalist for [[Sezen Aksu]], and with Aksu's help she released her first studio album in the 1990s. Because of her education in [[classical music]], she initially had difficulties in performing pop music. Although she did experimental works from time to time, she eventually preferred to focus on making pop music instead of making [[avant-garde]] works, in order to make her music heard by a larger audience. In some of her works, she combined Western music and Eastern music, and benefited from [[opera]]s as well as [[Ottoman classical music|classical Turkish music]] together with ethnic elements. With her entrance to Europe's market in the early 2000s, many of her works were also sold in Turkey as well as European countries.

With Sezen Aksu's help, she made her debut in 1992 with the album ''Sakin Ol!'', and made herself known as a [[Turkish pop music]] artist in the 1990s by releasing the albums ''Lâ'l'' (1994), ''Sertab Gibi'' (1997) and ''Sertab Erener'' (1999). From these albums, the songs "Sakin Ol!", "Aldırma Deli Gönlüm", "Ateşle Barut", "Sevdam Ağlıyor", "Aslolan Aşktır", "Yanarım", "Zor Kadın" and "Vur Yüreğim" became number-one hits in Turkey. In the early 2000s, she continued her work by releasing the songs "Kumsalda" and "Kendime Yeni Bir Ben Lazım". She won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] with the song "[[Everyway That I Can]]", marking [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]]'s first victory in the competition. In 2004, she released the album ''[[No Boundaries (Sertab Erener album)|No Boundaries]]'', followed by ''Aşk Ölmez'' in 2005. After five years, she released another Turkish studio album ''Rengârenk'' in 2010, and the hit songs "Bu Böyle", "Açık Adres" and "Koparılan Çiçekler" made the album a successful work, and marked her return to the music market. After ''Rengârenk'', she released the album ''Ey Şuh-i Sertab'' (2012), which was dedicated to her father. At the same year, she received the Best Female TSM Soloist award at the Golden Butterfly Awards. In 2013, her new album ''Sade'' was released. The songs "İyileşiyorum", "Öyle de Güzel" and "Söz" all became hits in Turkey. In 2016, with the release of ''Kırık Kalpler Albümü'', Erener stated that she was returning to her 90s style. The album received favorable reviews, and "Kime Diyorum" and "Olsun" both became hit songs inside Turkey.

Erener has been praised for her music style and is one of the most successful artists who were discovered by Sezen Aksu. Due to her championship in Eurovision, she received the [[State Medal of Distinguished Service]]. In 2014, ''[[Hürriyet]]'' named her in its list of "91 Symbols of the 91st Anniversary of the Republic". Aside from her career as a singer, she also taught music at Müjdat Gezen Art Center for one year. Erener has been married three times, the second of which was to [[Levent Yüksel]] during 1990-96. She married Emre Kula in 2015. Throughout her career she has won seven [[Turkey Music Awards|Kral TV Video Music Awards]] as well as two Golden Butterfly Awards, and has received various other nominations.

Erener initially did not want to accept the offer and later said: "She [Sezen Aksu] asked me to become her backing vocalist. I didn't accept it. Because I was already a soloist. It sounded like taking a step backwards. I thought I shouldn't be a vocalist because of my position."

=== 1992–98: ''Sakin Ol!'', ''Lâ'l'' and ''Sertab Gibi'' ===
Erener's name began to be heard in the early 1990s with Sezen Aksu's help. She prepared her first studio album with the help of Aksu, [[Uzay Heparı]], [[Aysel Gürel]] and [[Garo Mafyan]]. Aksu spent a lot of money and time to help Erener in her album's preparations. Erener later talked about her experience: "I learned this country and land's music with Sezen's help. It was after meeting her that I became truly interested in the music that I was making here [in Turkey]. That is why Sezen had a lot of trouble when she was making that cassette for me, thinking about where in this [music industry] I belong to. Because people were saying 'Sertab sings well in English, but not in Turkish.' Those words had divided her mind in two parts."<ref name=sinema/> The album, titled ''Sakin Ol!'', was released in 1992. Sertab Erener made a huge debut with the album's lead single, also titled "Sakin Ol!". To assist Erener, both Aksu and Uzay Heparı appeared on the song's music video.

In June 2016, Erener's eleventh studio album ''Kırık Kalpler Albümü'' was published by GNL. The album's first music video was made for the song "Kime Diyorum" and directed by Can Saban. The album's production and arrangement was done by Erener's husband Emre Kula.

In 2015, together with her husband guitarist Emre Kula, bassist Eser Ünsalan, keyboardist Ozan Yılmaz and drummer Alpar Lu she found the group Oceans of Noise and they started to make English rock music.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haberturk.com/sertab-erener-in-yeni-grubu-oceans-of-noise-1682493 |title=Sertab Erener'in yeni grubu |work=Habertürk |date=22 October 2017 |access-date=15 February 2018}}</ref> In 2017, the group's first [[Extended play|EP]] was released. At the same time, they did the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Ayla: The Daughter of War]]''. Beginning in late 2017, Erener started to perform on a musical titled ''Sertab'ın Müzikali'' to mark the 25th year of her career. During the musical, which consisted of two separate sections, Erener performed her hit songs from 1990s and 2000s and was accompanied by professional dancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/pembenar/sertabin-muzikali-herkesi-buyuledi-2577597|title=Sertab'ın müzikali herkesi büyüledi|newspaper=Milliyet|date=22 December 2017|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref> The preparations for the musical began in 2015 and Beyhan Murphy served as the show's choreographer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/cadde/sertab-erener-muzikal-cocukluk-hayalimdi-2650909|title=Sertab Erener: 'Müzikal çocukluk hayalimdi'|newspaper=Milliyet|date=19 April 2018|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref> The show also continued in 2018 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/kultur-sanat/sertabin-muzikali-ocakta-da-devam-ediyor-6104174|title=Sertab'ın Müzikali Ocak'ta da devam ediyor|newspaper=Milliyet|date=19 December 2019|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref> Eda Ünsün of ''[[Milliyet]]'' praised Erener and her band's performance together the show's visuals adding that "a musical spree started in Turkey under the leadership of Erener".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/sertab-in-muzikali-muzikaller-cagi-baslatti-molatik-14363/|title=Sertab'ın Müzikali, müzikaller çağı başlattı|newspaper=Milliyet|first=Eda|last=Ünsün|date=27 February 2020|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>

== Artistry  ==
=== Music style and voice ===
Erener's voice possesses a 3-octave [[vocal range]] and is of [[coloratura soprano]] type. She is a [[pop music]] artist.<ref name="ates"/> Her songs are in "a range of Middle Eastern melodies to club songs".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/pazar/2009/12/13/sertab_erener_ile_gecmise_yolculuk|title=Sertab Erener ile geçmişe yolculuk|newspaper=Sabah|first=Melis|last=Danişmend|date=13 December 2009|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref> In the 1980s, she was involved in opera when she was first introduced to music, but when she couldn't find the success she was expecting in the opera, she decided to make pop music instead. She later talked about the experience: "It didn't turn out the way I thought or imagined. Maybe it was another [type of] opera that I created within myself. How can I know? There was no such scholarship to go abroad, it didn't exist. Later I said to myself that I'll sing [[jingle]]. That way I make money. It's best to do something on my own."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/10495371.asp|title=Sertab Erener ve opera|newspaper=Hürriyet|first=Tufan|last=Türenç|date=3 December 2008|access-date=21 June 2015}}</ref> She had a lot of difficulties with changing her style from opera to pop music.<ref name=pavarotti/> Semih Günver of ''Milliyet'' wrote about Erener in her article in 1994: "What a colorful, sweet voice. This young woman is a great singer. A real soprano performer."<ref>{{cite news|title=Hepsi geldi geçti|newspaper=Milliyet|page=20|first=Semih|last=Günver|date=23 November 1994}}</ref> Tolga Akyıldız also wrote about her in an article for ''Hürriyet'': "Sertab is one of the first brands of Turkish popular music with the power of both sound and song selection."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=-250714|title=Sertab'a bu kadarı yetmemeli|newspaper=Hürriyet|first=Tolga|last=Akyıldız|date=24 June 2001|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> Before becoming famous she performed in English for years, and as a result, in some parts of her first album ''Sakin Ol!'' she sang "things she didn't know the meaning of", and got tired with the efforts to figure out how to say and pronounce some words. In her second album, ''Lâ'l'', she realized this problem and worked on the songs with more interest and stopped dealing with only the technical part of the project.<ref name=pavarotti/> With her third album, ''Sertab Gibi'', she started songwriting and composing. Although she was more focused on the musical aspect of her works, her voice still stood out on the foreground.<ref name="demirledi">{{cite news|title=Yeniden hayata Demir'ledi|newspaper=Milliyet Pazar|first=Aslı|last=Çakır|page=3|date=15 June 1997}}</ref> She later described ''Sertab Gibi'' as an experiment and said: "It [the album] might have failed commercially at the time, but in terms of my career I came to the point where everyone said 'Wow, look at this woman!' With this experience, I realized that I have to say what I want through music, and Turkish people's appreciation can be won little by little, and I have to walk with them step by step and make the music. Otherwise, I have the capacity to produce completely [[avant-garde]] things, but it is something that only my friends would listen to. Yet I want to appeal to a wider audience. In this case, I believe that pop music is the right language to send the message and go one step further together."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/-ortunuyoruz-iste-/modaguzellik/haberdetay/01.01.1900/537296/default.htm|title=Örtünüyoruz işte!|newspaper=Milliyet Vitrin|first=Handan|last=Bayındır|page=4|date=28 July 2001|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref>

Her fourth album ''Sertab Erener'' was found "far from experimental works and more settled" compared to her previous three albums.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=-66784|title=Yeni bir isim|newspaper=Hürriyet|first=Lale|last=Barçın İmer|date=7 March 1999|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> Her fifth album, ''Turuncu'', was released with the purpose to connect people with life through a positive energy. She also demolished the image she had created with the song "Zor Kadın (Difficult Woman)" in the previous album with "Güle Güle Şekerim (Bye Bye Sweetie)" in the new one.<ref name="turuncu"/> "Everyway That I Can", with which she joined Eurovision in 2003, was decorated with ethnic motifs and was a mixture of classical pop and Turkish music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2003/05/25/yasam/ayas.html|title=Avrupa'ya Türk müziği damgası|newspaper=Milliyet|page=3|date=25 May 2003|access-date=26 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=76263|title=Eurovision'un ev sahibiyiz|newspaper=[[Radikal]]|date=26 May 2003|access-date=26 April 2013}}</ref> Her seventh album, ''Aşk Ölmez'', was prepared in a very unpretentious way. With ''Aşk Ölmez'', Erener put aside the idea of "I have to show all the information I've ever had in the first five minutes of the song, and I must reveal my voice there!".<ref name="at">{{cite news|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=316624|title=Üstüne binilemeyen vahşi bir atken kendimi eğittim|newspaper=Hürriyet|first=Sema|last=Denker|date=4 May 2005|access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref> She later talked about the album: "It's a little bit fooling around with the idea of love and being human.. I believe there is a philosophy behind it. There are also small jokes, but the album is about women and men and their relationships.... I tried to write about the conflicts that we have in between us, sometimes by taking it as a joke, and sometimes taking it seriously. These are the problems of the majority of people; after all, I don't live anything apart from them. As a person who lives in a big city, I talk about such person's issues. Based on these, I wrote the lyrics of the album."<ref name="bakis"/> Together with Demir Demirkan, she released the jazz fusion album ''Painted On Water'', which included [[türkü]]s that were rewritten in English and re-performed.<ref name="senin"/> With her eighth album ''Rengârenk'', she put "diva acts aside" and sang in a more calm manner.<ref name="diva"/>

=== Influences ===
[[File:Barbra Streisand My Name is Barbra television special 1965.JPG|thumb|upright|Erener was influenced by [[Barbra Streisand]] as she developed her singing style]]
Erener spent her childhood listening to her father's performances of classical Turkish songs. [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Tina Turner]] were among her favorite artists.<ref name="demirledi"/> ''Milliyet''{{'}}s Orhan Kahyaoğlu later said that "despite the influence of Sezen Aksu, she was easily stripped from Sezen's music style due to her own refinement and artistic background."<ref>{{cite news|title=Elini gençlerden çek, Sezen!|newspaper=Milliyet Pazar|first=Orhan|last=Kahyaoğlu|page=16|date=16 November 1997}}</ref> Erener said that before Sezen Aksu, she learned a lot during stage performances in terms of communicating with the audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/kultur/artik_popun_disinda_bir_yerdeyim-1008852|title=Artık popun dışında bir yerdeyim|newspaper=Radikal|location=İstanbul|first=Umut|last=Eroğlu|date=19 July 2010|access-date=22 June 2015}}</ref> She has named [[Barbra Streisand]] as the "woman of [her] life". She said that she constantly imitated Streisand before becoming famous, saying: "I can't say how I used to imitate her. I've studied this woman a lot, so much. When I decided to sing my own songs, I became aware that it doesn't work like that, with imitation. After that I tried so hard to find the identity of my voice."<ref name="psikopat"/>
