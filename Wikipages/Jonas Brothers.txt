Additionally, they opened for [[The Veronicas]] in early 2006. For their first album, titled ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'', the band collaborated with several writers, including [[Adam Schlesinger]] ([[Fountains of Wayne]]), [[Mike Mangini|Michael Mangini]] ([[Joss Stone]]), [[Desmond Child]] ([[Aerosmith]], [[Bon Jovi]]), [[Billy Mann]] ([[Destiny's Child]], [[Jessica Simpson]]) and Steve Greenberg. The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times, due to executive changes at [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have "another lead single" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band [[Busted (band)|Busted]] – "[[Year 3000#Jonas Brothers cover|Year 3000]]" and "[[What I Go to School For#Jonas Brothers version|What I Go to School For]]". The Jonas Brothers' first single, "[[Mandy (Jonas Brothers song)|Mandy]]", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]'' on February 22, 2006, and reached number four. Another song, "[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|Time for Me to Fly]]", was released on the ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'' soundtrack, also in February. In March, "[[Mandy (Jonas Brothers song)|Mandy]]" was featured in the [[Nickelodeon]] television film ''[[Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up]]'' and the ''[[Zoey 101: Music Mix]]'' soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on [[Cartoon Network]]'s Friday night programming block ''Fridays''.<ref name="MTV News" />

The band covered "[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]" from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' for the ''[[Disneymania 4]]'' album, released on April 4, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r823795|pure_url=yes}} |title=Disneymania, Vol. 4 > Overview |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 29, 2008}}</ref> Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'', airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the [[Disney Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-dragon-jake-long/episodes/ |title=American Dragon: Jake Long episode guide |publisher=[[TV.com]] |access-date=August 29, 2008}}</ref> ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' was finally released on August 8, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} According to the band's manager, it was only a "limited release" of 50,000 copies, so the album's price can rise as high as $200–$300 USD on auction sites like [[eBay]]. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers considered switching labels. On October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, "Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)", was re-released on ''Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worshipmusic.com/40462.html |title=Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection |publisher=WorshipMusic.com |access-date=September 1, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224225020/http://www.worshipmusic.com/40462.html |archive-date = December 24, 2007}}</ref> The same month, the Jonas Brothers covered "[[Poor Unfortunate Souls]]" from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disc special-edition release of [[The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)|''The Little Mermaid'' soundtrack]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FZDIL8 |title=Little Mermaid Soundtrack (Special Edition) |access-date=September 1, 2008}}</ref> The second single from ''It's About Time'' was "[[Year 3000#Jonas Brothers cover|Year 3000]]", the music video of which premiered on the Disney Channel in January 2007. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.
