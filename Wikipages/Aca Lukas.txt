==Life and career==
Vuksanović was born on November 3, 1968 in Belgrade, and grew up in the downtown neighborhood of [[Karaburma]]. He graduated from a music high school. 

Vuksanović began his career in the early 90s performing various genres of music, from [[jazz music|jazz]] to [[Gypsy style|Gypsy]], in Belgrade nightclubs, such as the bar "Lukas" from which he got his stage name. He later toured throughout [[Yugoslavia]] with rock musician [[Viktorija (singer)|Viktorija]] and her band. Lukas released his first album, ''Ponos i laž'', in 1995, on which he started collaborating with song-writing duo [[Marina Tucaković]] and Aleksandar Radulović. He achieved more significant popularity upon his next two albums and stand-out hits like the 1998 [[Anna Vissi]] cover "Lična karta" (''ID''), which became his signature song. Lukas held his first solo concert at the [[Pionir Hall]] in 1999, and then embarked on his first tour.
