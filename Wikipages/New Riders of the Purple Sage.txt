'''New Riders of the Purple Sage''' is an American [[country rock]] band.  The group emerged from the [[psychedelic rock]] scene in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1969, and its original lineup included several members of the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book | first= Martin C. | last= Strong | year= 2000 | title= The Great Rock Discography | edition= 5th | publisher=Mojo Books | location= Edinburgh | page= 694 | isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> The band is sometimes referred to as the '''New Riders''', or as '''NRPS'''.

==History==

===Origins: early 1960s – 1969===
The roots of the New Riders can be traced back to the early 1960s [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] [[American folk music revival|folk]]/[[beatnik]] scene centered on [[Stanford University]]'s now-defunct Perry Lane housing complex in [[Menlo Park, California]], where future [[Grateful Dead]] guitarist [[Jerry Garcia]] often played gigs with like-minded guitarist [[David Nelson (musician)|David Nelson]]. The young [[John Dawson (musician)|John Dawson]] (also known as "Marmaduke") also played some concerts with Garcia, Nelson, and their compatriots while visiting relatives on summer vacation. Enamored of the sounds of [[Bakersfield sound|Bakersfield-style country music]], Dawson would turn his older friends on to the work of [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Buck Owens]] and provided a vital link between [[Timothy Leary]]'s International Federation for Internal Freedom in [[Millbrook, New York]] (Dawson having boarded at the [[Millbrook School]]) and the Menlo Park bohemian coterie nurtured by [[Ken Kesey]].

Inspired by [[American folk music]], [[rock and roll]], and [[blues]], Garcia formed the [[Grateful Dead]] (initially known as The Warlocks) with blues singer [[Ron "Pigpen" McKernan]], while Nelson joined the similarly inclined New Delhi River Band (which would eventually come to include bassist [[Dave Torbert]]) shortly thereafter. Although they lacked the managerial acumen and [[Acid Tests|cultural cachet]] of the Grateful Dead and elected to remain in [[East Palo Alto, California]] unlike the former group, which soon relocated to the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of San Francisco, the New Delhi River Band were considered{{cn|date=May 2021}} by late 1966 to be the house band of [[Scotts Valley, California#The Barn|The Barn]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Baine |first1=Wallace |title=Santa Cruz County Stories: UCSC’s Ralph Abraham keeps alive the memories of Santa Cruz’s hip golden era |url=https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2016/07/15/santa-cruz-county-stories-ucscs-ralph-abraham-keeps-alive-the-memories-of-santa-cruzs-hip-golden-era/ |access-date=31 May 2021 |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2016-07-15 |quote=Came to Santa Cruz: 1968. Abraham was a professor at Princeton University in his early 30s when a UCSC recruiter visited him. He had developed an interest in psychedelic culture and mystical experience, but had no interest in relocating to California. ‘I accepted the free airline ticket to see friends,’ he said. His interview didn’t go well, he said. But before leaving, he went to find a friend at the Barn in Scotts Valley, where “I saw the musicians playing inside large metal sculptures, psychedelic paintings on the wall and 300 people stoned on LSD dancing to the music.’ Soon after, he changed his thinking: ‘I was interested in Santa Cruz the town, not Santa Cruz the university. But it was a job, so I accepted it.’}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=David Nelson and The New Delhi River Band, Fall 1966 (Nelson II) |url=https://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2012/03/david-nelson-and-new-delhi-river-band.html |access-date=31 May 2021 |work=Lost Live Dead |date=2012-03-22 |language=en |quote=The configuration of Highway 17 and Scotts Valley has completely changed, and no trace of The Barn remains.

The group continued to enjoy a cult following in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]] and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz Counties]] through the [[Summer of Love]] until their dissolution in early 1968.

After a period of inactivity, Nelson contributed to the Grateful Dead's ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' (1969) sessions and served as the caretaker of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]'s rehearsal space while guitarist Peter Albin and drummer David Getz undertook a European tour with [[Country Joe & the Fish]] following the schismatic departure of [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Sam Andrew]] from the former band in December 1968. During this period, Nelson and Garcia played intermittently in an early iteration of High Country, a [[traditional bluegrass]] ensemble formed by the remnants of the Peninsula folk scene. Nelson was set to serve as lead guitarist in the reconstituted lineup of Big Brother that coalesced later in 1969 and thus may have contributed to some of the recordings on ''[[Be a Brother]]'' (1970) during this transitional period.

Dawson—who dropped out of [[Occidental College]] in December 1965 and remained in [[Los Angeles]] for several years thereafter, "hanging out with musicians and weirdos"—had returned to Los Altos Hills by early 1969, allowing him to contribute to the ''Aoxomoxoa'' sessions and briefly enroll at [[Foothill College]].<ref name=Early-Days>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrpsmusic.com/band/earlydays.html |title=The Early Days of the New Riders |author=Dawson, John|work=nrpsmusic.com |access-date=January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deaddisc.com/disc/Aoxomoxoa.htm|title=Grateful Dead Family Discography: Aoxomoxoa|work=deaddisc.com|access-date=January 1, 2017}}</ref> After a [[mescaline]] experience at [[Pinnacles National Park]] with Torbert and [[Matthew Kelly (musician)|Matthew Kelly]], he began to compose songs on a regular basis.<ref name=Early-Days/> Some (such as "Glendale Train" and "I Don't Know You") were traditional country pastiches; a number of others ("Last Lonely Eagle", "Garden of Eden", and "Dirty Business") found him working in a "psychedelic country" fusion milieu redolent of [[Gram Parsons]]' nascent [[Flying Burrito Brothers]]. "Henry", a traditional shuffle with contemporary lyrics about marijuana smuggling, also dates from this period.

Dawson's vision was prescient, as 1969 marked the emergence of country rock via [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Band]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Poco]], the [[Dillard & Clark]] Band, and the [[Clarence White]]-era [[Byrds]]. Around this time, Garcia was similarly inspired to take up the [[pedal steel guitar]], and an informal line-up including Dawson, Garcia, and Peninsula folk veteran Peter Grant (on banjo) began playing coffeehouse and [[hofbrau]] concerts together when the Grateful Dead were not touring. Their repertoire included country standards, traditional bluegrass, Dawson originals, and a few Dylan [[Cover version|covers]] ("[[Lay Lady Lay]]", "[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]", "[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|Mighty Quinn]]"). By the summer of 1969 it was decided that a full band would be formed and David Nelson was recruited to play lead guitar.

In addition to Nelson, Dawson (on [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]), and Garcia (continuing to play pedal steel), the original line-up of the band that came to be known as the New Riders of the Purple Sage (a nod to the [[Foy Willing]]-led [[Western swing]] combo from the 1940s, [[Riders of the Purple Sage (band)|Riders of the Purple Sage]], which borrowed its name from the [[Riders of the Purple Sage|Zane Grey novel]]) consisted of [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] Studio engineer Bob Matthews on electric bass and [[Mickey Hart]] of the Grateful Dead; bassist [[Phil Lesh]] also played sporadically with the ensemble in lieu of Matthews through the end of the year, as documented by the late 1969 demos later included on the ''[[Before Time Began]]'' archival release. Lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] briefly rehearsed with the band on bass in early 1970 before the permanent hiring of Torbert in April of that year.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 16, 2011 |url=http://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2011/03/new-riders-of-purple-sage-bassist-1969.html |title=New Riders Of The Purple Sage, Bassist: 1969-70 |website=Lost Live Dead |access-date=November 27, 2019}}</ref> The most commercially successful configuration of the New Riders would come to encompass Dawson, Nelson, Torbert, [[Spencer Dryden]], and [[Buddy Cage]].

===Vintage NRPS: 1969–1982===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NRPSPowerglide.jpg|thumb |260px | Album cover art from ''Powerglide'' (1972). Left to right: David Nelson, John Dawson, Spencer Dryden, Dave Torbert, Buddy Cage.]] -->
After a few warmup gigs throughout the Bay Area in 1969, Dawson, Nelson, and Torbert began to tour in May 1970 as part of a tripartite bill advertised as "An Evening with the Grateful Dead". An acoustic Grateful Dead set that often included contributions from Dawson and Nelson would then segue into New Riders and electric Dead sets, obviating the need to hire external opening acts.

By the time the New Riders recorded their first album in late 1970, change was in the air. Hart temporarily left the Grateful Dead in February 1971. Although he contributed to two tracks on the album, former [[Jefferson Airplane]] drummer Spencer Dryden replaced Hart in the New Riders prior to his departure from the parent group. Dryden would remain with the group for ten years, ultimately serving as the band's manager. 

[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|Their first album]], eponymously titled, was released on [[Columbia Records]] (under a contract informed by [[Clive Davis]]'s long-term aspiration to sign the Grateful Dead) in late 1971. It proved to be a moderate success comparable to the Dead's releases of the era, peaking at No. 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Entirely composed by Dawson (in comparison to the more egalitarian songwriting of later releases), the record was driven by Garcia's pedal-steel playing.

With the New Riders desiring to become more of a self-sufficient group and Garcia needing to focus on his other responsibilities, the musician parted ways with the group in November 1971. Seasoned pedal steel player Buddy Cage was recruited from [[Ian and Sylvia]]'s [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] to replace Garcia. The band's second album, ''[[Powerglide (album)|Powerglide]]'' (1972), was the first to feature this line-up. The ''Powerglide'' album art included a notable caricature of the band members drawn by Lore Shoberg.

1973's ''[[The Adventures of Panama Red]]'' included a Nelson-sung cover of [[Peter Rowan]]'s "[[Panama Red (song)|Panama Red]]" that steadily gained traction as an enduring FM radio staple. The album peaked at No. 55 in ''Billboard''<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and, albeit as a [[sleeper hit]], marked the band's commercial zenith; in 1979, it was [[certified gold]] by [[RIAA]].

In the mid-1970s, [[Radio Caroline]] adopted the song "On My Way Back Home" from the ''[[Gypsy Cowboy]]'' album as the station's theme tune. The song was well-suited to the station's album-oriented format of the time, and included the lyric "Flying to the sun, sweet Caroline".

The New Riders of the Purple Sage continued touring and releasing albums throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s to an increasingly fallow reception;<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> none of the albums that followed ''[[New Riders (album)|New Riders]] ''(1976) charted on the ''Billboard ''200 in antipodal contrast to the widespread mainstream success of the [[outlaw country]] movement (exemplified by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Waylon Jennings]]) and such second-wave country rock groups as [[The Eagles]], [[Pure Prairie League]], and [[Firefall]]. The band continued to open several Grateful Dead and [[Jerry Garcia Band]] shows in 1977 and 1978, including the final concert preceding the closure of [[Winterland Ballroom]] on December 31, 1978. 

In 1974, Torbert left NRPS; he and Matthew Kelly had co-founded the band [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]] (best known for [[Bob Weir]]'s membership during the Grateful Dead's late-1974 to mid-1976 touring hiatus) the year before. He was initially replaced by [[Skip Battin]] (formerly of [[Skip & Flip]] and the early 1970s lineup of The Byrds), who briefly emerged as the dominant creative force in the band due to his prolific songwriting collaboration with controversial Hollywood impresario [[Kim Fowley]]. [[Stephen A. Love]] of [[Ricky Nelson|Rick Nelson]]'s Stone Canyon Band and the [[Roger McGuinn]] Band replaced Battin after he left the group to co-found a reconstituted lineup of The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1976. Shortly thereafter, Spencer Dryden relinquished his performance duties to manage the group in 1977. His musical replacement was Patrick Shanahan. Allen Kemp joined on bass in 1978 before emerging as a co-frontman on guitar and vocals, contributing prominently to the songwriting for the band's last major label release, 1981's  ''[[Feelin' All Right]]''.<ref>Thomson, Gus. [http://auburnjournal.com/detail/118942.html "Auburn’s Allen Kemp Part of Rick Nelson, New Riders of Purple Sage Bands"], [[Auburn Journal]], July 9, 2009</ref> 

In 1982, Nelson and Cage left the band, leaving Dawson as the sole remaining member from the classic lineup.

===New New Riders: 1982–1997===
From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, Dawson continued as leader of the New Riders of the Purple Sage. He was joined by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-oriented multi-instrumentalist Rusty Gauthier, who sang and played acoustic guitar, [[slide guitar]], [[mandolin]], banjo, and [[fiddle]].<ref>Brown, Toni (June 1991). [http://www.kippel.com/archives/journalism/files/18-3-newriders.html "New Riders of the Purple Sage Interview"], ''Relix''. Retrieved May 7, 2014.</ref> During this fifteen-year period, an evolving lineup of musicians played with Dawson and Gauthier in the New Riders.  These included, among others, guitarists Allen Kemp, Gary Vogensen and Evan Morgan, bass players Fred Campbell, Bill Laymon, and Michael White, and drummers [[Val Fuentes]] and Greg Lagardo.

Some projects had the current line-up performing new material and others reworked older material.  On some albums, such as ''[[Midnight Moonlight]]'', the band's sound was less influenced by electric country rock and more by acoustic bluegrass music.

===Retirement: 1997–2005===
In 1997, the New Riders of the Purple Sage split up. Dawson retired from music and moved to Mexico to become an [[English language|English]] teacher. By this time, [[David Nelson (musician)|Nelson]] had started his own David Nelson Band. There was a reunion performance in 2001. In 2002, the New Riders accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award from ''[[High Times]]'' magazine. On hand were a frail Dawson (suffering from [[emphysema]]), Nelson, Cage, Dryden and Torbert's widow Patti.  The band performed "Panama Red" and "Lonesome LA Cowboy" with Peter Rowan as part of the celebration. In the spring of 2004, Cage sat in at several gigs with the David Nelson Band.

===NRPS revival: 2005–present===
Shortly after the death of Spencer Dryden, a reconstituted line-up of the New Riders began touring in late 2005. It features David Nelson and Buddy Cage, alongside guitarist [[Michael Falzarano]], bassist [[Ronnie Penque]], and drummer [[Johnny Markowski]].<ref name=HeraldPalladium/><ref name=NewsHerald/>  They have released a live album, ''[[Wanted: Live at Turkey Trot]]'', and two studio albums, ''[[Where I Come From (New Riders of the Purple Sage album)|Where I Come From]]'' and ''[[17 Pine Avenue]]''.
