In June 2020, after the demise of actor [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], Sonu Nigam posted a video saying that the music industry is also monopolized by two major companies and that he had also faced similar discrimination. He urged these music companies to be fair and kind to the newcomers in the music industry. Although he stopped short of naming anyone he made it clear that the malpractices in Bollywood are terrible and are almost killing the music talent of the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nigam |first1=Sonu |title=#SonuLiveD {{!}} VLog 48 |url=https://www.facebook.com/SonuNigamSpace/videos/2541305792785886/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARD9MF9gzfNXamKK2nIEeX0PlE8FzdVM362kdM6k4MeYwZdoe5ICqixfj6_gMwjoB2k9Ej_ffMeCNmmD |website=Facebook.com |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=18 June 2020 |ref=#SonuLiveD {{!}} VLog 48 {{!}} You might soon hear about...}}</ref>
Nigam uploaded another video to say that after his previous video, the Music Mafia has gotten together about six geniuses against him and sent a press release to the Times of India. Sonu Nigam maintained that he didn't name anyone and was only putting up his point of view regarding the malpractices in the music industry of Bollywood. In his second video Nigam names [[Bhushan Kumar]], CEO of [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and tells him to stay away from him.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nigam |first1=Sonu |title=Laaton ke MAFIA baaton se nahi maante |url=https://www.facebook.com/SonuNigamSpace/videos/552681908759110/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARD9MF9gzfNXamKK2nIEeX0PlE8FzdVM362kdM6k4MeYwZdoe5ICqixfj6_gMwjoB2k9Ej_ffMeCNmmD |website=Facebook.com |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=22 June 2020 |ref=Laaton ke MAFIA baaton se nahi maante}}</ref>
