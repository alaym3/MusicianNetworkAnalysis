'''Wild Cherry''' was an American [[funk rock]] band formed in Mingo Junction, Ohio, in 1970 that was best known for its song "[[Play That Funky Music]]".

==History==

===Early lineups (1970–1974)===
[[Rob Parissi]] (lead vocals and guitar) was raised in the steel-mill town of [[Mingo Junction, Ohio]]. He graduated from [[Mingo High School]] in 1968 and formed the band Wild Cherry in 1970 in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], [[Ohio]].<ref name="bogdanov2003">Bogdanov 2003, p. 746</ref> The band's name, 'Wild Cherry,' was taken from a box of cough drops.<ref name=harrison1976 /> The band played the [[Ohio Valley]] region, the Northern [[West Virginia]] panhandle, and [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. The original lineup included Ben Difabbio (drums and vocals) and Louie Osso (guitar, lead, and background vocals) from Steubenville, Larry Brown (bass, lead, and background vocals) from [[Weirton, West Virginia|Weirton]], West Virginia, Larry Mader (keyboards, lead and background vocals) from [[East Springfield, Ohio|East Springfield]], Ohio, and Ron Vallera (guitar, background voals) from Steubenville, Ohio). Over time, the band members changed; Osso, Brown, Mader and Vallera left the band and were replaced by Parissi's cousin, Coogie Stoddart (guitar, lead, and background vocals), and Joe Buchmelter (bass). Buchmelter was soon replaced by Bucky Lusk.

In the early 1970s, several records were released under their own label, including "You Can Be High (But Lay Low)," and "Something Special On Your Mind," in 1971. The music at this stage was pure rock music. Wild Cherry eventually gained a record contract with Brown Bag Records, owned and operated by the late [[Terry Knight]].<ref name=bogdanov2003 /> Brown Bag produced several demos and singles that were later distributed by [[United Artists Records|United Artists]], including "Get Down" (1973) and "Show Me Your Badge" (1973).

The band broke up, and Parissi left the music scene temporarily. He reformed the band in 1975.<ref name=bogdanov2003 />

===Later lineups (1975–1979)===
The new lineup consisted of [[Bryan Bassett]] (guitar/vocals), [[Allen Wentz]] (bass guitar/synthesizer/vocals), Ronald Beitle (drums), and Parissi.<ref name=bogdanov2003 /> As the group began to develop a following in the Pittsburgh area, [[disco]] was becoming increasingly popular, and they were repeatedly asked by listeners to play more dance music.<ref name=bogdanov2003 /> While brainstorming for new song ideas, Beitle recounted hearing a fan shout, "Are you white boys gonna play some funky music?" Parissi was inspired to write a song based on the phrase, so he began writing on a drink order pad with a pen borrowed from the bartender. After the band recorded the song, studio engineer Ken Hamann brought the band to the attention of Sweet City Records, distributed by [[Epic Records|Epic/CBS]], which signed the group.<ref name=harrison1976>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Ed|title=Wild Cherry, named for cough drops, eyes gold|journal=Billboard|date=October 23, 1976|volume=88|issue=43|page=54|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Parissi had intended to record the song as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to a cover version of the [[Commodores]]' "I Feel Sanctified," but the label suggested it as the A-side instead.<ref name=arena2016>{{cite book|last=Arena|first=James|title=Legends of Disco: Forty Stars Discuss Their Careers|date=March 30, 2016|publisher=McFarland|pages=175–182|isbn=978-1-4766-6496-5}}</ref>

"Play That Funky Music" became a huge hit when released in 1976, peaking at number one on both the [[Billboard magazine|'' Billboard'']] [[R&B]] and pop charts.<ref name=bogdanov2003 /> Both the single and Wild Cherry's self-titled debut album went platinum.<ref name=bogdanov2003 /> The band was named Best Pop Group of the Year by [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] and received an [[American Music Award]] for Top [[R&B]] Single of the Year as well as a pair of [[Grammy]] nominations for Best New Vocal Group and Best [[R&B]] Performance by a Group or Duo.<ref name=bogdanov2003 />

"Play That Funky Music" was the only hit on the album, although "Hot to Trot" was a minor follow-up hit in some non-U.S. markets. The album featured contributions from keyboardist [[Mark Avsec]], who soon thereafter became a permanent member of the band. None of Wild Cherry's three subsequent albums were very popular. Neither ''Electrified Funk'' (1977) (which contained the "Play That Funky Music" soundalike single "Baby Don't You Know") nor ''[[I Love My Music]]'' (1978) produced any top 40 hits, and ''[[Only the Wild Survive]]'' (1979) did not even produce a top 100 single. The band broke up in late 1979.<ref name=arena2016 />

Coogie Stoddart returned to perform with Wild Cherry, beginning with the tour to support ''Electrified Funk'', and recorded ''I Love My Music'' with the band. Stoddart toured with the group, in support of ''I Love My Music'' but left before ''Only the Wild Survive'' was recorded.

===Post-breakup (1980–present)===
*Mark Avsec partnered with [[Donnie Iris]] (of [[the Jaggerz]]) in the early 1980s to form Donnie Iris and the Cruisers. Iris had played with Wild Cherry on their fourth and final album. Their hit singles included "[[Ah! Leah!]]".<ref name="bogdanov2003"/> Avsec also teamed up with fellow Cruiser [[Kevin Valentine]] to record under the moniker [[Cellarful of Noise]] in 1985, releasing two albums with this project. Another of Avsec's compositions, "[[She Don't Know Me]]," originally written for the band La Flavour (who later evolved into "Fair Warning"), became one of the first hits for the then-fledgling band, [[Bon Jovi]].<ref name=michaels2005>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Randolph|title=Flashbacks to Happiness: Eighties Music Revisited|date=September  2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37007-8|pages=117–118}}</ref> A lawsuit related to "Ah! Leah!" inspired Avsec to become a copyright lawyer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Segall|first1=Grant|title=Mark Avsec is a leading rocker and lawyer: My Cleveland |url=http://www.cleveland.com/mycleveland/index.ssf/2013/03/mark_avsec_is_a_leading_rocker.html |website=cleveland.com|publisher=The Plain Dealer|access-date=September 20, 2017|date=March 10, 2013}}</ref>

*Allen Wentz moved to New York City and became a session synthesizer specialist, playing on many records and jingles. He has worked with artists ranging from [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Roberta Flack]] to [[Cyndi Lauper]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

*Bryan Bassett became a producer and engineer at King Snake Studio in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]], Florida. He has played with [[Foghat]] and [[Molly Hatchet]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Bryan Bassett|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bryan-bassett-mn0000523938|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref> and he has also served as a board governor for the Florida Chapter of [[NARAS]].

*Parissi moved to [[Miami]], Florida in 1979 and formed a tour band with [[Bobby Caldwell]].<ref name=arena2016 /> In 1980, Parissi moved to [[New York City]], met members of [[Billy Squier]]'s band, and did recording sessions with them. At the same time, he also co-wrote songs with Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Kent and co-produced the album ''[[Dedication (Gary U.S. Bonds album)|Dedication]]'', along with [[Gary U.S. Bonds]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 1980/81.<ref name=arena2016 /> The album produced the hit "This Little Girl (Is Mine)," which sold over 500,000 copies, for which Rob was awarded another gold album. As of the 2010s, Parissi resides in Florida and is writing and recording in the adult contemporary and [[smooth jazz]] genres, as in his CD "The Real Deal," an all-vocal album.<ref name=arena2016 />

: On August 11, 2013, the people of Parissi's hometown in Mingo Junction, Ohio renamed the longest street there as Rob Parissi Boulevard  and declared August 11 as Rob Parissi Day.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Limnios|first1=Michalis|title=Interview with fabulous musician Rob Parissi of Wild Cherry - with an amazing career in the music industry|url=http://blues.gr/profiles/blogs/interview-with-fabulous-musician-rob-parissi-of-wild-cherry-with|website=blues.gr|access-date=September 20, 2017|language=en|date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> He and his wife, Ilona, established a scholarship endowment for his former consolidated high school, now named [[Indian Creek High School (Wintersville, Ohio)|Indian Creek High School]], and he returns every year to do a charity fundraiser for that scholarship endowment.

*Ron Beitle (1954–2017) performed with several rock bands, including Nied's Hotel Band in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABOUT – Nied’s Hotel Band|url=http://niedshotelband.com/meet-the-band/|website=NiedsHotelBand.com|access-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref> He died in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/postgazette/187499195|title=RONALD BEITLE Obituary (2017) - Sharpsburg, PA - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|website=Legacy.com|access-date=October 18, 2021}}</ref>
