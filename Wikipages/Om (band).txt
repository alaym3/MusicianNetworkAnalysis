==History==
Om's earliest works incorporate musical structures similar to [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] and [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] chant, as heard on the debut album ''[[Variations on a Theme (Om album)|Variations on a Theme]]''. The band's name itself derives from the Hindu concept of [[Om]], which refers to the natural vibration of the universe. Every album from  ''[[Pilgrimage (Om album)|Pilgrimage]]'' onward features [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Icon|iconography]] in the cover art.

Om's first three albums feature [[Al Cisneros]] on vocals and bass and [[Chris Hakius]] on drums.
