'''''Good Will Hunting''''' is a 1997 American [[Psychological drama (subgenre)|psychological drama]] film directed by [[Gus Van Sant]], and starring [[Robin Williams]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Minnie Driver]] and [[Stellan Skarsgård]]. Written by Affleck and Damon, the film follows 20-year-old [[South Boston]] janitor Will Hunting (Damon), an unrecognized genius who, as part of a [[deferred prosecution]] agreement after assaulting a police officer, becomes a patient of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor (Skarsgård). Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend (Affleck), his girlfriend, and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.

The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225&nbsp;million during its theatrical run against a $10&nbsp;million budget. At the [[70th Academy Awards]], it received nominations in nine categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won in two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon.

In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s "100 Favorite Films" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2014-11-22|archive-date=2014-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126114246/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Plot==

Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of [[South Boston]] is a natural genius who is self-taught. He works as a janitor at [[MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy, and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult [[combinatorial]] mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Will flees when Lambeau catches him writing the solution on the blackboard late at night. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].

The next day, Will and his friends fight a gang that contains a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s. During the first session, Will insults Sean's deceased wife, and Sean threatens him—but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.

Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in [[love at first sight]]. Sean does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.

Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his "chief negotiator", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.

Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of [[child abuse]]. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go "see about a girl", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Matt Damon]] started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class he was taking at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="boston">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2013/01/02/good-will-hunting-oral-history/|title=Good Will Hunting: An Oral History|work=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston]]|date=January 2, 2013|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-date=December 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223234200/https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2013/01/02/good-will-hunting-oral-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script.<ref name="boston" /> He wrote his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film), into his script. (Satenstein later married [[Metallica]] drummer [[Lars Ulrich]].)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1432111/the-unlikely-link-between-metallica-and-matt-damon/|title=The Unlikely Link Between Metallica And Matt Damon|date=1998-03-11|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-05-08|archive-date=2017-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627051540/http://www.mtv.com/news/1432111/the-unlikely-link-between-metallica-and-matt-damon/|url-status=live}}</ref> Damon said the only scene from that script that survived – "it survived verbatim" – was when Will Hunting (Damon) meets his therapist, Sean Maguire ([[Robin Williams]]).<ref name="boston" /> Damon asked [[Ben Affleck]] to develop the screenplay together. They completed the script in 1994.<ref name="boston" /> At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of [[South Boston]] who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.<ref name="boston" />

[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would stand to earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced and they retained sole writing credit.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Castle Rock president [[Rob Reiner]] urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist. [[Terrence Malick]] told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tomshone.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-good-will-hunting-got-its-ending.html|title=THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS: Malick gave Good Will Hunting its ending|date=2011-01-05|website=THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS|access-date=2018-05-08|archive-date=2018-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716111732/http://tomshone.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-good-will-hunting-got-its-ending.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

At Reiner's request, screenwriter [[William Goldman]] read the script. Goldman consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote ''Good Will Hunting'' or acted as a [[script doctor]]. In his book ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' Goldman jokingly writes, "I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch," before dismissing the rumor as false and saying his only advice was agreeing with Reiner's suggestion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmE9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA332|title=Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade|last=Goldman|first=William|year=2001|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=332–333|isbn=9780375703195|access-date=2018-05-08|archive-date=2021-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206031537/https://books.google.com/books?id=PmE9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA332|url-status=live}}</ref>

Affleck and Damon proposed to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said they wanted [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Juul | first=Matt | title='Good Will Hunting' Might've Been Very Different Without Sylvester Stallone | url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2016/01/06/matt-damon-sylvester-stallone-rocky/ | work=[[Boston Magazine]] | date=January 6, 2016 | access-date=March 11, 2018 | archive-date=February 15, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143637/https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2016/01/06/matt-damon-sylvester-stallone-rocky/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Kevin Smith]] was working with Affleck on ''[[Mallrats]]'' and with both Damon and Affleck on ''[[Chasing Amy]].''<ref>Smith's comments on the ''[[Mallrats]]'' DVD audio commentary</ref> Castle Rock put the script in turnaround, and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock the money paid, otherwise the script reverted to the studio, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay now turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face. As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his ''Chasing Amy'' director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. In his recollection of the meeting, Weinstein asked about an out-of-place, mid-script [[oral sex]] scene, which Damon and Affleck explained was a test to see which studio executives had actually read the script.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=623Es9ZYmt8&t=25s|title = Harvey Weinstein - The Graham Norton Show|date = Mar 15, 2015 |publisher = BBC America|via= [[YouTube]] }}</ref><ref name="boston" />

After buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Michael Mann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/chris-moore-the-chair-good-will-hunting-interview/|title=Chris Moore Talks THE CHAIR, Choosing Shane Dawson and Anna Martemucci for the Competition, GOOD WILL HUNTING, SURVIVOR'S REMORSE and More|website=Collider|date=September 6, 2014|first=Christina|last=Radish|access-date=September 5, 2020|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112034828/https://collider.com/chris-moore-the-chair-good-will-hunting-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a "good director" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director, but still served as one of the film's executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose [[Gus Van Sant]] for the job, whose work on previous films like ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.

[[File:Au Bon Pain, Cambridge, MA.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Au Bon Pain]] in [[Harvard Square]] where Skylar asked Will to explain his "[[photographic memory]]" to her (as seen in 2013; it has since been redeveloped by Harvard).]]
Filming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were shot on location in the Greater Boston area, many of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the [[University of Toronto]] standing in for [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]]. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and [[Central Technical School]]. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnus [[John Lithgow]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Ba Tran | first=Andrew | title=Then and Now: Revisiting 'Good Will Hunting' | url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/southboston/gallery/good_will_hunting_15_years_later?pg=2 | work=Boston.com | page=2 | access-date=January 25, 2017 | archive-date=February 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031302/http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/southboston/gallery/good_will_hunting_15_years_later?pg=2 | url-status=live }}</ref> Likewise, only the exterior shots of [[Bunker Hill Community College]] were filmed in Boston; however, Sean's office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.<ref>{{cite web | last=Ba Tran | first=Andrew | title=Then and Now: Revisiting 'Good Will Hunting' | url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/southboston/gallery/good_will_hunting_15_years_later?pg=21 | work=Boston.com | page=21 | access-date=January 25, 2017 | archive-date=February 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031104/http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/southboston/gallery/good_will_hunting_15_years_later?pg=21 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The musical score for ''Good Will Hunting'' was composed by [[Danny Elfman]], who had previously collaborated with [[Gus Van Sant]] on ''[[To Die For]]'' and would go on to score many of the director's other films.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/filmmaker-gus-van-sant-and-composer-danny-elfman-talk-of-their-collaborations/|title=Filmmaker Gus Van Sant and composer Danny Elfman talk of their collaborations|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081905/https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/filmmaker-gus-van-sant-and-composer-danny-elfman-talk-of-their-collaborations/|url-status=live}}</ref> The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriter [[Elliott Smith]]. His song "[[Miss Misery]]" was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], but lost to "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" from ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2013/01/10/elliott-smiths-music-good-hunting/|title=How Elliott Smith's Music Transformed Good Will Hunting – Boston Magazine|date=2013-01-10|work=Boston Magazine|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081722/https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2013/01/10/elliott-smiths-music-good-hunting/|url-status=live}}</ref> Elfman's score was also nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], but lost to ''Titanic'' as well. On September 11, 2006, ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' used Elfman's song "Weepy Donuts" while [[Matt Lauer]] spoke during the opening credits.

A soundtrack album for the film was released by [[Capitol Records]] on November 18, 1997, though only two of Elfman's cues appear on the release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Will Hunting – Original Soundtrack|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/good-will-hunting-mw0000030450|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=All Media Network, LLC|access-date=February 20, 2014|archive-date=March 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317074641/http://www.allmusic.com/album/good-will-hunting-mw0000030450|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/08/cinema-sounds-good-will-hunting-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|title=Cinema Sounds: Good Will Hunting|date=2009-08-26|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511145627/https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/08/cinema-sounds-good-will-hunting-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Mathematics==
In an early version of the script, Will Hunting was going to be a physics prodigy, but Nobel Laureate in Physics [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]] at Harvard told Damon that the subject should be math instead of physics. Glashow referred Damon to his brother-in-law, [[Daniel Kleitman]], a mathematics professor at MIT. In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to "speak math to us" for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdoc [[Tom Bohman]] to join him, giving them a "quick lecture". When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science [[P versus NP problem]], but the movie used other problems. [[Columbia University]]'s physics and math professor [[Brian Greene]] at the [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]] [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan]] retrospective explained that for physics, "Having some deep insight about the universe [⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠] typically [⁠ ⁠is ⁠] a group project in the modern era," while "doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often."<ref name="bi">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/good-will-hunting-matt-damon-harvard-professor-helped-change-movie-2015-4|title=One of Matt Damon's Harvard professors gave him a small note that completely changed 'Good Will Hunting'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-date=2018-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510184841/http://www.businessinsider.com/good-will-hunting-matt-damon-harvard-professor-helped-change-movie-2015-4|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="mit">{{Cite news|url=https://alum.mit.edu/slice/how-mit-professor-helped-good-will-hunting-get-math-right-and-landed-tiny-role-film|title=How an MIT Professor Helped Good Will Hunting Get the Math Right—and Landed a Tiny Role in the Film|access-date=2018-05-10|last=London|first=Jay|work=MIT Alumni - Slice of MIT|archive-date=2020-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023051200/https://alum.mit.edu/slice/how-mit-professor-helped-good-will-hunting-get-math-right-and-landed-tiny-role-film|url-status=live}}</ref>

Patrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at the [[University of Toronto]], served as the mathematical consultant for the film.<ref>O'Donnell relied on ''Graph Theory and Theoretical Physics'' by [[Frank Harary]] where at page 63 P.W. Kasteleyn wrote on "Graph theory and crystal physics".</ref>

The main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will Hunting's talent, first to the audience, second to Professor Lambeau. Matt Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT's [[Infinite Corridor]] and writing "an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation" on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards "because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/matt-damon-commencement-address-0603|title=Matt Damon's Commencement address|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-date=2018-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430161028/http://news.mit.edu/2016/matt-damon-commencement-address-0603|url-status=live}}</ref>

===The first blackboard problem===
Near the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard.<ref>[[Burkard Polster]] & Marty Ross (2012) ''Math goes to the Movies'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], page 9, {{ISBN|1-4214-0483-4}}</ref> The problem has to do with intermediate-level [[graph theory]], but Lambeau describes it as an advanced "[[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] system."

To answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up an [[adjacency matrix]]:
:<math>A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0& 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.</math> 
To answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-step [[walk (graph theory)|walks]] in the graph, and finds the third power matrix:
:<math>A^3=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 & 2 & 3 \\ 7 & 2 & 12 & 7 \\ 2 & 12 & 0 & 2 \\ 3 & 7 & 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.</math>
The third and fourth parts of the question concern [[Generating function#Example: Spanning trees of fans and convolutions of convolutions|generating functions]]. The other characters are astounded that a janitor shows such facility with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

===The second blackboard problem===
Lambeau subsequently poses a new challenge on the blackboard: state [[Cayley's formula]] and "draw all the homeomorphically irreducible trees with <math>n=10</math>." Will writes eight of the ten trees correctly before Lambeau interrupts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cantorsparadise.com/the-math-problems-from-good-will-hunting-w-solutions-b081895bf379|title=The Math Problems from Good Will Hunting, w/ solutions|author=Jorgen Veisdal|date=31 July 2019}}</ref>

===Critical response===
On the [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, writing that while the story is "predictable", it is "the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective".<ref>{{cite web |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/good-will-hunting-1997 |title= Good Will Hunting Movie Review (1997) |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date= 1997-12-25 |access-date= 2013-09-01 |archive-date= 2013-08-02 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130802052628/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/good-will-hunting-1997 |url-status= live }}</ref> Duane Byrge of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the performances of the cast, writing "The acting is brilliant overall, with special praise to Matt Damon for his ragingly tender portrayal of the boy cursed with genius".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/good-will-hunting-1997-review-952640|title='Good Will Hunting': THR's 1997 Review|last=Byrge|first=Duane|date=1991-12-01|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> Peter Stack of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' was equally positive, writing "The glow goes well beyond a radiant performance by Matt Damon ...

Quentin Curtis of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' opined Williams' performance brought "sharpness and tenderness", calling the film a "crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare.
