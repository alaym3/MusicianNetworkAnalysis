'''Demon Hunter''' is an American [[Christian metal]] band from [[Seattle]], Washington, started in 2000 by brothers [[Don Clark (musician)|Don Clark]] and [[Ryan Clark (musician)|Ryan Clark]]. Although the brothers created the band together, only Ryan remains, since Don left the band to take care of his family. As of early 2010, the band has sold over half a million albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookschristian.com/music/demon-hunter/the-world-is-a-thorn/580897 |title=The World Is A Thorn Demon Hunter : 5099930638723: CD - BooksChristian.com Christian Book Store |publisher=Bookschristian.com |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=May 6, 2010}}</ref> The band's style is known for combining [[nu metal]] sounds and qualities with ones heard in [[metalcore]].<ref name="Miniradman"/>

== History ==

=== Formation and initial releases ===

Demon Hunter was initially conceived as a project band by the Clarks, who had played together previously in the initially [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] and [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] influenced but later more experimental band [[Training for Utopia]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/training-for-utopia-mn0000745261|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=July 26, 2017|title=Training for Utopia &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links}}</ref> Ryan had previously played guitar in hardcore band [[Focal Point (band)|Focal Point]], who released an album on Tooth & Nail/Solid State when Ryan was still in his teens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toothandnail.com/artists/109/Focal_Point/ |title=Tooth & Nail |publisher=toothandnail.com |access-date=August 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304190423/http://www.toothandnail.com/artists/109/Focal_Point/ |archive-date=March 4, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Demon Hunter first appeared on ''[[This is Solid State Vol. 3]]'' with their first song "Through the Black" released in February 2002.<ref>{{cite web|    url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-solid-state-vol-3-mw0000217913|title= This Is Solid State Vol. 3 Review| publisher=allmusic.com| access-date= July 26, 2017}}</ref> Demon Hunter's [[Demon Hunter (album)|self-titled album]] was released in October 2002 on [[Tooth and Nail Records]] subsidiary [[Solid State Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/DemonHunter.asp|title=Demon Hunter, "Demon Hunter" Review| publisher=www.jesusfreakhideout.com|access-date= July 26, 2017}}</ref> Ryan and Don wrote all of the songs, performed the majority of the instruments (with Ryan singing as he had in TFU) and hired Jesse Sprinkle, formerly of [[Poor Old Lu]], to record drum tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Demon Hunter {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/demon-hunter-mn0000201581/biography|access-date=2020-07-08|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref>

At first the members of the band chose to hide or obscure their identities in photos and in the press.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  Their names were revealed when they undertook their first tour, which featured Norwegian metal heavyweights [[Extol]] and death-influenced [[metalcore]] youngbloods [[The Agony Scene]], and saw the permanent adding of Jesse Sprinkle on drums, [[Jon Dunn (musician)|Jon Dunn]] on bass, and [[Kris McCaddon]], formerly of [[Embodyment]] and [[Society's Finest]], on lead guitar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Demon Hunter returned to the studio to record their second full-length release, ''[[Summer of Darkness]]'', with McCaddon contributing, and again with Jesse drumming. ''Summer of Darkness'' hit stores on May 4, 2004, and was a modest success, propelling Demon Hunter into the secular scene with the addition of the music video "Not Ready to Die" on MTV2's ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/119/Demon-Hunter.html |title=Demon Hunter – Heavy Metal – News – Demon Hunter Videos – Demon Hunter Ringtones – mp3s – Tabs – Wallpaper – lyrics |publisher=The Gauntlet |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.666metal.com/interviews/showinterview.cfm?interID=53 |title=HARM.US/666METAL.COM – ->INTERVIEW WITH DEMON HUNTER BY WAYFAERER< |publisher=666metal.com |date=November 26, 2003 |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929165135/http://www.666metal.com/interviews/showinterview.cfm?interID=53 |archive-date=September 29, 2011  }}</ref> and [[Fuse TV]], along with single "My Heartstrings Come Undone" being placed on the ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' soundtrack.  The album featured four guest vocal appearances, including Mike Williams of [[The Agony Scene]] on "Beheaded", Brock Lindow of [[36 Crazyfists]] on "Beauty Through The Eyes of a Predator", [[Howard Jones (heavy metal musician)|Howard Jones]] from [[Killswitch Engage]] on "Our Faces Fall Apart" and [[Trevor McNevan]] of [[Thousand Foot Krutch]] on "Coffin Builder".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musichristian.com/sys/product.php?PRODUCT=33632 |title=Demon Hunter : Summer of Darkness |publisher=MusiChristian.com |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120122201/http://www.musichristian.com/sys/product.php?PRODUCT=33632 |archive-date=January 20, 2009  }}</ref>

Demon Hunter hit the road that summer with McCaddon on lead and Dunn on bass, and with new touring drummer [[Timothy "Yogi" Watts]], as Jesse Sprinkle could not make the tour. This time Demon Hunter took with them rock/[[post-hardcore]] rookies [[Dead Poetic]], along with metalcore band [[Haste the Day]]. Post-hardcore band [[Staple (band)|Staple]] replaced Haste the Day towards the end of the tour.

In 2005, Demon Hunter went back to The Compound in [[Seattle, Washington]] to record their third album, entitled ''[[The Triptych]]''. The word "triptych" centers around the concept of three, as it was the band's third album.  Included on the album is a cover of [[Prong (band)|Prong]]'s song "Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck". This album debuted Watts as Sprinkle's permanent replacement on drums (Jesse having joined Dead Poetic) as well as the addition of [[Ethan Luck]] as lead guitarist, replacing Kris McCaddon. ''The Triptych'' was even bigger than ''Summer of Darkness'', selling more than twice as many records on its first week of release than ''Summer of Darkness'' had. "Undying" was the band's first single from this album, and was also made into a music video directed by Chris Sims.

Demon Hunter's only 2006 tour took place over the summer with [[Zao (US band)|Zao]], [[Becoming the Archetype]], [[August Burns Red]], and [[Spoken (band)|Spoken]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=18376 |title=Metal News – Demon Hunter, Zao, August Burns Red Tour Dates |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> The band shot a video for "One Thousand Apologies" after the tour was over with director [[Darren Doane]] at the helm. ''The Triptych'' was re-released on October 31, 2006 with a DVD accompanying the album and four extra songs added to the original album.

The hard rock and heavy metal based magazine, ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', published a cover story on Christian metal in December 2006, featuring what the magazine called "The Holy Alliance":  [[Spencer Chamberlain]] from [[Underoath]], [[Ryan Clark (musician)|Ryan Clark]] from Demon Hunter, [[Tim Lambesis]] from [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], and [[Cory Brandan Putman]] from [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]].

Demon Hunter entered the studio in June 2007 to record their fourth full-length album, ''[[Storm the Gates of Hell]]'', which was released on November 6, 2007. Solid State released three versions of the album with various bonuses. "Fading Away" was the album's first single and music video. In spite of the bands secular popularity, they continued to support the underground [[Christian metal]] scene by appearing on obscure radio programs such as The Full Armor of God Broadcast<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podcast.fullarmorradio.com/2007/11/16/the-full-armor-of-god-platinum-edition-w-demon-hunter.aspx |title=Ryan Clark on The Full Armor of God Broadcast |publisher=Podcast.fullarmorradio.com |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824173854/http://podcast.fullarmorradio.com/2007/11/16/the-full-armor-of-god-platinum-edition-w-demon-hunter.aspx |archive-date=August 24, 2011  }}</ref> in January 2008. On March 13, 2008, "Carry Me Down" debuted on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''{{'}}s website as the album's second music video, and made its television premiere on March 15 on the same show.

[[File:Demon Hunter.JPG|thumb|Demon Hunter performing at Red Letter Rock Festival in 2008]]
In 2008, the band headlined the "Stronger Than Hell" tour, which started May 26 in [[Seattle]], Washington. The tour featured the recently reunited Christian metal forefathers [[Living Sacrifice]], whose lead singer [[Bruce Fitzhugh]] was featured as a guest vocalist on ''[[Storm the Gates of Hell]]''{{'}}s track titled "Sixteen". The tour also included [[Oh, Sleeper]], [[The Famine]], and [[Advent (band)|Advent]]. This tour completed July 5, 2008, at [[Cornerstone Festival]] in Illinois. Demon Hunter released ''[[45 Days]]'' in November, a [[box set]] comprising two DVDs and a CD containing a documentary film about the band and their fans, a pro-shot performance from the "Stronger Than Hell" tour and a brand new score written exclusively for the film along with two bonus tracks. ''45 Days'' was directed by Cale Glendening.

A live album, ''Live in Nashville'', was released on January 27, 2009. It includes 14 songs from their show in Nashville, Tennessee, from their "Stronger Than Hell" tour. The album features [[The Showdown (band)|The Showdown]] lead guitarist [[Patrick Judge]], who filled in for Luck on several of the "Stronger Than Hell" dates due to Luck's conflicting scheduling commitments as drummer for [[Relient K]].

Judge also filled in for Brian Leppke of metalcore band [[Bleeding Through]] when he was unable to turn up for the Thrash and Burn tour in May.

== Christianity ==

Don Clark stated, "I guess we liked to ride the fence. Then we got a little older, maybe wiser, and you know what, we're a Christian band. We're five dudes, we're all believers, we really don't want to ride the fence anymore."<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web|title=Is Demon Hunter a Christian Band?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pf-tw2Pibo}}</ref> Ryan Clark claimed, "When we officially started we wanted to be very bold about it, we didn't see any purpose of just beating around the bush."<ref name="YouTube"/> Fans who are Christians are supportive of the band's bold faith position. "They respect that we don't walk the fence between a non-Christian and Christian band."<ref name="YouTube"/>

A [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who claimed to have killed [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] was quoted as saying "'[W]e stopped using [Metallica's] music, and then a band called Demon Hunter got in touch and said, 'We're all about promoting what you do.'
