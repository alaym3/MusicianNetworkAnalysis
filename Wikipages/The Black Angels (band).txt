'''The Black Angels''' are an American [[psychedelic rock]] band from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]].<ref name=Levin>Hannah Levin, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=31709 Review of ''Passover''], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', Apr 13 – Apr 19, 2006. Accessed 7 October 2006.</ref>  Formed in May 2004, they took their name from the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]'s "[[The Black Angel's Death Song]]."<ref name=bandsite>{{cite web|url=http://theblackangels.com/ |title=The Black Angels website – ABOUT THE BAND |access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> They have released five studio albums and one compilation album.

==History==

=== Early Years (2004–2005) ===
In 2005, the Black Angels were featured on a dual-disc compilation album of psychedelic music called ''Psychedelica Vol. 1'' from [[Northern Star Records]]. This, along with the growing popularity of their MySpace page, gave the band a jump in popularity in the underground scene.

=== ''Passover'' and ''Directions to See a Ghost'' (2006–2009) ===
The group's debut LP, ''[[Passover (album)|Passover]],'' released in 2006, was generally well received in the underground independent rock community and was noted for its dark tones and lyrical content. A review of ''[[Passover (album)|Passover]]'' described them as "Walking in the shadows cast by [[Spiritualized]] mastermind [[Jason Pierce]]," invoking "dirges" reminiscent of the [[13th Floor Elevators]].<ref name="Levin" /> ''[[Passover (album)|Passover]]'' included a quote in the liner notes from [[Edvard Munch]]: ''"Illness, insanity, and death are the black angels that kept watch over my cradle and accompanied me all my life."'' The band was featured on the soundtrack of the 2007 [[Kevin Bacon]] movie, ''[[Death Sentence (2007 film)|Death Sentence]]'', on the second episode of FOX's ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and in the ninth episode of ''Californication''.

They released their second album ''[[Directions to See a Ghost]]'' in 2008. Songs from ''Directions to See a Ghost'' were also featured in [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel's]] 2009 documentary, ''Manson''. Their song "Young Men Dead" was featured on the March 17, 2010 episode of UFC Primetime, "St. Pierre vs. Hardy," on [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]].  "Young Men Dead" was also included on the soundtrack for the 2011 snowboard movie ''[http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/The-Art-of-FLIGHT-Soundtrack-%E2%80%93-Full-Music-List-021243086400429 The Art of Flight]''.

Festival appearances by the band during this time included [[Lollapalooza]] 2007, [[SXSW]] 2006 & 2008, and [[All Tomorrow's Parties]] 2008, among others. Touring partners included the [[blues rock]] band [[The Black Keys]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], [[The Warlocks]], [[Roky Erickson]], [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[The Raveonettes]], [[Wolfmother]], and [[The Horrors]].

Between October 28 and November 2, 2008, the band performed as [[Roky Erickson]]'s backing band on the West Coast. The band featured on [[Unkle|Unkle's]] May 2010 release, ''[[Where Did the Night Fall]]'', collaborating on a song called "Natural Selection."

=== ''Phosphene Dream'', ''Indigo Meadow'', and ''Death Song'' (2010–present) ===
On April 23–25, 2010, [[The Reverberation Appreciation Society]] and the Black Angels presented their third annual music-and-arts festival, [[Levitation (festival)|Austin Psych Fest]]. Bands topping the 43-band bill included [[The Raveonettes]], [[Pink Mountaintops]], [[The Warlocks]], [[The Gaslamp Killer]], [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]], [[Night Beats]], and [[Silver Apples]].

The band's third album, [[Phosphene Dream]], was released on September 14, 2010. The group played the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] Music Festival in Monticello, New York, in September 2010. On Record Store Day 2011 a 12" LP titled ''Another Nice Pair'' was released, a limited edition red LP containing the band's first two EPs. Of the total records pressed, 100 were randomly inserted with a print signed by Alex Maas, Stephanie Bailey, Christian Bland, Kyle Hunt, and Nate Ryan.

The 4th annual [[Levitation (festival)|Austin Psych Fest]] ran from April 29 – May 1, 2011, and was held at the Seaholm Powerplant (the last event to be held inside the building) and featured [[Roky Erickson]], Spectrum, [[Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group]], [[Atlas Sound]], [[Black Moth Super Rainbow]], [[Prefuse 73]] and [[A Place To Bury Strangers]] topping a lineup of 55 bands.

The band's fourth album, [[Indigo Meadow]], was released on April 2, 2013, and they embarked on a tour across the United States in May 2013 in support of the album.

In February 2014, the Black Angels covered a version of "Soul Kitchen" for ''A Psych Tribute to the Doors'', released by [[Cleopatra Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cleorecs.com/store/shop/a-psych-tribute-to-the-doors-cd/ |title=A Psych Tribute To The Doors (CD) &#124; Cleopatra Records : Store |publisher=Cleorecs.com |date=2014-02-18 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>

The 7th annual [[Levitation (festival)|Austin Psych Fest]] was held during May 2–4, 2014 at Carson Creek Ranch next to the [[Colorado River]] and featured a rare Friday night performance from the legendary 1960s [[baroque pop]] band [[The Zombies]], [[The Dandy Warhols]] and [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]] performing together on the same stage, the [[psychedelic folk]] band [[Quilt (band)|Quilt]], the [[electronica]] duo [[Peaking Lights]], [[Temples (band)|Temples]], [[Sleepy Sun]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War on Drugs]], [[Loop (band)|Loop]], and an incendiary performance from Japanese [[drone rock]] band [[Acid Mothers Temple]] in which several instruments were lit on fire.

On July 22, 2014, the Black Angels released their EP, [[Clear Lake Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan J. Prado |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/07/the-black-angels-clear-lake-forest-review.html |title=The Black Angels: Clear Lake Forest Review |publisher=pastemagazine.com |date=2014-07-22 |access-date=2015-01-27}}</ref>

In December 2014, the Black Angels released a split single, along with Sonic Jesus, called "Molly Moves My Generation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/12/the-black-angels-release-pounding-new-single-molly-moves-my-generation-listen/ |title=The Black Angels release pounding new single "Molly Moves My Generation" |publisher= Consequenceofsound.net |date=2014-12-01 |access-date=2015-01-27}}</ref>

The 8th annual [[Levitation (festival)|Austin Psych Fest]], now renamed [[Levitation (festival)|''Levitation'']], was held from May 8–10, 2015 at Carson Creek Ranch and featured an impressive lineup, including a rare 50th anniversary reunion of pioneering Texas [[psychedelic rock]] band [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Tame Impala]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s 20th anniversary performance of [[Psychocandy]] in its entirety, [[Spiritualized]], [[Primal Scream]], and [[Earth (American band)|Earth]]. [[Melody's Echo Chamber]] and [[Rose Windows (band)|Rose Windows]] were scheduled to perform, but Rose Windows announced their breakup prior to the event and Melody's Echo Chamber had travel issues and had to cancel.

The band released their fifth album, ''[[Death Song (album)|Death Song]],'' in April, 2017.<ref name=DS>{{cite web|url=http://theblackangels.com/media-item/deathsong/ |title=The Black Angels website – /deathsong/ |access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref>
