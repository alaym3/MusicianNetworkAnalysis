She attended Ardenne Highschool in Kingston, Jamaica.

===2010s===

In 2016, she won her school talent show at [[Ardenne High School]] located in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] without realizing that the informal show at which she performed in her school cafeteria had been an audition. She went on to learn music theory and vocal technique in her high school choir.<ref name="tmrwmagazine">{{cite web | url = https://tmrwmagazine.com/features/music/our-class-of-2019-koffee | title = Our Class of 2019: Koffee | magazine = TMRW Magazine | last = Davies | first = Nicola | date = 14 December 2018 | access-date = 22 January 2019 }}</ref> A defining moment for Koffee occurred her final year of high school, when she performed at her school's talent show with other gifted artists in front of about 1,000 people. She indicated that the show gave her the first bit of confidence to perform and deliver music live.<ref name="Giorgis">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/meet-koffee-jamaicas-teenage-reggae-sensation/586138/|title=The Teenage Girl Leading Jamaica's New Reggae Scene|last=Giorgis|first=Hannah|date=2 April 2019|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

Koffee gained popularity after uploading a video to Instagram of her singing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/meet-koffee-jamaicas-teenage-reggae-sensation/586138/|title=The Teenage Girl Leading Jamaica's New Reggae Scene|last=Giorgis|first=Hannah|date=2 April 2019|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first single, "Legend", with just her voice and acoustic guitar. A tribute to Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]],<ref name="tmrwmagazine"/> the song became a viral [[Instagram]] hit, once the athlete reposted it on his own Instagram.<ref name="Giorgis"/> Awareness of the violence and social problems she witnessed growing up has influenced her lyrics, and besides [[Protoje]] and [[Chronixx]] she has cited [[Super Cat]] and [[Giggs (rapper)|Giggs]] among her musical inspirations.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Koffee |subject2=Iba Mahr |subject3=Busy Signal |subject4=Stacey McKenzie |interviewer=Winford Williams |title=Koffee, Iba Mahr, Busy Signal, Stacey McKenzie - Onstage February 2 2019 (FULL SHOW) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3ADl3kl1ac |publisher=Caribbean Entertainment Productions |quote=I would say that to a small extent, in the sense that I didn't- I wasn't able to study his music or grow up on it, but I knew a few Super Cat songs and when I think about my flow and my delivery, I can relate it to him if nobody else. |at=35 minutes in |date=2 February 2019 |work=OnStage TV |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reggaeville.com/artist-details/koffee/about/ |title=Biography: Koffee |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Reggaeville.com |access-date=8 February 2019 |quote=But while reggae is on the agenda at the moment, Koffee intends to take in the many artists who have influenced her over the years, from Protoje and Super Cat to St Louis rapper Smino and UK Rap star Giggs. }}</ref>

"Burning", her take on Upsetta Records' Ouji Riddim (which had been made popular by Jamaican artists [[Busy Signal]] and [[Luciano (DJ)|Luciano]]), followed.
