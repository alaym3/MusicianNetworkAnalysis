'''R. L. Burnside''' (November 23, 1926 – September 1, 2005) was an American [[blues]] singer, songwriter and guitarist. He played music for much of his life but received little recognition before the early 1990s. In the latter half of that decade, Burnside recorded and toured with [[Jon Spencer]], garnering [[Crossover music|crossover]] appeal and introducing his music to a new fan base in the [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[garage rock]] scenes.

As was the case with his role model [[John Lee Hooker]], Burnside's earliest recordings sound quite similar to one another, even repetitive, in vocal and instrumental styling. Many of these songs eschew traditional [[chord progression|chord changes]] in favor of a single [[chord (music)|chord]]<ref name="Herzhaft1992"/><ref name="69notes"/><ref name="palmer jim"/> or a simple [[bassline]] pattern that repeats throughout.

vocals similar to field hollers?-->

Like his contemporary [[T-Model Ford]], Burnside favored a stripped-down approach to the blues, marked by a quality of rawness.

Burnside knew many [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasts]]—African American narrative folk poems such as "[[Signifying monkey]]" and "Tojo Told Hitler"—and fondly recited them between songs at his concerts and on recordings.
