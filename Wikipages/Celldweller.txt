'''Celldweller''' is an American [[electronic rock]] project by multi-musician [[Klayton]]. Celldweller songs have been featured in many films, movie trailers, television shows and video games.<ref name="List of artist and song placements from Position Music">{{cite web |title=Placements - Position Music |url=http://sync.positionmusic.com/#/placements/ |access-date=May 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513004801/http://sync.positionmusic.com/#/placements/ |archive-date=May 13, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="List of song placements from celldweller.com">{{cite web|title=Placements - Celldweller.com |url=http://www.celldweller.com/site/?page_id=41 |access-date=May 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928122255/http://www.celldweller.com/site/?page_id=41 |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Career==
===Precursors: Circle of Dust and Angeldust (1992–1999)===
The name Celldweller was derived from a nickname his mother gave him when he was a teenager, dubbed "Cellar Dweller", as he made all of his music in his parents' basement.<ref name="Origin of the name Celldweller">{{cite web|title=ask_celldweller Ep. 02: Thanks Mom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqBUZG4rYQ|work=YouTube.com|publisher=Celldweller|access-date=March 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713134426/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqBUZG4rYQ|archive-date=July 13, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Klayton had gained a devoted cult following in the mid 90s because of his [[industrial metal]] band [[Circle of Dust]]. After the dissolution of Circle of Dust, Klayton concurrently released both a posthumous collection of reworked Circle of Dust leftovers titled ''[[Disengage (album)|Disengage]]'' and an album for a new project, [[Angeldust (industrial band)|Angeldust]], created in conjunction with illusionist [[Criss Angel]].<ref name="carpenoctem">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8&Itemid=591 |title=Klay Scott Interview with Carpe Noctem |publisher=Carpe Noctem magazine |year=1997 |access-date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708131329/http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8&Itemid=591 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Both albums demonstrated Klayton's shift away from industrial metal and towards more electronic-modern industrial rock influences, incorporating richer electronic instrumentation and greater emphasis on melody. This change in style was a major step toward the sound that would come to define Celldweller's output. Klayton began creating songs for the Celldweller project in 1998/1999<ref name="deliriuminterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=885&Itemid=591 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610224703/http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=885&Itemid=591 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |title=Klayton Interview with DELIRIUM |last=Diamantis-Fry |first=Sophie |year=2003 |access-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> and released a limited edition EP of three early Celldweller demos and two solo trance tracks, which quickly sold out. Klayton and Criss Angel parted ways in 2000 after three albums' worth of material had been completed, allowing Klayton to devote all of his time to Celldweller.<ref name="1340interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=382&Itemid=591 |title=Klayton Interview with 1340 Mag |publisher=1340 Mag |year=2003 |access-date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212613/http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=382&Itemid=591 |archive-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

Klayton worked in earnest with producer Grant Mohrman (formerly of Leaderdogs for the Blind) on the debut ''[[Celldweller (album)|Celldweller]]'' album, which was slated for release in February 2001. Unfortunately, various delays kept pushing the release date back.<ref name="Celldwellercurrentinfo29102002">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021029181051/http://celldweller.com/currentinfo.html |url=http://www.celldweller.com |title=Celldweller current info 29 October 2002 |archive-date=October 29, 2002 |access-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> During this time, Klayton kept fans up to date with numerous Celldweller Logs through his website and via email and, in 2001, released raw files of the song "Symbiont" to give fans and fellow musicians a chance to remix Celldweller's music.<ref name="Celldwellercurrentinfo01062000">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001209081800/http://celldweller.com/currentinfo.html |url=http://www.celldweller.com |title=Celldweller current info 1 June 2000 |archive-date=December 9, 2000 |access-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> Eight remixes were chosen and uploaded to the original [[Mp3.com]], most of them making it to the top of the Electronic and the Electro-Industrial charts. All the exposure led to over 500,000 song plays on Mp3.com. The "Symbiont" remixes became a digital EP six years later.

The self-titled debut album saw release in early 2003 and debuted at No.&nbsp;17 on [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']]'s Internet Sales Chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=celldweller|chart=Internet Albums}} Celldweller ranking at ''Billboard'']</ref> ''Celldweller'' included a guest appearance by [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] drummer Jarrod Montague. In 2004, the album took home seven awards at the Just Plain Folks Music Awards, winning Album of the Year, Producer of the Year, Industrial Album of the Year, Metal Song of the Year ("One Good Reason") and Best Industrial Rock Song ("Switchback"), and also took runner-up in Best Industrial Song with "Stay with Me (Unlikely)" and Best Rock Song with "I Believe You".<ref name="justplainfolks" /> Later, the songs "Birthright" and "Switchback" were included in the list of Hard and Extreme Mode songs respectively for the popular iPhone OS game ''[[Tap Tap Revenge]]''.

In 2004, Klayton put together a double disc release called ''[[The Beta Cessions]]''. The first disc contained a re-recording of the last Circle of Dust song, "Goodbye", alternate mixes of "Switchback", the Klayton tracks from the initial Celldweller EP, and demo versions of debut ''Celldweller'' songs. The second disc contained the full debut album in instrumental form, with a few of the instrumentals being slightly edited.<ref name="1340interview2">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=881&Itemid=707 |title=Beta Cessions Review |publisher=ReGen |last=Yucel |first=Ilker |year=2006 |access-date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610202827/http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=881&Itemid=707 |archive-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> Klayton stated that he plans to release Beta Cessions to coincide with each of his major albums to collect outtakes, demos, and other rarities.<ref name="06102005blog">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=429&Itemid=579 |title=Klayton Was Here...

In the years following the release of the first Celldweller album, various remix EPs were released, culminating in the conception of the Take It & Break It Celldweller Remix Competition in 2006.<ref name="keyboardmag">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=921&Itemid=697 |title=Celldweller To Launch Groundbreaking Remix Contest |date=September 2006 |access-date=April 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230535/http://www.celldwellertribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=921&Itemid=697 |archive-date=June 10, 2015 }}</ref> Expanded off the fan remix concept that Klayton first toyed with in 2001 with the Symbiont remixes, the Take It & Break It competition saw the creation of its own website on which unlimited numbers of fans could register, download and remix the individual recording files of various Celldweller songs, and then submit their remixes. Three rounds of the competition were completed, with compilations of Celldweller remixes being released at the end of each round. In 2008, the Celldweller Remix Competition evolved into the FiXT Remix Competition where fans, remixers, and musicians have the opportunity to remix songs of not only Celldweller but other FiXT Music artists as well.<ref name="The FiXT Remix Competition website">{{cite web|url=http://www.fixtremix.com/index.html|title=The FiXT Remix Competition website|access-date=May 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531195859/http://www.fixtremix.com/index.html|archive-date=May 31, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In December 2008, Klayton released ''[[Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 1|Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01]]'', a collection consisting primarily of short, instrumental score-based compositions. He selected and reworked demos from his extensive archives that he felt would suit for film, TV and video game licensing.<ref name="04122008blog">{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/celldweller/blog/430459609 |title=Klayton Was Here...(artist's blog) 5-10-08 |date=September 5, 2008 |access-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> Additionally, some songs were from the (then work in progress) second main Celldweller album sessions.<ref name="fearnetinterview" /><ref>Celldweller - The Best It's Gonna Get Beta Cessions Commentary (Wish Upon a Blackstar Chapter 02 Deluxe Edition)</ref> Celldweller's management has sought to have these songs placed in media, like those on the debut album, and several have already been heard on film and television and in video games.<ref name="fearnetinterview" />

In March 2009, Klayton announced that the title of the album is ''[[Wish Upon a Blackstar]]''. Of 50 songs, he has narrowed it down to the 10 that will comprise the album. In a blog post on his website, he elaborated on wanting to release the album in "Chapters" with each Chapter consisting of two songs.

In April 2009, Klayton revealed the tracks ''Wish Upon a Blackstar'' would contain,<ref name="4-20-09klog">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldweller.com/2009/04/does-this-smell-like-chloroform-04-20.html |title=Does This Smell Like Chloroform?

[[File:Celldweller logo black.svg|thumb|Textlogo]]
During the recording of ''Wish Upon a Blackstar'', Klayton also began work on his follow-up to ''Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01'' (SVH). ''[[Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 2|Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02]]'' will be released in the same manner as ''Wish Upon a Blackstar'': as handfuls of tracks are completed, Chapters of the full album will be released digitally until the full collection is complete and the album is released on physical media. Chapter 01 of ''SVH Vol. 02'' featured four songs, including a 20-minute ambient piece titled "Adrift on Celestial Seas" (a first for Celldweller). Additionally, a Limited Edition CD of Chapter 01 was released on December 7, 2010 that contained a bonus short ambient track, "Distants".

In addition to working on ''Wish Upon a Blackstar'' and ''SVH Vol. 02'', Celldweller kept busy on other fronts. He produced the remainder of the debut [[Blue Stahli]] album, appeared on the soundtrack of the [[Xbox 360]]/[[PlayStation 3]] game ''[[Dead Rising 2]]'' with a new original song, "Kill the Sound", as well as a selection of previously released Celldweller songs,<ref name="deadrising2announce">{{cite web |url=http://fixtstore.com/news/?p=1921 |title=Dead Rising 2: The Music Behind the Game (Celldweller) |publisher=FiXT News |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=January 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711005449/http://fixtstore.com/news/?p=1921 |archive-date=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> and also remixed songs for [[BT (musician)|BT]]<ref name="BTremix">{{cite web |url=http://www.celldweller.com/site/?p=197 |title=Update from the studio |publisher=Celldweller |date=April 3, 2009 |access-date=January 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708132112/http://www.celldweller.com/site/?p=197 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> and [[Jes Brieden|JES]].

Klayton confirmed in April 2010 that, for the first time in five years, he would be taking Celldweller on the road.
