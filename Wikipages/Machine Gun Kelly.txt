'''George Kelly Barnes''' (July 18, 1895 – July 18, 1954),<ref name="alcatrazhistory">{{cite web |url= http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/mgk.htm |title=George 'Machine Gun' Kelly |work=Alcatraz History.com |year=2015 |access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref> better known by his pseudonym "'''Machine Gun Kelly'''", was an American [[gangster]] from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], active during [[Prohibition in the United States|the Prohibition era]]. His nickname came from his favorite weapon, a [[Thompson submachine gun]]. He is best known for the kidnapping of the oil tycoon and businessman [[Charles F. Urschel]] in July 1933, from which he and his gang collected a $200,000 ransom (around ${{Inflation|US|0.2|1933|r=1|fmt=c}} million as of today).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/U/UR009.html |title=Urschel Kidnapping |last=O'Dell |first=Larry |publisher=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |work=Oklahoma Historical Society |access-date=May 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228162724/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/U/UR009.html |archive-date=December 28, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Urschel had collected and left considerable evidence that assisted the subsequent [[FBI]] investigation, which eventually led to Kelly's arrest in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on September 26, 1933.<ref name="alcatrazhistory" /> His crimes also included [[rum-running|bootlegging]] and [[armed robbery]].

==Early life==
Kelly's first sign of trouble came when he enrolled in [[Mississippi State University]] to study agriculture in 1917. From the beginning, Kelly was considered a poor student with his highest grade (a C plus) awarded for good physical hygiene. He was constantly in trouble with the faculty and spent much of his academic career attempting to work off the demerits he had earned. It was during this time that Kelly met a young woman by the name of Geneva Ramsey. Kelly quickly fell in love with Geneva and made an abrupt decision to quit school and marry.<ref name="alcatrazhistory"/>

==Career==
During the [[Prohibition era]] of the 1920s and 1930s, Kelly worked as a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] for himself as well as a colleague.<ref name="Flyer">{{cite web|url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/public-enemy-number-one/Content?oid=1122623|title=Public Enemy Number One: The real story of Machine Gun Kelly, the Memphis boy who grew up to become the most wanted man in America|last=Finger|first=Michael|date=September 7, 2005|work=Memphis Flyer}}</ref> After a short time, and several run-ins with the local Memphis police, he decided to leave town and head west with his girlfriend.

He was arrested in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1928, for smuggling liquor onto an Indian Reservation, and sentenced to three years at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary, Kansas]], beginning February 11, 1928. He was reportedly a model inmate and was released early. Shortly thereafter, Kelly married [[Kathryn Kelly|Kathryn Thorne]], an experienced criminal who purchased Kelly's first machine gun and insisted{{spaced ndash}}despite his lack of interest in weapons{{spaced ndash}}on his performing target practice in the countryside, and went to great lengths to familiarize his name within underground crime circles.<ref>200 Texas Outlaws and Lawmen, 1835-1935, Laurence J.

Kelly's last criminal activity &ndash; the July 1933 kidnapping of wealthy [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] resident, [[Charles F. Urschel]] and his friend Walter R. Jarrett &ndash; would become his undoing. The Kellys demanded a ransom of $200,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.2|1933|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), and held Urschel at the farm of Kathryn's mother and step-father.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/kidnappings/kathryn-kelly/|title=Kathryn Kelly – Crime Museum|work=Crime Museum|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Urschel, having been blindfolded, made note of evidence of his experience, including remembering background sounds, counting footsteps and leaving [[fingerprint]]s on surfaces in reach. This proved invaluable for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in its investigation, as agents concluded that Urschel had been held in [[Paradise, Texas]], based on sounds that Urschel remembered hearing while he was being held hostage.

An investigation conducted in Memphis disclosed that the Kellys were living at the residence of J. C. Tichenor. Special agents from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], were immediately dispatched to Memphis, where, in the early morning hours of September 26, 1933, a raid was conducted. George Kelly and Kathryn Thorne were taken into custody by FBI agents and Memphis police. It is often reported that Kelly was caught without a weapon and allegedly shouted, "Don't shoot, G-Men! Don't shoot, G-Men!" as he surrendered to FBI agents. This version of events appears to be a media myth created months after the arrest. Another version of the raid alleged Kelly had a pistol in his hand, but with a shotgun aimed at his heart he surrendered mumbling something along the lines of "I've been expecting you." However, the FBI's earliest account of the event was written between three and five days after Kelly’s arrest and states: "Agent Rorer saw that Kelly…had proceeded into the front bedroom and was in a corner with his hands raised. He was covered by [Memphis Police] Sergeant [name withheld]." with Kelly not reported to have spoken at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/september/kelly_092608|title=FBI 100 - Machine Gun Kelly|website=FBI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/public-enemy-number-one/Content?oid=1122623|title=Public Enemy Number One|first=Michael|last=Finger|website=Memphis Flyer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2003/september/kelly092603|title="Machine Gun" Kelly and the Legend of the G-Men|website=FBI}}</ref>

The arrest of the Kellys was overshadowed by the escape of ten inmates, including all of the members of the future [[John Dillinger|Dillinger gang]], from the penitentiary in [[Michigan City, Indiana]], that same night.<ref name="FeeWebb2016">{{cite book|last1=Fee|first1=Christopher R.|author-link1=Christopher R.

On October 12, 1933, George Kelly and Kathryn Thorne were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial was held at the [[United States Post Office, Courthouse, and Federal Office Building (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma)|Post Office, Courthouse, and Federal Office Building]] in Oklahoma City.

An investigation in [[Coleman, Texas]], disclosed that the Kellys had been housed and protected by Cassey Earl Coleman and Will Casey, and that Coleman had assisted George Kelly in storing $73,250 of the Urschel ransom money on his ranch. This money was located by Bureau agents in the early morning hours of September 27 in a cotton patch on Coleman's ranch. They were both indicted in [[Dallas, Texas]], on October 4, 1933, charged with harboring a fugitive and conspiracy, and on October 17, 1933, Coleman, after entering a plea of guilty, was sentenced to serve one year and one day, and Casey, after trial and conviction, was sentenced to serve two years in the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.<ref name="fbi100">{{cite web

The kidnapping of Urschel and the two trials that resulted were historic in several ways. They were:
# the first federal criminal trials in the United States in which film cameras were allowed;
# the first kidnapping trials after the passage of the [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Lindbergh Law]], which made [[kidnapping]] a [[federal crime]];
# the first major case solved by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s FBI; and
# the first prosecution in which defendants were transported by airplane.

==Death==
[[File:Machine Gun Kelly's marker.jpg|thumb|His gravestone, marked "George B. Kelley"]]
Machine Gun Kelly spent his remaining 21 years in prison. During his time at [[Alcatraz]], he got the nickname "Pop Gun Kelly." According to fellow inmate Dale Stamphill, the nickname originated because, "He told big fish stories. The cons called him ‘Pop Gun Kelly’ after [[Pop gun|cork guns]] that were popular with kids...the guys didn’t take him seriously...." This may have stemmed from the fact that, in addition to his exaggerated tall tales, Kelly was a model prisoner and did not act like the brutal gangster his wife, the media, and FBI had made him out to be.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/blog/2019/07/16/machine-gun-kelly-and-his-lost-years-on-alcatraz/|title=Machine Gun Kelly and His Lost Years on Alcatraz|date=July 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historic-memphis.com/biographies/machinegunkelly/machinegunkelly.html|title=Machine Gun Kelly captured in Memphis|website=historic-memphis.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alcatrazhistory.com/mgk.htm|title=George "Machine Gun" Kelly|website=www.alcatrazhistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memphismagazine.com/api/content/a1f6aaf4-5c4b-11e7-aff2-0a5fbc963f88/|title=The Real Story of Machine Gun Kelly|first=Michael|last=Finger|date=July 10, 2017|website=Memphis magazine}}</ref> He spent 17 years on Alcatraz as inmate number 117, working in the prison industries, continuing to boast and exaggerate his past escapades to other inmates, and was quietly transferred back to Leavenworth in 1951.

==In popular culture==
Machine Gun Kelly and his crimes are portrayed in films such as ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' (1958), ''[[The FBI Story]]'' (1959) and ''[[Melvin Purvis: G-Man]]'' (1974).

Crime novelist [[Ace Atkins]]' 2010 book ''Infamous'' is based on the Urschel kidnapping and George Kelly and Kathryn Thorne. Kelly is (along with [[Pretty Boy Floyd]] and [[Baby Face Nelson]]) one of the main characters of the comic book series ''[[Pretty, Baby, Machine]]''.

George Kelly and Kathryn Thorne were the inspiration for "Machine Gun Kelly" (1970), a song written by [[Danny Kortchmar|Danny "Kootch" Kortchmar]] and recorded by [[James Taylor]] on his 1971 album ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]''.

[[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]] is the stage name for American musician Colson Baker, from [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

Kelly was an inspiration to the popular UK punk band, The [[Angelic Upstarts]], for their track “Machine Gun Kelly” written by Thomas ‘Mensi’ Mensforth.
