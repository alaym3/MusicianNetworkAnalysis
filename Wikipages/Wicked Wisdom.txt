==History==
{{quote box|width=35%|quote="I listened to all kinds of metal as a kid. [[Metallica]], [[Guns N' Roses]]. I would always look at [[Axl Rose]] and say, 'Why aren't there any chicks out there doing this now?' I always wanted an opportunity to get out there and rock out."|source=Pinkett Smith on why she created Wicked Wisdom<ref name=Wicked1/>}}

[[Jada Pinkett Smith]] formed the band in 2002.<ref name=Wicked1>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Jada Pinkett Smith Lives Out Her Axl Rose Dreams|date=2005-01-31|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1522697/20060127/wicked_wisdom.jhtml|accessdate=2007-10-07|publisher=MTV}}</ref> The band consists of Pinkett Smith performing lead vocals, Pocket Honore (guitar, vocals), Cameron "Wirm" Graves (guitar, keyboard, vocals), Rio Lawrence (bass, vocals) and Philip "Fish" Fisher (drums, formerly of [[Fishbone]]). The band is managed by James Lassiter and Miguel Melendez of [[Overbrook Entertainment]], a company co-founded by Pinkett Smith's husband [[Will Smith]].<ref name=Ozzfest1>{{cite web|last=Titus|first=Christa L.|title=Osbourne Defends Wicked Wisdom's Ozzfest slot|date=2005-06-07|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62669/osbourne-defends-wicked-wisdoms-ozzfest-slot|accessdate=2008-10-16|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]]}}</ref>

===The Onyx Hotel Tour===
Wicked Wisdom landed a slot on [[Britney Spears]]' [[Onyx Hotel Tour]] in 2004, one of the year's highest-profile tours. To promote their 2004 debut album, titled ''My Story'', the band opened for Spears for eight dates in April and May 2004, during the European leg of the tour.<ref name=Onyx1>{{cite web|last=Susman|first=Gary|title=Britney's opening act: Jada Pinkett Smith|date=2004-03-11|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,599764,00.html|accessdate=2008-10-16|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>

===Ozzfest 2005===
In 2005, [[Sharon Osbourne]] went to see Wicked Wisdom perform at a small night club in Los Angeles, California. She said, "I was blown away. When you see and hear Jada with her band it's apparent that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music."<ref name=Ozzfest1/> In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on the second stage of 2005's [[Ozzfest]].<ref name=Ozzfest2>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Jada Pinkett Smith's Band Added to Lineup|date=2005-05-17|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1502453/20050517/index.jhtml?headlines=true|accessdate=2008-10-16|publisher=MTV}}</ref> Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, "I'm not here asking for any favors. You've got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it."<ref name=Ozzfest3>{{cite web|last=Titus|first=Christa L.|title=Wicked Wisdom Persevering On Ozzfest|date=2005-07-25|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61992/wicked-wisdom-persevering-on-ozzfest|accessdate=2008-10-16|work=Billboard Magazine}}</ref> Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, "once word got out that we weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire."<ref name=Wicked1/> Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, "After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out."<ref name=Ozzfest4>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=Chris|title=Pinkett Smith gets 'Wicked'|date=2006-02-24|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060224/news_1c24jada.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912104745/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060224/news_1c24jada.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2008-10-16|work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]}}</ref>

===Wicked Evolution===
In September 2011, [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] was seen/photographed leaving a recording studio, but speculation connected the moment to her daughter, [[Willow Smith]], completing her debut album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaving the Recording Studio|url=http://entertainmentrundown.com/2011/09/26/spotted-jada-pinkett-smith-leaving-recording-studio/|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> In January 2012, a video posted to [[YouTube]], claimed to show The Graves Brothers working in the studio on a gothic/piano rock styled pop song for what they called "the new Jada Pinkett Smith record".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Graves Brothers Producing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5GApkbotWo&sns=em|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref>  Over the next couple of weeks it was announced that the new band name was "Wicked Evolution".{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In 2021, Wicked Wisdom reunited with Smith's daughter [[Willow Smith]] to perform "Bleed All Over Me" for a Mother's Day episode of [[Red Table Talk]].
