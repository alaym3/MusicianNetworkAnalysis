==Life and career==
=== 1990–2012: Early life and career beginnings ===
Amir Obè was born in [[Detroit]], then moved to [[New York City]].
His mother is Polish and a music teacher and his father is Sudanese. Obè's father listened to [[Michael Jackson]] growing up and was heavily influenced by [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Kanye West|Kanye]]  Obè played football in the street and rode his bike. During high school, he kept going back and forth from [[New York City]] to visit his sister. Obè played basketball in high school. He played one and two, point guard and shooting guard. He also played AAU, but in high school he was best offensive player in junior year and senior year.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/03/amir-obe-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Amir Obe|date=2016-03-25|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|last=Cline|first=Georgette|accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>

When Obè was 16 or 17, he bought a computer mic and made song called, "Step Your Swag Up", which was his first. His parents didn't know he made music because he did it privately, but basketball was his main priority at the time. After high school, Obè started pursuing a music career and moved back to Brooklyn. Obè was first known as an artist when he went by the name of Phreshy Duzit on [[Myspace]]. He had about 100,000 fans and every week he kept releasing new freestyles and started seeing attention and getting messages from record labels. He eventually got signed to [[Atlantic Records]]. When Obè was 18, he made a friendship with [[PartyNextDoor]] on [[Twitter]], who at the time went by "Jahron B". At that time, he was always songwriting and producing, so he'd always send him beats.<ref name="submit">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/6805311/amir-obe-drake-happening-in-the-grey-area-interview|title=Rapper Amir Obe Talks Drake Collaboration & 'Happening In The Grey Area' EP|last=Platon|first=Adelle|date=2015-12-11|website=[[Billboard.com]]|accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>

In the fall of 2014, Oliver El-Khatib ([[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s manager and co-founder of [[OVO Sound]]) spoke to Obè and told him Drake is a fan of ''Detrooklyn.''
