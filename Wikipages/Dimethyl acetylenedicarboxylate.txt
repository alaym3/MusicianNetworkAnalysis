'''Dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate''' (DMAD) is an [[organic compound]] with the formula CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CC<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>. It is a di-[[ester]] in which the ester groups are conjugated with a C-C triple bond.  As such, the molecule is highly [[electrophilic]], and is widely employed as a [[dienophile]] in cycloaddition reactions, such as the [[Diels-Alder reaction]].  It is also a potent [[Michael acceptor]].<ref>Stelmach, J. E.; Winkler, J. D. "Dimethyl Acetylenedicarboxylate"in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J.

This compound was used in the preparation of [[nedocromil]].

==Preparation==
Although inexpensively available, DMAD is prepared today as it was originally. [[Maleic acid]] is [[bromination|brominated]] and the resulting dibromo[[succinic acid]] is [[dehydrohalogenation|dehydrohalogenated]] with [[potassium hydroxide]] yielding [[acetylenedicarboxylic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bandrowski | first1 = E. | title = Ueber Acetylendicarbonsäure | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 10 | pages = 838–842 | year = 1877 | doi = 10.1002/cber.187701001231| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1425134 }}</ref><ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Abbott, T.
