The group's [[a cappella]] cover version of "[[Caravan of Love]]" (originally by [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]) was a UK Number 1 single in December 1986.

After breaking up in 1988, [[Paul Heaton]] and [[Dave Hemingway]] formed [[The Beautiful South]], while bassist Norman Cook became an [[electronic dance music]] DJ and music producer, founding the groups [[Beats International]], [[Pizzaman (band)|Pizzaman]], and [[Freak Power]], before rebranding himself as [[Fatboy Slim]].

==Career==

The band was formed in late 1983 by [[Paul Heaton]] (vocals) and [[Stan Cullimore]] (guitar), initially as a busking duo. Throughout his tenure with the band, Heaton billed himself as "P.d. Heaton".  <!-- Yes, Capital P, small d.  P.d. Heaton, not p.d. or P.D., is how it is spelled on ALL Housemartins singles and albums. Do not change this. --> Heaton and Cullimore recorded a demo tape with Ingo Dewsnap and Sharon Green of Les Zeiga Fleurs which brought them to the attention of [[Go! Discs]]. They then expanded by recruiting [[Ted Key (musician) | Ted Key]] (bass), former guitarist with the Gargoyles.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sheffieldtapearchive.bandcamp.com/album/the-gargoyles-hull-adelphi-club-1986 | title=The Gargoyles - Hull Adelphi Club 1986 | publisher=Sheffield Tape Archive | access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Their first live performance as a band was at [[Hull University]] in October 1984.<ref>Frame, Pete (1999) ''Pete Frame's Rockin' Around Britain: Rock'n'roll Landmarks of the UK and Ireland'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|978-0711969735}}, p. 204</ref> The band's membership changed considerably over the years. Key left at the end of 1985 and was replaced by Norman Cook (later known as [[Fatboy Slim]]). Drummer Chris Lang was replaced by [[Hugh Whitaker]], former drummer with the Gargoyles, who in turn was replaced with [[Dave Hemingway]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref name="Beautiful South Fans Housemartins Page">{{cite web | url=http://www.beautifulsouthfans.co.uk/the-housemartins.html | title=The Housemartins | work=Beautiful South and Paul Heaton Fans | access-date=28 October 2016 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226232247/http://www.beautifulsouthfans.co.uk/the-housemartins.html | archive-date=26 December 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The band often referred to themselves as "the fourth best band in Hull", with the best three bands being [[Red Guitars]], [[Everything but the Girl]], and the Gargoyles.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1986, having recorded two [[John Peel]] sessions, the band broke through with their third single "[[Happy Hour (The Housemartins song)|Happy Hour]]", which reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 261}}</ref> The single's success was helped by a [[claymation]] animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time, featuring a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by television comedian [[Phill Jupitus]], who toured with the band under his stage name of "Porky the Poet".  Their debut album, ''London 0 Hull 4'', was released later in 1986 and contained their previous two singles as well as alternative versions of first single "[[Flag Day (song)|Flag Day]]" and follow-up to Happy Hour, "[[Think for a Minute]]". At the end of 1986 they had their only UK No.&nbsp;1 single on 16 December with a cover version of [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]'s "[[Caravan of Love]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  "Caravan of Love" was first performed by the band in their second [[List of Peel sessions|Peel session]] in April 1986, prior to their initial chart success. At Peel's suggestion, the band then recorded another session (under the name the Fish City Five), consisting entirely of a cappella performances, and on at least one occasion (at The Tower nightclub in Hull, the same concert at which they were filmed as the Housemartins for the BBC programme, ''Rock Around the Clock''), played support act for their own performance under this alternative name.  The "Caravan of Love" single featured four a cappella gospel songs on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].

The Housemartins' second album ''[[The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death]]'' was released in September 1987, and included their two previous singles "[[Five Get Over Excited]]" and "[[Me and the Farmer]]". A third single from the album, "[[Build (song)|Build]]", was released in November; a Peel Session from the same month provided a recording used for their last single "[[There Is Always Something There to Remind Me]]" in 1988. A farewell compilation album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Quite Good]]'' was released later that year.

The band split in 1988, but the members have remained in contact and have worked on each other's projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with [[Beats International]] and then as [[Fatboy Slim]], while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie [[Sean Welch]] formed [[the Beautiful South]]. In August 2009, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine arranged for The Housemartins' original members to get together for a photo-shoot and interview, for the first time in many years, but in the interview all the members maintained that the band would not re-form.

In December 2009, Cullimore co-wrote songs for (and appeared in) a pre-school music series called ''[[The Bopps]]'', which first showed on [[Nick Jr. (UK & Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] in the UK in April 2010. Cullimore and Whitaker joined Heaton on stage during a show by Heaton and [[Jacqui Abbott]] in 2014 at Hull's [[The New Adelphi Club]], on the stage where the band had signed their Go-Discs record contract, although it was not a Housemartins reunion. The trio performed the Housemartins hit "Me and the Farmer", and Cullimore and Heaton closed the show with a performance of "Caravan of Love".<ref>{{cite news |last=Longhorn |first=Danny |url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Housemartins-reunite-Adelphi-Caravan-Love-Paul/story-23049884-detail/story.html |title=Housemartins reunite for Adelphi Caravan of Love as Paul Heaton joined on stage by Stan Cullimore and Hugh Whitaker |newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]] |date=6 October 2014 |access-date=4 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010043514/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Housemartins-reunite-Adelphi-Caravan-Love-Paul/story-23049884-detail/story.html |archive-date=10 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Musical style and lyrics==
The band's early releases saw them described as [[jangle pop]], which brought comparisons with bands such as [[the Smiths]] and [[Aztec Camera]].<ref name="Cooper">Cooper, Kim & Smay, David (2004) ''Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415969987}}</ref><ref name="Fletcher">Fletcher, Tony (2012) ''A Light that Never Goes Out: The Enduring Saga of The Smiths'', William Heinemann Ltd, {{ISBN|978-0434022182}}, p. 548</ref> [[David Quantick]], writing for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', described them in 1986 as playing "traditional '60s-style guitar pop overlaid with soul vocals".<ref name="Quantick">Quantick, David (1986) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=FL-rqqrDxb8C&pg=PA16&dq=%22the+housemartins%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tiHkUYytDMa0O4-DgegF&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20housemartins%22&f=false Blinded by Gospel]", ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', December 1986, p. 16. Retrieved 15 July 2013</ref> Cook described the band as "religious, but not Christians", and the band's repertoire included gospel songs.<ref name="Cooper" /><ref name="Quantick" />

Many of the band's lyrics have [[socialism|socialist]] themes, with Cook stating that "Paul realised that he hated writing about love...and that writing politically came easier to him", describing some of their songs as "angrily political".<ref name="Quantick" /><ref name="Lamie">Lamie, Maria "The Housemartins" in Buckley, Peter (ed.)
