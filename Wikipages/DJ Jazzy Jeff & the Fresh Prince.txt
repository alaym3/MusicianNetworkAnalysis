'''DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince''' were an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[West Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], consisting of rapper [[Will Smith]] (the Fresh Prince) and disc jockey Jeff Townes ([[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]). Active full time from 1986 to 1994 and occasionally thereafter, they scored a string of lighthearted, inoffensive, and humorous hit singles. 

The group received the first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] in 1989 for "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" (1988), though their most successful single was "[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Will Smith and Jeff Townes have remained close friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs together under Smith's solo performer credit.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince to reunite? |publisher=://URLFan |url=http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707061753/http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |archive-date=July 7, 2008 }}</ref> DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince have sold over 5.5 million albums in the US. They also performed together as recently as September 2019.

==Career==
===1985–1988: Early years and ''Rock the House''===
Jeff Townes and Will Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985. One night, Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his [[hype man]]. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was disappointed when his hype man finally made it to the party.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazz Jeff Interview Made From Scratch |publisher=DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Fan Site |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163814/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, [[Ready Rock C]], who was not officially credited to the duo, only as a support live member. In 1986, Philadelphia-based Word Records (later changed to Word-Up Records) released their first single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/42031-Word-Records|title=Word Records|website=Discogs.com|access-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jazz-Jeff-Fresh-Prince-Girls-Aint-Nothing-But-Trouble/release/395629|title=Jazz Jeff & Fresh Prince* - Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble|website=Discogs.com|access-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref> The song [[sample (music)|sampled]] the theme song of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.<ref name=sickening>{{cite news |title = Will Smith: My Work Ethic Is "Sickening" |publisher = CBS |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |access-date = May 14, 2008 |date=November 30, 2007}}</ref>

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Jive Records]] and [[Russell Simmons]]. The duo's first album, ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in  March 1987. The album sold about 300,000 units. That same year, the band found themselves on their first major tour with [[Run DMC]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and others.

===1988–1989: ''He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper''===
Their 1988 follow-up album, ''[[He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper]]'', made them multi-platinum stars. Mostly recorded in the [[United Kingdom]], the album was rap music's first double-[[gramophone record|vinyl LP]] release; it was also issued as a single cassette and CD. "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]", the lead-off single, made them [[MTV]] household names and also gained the honor of the first Grammy for a hip hop/rap song, which was met with mixed feelings. Nevertheless, the single was a success, launching the group into even more mainstream stardom. The video showed Prince's misadventures of trying to get around his parents' strict rules in a very comical way, very much like their first single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]". It gained much airplay on TV channels such as MTV, giving the group much attention. The song was played in an episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' ("Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect (Part 1)"), and referenced in two other episodes of the same series ("The Fresh Prince Project" and "Not With My Pig, You Don't").

Another single, "[[A Nightmare on My Street]]", showcased a fictional confrontation with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' villain [[Freddy Krueger]]. The record's release coincided with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'', which caused legal threats from the movie's distributor [[New Line Cinema]]. In response, the corresponding music video was pulled from release and a legal disclaimer was included on later pressings of ''He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper'' denying affiliation with the film. The video was released by Jazzy Jeff in 2018. <ref>Music video for Nightmare on my Street https://youtube.com/fVbaYFVUbLo]</ref>

Jeff reveals on track 19 of [[Skillz (rapper)|Skillz]]'s Infamous Quotes [[mixtape]] that New Line Cinema approached Will & Jeff for a movie role which they ended up turning down. The film was ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]''. The last single from ''[[He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper]]'' was "Brand New Funk" sampled a James Brown song and quotes it. In the song, the Fresh Prince explains how Jeff has brought in a tape that contains a very cool song that he cannot help but rap over, and how fans react to it. The song was well received by many hip hop fans due to its funk sound, lyrical spins, and the fact that it showed off more of the skills of Jazzy Jeff. The video was shot in black and white, showed live performance clips from a concert and featured 2 Damn Hype Dancing.

===1989–1990: ''And in This Corner...''===
1989 saw the release of ''[[And in This Corner…]]'', the group's third LP. While the sales were a success, reaching gold, the duo's popularity was slipping. The [[crossover (music)|crossover]] curse of various rap acts had come to pass, as their initial audience felt they had become too accessible; non-crossover rap acts like [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Boogie Down Productions]] had bigger street followings; meanwhile, pop radio had latched on to new faces like [[Tone Loc]] and [[Young MC]], while non-radio followers became more enamored with hardcore acts like [[Ice-T]] and [[2 Live Crew]]. The lead single, "[[I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson]]" was in the same vein as their other lead singles; with this one having Will say he could literally beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match. Jazzy Jeff is shown training Prince to perform this task, and after Prince loses, Jeff then claims that he might be able to do it himself. [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]] and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] (co-stars of ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'') show up as Don King and member of the fighting crew's posse, respectively.

The next single was "Jazzy's Groove", sampling "[[Nautilus (song)|Nautilus]]" in the chorus and bridge. The song features much more of Jazzy Jeff, like in "Brand New Funk"; Jazzy Jeff gives a 'math lesson' by making the sound clips add 1+1, 2+1, and 2+2. Due to a self-admitted spendthrift attitude,<ref name=sickening/> Smith felt he had nothing to lose when a producer from [[NBC]] and [[Quincy Jones]] approached him with an idea for a sitcom, with Townes appearing as a recurring character, named "Jazz". A popular [[running gag]] would have Uncle Phil (James Avery) literally throwing Jazz out of the house; however, this action is not restricted to Uncle Phil, as other characters, including Hilary Banks ([[Karyn Parsons]]), Geoffrey Butler ([[Joseph Marcell]]), the second Aunt Vivian ([[Daphne Maxwell Reid]]) and even Will himself, have thrown him out in the same manner. Another trademark on the show involved Jazz and Will greeting each other by slapping each other's hand, then swinging back in opposite directions while saying "Pssh!" ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' boosted his profile and his pocketbook. But Smith ended up squandering almost US$2.8m, while failing to pay any of it to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in income taxation. Soon after ''And in This Corner...'' was released, Smith was found guilty of income-tax evasion by the IRS, and sentenced to pay this all back. For the first three seasons of ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,'' Smith had 25% of his paycheck subjected to IRS garnishment.<ref name=sickening/> 

In 1990 [[Ready Rock C]] decided not to continue as support. He later sued the duo alleging [[breach of contract]], but lost in court.<ref name="Holmes-v-Smith">{{cite web|date = April 16, 2004|url = https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/&httpsredir=1&article=1823&context=thirdcircuit_2004|title = ''Clarence Holmes v.

===1991–1994: ''Homebase'', ''Code Red'' and split===
Still having a bit of extra money from starring in the successful sitcom, the duo decided to stage a comeback album in 1991, ''[[Homebase (album)|Homebase]]''.  The platinum album featured a more mature sound from the group, with Smith rapping in a deeper, consistent voice and changed their sound to fit the era's trend of hip-hop. ''Homebase'' featured the lead-off single "Summertime", which added rap lyrics to the music of the [[Kool & the Gang]] instrumental "Summer Madness" and has become one of their most enduring hits. The video features clips from a family reunion in Philly, and shows the duo being driven around while sitting atop a car. Summertime earned the duo its second Grammy win. The next singles were "Ring My Bell" and "Things That U Do". Both featured the typical sound of the early 90s. Both videos for the songs featured a different version from the original found on the LP.

The final single for the release was "You Saw My Blinker", a song about an old lady that crashed into Prince's new car and his anger at the events that happened thereafter. This is the first (and one of the only) songs where Smith curses, saying the word 'bitch' (''To the left lane I tried to switch, then, you saw my blinker, bitch''). Prince's voice is a bit deeper than usual, to make it sound like he's agitated, similar to "Then She Bit Me" from ''And in This Corner...'' This song reached No. 20 Billboard Hot 100 and No. 22 Hot R&B/Hip Hop singles. In 1992 for the [[Barcelona Olympic Games]] the duo released the song "Higher Baby" as part of the compilation album ''[[Barcelona Gold]]''.

''[[Code Red (DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince album)|Code Red]]'', their last studio LP as a duo, was released in 1993, reaching gold sales. This LP featured a self-admitted harder sound than their other songs, with Jazzy Jeff saying "We wanted to take a new direction. It wasn't that we were concentrating on harder, it was just different",<ref>{{cite web|title=Fresh Ink Talks to Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince |publisher=jazzyjefffreshprince.com |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/fresh-prince/rapping-with-jazzy-jeff-and-fresh-prince.htm |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226065439/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/fresh-prince/rapping-with-jazzy-jeff-and-fresh-prince.htm |archive-date=December 26, 2007 }}</ref> featuring more jazz and soul samples than previous releases. The lead single "[[Boom! Shake the Room]]" reached No. 1 in UK, Ireland, Spain and Australia, and featured a harder sound than any of their other songs. Other singles were "I'm Looking For the One (To Be With Me)", which is similar to "Summertime", and "I Wanna Rock", which showed off more of Jazzy Jeff's DJ skills. Shortly afterward, Smith began to pursue acting full-time and the duo split. He and Townes ended up being sued by Jive, who alleged that the duo was still under contract to create more albums.

==Occasional appearances==
In 1998 the label released the compilation ''[[Greatest Hits (DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince album)|Greatest Hits]]'' with the hits and two previously unreleased songs. Despite not being officially a "group" since 1993, the duo remained close friends and performed together in every major concert or award ceremony performance as well as frequently working together in all of Smith's solo albums. In 2005, Smith and Townes performed together at the Philadelphia leg of [[Live 8 concert, Philadelphia|Live 8]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/25/will-smith-fresh-prince-rap-alfonso-ribeiro-jaden-smith-dj-jazzy-jeff_n_3336968.html Will Smith's 'Fresh Prince' Rap Returns, Star Joined By Alfonso Ribeiro, Jaden Smith, DJ Jazzy Jeff], [[Huffington Post]], May 25, 2013; accessed May 27, 2013</ref> They performed in [[Croatia]] on August 26, 2017, [[Blackpool]] on August 27, and [[Budapest]] on September 25, 2019, for Smith's 51st birthday.
