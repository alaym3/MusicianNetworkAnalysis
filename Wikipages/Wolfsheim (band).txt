'''Wolfsheim''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɔlfs.haɪm}}) was a [[synthpop]] duo from [[Hamburg]], Germany, that consisted of Markus Reinhardt and [[Peter Heppner]]. Although never officially disbanded, Wolfsheim has been inactive since 2005 due to a dispute between the two members, which even led to [[trial]]s in 2007 and 2008 that forbade either member to continue Wolfsheim without the other. The band's musical style takes cues from the 1980s [[New Romanticism]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], usually considered synthpop or [[Dark wave|darkwave]]. They are best known for their singles "[[The Sparrows and the Nightingales]]" (1991), "Once in a Lifetime" (1998) and "Kein Zurück" (2003). Their lyrics tend to be melancholic, but at the same time modernist.

== History ==
The band was founded in 1987 by Markus Reinhardt and Pompejo Ricciardi and was named after [[The Great Gatsby#Minor characters|Meyer Wolfsheim]], a fictional character from [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. Markus' brother Oliver joined the band some time afterward. After co-founder Ricciardi left the band and was replaced by Peter Heppner who had known the band members from mutual friends and from growing up in the same [[neighborhood]] in [[Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg]], they produced their first [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape ''Ken Manage'' in 1988. Their first performance was at Werkstatt 3, a small club in [[Hamburg]]. Oliver Reinhardt left the band, leading to the band's definitive lineup of Markus Reinhardt (music) and Peter Heppner (lyrics and vocals).

After making a second demo tape ''Any But Pretty'' (1989), Wolfsheim applied at various labels to no avail, until they caught the attention of the [[sole proprietorship|one-man]] [[independent record label]] [[Strange Ways Records]]. Wolfsheim's "The Sparrows and the Nightingales" (1991), was the first single to be released on Strange Ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Strange+Ways+Records |title=Strange Ways discography |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> The song became a fast hit, even though it was not heavily promoted. Their debut album ''No Happy View'' (1992) was also released on Strange Ways and did well in the charts. The follow-up ''Popkiller'' (1993) reached the [[Media Control Charts|German Media Control Charts]], albeit at a low position. In February 1995, Wolfsheim released the compilation album ''55578'', comprising many tracks previously featured on singles, as well as some unreleased material. The first 55,578 copies were [[special edition]]s that contained a bonus disk with material recorded at the Strange Ways Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolis-records.com/artists/?artist=wolfsheim |title=Metropolis Records |publisher=Metropolis Records |access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> The album remained in the German charts for five weeks. The 1996 album ''Dreaming Apes'' reached number 91. Following its release, Wolfsheim embarked on their first tour in May 1996. A [[live CD|live recording]] was released in October 1997 named ''Hamburg Rom Wolfsheim''.

Throughout the band's existence, both members were involved with various [[side project]]s. Reinhardt started the bands ''Nefkom'' and ''Neustart'', both of which released their albums on Strange Ways. Heppner collaborated with [[Joachim Witt]] in 1998 on the song "Die Flut", which reached No. 2 in the German Single Charts and garnered them a platinum record. His increased popularity also boosted Wolfsheim's success; their album ''Spectators'', released in February 1999, was the first to reach the top-10 in Germany, at number two. Since 2001, the album was distributed in the [[United States]] by [[Metropolis Records]]. ''Spectators'' reached gold status in Germany in 2004. The singles released off this album, "Once in a Lifetime", "It's Hurting for the First Time" and "Künstliche Welten" were all successful. That summer, Wolfsheim played at many of the major German festivals, including the Bizarre Festival, [[Rock am Ring]], and [[Rock im Park]]. They also played their first show outside of Germany, at [[Belgium]]'s Eurorock Festival.

Since 1999 Reinhardt focused on Care Company, a band whose 2001 album ''In the Flow'' was released on [[Motor Music|Motor]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. Heppner featured on tracks by several other artists. He collaborated among others with the dance project [[Schiller (band)|Schiller]] on the songs, "Dream of You" and "Leben... I Feel You", which were a big success all over Europe. He also collaborated on "Glasgarten" with [[Goethes Erben]] and "Wir sind Wir" with trance/techno-DJ [[Paul van Dyk]].

In anticipation of a forthcoming album, Wolfsheim released the live DVD ''Kompendium'' on 16 April 2002, containing a recording from the ''Spectators'' tour, an interview, and various music videos. In March 2003, the release of ''Casting Shadows'' instantly sent it to the top spot in the German album charts and reached platinum status. The single "Kein Zurück", released on 2 February was the band's first single to enter into the Media Control Charts top-10, debuting at number five and moving up to the fourth spot. It remained in the charts for 10 weeks and reached gold status. Greatest highlight in the band's career was receiving an [[Echo (music award)|ECHO]] in 2004 for Best Alternative Domestic Band. A sold-out tour through Germany was followed by Wolfsheim's only tour through the U.S. in March and April 2004.
