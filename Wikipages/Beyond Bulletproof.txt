''Beyond Bulletproof'' was met with generally favorable reviews from critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 77, based on four reviews.<ref name="MC" />

RapReviews.com critic Ryan Feyre said, "[[Mozzy]]'s greatest strength as a writer is clear intimacy. Every time he spits a verse, I feel like he's talking to me one-on-one with a cigar in hand and his posse surrounding him. There's wisdom attached to his words because he's been through it all. ... Mozzy still carries demons, but there are indeed shimmers of happiness percolating throughout some of these passages".<ref name="RR" /> Kenan Draughorne of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said, "He doesn't dazzle with sinewy flows or clever melodies; he spits what's on his mind and trusts it will resonate. It definitely resonates on ''Beyond Bulletproof'', due to his transparent lens and well-suited production. Chalk it up as a victory for [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]'s lyrical champion".<ref name="HHDX" /> Sheldon Pearce of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' summed up, "''Beyond Bulletproof'' is the closest Mozzy has come to making his songs accessible".<ref name="Pitchfork" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Fred Thomas said, "Lyrical themes orbit around topics he often returns to: crime, struggle, and street vengeance. With ''Beyond Bulletproof'', however, the delivery is shades more relaxed and even introspective, allowing for a clearer view of Mozzy's pain as well as his personality".<ref name="AM" />
