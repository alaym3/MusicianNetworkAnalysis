==Biography==
Byiome Muir grew up in Sandy Bay, a small community east of [[May Pen]] in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica.  Muir attended [[Palmers Cross]] All-Age School and then Garvey Maceo High School, and would often sing and make noises during class.  Muir briefly attended [[Knox College, Jamaica|Knox Community College]] with a focus on [[architecture]], but dropped out to pursue his recording career full-time.<ref name="flex"/><ref name="earlylife">{{cite news |title=Big Names Back I-Octane's Summer Effort |first=Leighton |last=Levy |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110522/ent/ent3.html |newspaper=[[Gleaner Company|Jamaica Gleaner]] |date=22 May 2011 |access-date=4 Apr 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=I-Octane |series=Noisey Jamaica |author1=Snoop Lion |author-link=Snoop Lion |author2=Andy Capper |author2-link=Andy Capper |author3=Codine Williams |author4=Trevor Silmser |network=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=26 Feb 2013 |number=6 |url=http://noisey.vice.com/noisey-jamaica/tommy-lee-sparta |access-date=7 Apr 2013}}</ref>

Muir began his recording career at the age of 16, when he was introduced to [[Donovan Germain]] of Penthouse Records, then manager of such artists as [[Buju Banton]] and [[Assassin (deejay)|Assassin]].<ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane explosion |first=Tanola |last=Jackson |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20080229/ent/ent5.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=29 Feb 2008 |access-date=4 Apr 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527062648/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20080229/ent/ent5.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Muir released his first [[Single (music)|singles]], "Oh Jah" and "Stepp a Seed", in 2000 at Penthouse Records under the moniker Richie Rich.  After meeting Junior Arrows of the [[Arrows the Ambassador|Arrows Recording Company]], Muir signed onto the [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] label under the new name I-Octane, a play on high-[[Octane rating|octane]] fuel and the [[Iyaric#I words|Rastafarian use of I]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |title=I-Octane Crying to the Nation Review |first=David |last=Katz |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/w4m5 |newspaper=[[BBC Music Magazine|BBC Music]] |date=7 Mar 2012 |access-date=4 Apr 2013}}</ref>  I-Octane's initial acclaim came in 2007 for his [[social commentary]] works such as the [[roots reggae]] track "Stab Vampire" which climbed to the top of several Jamaican charts.<ref name="iggy">{{cite news |title=Fuel Your Lady’s Love With Reggae Superstar, I-Octane |first=Halley |last=Bondy |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/articles/fuel-your-ladys-love-with-reggae-superstar-i-octane/ |newspaper=[[MTV]] Iggy |date=13 Feb 2012 |access-date=16 Apr 2013}}</ref>  In 2009, I-Octane topped the charts again with his emotional songs "Mama You Alone" and "Lose A Friend", and the latter of which was later adapted as a tribute to those who died during the police manhunt for [[Christopher Coke|Christopher "Dudus" Coke]] in [[Tivoli Gardens, Kingston|Tivoli Gardens]].<ref name="billboard"/>

When I-Octane left Arrows over financial disputes, the artist came under the guidance of Robert Livingston, a veteran producer who had been responsible for the success of such artists as [[Super Cat]] and [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]].<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="iggy"/>  I-Octane gained further traction in 2010 with a string of hits produced by Cashflow Records, including "No Love Inna Dem" and the [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] anthem "Puff It," which was named as one of [[NPR]]'s Top 5 Dancehall Tracks of 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Top 5 Dancehall Tracks Of 2011 |first=Baz |last=Dreisinger |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/01/143016082/the-top-5-dancehall-tracks-of-2011 |newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=27 Dec 2011 |access-date=4 Apr 2013}}</ref>  He also topped the charts once again with the contemplative "My Life" produced by DJ Frass, and was featured in the April–May issue of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] magazine [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]].<ref name="earlylife"/>  The same year, he also signed on as [[Brand ambassador|Brand Ambassador]] for the [[telecommunication]]s firm [[Digicel]], and as of 2013 he remains employed as a representative of the company.<ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane re-signed as Digicel brand ambassador |first=Curtis |last=Campbell |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130125/ent/ent2.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=25 Jan 2013 |access-date=4 Apr 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205065759/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130125/ent/ent2.html |archive-date=5 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> I-Octane has also been the Brand Ambassador for the [http://www.goldeneaglejamaica.com '''Golden Eagle Brand'''] in Jamaica since 2015.

In 2011, I-Octane announced he would be starting his own record label, Conquer The Globe Productions, which would serve to produce instrumentals for him and promote him as an artist.  He also said the label's first release would be an [[extended play]] in December of that year to be followed by an album in early 2012.  The six-song EP, "Straight From The Heart," was released on 7 December as a primarily digital release, with distribution by [[TuneCore]].  The EP was marketed towards a global audience and three of its songs were recorded in the [[United States|U.S.]], a first for the artist.  The EP's lead single "Burn Dem Bridge," produced by [[Di Genius|Stephen "Di Genius" McGregor]], topped several charts in Jamaica and received significant radio airplay, including on international stations such as [[New York City|New York's]] [[WQHT|Hot 97]].<ref name="billboard"/>

I-Octane's debut album, ''Crying To The Nation'', was released on 13 February 2012 through Robert Livingston's Scikron Entertainment in the [[Caribbean]] and [[VP Records]] internationally.  The album received generally positive reviews from critics.  Rick Anderson of [[Allmusic|AllMusic]] praised the record as a "solid winner", but mentioned it relied a little too strongly on [[Auto-Tune]], and David Katz of [[BBC Music Magazine|BBC Music]] called the album "a surprisingly varied set, comprising mostly new roots reggae in the [[One drop rhythm|one drop]] style, along with a couple of rougher-edged tracks in full-on dancehall mode".<ref name="bbc"/><ref>{{cite news |title= I-Octane Crying to the Nation |first=Rick |last=Anderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/crying-to-the-nation-mw0002279145 |newspaper=[[Allmusic|AllMusic]] |date=13 Feb 2013 |access-date=4 Apr 2013}}</ref>  The album's lead single was the [[lovers rock]] ballad "L.O.V.E. Y.O.U.", which was marketed to international audiences but also did well domestically.  I-Octane followed the album with a tour of the U.S., [[Canada]], and [[Europe]], and ended the year strong with a string of hit singles, including "Badmind Dem A Pree", a collaboration with [[Bounty Killer]] produced by [[Buju Banton]]'s son Markus Myrie, the summer hit "Love Di Vibes", and the Seanizzle-produced "Gal A Gimmi Bun", a song in which I-Octane laments his partner's infidelity.<ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane wraps up Canadian leg of tour |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120514/ent/ent3.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=14 May 2012 |access-date=4 Apr 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519100035/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120514/ent/ent3.html |archive-date=19 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane continues to dominate dancehall scene |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20121129/ent/ent3.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=29 Nov 2012 |access-date=4 Apr 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150717/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20121129/ent/ent3.html |archive-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane laments 'getting bun' in new single |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130111/ent/ent2.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=11 Jan 2013 |access-date=4 Apr 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603070716/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130111/ent/ent2.html |archive-date=3 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=I-Octane still on a high ... following memorable performance at YVAs |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130207/ent/ent2.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=7 Feb 2013 |access-date=7 Apr 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213123828/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130207/ent/ent2.html |archive-date=13 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
