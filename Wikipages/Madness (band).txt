==Career==
=== 1976–1978: Formation ===
The core of the band formed as the North London Invaders in 1976, and included [[Mike Barson]] (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, [[Chris Foreman]] (Chrissy Boy) on guitar and [[Lee Thompson (saxophonist)|Lee Thompson]] (Kix) on saxophone and vocals.<ref name="madness76">{{cite web |url=http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1976/text.htm |title=The Madness Timeline: 1976 |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002914/http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1976/text.htm |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as [[Chas Smash]]) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist [[Dikron Tulane]].<ref name="madness76" />

This six-piece line-up lasted until part-way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]]) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden.<ref name="madness77">{{cite web |url=http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1977/text.htm |title=The Madness Timeline: 1977 |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002935/http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1977/text.htm|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> Tulane went on to be an actor<ref name="DT1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876305/|title=Dikran Tulaine|website=IMDb.com|access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref> under the name Dikran Tulaine.

By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return as a vocalist after he had filled in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed).<ref name="madness78" /> Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson.

During 1979, the band began to attract a live following in London, being regulars at the [[Dublin Castle, Camden|Dublin Castle]] in Camden Town.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jan/27/alo-conlon-pub-landlord-legend |title=Alo Conlon: A tribute to a rock'n'roll pub landlord |first=Morwenna |last=Ferrier |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 January 2009 |access-date=1 September 2015}}</ref> The band's first commercial recording was the Lee Thompson composition "[[The Prince (song)|The Prince]]".<ref name="madness79" /> The song, like the band's name, paid homage to their idol, [[Prince Buster]]. The song was released through [[2 Tone Records]], the label of [[The Specials]] founder [[Jerry Dammers]].<ref name="madness79" /> The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at number 16.<ref name="madness79" /> Madness toured with fellow [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] bands the Specials and [[the Selecter]], before recording their debut album.

That debut album, ''[[One Step Beyond...]]'' was released by [[Stiff Records]].<ref name="madness79" /> The album included a re-recording of "The Prince" and its B-side "Madness", and the band's second and third singles: "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" and "[[My Girl (Madness song)|My Girl]]". The title song was a cover of the [[B-side]] of the 1960s Prince Buster hit "Al Capone". The ''One Step Beyond...'' album stayed in the British charts for 78 weeks, peaking at number 2.<ref name="madness79" /><ref name="osbchart">{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/ |title=One Step Beyond Official Charts Companyrmation |access-date=30 July 2007 }}</ref> Smyth performed on the album but was not an official member of the band at the time or the album's recording or release. He would formally join Madness a few weeks after ''One Step Beyond...'' was issued in October 1979.

After the release of "My Girl", the band felt that they had exhausted the material from ''One Step Beyond...'', and did not want to release any more singles from the album.<ref name="madness80" /> However, [[Dave Robinson (music executive)|Dave Robinson]], head of Stiff Records, disagreed.<ref name="madness80" /> Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks.<ref name="madness80" /> The result was the ''[[Work Rest and Play]]'' EP, which was headlined by the song "[[Night Boat to Cairo]]", from the ''One Step Beyond'' album.<ref name="madness80" /> The EP reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="madness80" />

In 1980, the band's second album, ''[[Absolutely (Madness album)|Absolutely]]'' reached number 2 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="madness80">{{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1980/text.htm |title= The Madness Timeline: 1980 |access-date=19 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002834/http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1980/text.htm |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> ''Absolutely'' spawned some of the band's biggest hits, most notably "[[Baggy Trousers]]", which peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="madness80" /> "[[Embarrassment (song)|Embarrassment]]" reached number 4 in the charts, and the instrumental song "[[The Return of the Los Palmas 7]]" climbed to number 7.<ref name="madness80" /> Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of ''One Step Beyond...'', they were mostly positive.

A drama-documentary film entitled ''[[Take It or Leave It (1981 film)|Take It or Leave It]]'' was released in 1981, featuring the band members playing themselves in a re-creation of their early days to the then-current period.<ref name="theargus1">{{cite news|last=Hall |first=Duncan |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/11875401.Madness_still_going_One_Step_Beyond_as_they_prepare_for_Sussex_County_Ground_gig/ |title=Madness still going One Step Beyond as they prepare for Sussex County Ground gig |newspaper=The Argus |date=24 March 2015 |access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref> Live recordings of Madness performances as well as those by other 2 Tone bands were used in the 1981 documentary film and soundtrack album ''[[Dance Craze]]''.

In 1981, the band's third studio album, ''[[7 (Madness album)|7]]'', reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and contained three hit singles: "[[Grey Day]]" (no. 4, April 1981), "[[Shut Up (Madness song)|Shut Up]]" (no. 7, September 1981), and "[[Cardiac Arrest (Madness song)|Cardiac Arrest]]" (no. 14, February 1982).<ref name="madness81">{{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1981/text.htm |title= The Madness Timeline: 1981 |access-date=19 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002841/http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1981/text.htm |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> In an article in 1979, [[Chris Foreman]] explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on.<ref name="soundsmag">{{Cite news |title=Absolutely | last =Millar | first =Robbi | newspaper=Sounds Magazine | date =September 1979 }} (The full article was also included on the back cover of the ''Absolutely'' LP.)</ref> This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, ''7'' was something of a change in direction. [[Graham McPherson|Suggs']] vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous albums had been watered down.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of ''One Step Beyond...'' and ''Absolutely'' and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums.

Near the end of 1981, Madness released one of their most recognised songs: a cover of [[Labi Siffre]]'s 1971 hit "[[It Must Be Love (Madness song)|It Must Be Love]]".<ref name="madness81" /> The song climbed to number 4 in the UK, and in 1983, the song peaked at number 33 in the US charts.<ref name="madness81" /><ref name="2tone1">{{cite web|url= http://2-tone.info/artists/madness.html |title= 2 Tone Records&nbsp;– Artists|website=2-tone.info |access-date=19 June 2007}}</ref> In 1982, Madness released their only number 1 hit to date, "[[House of Fun]]",<ref name="Sony/ATV">{{Cite web | url=https://www.sonyatv.com/en/songwriters/2338/madness | title=Sony/ATV|website=Sonyatv.com}}</ref> which they played live on the 1980s series ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', and also reached number 1 in the album charts with their first compilation, ''[[Complete Madness]]''.

In November 1982, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[The Rise & Fall (album)|The Rise & Fall]]'', which was well received in the UK, but did not get an American release. Instead, many of its songs were included on the US compilation ''[[Madness (Madness album)|Madness]]'', including "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]", which was their most internationally successful single to date. "Our House" reached number 5 in the UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts; it was also performed live on ''The Young Ones''.<ref name="madnessstory5">{{cite web|url= http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness5.html |title= The Madness Story: Chapter 5 |access-date=19 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215040907/http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness5.html |archive-date=15 December 2007}}</ref> Many reviewers compared ''The Rise & Fall'' to [[The Kinks]]' ''[[Village Green Preservation Society]]'',<ref name="amriseandfall">{{cite web |last=Woodstra |first=Chris |url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r43823|pure_url=yes}} |title= The Rise & Fall overview |website=AllMusic |access-date=2 August 2007}}</ref> and it is at times retrospectively considered a [[concept album]].

On 5 October 1983 the band were rehearsing and discussing a possible television series, which was being written for them by [[Ben Elton]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. Barson then informed the band that he would not be able to take part, as he was tired of the music business and wanted to spend more time with his wife. They had recently relocated to Amsterdam.<ref name="madness83"/> Barson agreed to finish recording the album ''Keep Moving;'' he left after playing for the last time with the band at the Lyceum Ballroom on 21 December 1983.

The band continued to reunite for annual UK Christmas season tours and held three more Madstock! festivals; in 1994, 1996 and 1998. Also in 1998, Madness returned to America for their first tour there since 1984. The live album ''[[Universal Madness]]'' was recorded at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in L.A. and released the following year. In 1999, Madness released their first studio album since 1986, entitled ''[[Wonderful (Madness album)|Wonderful]]''. The album reached number 17 in the UK Albums Chart, and the lead single, "[[Lovestruck (Madness song)|Lovestruck]]", gave the band their first new top 10 hit in the UK since 1983.<ref name="lovestruckchart">{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Ain%27t%20That%20A%20Lot%20Of%20Love |title= Lovestruck chart information|website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=1 August 2007 }}</ref> Neither of the two subsequent singles from the album, "[[Johnny The Horse]]" and "[[Drip Fed Fred]]", entered the top 40 of the UK chart.<ref name="jthchart">{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Keep%20The%20Home%20Fires%20Burning |title= Johnny The Horse chart information|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=1 August 2007 }}</ref><ref name="ddfchart">{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Money%20To%20Burn |title= Drip Fed Fred chart information|website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=1 August 2007 }}</ref>

From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003, a musical based on Madness songs, ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'', ran at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in London.

=== 2004–2010: The Dangermen and The Liberty of Norton Folgate {{anchor|dangermen}} ===
[[File:Madness at Bimbos.jpg|thumb|Madness performing live at Bimbos in 2005]]
In 2004, the band played a series of low-key concerts as The Dangermen, performing covers of classic reggae and ska songs. A lot of the songs were those played by the band when they were first forming,<ref name="suggsbbc04">Long, Chris. {{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2004/06/17/suggs_interview.shtml |title= Interview with Suggs of Madness |date=17 June 2004 |publisher=BBC |access-date=20 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319112924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2004/06/17/suggs_interview.shtml |archive-date=19 March 2008}}</ref> and the band performed the songs as a celebration of their 25th anniversary.<ref name="suggsbbc04" />

This led to the release of the album ''[[The Dangermen Sessions Vol. 1]]'' on V2 Records in August 2005. During the sessions which produced the album, in mid-2005, guitarist Chris Foreman announced his departure, citing "the petty, time consuming bollocks that goes on in the band" as his reason for leaving.<ref name="foremandeparture">Cohen, Jonathan. {{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62830/madness-inks-with-v2-new-album-in-works |title= Madness Inks With V2, New Album In Works |access-date=12 July 2007}}</ref> The band completed the album without him, and on release, it peaked at no. 11 in the UK Albums Chart, which was the band's highest studio album chart position in 21 years. Although two singles were released, neither was a major success in the UK. The more successful of the two, "[[Shame & Scandal]]", reached number 38, but was more successful in France where it peaked at number 12.<ref name="shamecharts">{{cite web|url= http://www.musicsquare.net/charts/song/2187 |title= Madness&nbsp;– Shame & Scandal: Charts |publisher=MusicSquare |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120445/http://www.musicsquare.net/charts/song/2187 |archive-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> "[[Girl Why Don't You?]]" did not chart and the band left the V2 record label shortly after. At this time, Kevin Burdette joined as the band's guitarist for live appearances and also appeared in the videos for both "Sorry" and "NW5" in early 2007.

The six remaining original members of Madness began working on their first original album in seven years.

In March 2007, the non-LP single [[Sorry (Madness song)|"Sorry"]] was released on the band's own record label [[Lucky 7 Records]], peaking in the UK charts at number 23. The single included a version featuring UK [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists [[Sway DaSafo]] and [[Baby Blue (rapper)|Baby Blue]].

The new Madness song "[[NW5]]" (then still titled "NW5 (I Would Give You Everything)") and a re-recorded version of "It Must Be Love" were featured in the German film ''Neues vom Wixxer''. The two songs were released in Germany as a [[double A-Side]], and both of them were turned into music videos, which&nbsp;– besides members of the film's cast&nbsp;– featured Suggs, Chas Smash, Woody and stand-in guitarist Burdette. A re-recorded version of "NW5" was released as a single on 14 January 2008 in the UK reaching no. 24&nbsp;– this recording featured original Madness guitarist Chris Foreman, who had rejoined the band in time for the 2006 Christmas tour but had not participated in the original recording of the song.

In June 2008, Madness played the majority of their new album ''[[The Liberty of Norton Folgate]]'' at London's [[Hackney Empire]] for three nights. The Hackney Empire performances were recorded and sold to fans on USB wristbands as they left the show. Madness played two dates in December 2008, firstly in Manchester on 18 December, and secondly a return gig to The O2 in London on the 19th.

In December 2008 the band also announced that for their thirtieth anniversary in 2009, they would be staging a fifth Madstock Festival in London's Victoria Park on 17 July, 11 years after the last Madstock concert. It was originally rumoured that the newly reformed [[The Specials]] would make an appearance after finishing their reunion tour. However, this did not occur, although original Specials keyboardist Jerry Dammers&nbsp;– who was not part of the reunion line-up&nbsp;– was announced as a support act with [[The Spatial AKA Orchestra]] shortly before the festival. Dammers supported Madness again during their 2009 Christmas tour when he opened each night with a DJ set.

Through late March and early April 2009, the band played a series of festival and separate headlining dates across Australia. The lead-up single from their latest album, entitled [[Dust Devil (Madness song)|"Dust Devil]]", was released on 11 May on Lucky 7 Records. [[Alfie Allen]] and [[Jaime Winstone]] co-starred in the music video. The single charted at No.&nbsp;64 on the UK Singles Chart and at No.&nbsp;1 on the UK Independent charts on 17 May 2009.

The new album, entitled ''[[The Liberty of Norton Folgate]]'', was released a week later, on 18 May 2009. It charted at No.&nbsp;5 in the UK Albums Chart. The band continued to play various festivals, including [[Pinkpop]], [[Splendour in Nottingham|Splendour]], and [[Glastonbury festival|Glastonbury]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/glastonbury/5626086/Glastonbury-2009-Suggs-interview.html | title=Glastonbury 2009: Suggs interview| date=24 June 2009| last1=Perry| first1=Andrew}}</ref> On 27 September 2009, the band also played a free concert on a closed-off [[Regent Street]] in association with [[Absolute Radio]].

On 28 August, Madness played the [[Rock en Seine]] festival near Paris, on the same night where [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher engaged in a physical altercation, resulting in the split of the band. As Oasis cancelled their headlining slot, Madness, even though having played earlier in the evening, were asked to replace them. They accepted the invitation and both of their sets during the festival were said to have been well received.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

As in previous years, the band embarked on a Christmas tour of the UK (also playing one concert in [[Dublin]]), playing at various medium-sized venues. Mark Bedford took a break from the band and was replaced by Graham Bush for the tour.

Some members of the band appeared in [[Catherine Tate]]'s ''Nan's Christmas Carol''. They first posed as carol singers, then played "Baggy Trousers" over the credits. On 18 January 2010, Madness released a fourth single, "[[Forever Young (Madness song)|Forever Young]]", from ''The Liberty of Norton Folgate''. The single failed to chart.

During an interview with [[RTÉ 2fm]] radio host [[Dave Fanning]] on 24 May 2010, drummer [[Daniel Woodgate]] stated that the members of the band were in the final stages of preparing songs for the follow-up to ''The Liberty of Norton Folgate''. The band hoped to be able to start recording the album later on in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2010/pc/pod-v-2505109m03sdavefanningshow.mp3|title=RTÉ 2fm: Dave Fanning Interview with Woody of Madness (24 May 2010) |format=MP3 | publisher=RTÉ News |access-date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

In September 2010, Madness were awarded the Idol Award at the [[Q Awards]] in London. Guitarist Chris Foreman stated in his acceptance speech that Madness were recording a new album.

Madness toured the UK throughout November and December 2010 with their final show at London's [[Earl's Court]], where they played a new song from their upcoming album. However, two concerts, in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Sheffield]], were cancelled due to heavy snowfall, although they were later rescheduled for 5 and 6 February 2011 respectively.

In June 2011, the band performed at [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] Festival at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], curated by inspiration [[Ray Davies]], who also introduced the band on stage. The concert served as the premiere of three new songs&nbsp;– "1978", "Can't Keep a Good Thing Down" and "Death of a Rude Boy".

The summer of 2012 saw two notable performances. In June, the band performed at the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Diamond Jubilee]] concert at [[Buckingham Palace]]. The band performed "Our House" and "It Must Be Love" from the roof of the palace with accompanying animations projected onto the palace front. In August, the band was the first to perform at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]]. Departed bass player Bedford rejoined the band for both performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9617366/Madness-Suggs-on-30-years-as-musics-most-dysfunctional-family.html|title=Madness: Suggs on 30 years as music's most dysfunctional family|first=Sheryl|last=Garratt|date=22 October 2012|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In August 2012, Madness released "Death of a Rude Boy" as a free teaser track from their new album.

From the start of 2013, Bedford increased his performances with the band building to his full-time return to the group, which meant a close to the four years Graham Bush had spent with the band.<ref name="linkedin.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/graham-bush-bushers/52/43/470 |title=Graham Bush (Bushers) |publisher=LinkedIn.com |access-date=19 April 2014}}{{Better source needed|date=November 2020}}</ref>

On 22 March 2013, the band performed outside the [[BBC Television Centre]] in a live broadcast for [[BBC Four]]. This was followed by ''Goodbye Television Centre'', a celebration of 50 years of the television centre, marking the closure of the building and the last show to be broadcast from it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21903603|title=Madness perform Television Centre gig|work=BBC News|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> Following that the band was the closing act to the new year celebration of 2014 in Dublin, Ireland.

On 22 March 2014, Suggs confirmed that Madness were writing a new album which he stated "the band plan to record in the summer and release by the end of 2014".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=77558 |title=Suggs writing new Madness album |publisher=Music News |access-date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

In October 2014, Cathal Smyth, aka Chas Smash, left Madness to pursue a solo career. His solo album, ''[[A Comfortable Man]]'', was released on 11 May 2015.  Although Smyth's departure was characterized at the time as a 'break' to concentrate on his solo career and not necessarily a permanent departure, Smyth has not rejoined Madness in the years since the break was announced.  Madness has continued as a six-piece. 

In February 2015, the band announced the Grandslam tour, taking in 20 outdoor venues.

===2016–present: ''Can't Touch Us Now''===
The band announced their new album ''[[Can't Touch Us Now]]'' in May 2016.

Throughout 2017, the band played at several festivals and concerts worldwide including mainland Europe, Asia, and Australia.  In April their first Australian gig at the Fremantle Arts Centre in Western Australia sold out, necessitating a second gig the following night.  In August, the band hosted their own "House of Common Festival" for the second year on [[Clapham Common]].

===The Madness===
[[File:The Madness Band.jpg|thumb|upright|A promotional photograph of The Madness, (L-R): Thompson, Foreman, Smash, and Suggs]]
The Madness was a line-up of Madness without Mark Bedford, Daniel Woodgate and Mike Barson, active between 1988 and 1989. Formed by Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman in 1988, they distinguished this line-up from the previous Madness line-up only by adding the word "The" to the band's name. The band had held a competition to find a new name on Radio 1. They decided on 'The Wasp Factory' after the [[Iain Banks]] novel, but that name had already been taken by another band.

The album is notable for featuring notable guest performers including [[Jerry Dammers]], [[John Hasler]] and [[Earl Falconer]]. It is also the first album produced by the band themselves under the alias 'The Three Eyes'.

''The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'' and many online discographies consider this band to be the same as "Madness". Several of the songs on the album (4BF, Be Good Boy, Gabriels Horn, In Wonder) were reworked songs from the cancelled 1986 Madness album and had been performed live or demoed in 1986 before the band split. Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman also alluded to this view on their album ''[[Crunch!]]'', which was dedicated to "the good ship Madness and all who sailed in her (1979 to 1989)".

===The Nutty Boys===
The Nutty Boys were [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] and [[Chris Foreman]] of Madness. The name "The Nutty Boys" was actually the name of their album, while the new band was called "Crunch!". The posters for their first concert mistakenly listed the band as "The Nutty Boys" instead of "Crunch!", and the name stuck. While the members of the band Madness were nicknamed "The Nutty Boys" as a whole, this section lists only the work released by Thompson and Foreman under "The Nutty Boys" name in the early 1990s.

==Collaborations==
Madness collaborated with [[Elvis Costello]] in 1983 on a version of their song "[[Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)]]". It was released as a bonus track to the 12" copy of the single. In later years, Barson stated that Costello's "[[Watching the Detectives (song)|Watching the Detectives]]" was the main influence on the song "My Girl". For ''Wonderful'' in 1999, [[Ian Dury]] laid down vocals on the track "[[Drip Fed Fred]]" which was released as the last single from the album. It was Dury's last recording before his death. Ill health prevented Dury from actively promoting the single, although he did appear on the [[National Lottery Show]], for a later performance on [[TFI Friday]], the song was reworked to incorporate [[Phill Jupitus]] on vocals. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists including [[UB40]] and [[Prince Buster]], notably at their first Madstock concert. They have also played live frequently with members of the other 2 Tone bands including The Specials. In May 2008, Suggs and Carl performed live with [[Pet Shop Boys]] at London's [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] collaborating on a new arrangement of "My Girl". A few days afterwards, [[Pet Shop Boys]] posted their own version of the track on their official website.

In late 2010, the band collaborated in the ''Cage Against The Machine'' project, in which numerous artists performed [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' for a [[charity single]] intended to prevent the winner of [[The X Factor (UK)|''The X Factor'']] claiming the Christmas Number 1. The title refers to the previous year's successful campaign to get [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Killing in the Name]]" to chart above ''X Factor'' winner [[Joe McElderry]].

==Lyrical themes==
Frequent themes in Madness' songs included childhood memories (e.g., "[[Baggy Trousers]]", and "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]") and petty crime (e.g., "[[Shut Up (Madness song)|Shut Up]]", and "Deceives the Eye"). Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs,<ref name="absolutelyam">{{cite web |last=Woodstra |first=Chris |url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r12188|pure_url=yes}} |title= Absolutely overview |website=AllMusic |access-date=5 July 2007}}</ref> many of their songs took a darker tone (such as the singles "[[Grey Day]]" and "[[Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)]]") and they sometimes tackled what were, at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. "Embarrassment" (from the ''Absolutely'' album) was written by Lee Thompson, and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man's child.<ref name="embarrassment">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4465666.stm |title= An embarrassment no more |work=BBC News | date=24 November 2005 | access-date=5 January 2010 |first=Jonathan |last=Duffy}}</ref> Madness discussed [[animal testing]] in the song "Tomorrow's Dream".<ref name="animaltesting">{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Lee |url=http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_6c.htm |title= Tomorrow's Dream: What's it all about? |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002752/http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_6c.htm |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> The band criticised the [[National Health Service]] in "Mrs. Hutchinson", which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became terminally ill.

==Awards==
The band's first notable musical award came in 1983 when Chris Foreman and Cathal Smyth won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for ''Best Song'' for the international hit "Our House".<ref name="suggsimdb" /><ref name="madness83" /> Madness received another Ivor Novello Award 17 years later for an "Outstanding Song Collection".<ref name="suggsimdb" /><ref name="novellobbc">{{cite web|url= http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/764027.stm |title= Ivor Novello awards: The winners|website=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk }} Retrieved on 19 June 2007.</ref> In 2005, they were awarded the [[MOJO Awards|MOJO]] "Hall of Fame" Award, notably for being "an artist's artist".<ref name="mojoaward">{{cite web|url= http://promo.emapnetwork.com/mojo/honours2005/ |title= Mojo honours list for 2005 |access-date=10 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621181647/http://promo.emapnetwork.com/mojo/honours2005/ |archive-date=21 June 2007}}</ref> In 2007, a campaign took place by fans of Madness for the band to be awarded a [[Brit Award]].<ref name="britaward">{{cite web|url=http://www.madnessbritaward.co.uk |title=Madness Brit Award campaign |access-date=10 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403050332/http://www.madnessbritaward.co.uk/ |archive-date=3 April 2008 }}</ref> Many fans and critics feel they have been overlooked over their past 30 years in the music industry.<ref name="britaward" /> In July 2009, Madness were awarded the 'Silver Clef' Icon Award.
