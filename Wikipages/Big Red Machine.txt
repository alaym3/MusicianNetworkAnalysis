The '''Big Red Machine''' is a nickname for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] [[baseball]] team that dominated the [[National League]] from [[1970 in baseball|1970]] to [[1979 in baseball|1979]] and is widely recognized as being among the best in baseball history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Big Red Machine Rates Among Best Ever; Balance of Offense, Defense made '75 Cincinnati Team So Great |last=Peterson|first=Bill |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |publisher=Scripps Howard news Service |date=1995-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Shannon|first=Mike |title=Riverfront Stadium: Home of the Big Red Machine |year=2003 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=0-7385-2324-0 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjYflf-JSvoC |access-date=2009-05-13}}</ref> The team won six [[National League West Division]] titles, four National League pennants, and two [[World Series]] titles.<ref>{{cite web|work=Baseball-Reference.com |title=Cincinnati Reds Team History & Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/ |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> Between 1970 and 1979 the team averaged over 95 wins a season, with a total record of 953 wins and 657 losses.

The core of that Reds team had the best record in the Major Leagues in 1981, but did not make the postseason because of [[Bowie Kuhn]]'s split-season playoff format due to the player's strike.

The 2010–2014 San Francisco Giants did win three World Championships in five years, at least sparking the debate of whether they could be considered a National League dynasty, but they did not reach the postseason in consecutive years during this span. <ref name="World Series" />

==Later Years==
Dan Driessen took over at first base for Tony Perez in 1977.<ref name="baseball-reference.com"/> Although some of the original players departed the team, some extended the Big Red Machine nickname for two more years until the departures of Anderson and Rose following the 1978 season.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> The Reds turned around to finish in second place in [[1977 in baseball|1977]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Baseball-Reference.com |title=1977 Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1977.shtml |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> and [[1978 in baseball|1978]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Baseball-Reference.com |title=1978 Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1978.shtml |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> Ray Knight replaced Pete Rose at third base for Cincinnati in 1979 and the rest of the Reds starting lineup still included six of the great eight: Bench, Morgan, Foster, Concepcion, Griffey and Geronimo. The Cincinnati Reds won another division title in 1979,<ref name="baseball-reference.com">[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1979.shtml 1979 Cincinnati Reds Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics – Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NLCS.

The Big Red Machine had one last great run in 1981 when they finished the strike season with the best record in baseball. Only three of the great eight remained in the starting lineup: Foster, Griffey and Concepcion. Bench had an injury plagued season and was moved from catcher to third base. [[Tom Seaver]] had a win-loss record of 14–2 and an ERA of 2.54 while starting only 23 games in the Reds' strike-shortened 108-game regular season.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1981.shtml 1981 Cincinnati Reds Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics – Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Despite that, the Reds finished second in the [[National League West]] in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|both halves of the season]], making them ineligible to compete in the postseason despite having the best overall record in baseball.

==Rivalries==
The Big Red Machine's archrival were the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The two teams often competed for the [[NL West]] division title and finished either first or second in every year from 1970 through 1979 with the one exception being 1971. Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said, "I don't think there's a rivalry like ours in either league. The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers' natural rivals, but I don't think the feeling is there anymore. It's not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers." The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central. However, they did face one another in the [[1995 NLDS]], with the Reds sweeping the Dodgers in three games.

The Big Red Machine was also part of the rivalry with the two [[Phillies–Pirates rivalry|Pennsylvania teams]]. All of the Reds' four pennants in the 1970s came against these teams (Pittsburgh Pirates in 1970, 1972, and 1975, and Philadelphia Phillies in 1976). In 1979, [[Pete Rose]] added to the notion of the Big Red Machine being part of the rivalry when he signed with the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and helped them win their first World Series championship in {{wsy|1980}}.
