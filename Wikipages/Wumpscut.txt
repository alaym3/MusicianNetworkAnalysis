'''Wumpscut''' (stylised as ''':wumpscut:''') is an [[electro-industrial]] music project from [[Germany]]. It was founded in May 1991 by [[Bavaria]]n [[disc jockey]] Rudolf "Rudy" Ratzinger (born June 3, 1966).

== History ==
Rudy Ratzinger is the creative force behind Wumpscut, occasionally employing the help of guest artists (such as Aleta Welling, P·A·L, Selene etc.), although such collaborations were minimal in scope.<ref name="culture_shock_2">{{cite journal |last1=Lindner |first1=Petra |title=Interview:Wumpscut |journal=Culture Shock |date=1996 |issue=2 |pages=25–27 |publisher=Genocide Project |location=Hackensack, NJ |language=English |issn=1093-1651 }}</ref> Ratzinger cites the influence of such bands as [[Leæther Strip]] as his reason for making the transfer from DJing to recording music: "I was a DJ for several years and was tired of offering the audience only alien stuff. The first Leæther Strip works were responsible for trying something on my own."<ref name="aracnet.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.aracnet.com/~jester/interview/wumpscut.interview.html | title = Interview with :Wumpscut: - conducted by Kevin Congdon - 5/97 | date = 5 January 2004 | website = Sonic Boom | publisher = Chris Christian | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110912000309/http://www.aracnet.com:80/~jester/interview/wumpscut.interview.html | archive-date = 12 September 2011}}</ref>

First works performed by Wumpscut dates back to the early 1990s when Rudy Ratzinger started to play music in Bavarian club houses and in Southern Germany. In a 1997 interview, Rudy Ratzinger reveals that "Pornography" and "War Combattery" were his first two songs in EBM, those two four-minute songs are to be found on ''Defcon'', the first demo issued by Wumpscut in late 1991.<ref name="aracnet.com"/> Yet, only "Pornography" was picked for reappearance on ''[[Blutkind]]'' (although a remix of War Combattery surfaced on the Mesner Tracks re-release EP which was released before). According to Rudy, "War Combattery" was a great hit in club houses: "[It] was a very big success in the clubs in Southern Germany."
    
The release of the song "Soylent Green", which is named after the [[Soylent Green|1973 movie]] and also contains [[Sampling (music)|audio samples]] from the German dubbed version, first attracted attention to Wumpscut. Since its release in 1993, it has become a frequently played song at events and clubs in the [[Goth subculture|goth]] and [[industrial music|industrial]] [[subcultures]], in [[Germany]], [[UK]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thewritingdisorder.com/reviewsburton.html | title = Views + Reviews + Other Stuff: THE NEW CLASSIC INDUSTRIAL | first = Burton | last = Pressboard | date = Spring 2011 | website = TheWritingDisorder.com }}</ref>

Wumpscut produced elaborate box set releases including limited versions of [[CD]] or [[LP (format)|LP]] releases with additional and bonus material (bonus tracks, "liquid soylent" energy drinks, posters, pins, stickers, bags, flags, etc.). Wumpscut albums were reissued with variant artworks, remastering and track listings. Standalone merchandise such as [[baseball caps]], [[coffee mugs]] and [[t-shirts]] were also made available for purchase.

Rudy Ratzinger has to date released seventeen studio albums<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/wumpscut-returns-with-wuterich-us-release-imminent/ |title=Wumpscut returns with ‘Wüterich’ – various editions now available for ordering incl. vinyl ones |access-date=4 November 2016 | first = Bernard | last = Van Isacker | date = 4 March 2016 | work = Side-Line Music Magazine}}</ref> plus a number of compilations: demos, compilation tracks, and remixes from deleted singles and EPs. The sixteenth Wumpscut album, [[Wüterich]], released March 25, 2016 on the Metropolis label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stormingthebase.com/wumpscut-wuterich-cd/#oid=1002_2 |title=WUMPSCUT. WUTERICH. CD. |access-date=4 November 2016 | website = Storming the Base}}</ref> He released a "best of" album titled Innerfire on May 5, 2017, while also announcing that Wumpscut would no longer be producing or making any new music on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.

On 5 November 2020, a new album entitled "Fledermavs 303" was announced with the release of a teaser track through the Wumpscut page on Bandcamp,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wumpscut.bandcamp.com/album/fledermavs-303-teaser/ |title=Wumpscut - Fledermavs 303 |access-date=5 November 2020 |date=5 November 2020}}</ref> presumably implying that Rudy has returned to producing music again.

On 2 April 2021, a new album entitled "Fledermavs 303" was released.

== Record labels ==
Ratzinger started [[Vanity label|his own record label]], Beton Kopf Media, in 1995, used exclusively to release Wumpscut material to the European market.<ref name="culture_shock_2" /> In 1996, he started the label Mental Ulcer Forges which lapsed in the early 2000s, then relaunched in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=11502_0_2_0_C | title = Mental Ulcer Forges label resurrected | first = Bernard | last = Van Isacker | date = 26 January 2006 | work = Side-Line Music Magazine | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121002202043/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=11502_0_2_0_C | archive-date = 2 October 2012}}</ref> The label released albums by the following bands: Remyl, [[Noisex]], [[B-Ton-K]], Yendri and [[F/A/V]]. Rudy also managed the label Fleisskoma with Karl Kimmerl (B-Ton-K), which has released work by the electronic band [[Press to Transmit]].

== Live performance ==
Despite the project's popularity in the [[electro-industrial]] genre, Wumpscut is a studio-only project and never tours.  When asked for his reason behind this decision, Rudy commented: "I cannot come up to my self-set level."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/Wumpscut/ | title = :Wumpscut: | first = Marc | last = Urselli | date = 25 June 2005 | work = Chain D.L.K. | access-date = 20 January 2018}}</ref>
