==Career==

===1980s===
One of four children born in [[Venezuela]] to Italian immigrants,<ref name="Cordova"/> De Vita's family returned to [[Rome]], Italy when he was 3. The family moved back to [[Venezuela]] when De Vita was 13. Due to his upbringing in [[Rome]], Italy, De Vita learned Italian as his first language and did not learn Spanish until he returned to Venezuela at age 13. He later studied piano at the university level. In 1982, De Vita formed the group Icaro, which released one self-titled album in his homeland. Two years later, he released his first disc as a solo artist, simply titled ''[[Franco De Vita (album)|Franco De Vita]]'' (1984). The album spun off three Spanish-language hits: "Somos Tres", "No Hay Cielo", and  "Un Buen Perdedor". His 1986 in album ''[[Fantasía (Franco De Vita album)|Fantasía]]'' produced several more hits, including the title song and "Aquí Estás Otra Vez". "Sólo Importas Tú", taken from the album, was used as the theme song to the Spanish-language soap opera ''[[La Dama De Rosa]]''. He appeared in the end credits of every episode, performing the song at the piano.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Best of Franco De Vita|url=http://bestsongsever.com/franco-de-vita|access-date=2020-12-18|website=bestsongsever.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Franco de Vita song lyrics|url=https://www.cancioneros.com/lyrics/artist/12338/franco-de-vita|access-date=2020-12-18|website=CANCIONEROS.COM/LYRICS}}</ref> 

Seeking wider international exposure, De Vita moved to the [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] label for the 1988 album ''[[Al Norte del Sur]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p29075|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Franco De Vita|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|access-date=May 9, 2010}}</ref> The album showed his socially conscious, adult-oriented pop, particularly through the tunes "Te Amo" and "Louis". The latter song, about a daydreaming cabbie who idolizes [[The Beatles]], was promoted with a music video considered quite advanced for its time. De Vita's 1990 album ''[[Extranjero]]'' featured the song "No Basta", which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the United States Latin charts and won an [[MTV Video Music Award]].

===1990s===
Subsequent albums have included the live release ''[[En Vivo Marzo 16]]'' (1992); ''[[Voces a mi Alrededor]]'' in 1993; the acoustic-flavored ''[[Fuera de Este Mundo]]'' (1996); and 1999's world-beat inspired ''[[Nada Es Igual (Franco De Vita album)|Nada Es Igual]]''. He left Sony for the 2002 album ''[[Segundas partes también son buenas]]'', but returned to the label the following year.

===2000s===

His 2004 album ''[[Stop (Franco De Vita album)|Stop]]'' reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the United States Latin charts, spurred by the hits "Tú De Qué Vas" and "Si La Ves," the latter a collaboration with pop group [[Sin Bandera]]. That same year, he toured arenas in the United States on a co-headlining tour with [[Ricardo Montaner]], a fellow Argentine-Venezuelan songwriter. He also has recorded in Italian and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. As a songwriter, he has written songs for [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Chayanne]].

In 2005, an expanded edition of ''Stop'' was released, titled ''Stop + Algo Más'', that included remixes and live recordings, as well as ''No Sé Lo Que Me Das'', De Vita's first recording in English. The following year saw the release of ''[[Mil y Una Historias En Vivo]],'' a two-disc live album that also featured four studio tracks, including collaborations with [[Alejandro Fernández]] and [[Diego El Cigala]]. A DVD version was released simultaneously.

In 2007, De Vita collaborated on a single with [[reggaeton]] duo [[Wisin & Yandel]] called "Oye Donde Esta El Amor", which borrowed the chorus from his composition "Donde Esta El Amor." They released an updated version of "Un Buen Perdedor" that peaked at No. 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Latin Songs chart. In 2008, he re-recorded "Que No Muera La Esperanza" (originally featured on ''Voces A Mi Alrededor'') with Wisin & Yandel, as well as releasing a new studio album, [[Simplemente La Verdad]]. He was also presented with the [[ASCAP Latin Heritage Award]].<ref name="ascaplatin">{{cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/news-events/awards/latin-heritage-award#:~:text=Awarded%20to%20songwriters%20and%20composers,and%20enduring%20contributions%20to%20music.|title=ASCAP Latin Heritage Award|publisher=ASCAP|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>
