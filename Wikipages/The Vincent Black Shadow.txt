'''The Vincent Black Shadow''' (also known as '''TVBS''') is a Canadian [[alternative rock]] band that was signed to the Bodog record label in 2006 and to Beef Records in 2008. Originally consisting of [[Cassandra Ford]] on vocals, brothers Rob Kirkham on guitar, Anthony Kirkham on drums, and [[Nim Vind|Chris Kirkham]] on bass, with Mary Ancheta on keyboards. As of 2010, Nikki Hurst replaced Ford as lead vocalist when Ford expressed interest in taking a break to go to school. The new line up however remained the same and Ford decided to work on other musical projects minus the Kirkham brothers. The name is derived from the motorcycle of the same name, the [[Vincent Black Shadow]]. ''[[Fears in the Water]]'' was first released on July 11, 2006,<ref name="billboard.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865#/album/the-vincent-black-shadow/fear-s-in-the-water/782880 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125071119/http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865#/album/the-vincent-black-shadow/fear-s-in-the-water/782880 |archive-date=2010-11-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and their sophomore effort, ''[[El Monstruo (album)|El Monstruo]]'', on September 15, 2008.<ref name="auto"/> Their latest creation, an EP entitled "The Finest Crime" was released via iTunes on Valentine's Day 2011.

== History ==
The Vancouver quintet was formed by [[Cassandra Ford]] and Rob Kirkham. In 2000 the two met at a bar, becoming musical collaborators from then on. Kirkham then recruited his two brothers Chris and Anthony Kirkham. The brothers had extensive musical training from their father, a trumpet player for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Finally, Mary Ancheta joined the group later on. The band signed to the Bodog record label in 2006.  In 2007, ''The Vincent Black Shadow'' played on the [[Warped Tour 2007|Vans Warped Tour]] having 'rocked' it the previous year. The Vincent Black Shadow have also toured with Wednesday 13, Joan Jett, Halifax, [[Greeley Estates]], Bif Naked, Kosheen, and [[Snow Patrol]]. Following on they have also appeared on bills with Silverstein and Blessthefall among other bands. In August 2008 the band announced in an e-mail sent out to fans that they had parted ways with Bodog Music, and were releasing their sophomore effort ''[[El Monstruo (album)|El Monstruo]]'' through Beef Records on September 15, 2008. On December 8, 2008, the EP "[[Head In a Box (EP)|Head In a Box]]" was released on the band's official website as a digital only release. The songs included on ''[[Head In a Box (EP)|Head In a Box]]'' are B-sides from ''[[El Monstruo (album)|El Monstruo]]''. [[Cassandra Ford]] left the band in early 2010 and was replaced by vocalist Nikki Hurst,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Vincent-Black-Shadow/13276820774|title=The Vincent Black Shadow|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref> the band's original keyboard player.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865#/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125071119/http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865#/artist/the-vincent-black-shadow/771865 |archive-date=2010-11-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
