Having been raised in a music-loving family, her interest in singing comes mostly from her family. At the age of 10, she sang in a high school choir and began writing songs with her brother.<ref name="Hypebae"/> She attended Les Cours Sonou University and received a [[BA degree]] in international relations and political science. During her college years, she was often bullied by her classmates because of her age and appearance. To counter the feelings she experienced from being taunted, Ayra Starr turned to music. "I would listen to [[Nicki Minaj]] on my way to school, and I'd feel like the second Nicki Minaj."<ref name="Hypebae"/> Ayra Starr's mother was very supportive of her musical ambitions, and always encouraged her to pursue a singing career.<ref name="NME"/>

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style ===
Although musically diverse, Ayra Starr's sound has predominantly been categorized as [[Afropop]] and [[R&B]]. Her voice has been described in the media as "silky", "cozy", "delicate", "sturdy", "arresting" and "soulful", with music critics noting the dynamic nature of her range and emotional delivery.<ref name="Pulse"/><ref name="Floormag">{{cite news |last1=Chalamilla |first1=Karen |title=Ayra Starr Album Review: 19 & Dangerous {{!}} THE FLOOR MAG |url=https://www.thefloormag.com/post/ayra-starr-album-review-19-dangerous |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=The Floor Magazine |date=9 August 2021 |language=en}}</ref> Her lyrics are a mixture of English, [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]] and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], often exploring contemporary topics such as love, relationship, empowerment and freedom.<ref name="Rollingstone1"/>

With the release of her debut eponymous EP, some critics felt that her vocal technique bore a striking resemblance to [[Tems (singer)|Tems]]' musical style. In an interview with [[Cool FM Nigeria|Cool FM]], Ayra Starr spoke about comparisons to Tems: "I'm a young artist and Tems is an amazing musician, for people to compare me to such an amazing musician, it's a compliment and I'm honoured."<ref name="Cool FM NG">{{cite news |title=AYRA STARR SAYS IT'S A COMPLIMENT AND SHE'S HONOURED TO BE COMPARED TO TEMS. |url=https://www.coolfm.ng/news/editorial/tems-says-its-a-compliment-and-shes-honoured-to-be-compared-to-tems/ |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=Cool FM - Your Number One Hit Music Station ! |date=20 February 2021 |language=en}}</ref> Motolani Alake, in his review of the EP for ''Pulse'' wrote that "Ayra Starr isn't exactly a replica of Tems, but when she manipulates her vocals to stress the final syllable on words, sentences and cadences by flexing her [[octave]]s, she definitely sounds like Tems." Alake also opined that both artists are different and that "Tems can be more alternative while Starr is more Nigerian and more Afropop with more lamba in her soul."<ref name="Pulse"/> ''[[Schön! Magazine]]''{{'}}s Thandie Sibanda called the EP "a coming-of-age jukebox."<ref name="Schonmag"/> Karen Chalamilla of ''The Floor'' remarked that ''Ayra Starr'' "not only solidifies the singer/songwriter as a standout vocalist, but also serves as an acute window into her artistic sensibilities."<ref name="TheFloor2">{{cite news |last1=|first1= |title=EP Review: Ayra Starr {{!}} The Floor Mag |url=https://www.thefloormag.com/post/ep-review-ayra-starr |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=The Floor Magazine |date=22 January 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In a review for ''19 & Dangerous'', Oris Aigbokhaevbolo of ''Music In Africa'' described Starr as an evolving artist and praised her singing abilities, adding that it's clear she "can work across genres while not quite sounding like anybody else." ''19 & Dangerous'' retains the Afropop-R&B sound of her previous record, but it also incorporates influences from genres such as [[neo-soul]], [[Jazz]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]].<ref name="MusicInAfrica">{{cite news |last1=Aigbokhaevbolo |first1=Oris |title=19 and Dangerous: Ayra Starr unifies alté and mainstream Afrobeats |url=https://www.musicinafrica.net/magazine/19-and-dangerous-ayra-starr-unifies-alte-and-mainstream-afrobeats |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=Music In Africa |date=7 August 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Ayra Starr grew up in a musically inclined family. She considers her mother, a former singer and her brother Dami, a guitarist and songwriter as her earliest inspirations for her interest in a music career.<ref name="eighteenmag"/> Growing up between Bénin and Nigeria, she was exposed to different cultures that influenced her perspective on life and her personality. Ayra Starr and Dami began writing songs from a very young age under the tutelage of their mother and aunt. She had wanted to make a real career out of singing since age 10 but her father encouraged her to complete her education first.<ref name="Rollingstone1">{{cite news |last1=Conteh |first1=Mankaprr |title=The Sharp and Swift Ascent of Ayra Starr |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/arya-star-interview-1211965/ |access-date=12 September 2021 |work=Rolling Stone |date=13 August 2021}}</ref>

In her interviews for local and international media, she stated that throughout her childhood, she had a wide range of musical influences, including [[2Face Idibia]], [[Wande Coal]], [[Angélique Kidjo]], [[Lijadu Sisters]] and [[Tope Alabi]], and in college, [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]] and [[Tiwa Savage]]. She credited [[Shakira]] as her biggest influence vocally along with [[Beyoncé]], [[Rihanna]] and [[Miley Cyrus]]: "It was just the power I would feel listening to their music. We didn't get a lot of Nigerian female singers singing strongly about things like them, not as we do now." Lyrically, she admires [[Aṣa]] and has said that she "wrote so beautifully [and] was one of one of those people [she] would listen to just to learn how to write properly."<ref name="TLBF">{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Andrew |title=On the Rise: Ayra Starr |url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/ayra-starr-on-the-rise |access-date=12 September 2021 |work=[[The Line of Best Fit]] |language=en}}</ref>
