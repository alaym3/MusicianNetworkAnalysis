'''Vola''' (stylized as '''VOLA''') are a Danish [[progressive metal]] band formed in [[Copenhagen]] in 2006. Having gone through a number of lineup changes earlier in their career, the band currently consists of three Danes, Asger Mygind (vocals and guitars), Martin Werner (keyboards) and Nicolai Mogensen (bass guitars); and one [[Sweden|Swede]], Adam Janzi (drums).<ref name="Stargazed">{{Cite web|url = https://stargazed.net/interviews/interview-with-asger-mygind-guitar-and-vocals-of-the-danish-progrockband-vola/|title = Interview with Asger Mygind, Guitar and Vocals of the Danish progrockband VOLA.|first = Patrik|last = Nilsson|publisher = Stargazed Magazine|date = 11 October 2018|accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=14 September 2019|title=Dansk band stormer frem i udlandet: 'Vi har haft det ret vildt over, hvor stærkt det pludselig gik'|url=https://www.dr.dk/musik/dansk-band-stormer-frem-i-udlandet-vi-har-haft-det-ret-vildt-over-hvor-staerkt-det-pludselig|access-date=13 September 2020|website=DR|language=da-DK}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins (2006–2012) ===
The band was formed by vocalist and guitarist Asger Mygind and some friends, and coalesced into a stable lineup in 2006. The band self-released their first EP, ''Homesick Machinery'', in 2008,<ref name="Stargazed"/> which featured Mygind, guitarist Niels Dreijer, bassist Jeppe Bloch, Martin Werner on keyboards and Niklas Scherfig on drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.discogs.com/VOLA-Homesick-Machinery/release/5156780|title =  VOLA – Homesick Machinery|publisher = [[Discogs]]|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref> A single, "Glasswork", was also released on 22 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/616d1efd-15cd-4459-9a2c-2454754442ce|title = Release group "Glasswork" by VOLA|publisher = [[MusicBrainz]]|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.discogs.com/VOLA-Glasswork/release/10923302|title =  VOLA – Glasswork|publisher = [[Discogs]]|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref>

After the first EP, there were some lineup changes, with Bloch and Scherfig replaced by Nicolai Mogensen and Felix Ewert, respectively.<ref name="Bloodstock">{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloodstock.uk.com/events/boa-2018/bands/vola|title = Band Profile for VOLA|publisher = [[Bloodstock Open Air]]|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="Vola">{{Cite web|url = https://www.volaband.com/pages/bio|title = Bio|publisher = VOLA|accessdate = 12 September 2020}}</ref> The new lineup recorded a second EP, ''Monsters'', which was self-released by the band in 2011. This EP consists of four tracks characterised by a mix of [[progressive rock]] and [[djent]] styles,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://rockfreaks.net/albums/4610|title = VOLA - Monsters EP|publisher = Rockfreaks.net|date = 17 January 2012|accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref> the latter of which was produced thanks to the use of [[seven-string guitar]]s.<ref name="Bloodstock"/> The band went on a short five-date tour of their home country to promote the EP,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://volaband.com/|title = Tour|publisher = VOLA|accessdate = 15 June 2019|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120415094309/http://volaband.com/|archivedate = 15 April 2012}}</ref> after which Dreijer left the band, leaving them as a four-piece, with Mygind taking over sole responsibility for vocals and guitars, and Mogensen handling backing vocals when they play live.<ref name="Stargazed"/>

=== ''Inmazes'' (2015–2017) ===
On 2 February 2015, VOLA self-released their first album ''Inmazes''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.discogs.com/VOLA-Inmazes/release/6992506|title =  VOLA – Inmazes|publisher = [[Discogs]]|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref> A video was released for the first single, "Gutter Moon" in August 2016, the band having previously released a lyric video for "Starburn".<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.loudersound.com/news/vola-issue-animated-gutter-moon-video|title = Vola issue animated Gutter Moon video|first = Scott|last = Munro|publisher = [[Prog (magazine)|Prog magazine]]|date = 12 August 2016|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref> The album was later given a physical release on 16 September 2016 by [[Mascot Label Group]].<ref>{{Cite web|language = German|url = https://metal-heads.de/news/vola-inmazes-veroeffentlichung-im-september/|title = VOLA – "Inmazes" Veröffentlichung im September|date = 6 August 2016|publisher = Metal-heads.de|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> According to Mygind the lyrical themes on ''Inmazes'' relate to entrapment:<ref name="Bloodstock"/> {{quote|text=The album tries to capture this feeling of being trapped in mental mazes and not being able to fully experience happiness, basically. How is this struggle visualized in your own mind and how do your surroundings react to the behaviour caused by it.}}

On 2 June 2017, the band released their ''October Session'' EP, featuring new acoustic versions of two songs from ''Inmazes'' ("Gutter Moon" and "Stray the Skies"), with a video being produced for the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.sonicabuse.com/vola-release-october-session/|title = Vola Release 'October Session'|publisher = SonicAbuse.com|date = 2 June 2017|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref>

To promote ''Inmazes'', the band embarked on a European tour for the first time, supporting [[Katatonia]] on their Fallen Hearts Over Europe tour, alongside the Icelandic band [[Agent Fresco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://distortedsoundmag.com/katatonia-reveal-european-tour-supports/|title = Katatonia reveal European tour supports|first = James|last = Weaver|publisher = Distorted Sound Magazine|date = 8 August 2016|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> Drummer Ewert was busy with other commitments and was therefore unable to take part in the tour, so the band hired Simen Sandnes from the band Arkentype as a temporary replacement.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://theprogspace.com/interview-with-simen-sandnes/|title = Interview with Simen Sandnes|publisher = The Progspace|date = 21 October 2016|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> It was subsequently announced on 22 August 2017 that Ewert had amicably left the band on a permanent basis, to focus on other projects. His replacement was revealed to be the Swedish drummer Adam Janzi,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/volaband/posts/we-would-like-to-welcome-adam-janzi-as-the-new-drummer-in-vola-we-have-had-a-won/10159248841315054/|title = We would like to welcome Adam Janzi as the new drummer in VOLA.|author = VOLA|publisher = [[Facebook]]|date = 22 August 2017|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> who had previously played with The Drake Equation.<ref name="Bloodstock"/>

[[File:Asger Mygind live at Circolo Mu, Parma - September 21st, 2019.jpg|thumb|Frontman Asger Mygind live in [[Parma]] in 2019]]
VOLA's second album, ''Applause of a Distant Crowd'', was released on 12 October 2018, and was considered something of a departure from ''Inmazes'', with less emphasis on the heaviness of the first album, and greater use of electronics,<ref name="Sputnikmusic">{{Cite web|url = https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/78140/VOLA-Applause-of-a-Distant-Crowd/|title = VOLA - Applause of a Distant Crowd|publisher = [[Sputnikmusic]]|date = 12 October 2018|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="Metalitalia">{{Cite web|language = Italian|url = https://metalitalia.com/album/vola-applause-of-a-distant-crowd/|title = VOLA – Applause Of A Distant Crowd|first = Marco|last = Gallarati|date = 5 October 2018|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> a process defined as "natural" by Asger Mygind:<ref name="Louder">{{Cite web|url = https://www.loudersound.com/news/vola-announce-new-album-applause-of-a-distant-crowd|title = Vola announce new album Applause Of A Distant Crowd|first = Scott|last = Munro|publisher = [[Prog (magazine)|Prog magazine]]|date = 7 August 2018|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> {{quote|text=I was in a very different place mentally while writing the lyrics for ''Inmazes''. I'm definitely in a happier place now.
It was actually a relief to be able to have a wider range of awareness for this record. I think our songs develop in the most natural way if I let my emotional response to the music dictate what the lyrics should be about rather than following any kind of plan.
This time the emotions were mostly tied to observations I've made about the outside world.

== Musical style and influences ==
On their first album ''Inmazes'', VOLA combined the typical sounds of [[progressive metal]] and [[electronic music]], creating songs with [[odd time signature]]s, complex [[riff]]s and catchy and melodic choruses, with the cover banner drawing comparisons to [[Pink Floyd]], [[Rammstein]] and [[Meshuggah]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://distortedsoundmag.com/album-review-inmazes-vola/|title = ALBUM REVIEW: Inmazes – VOLA|first = Laura|last = McCarthy|publisher = Distorted Sound Magazine|date = 13 September 2016|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/vola-inmazes-album-review|title = Vola - Inmazes album review|first = Kris|last = Needs|publisher = [[Prog (magazine)|Prog magazine]]|date = 17 August 2016|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref> As explained by Mygind, even the name of the band (which was chosen by previous bassist Jeppe Bloch) reflects their sound in that they "try to do [their] choruses very majestic and grandios [sic]".<ref name="Stargazed"/>

With the release of their second album ''Applause of a Distant Crowd'', the band expanded their musical palette to incorporate a more [[progressive rock]] sound and a greater use of electronics, with progressive metal essentially limited to the songs "Smartfriend" and "Whaler".<ref name="Sputnikmusic"/><ref name="Metalitalia"/><ref>{{Cite web|language = Italian|url = http://www.spaziorock.it/recensione.php?&id=applause-of-a-distant-crowd-vola-recensione-2018|title = VOLA – Applause Of A Distant Crowd|first = Giovanni|last = Ausoni|publisher = SpazioRock|date = 5 October 2018|accessdate = 17 September 2019}}</ref>

Amongst their influences the band have named [[Opeth]], [[Porcupine Tree]], [[Devin Townsend]], [[Soilwork]], [[Meshuggah]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Ulver]],<ref name="Bloodstock"/> and [[Mew (band)|Mew]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.prog-sphere.com/interviews/vola-interview/|title = VOLA: Mental Mazes|first = Niko|last = Savić|publisher = ProgSphere|date = 23 March 2015|accessdate = 13 September 2020}}</ref> Mygind is a big fan of British musician and producer [[Steven Wilson]], choosing his top ten favourite songs for [[Prog (magazine)|Prog]] magazine in November 2018.<ref name="Steven Wilson"/>
