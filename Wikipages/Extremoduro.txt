'''Extremoduro''' ({{IPA-es|e(k)stɾemoˈðuɾo}}) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[hard rock]] band from [[Plasencia]], [[Extremadura]]. The band is led by [[Roberto Iniesta]], also known as "Robe", who is often referred as "El rey de Extremadura" (The king of Extremadura). The name Extremoduro is a pun on the band's home region in western Spain, Extremadura, and roughly translates as "extremely tough",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAcEAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard+extremoduro+extremely+tough&pg=PA69|title=Billboard|date=17 June 1996|last1=Nielsen Business Media|first1=Inc}}</ref> "rough edge" or, more literally, “hard extreme”.

The band was created in 1987 and is regarded as one of the most influential bands of the Spanish hard rock scene, besides being a complete symbol for their region. Influenced by the [[Spanish literature]], Iniesta's lyrics are often described as rude street poetry, with frequent allusions to drugs, sex and self-destruction.

Well-known songs by Extremoduro include "So payaso", "Golfa", "Salir", "Extremaydura", "Puta" and "Jesucristo García". The highest moment in the band's career was probably reached with the release of their album ''[[Agila (album)|Agila]]'', which was awarded a prize for best video in the first edition of the Spanish Music Awards in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiosdelamusica.com/dyn/historia/lista_ganadores.php?id_seccion=2&id_edicion=1&id_categoria=77#cat_77|title=Premios de la musica 1997|language=es|access-date=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tmVsMRMs?url=http://www.premiosdelamusica.com/dyn/historia/lista_ganadores.php?id_seccion=2&id_edicion=1&id_categoria=77#cat_77|archive-date=27 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It is considered one of the best Spanish bands ever by several music magazines.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.es/discs/view/extremoduro-20-anos-discografia-completa Extremoduro en RollingStone.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111075910/http://rollingstone.es/discs/view/extremoduro-20-anos-discografia-completa |date=11 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5iIhOb1vjQUHW1tD_HIg0dXeCUipA?docId=1635088]</ref> They were ranked number 6 on [[Rolling Stone]]'s "50 Greatest Spanish rock bands".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rollingstone.es/noticias/view/especial-rs-los-50-mejores-grupos-de-rock-espanol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923001703/http://rollingstone.es/noticias/view/especial-rs-los-50-mejores-grupos-de-rock-espanol |archive-date=23 September 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In December 2019, the band announced a farewell tour of eight cities for May and June 2020.<ref>{{cite news | title = Extremoduro ofrecerá una gira de despedida en 2020 | newspaper = [[El País]] | language = es | date = 2019-12-19 | url = https://elpais.com/cultura/2019/12/19/actualidad/1576768150_057113.html?ssm=TW_CM | access-date =  2019-12-19}}</ref> However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] the tour was first postponed to autumn 2020, and finally cancelled. The band is officially disbanded. 
== History ==
=== The beginnings (1987 to 1991) ===
[[File:Extremoduro logo.svg|thumb|Extremoduro's logo.]]
[[Roberto Iniesta]] (also known as "Robe") establishes the band in the summer of 1987 in [[Plasencia]], the second most important city of [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]], a province of the west of Spain. Previously, in 1983, he had formed the band ‘[[Dosis Letal]]’ with Zósimo "Zosi" Pascual, with whom he composed the song "La Carrera",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoy.es/pg060425/prensa/noticias/Caceres/200604/25/HOY-CAC-052.html|title=El acusado de emparedar a su hermana tocó y compuso canciones con Robe Iniesta|date=25 April 2006|language=es}}</ref> that would later come to be the penultimate track of Extremoduro's 1996 disc [[Agíla]].

Extremoduro were initially formed by Robe, as vocalist and guitarist, "Chico" on the bass and "Miguelin" on the drums. This initial set-up lasted just a few months, after which Robe decided to reconfigure the group and found Salo and Louis "von Fanta" to replace Kaito and William respectively. With this new dynamic in place, and with the difficulty they faced recording an album, they decided to sell vouchers to their acquaintances (at a thousand [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] each) that would entitle each of them to a copy of the demo tape after it had been produced.<ref name="RS69">{{Cite journal|title=[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Spain nº140]]|journal=Rolling Stone|page=69|date=June 2011|issn=	1575-1554|language=es}}</ref> They sold 250 of these "coupons" (whose buyers are credited in the finished production). After this, they produced 1000 copies of this first "demo" which already contained some of the quintessential anthems of the group, such as "Extremaydura" or "Jesucristo Garcia"; the collection is ''[[Rock transgresivo#Rock transgresivo (Demo tape) (1989)|Rock transgresivo]]''.

The distribution of this transgressive musical offering of rock began to attract attention inside and outside their home region of [[Plasencia]]; it was so well received that the spanish television program Plastic<ref name="RS69"/> invited them for a live performance. They were then selected for the national final of the [[Yamaha]] trophy in which they finished third.<ref name="RS70">{{Cite journal|title=[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Spain nº140]]|journal=Rolling Stone|page=70|date=June 2011|issn=	1575-1554|language=es}}</ref>

It was in this final that [[Avispa Music]] noticed them and began negotiations for the release of their debut professionally recorded album, ''[[Rock transgresivo#Tú en tu casa, nosotros en la hoguera (1989)|Tú en tu casa, nosotros en la hoguera]]''.<ref name="RS70"/> The album was recorded that summer, containing the same songs as ''Rock Transgresivo'' (in addition to "''Amor Castúo''"). The group often expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome and, in fact, in 1994 it was remixed and partially re-recorded to be reissued under another name.<ref name="RS70"/>

At the end of this deal-making 1989, Robe restructured the band again: he switched to the role of supporting guitarist, to focus on the delivery of the vocals. In this way, Salo became lead guitarist and Carlos "Dirty" took up the vacancy for a bassist. In 1991, a deal was struck with Wasp to record the second album, but due to the poor expectations that the label offered, they decided to break this contract and sign with [[Pasión-Área Creativa]],<ref name="RS70"/> like [[Avispa Music]], an independent company, but this time with better conditions. They record a second album with them in [[Madrid]] ''[[Somos unos animales]]'', published in July 1991.

With the collaboration of vocalist and guitarist Madrid [[Rosendo Mercado]] (ex-[[Leño]]) on the songs " ''La canción de los oficios'' " (voice) and " ''Perro Callejero'' " (guitar), they themselves define it as the beginning of the true sound of Extremoduro that the band calls "transgressive Rock."

In this first period, drugs – especially heroin – were the inseparable 'other member' of the group. As such, the group's live performances (usually considered their greatest asset) were unpredictable to say the least.<ref name="RS70"/> Though they now had presence in the Spanish rock scene, it was said that Extremoduro's live gigs were either "unforgettable or a disaster." The group began to sell a lot and [[Pasión-Área Creativa]] proved too small for their ambitions, which together with other disputes (royalties not being paid for this LP), lead to them signing with [[Dro Records|DRO]] in 1991,<ref name="RS70"/> giving them better distribution and promotion, and the means to the success that later years brought.

===Signing up with DRO Atlantic===
[[Dro Records|DRO]] (Discos Radioactivos Organizados) was a record company founded in the '80s as Spain's first independent record label by members of the [[Aviator Dro]] techno pop outfit. When Extremoduro got signed up with them in 1992, it was one of the largest independent labels in Spain. However, it was in the process of being sold off to [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music International]], one of the most important multinational actors in the music business. Although the label has changed its name (DRO-Atlantic, DRO East-West, Warner Music España...), Extremoduro has published all of its albums through them since signing up. Indeed, they have re-edited their two previous albums with DRO.

In 1992, the third studio album came to be; the first within their contract with DRO, [[Deltoya]]. This had its origin in a spin-off project from the band, of Robe's: Extremozoide, although circumstances would cause this to be published as another album of Extremoduro's. The album has a more erotic—and less social—theme than the previous discs, and most of the lyrics are adaptations of the poems by Kiko "Luna Creciente", Tomás Rodríguez (the band's manager) and [[Manolo Chinato]]. The album includes the voices and participation of other artists, such as Argentinian singer and guitarist [[Ariel Rot]] in "Volando solo". It would not be the last time that Robe hatched upon a project that was independent of the group, nor the last time that this independence would prove to be short lived.

1993 is a crucial year in the history of Extremoduro. For starters, they cross paths with [[Iñaki Antón|Iñaki "Uoho" Antón]] (then guitarist of [[Platero y Tú]]) in [[Bilbao]] and together with other musicians start a new project: La [[Pedrá]].<ref name="RS70"/> Robe is responsible for voice and guitar, Uoho for a second guitar, keyboards and percussion, and they join Dieguillo (bassist for Quemando Ruedas, Cicatriz, Antisocial), Gary (drums for Quattro Clavos) and Selu (from [[Reincidentes]]) with his saxophone and [[cante jondo]]. In August, they take to the studio to record a half-hour of music but it is highly experimental and discontinuous and the label refuses to back it, as it is seen as too risky. They would have to wait two more years for it to be sold commercially. Still, thanks to the stability that DRO gives the band, Robe is able to start a side project to Extremoduro in [[Barcelona]]: The Q3. This gives space to accommodate the ideas that did not work within Extremoduro. Jorge "el Moja" is on drums, Eugene on the guitar, Miguel Ferreras on bass and Ramón Sogas "Mon", on the other bass.

Meanwhile, drugs continue to permeate Extremoduro, and throughout the tour there are disagreements in the band that lead to its break up. After being part of the band since recording the demo, and three albums, drummer Luis "von Fanta", bassist Carlos "el Sucio" and guitarist Salo left the group. Robe, not about to see the band go down the pan, or abandon their dreams, replaces the disbanded members of Extremoduro with members of Q3, which marks the end of this project, but saves Extremoduro. It was with this collection of musicians that recorded the fourth album: [[¿Dónde están mis amigos?]], Which continues the style begun with Deltoya and confirms their reputation as one of the most important groups of Spanish rock. However, they remain unknown to the public at large due to their political incorrectness and raw style. The album was recorded in autumn 1993 and was published later that year. While all his works hitherto had been self-produced, this is the first record for which they hired a professional producer: Ventura Rico. This LP is considered the most personal and intimate of the band. This is probably due to the disintegration of the group, because now the other musicians are employees in a band that is directed by Robe himself. [[Fernando Madina]] from [[Reincidentes]] takes part in the song Pepe Botika (¿Dónde están mis amigos?).
