But, I ran it by my cousin and kind of had his green light, and I got to a point where I just thought, even if it‚Äôs not perfect it‚Äôs okay because it‚Äôs still my experience.‚Äù<ref name=":0" />

The album art of her debut album features a photograph taken of Bedouine on the black-and-white tiled floor of the console room outside Gus Seyffert's studio, where she recorded the album.<ref name=":0" />

=== ''Bird Songs of a Killjoy'' ===
In March 2019, Bedouine announced her second full-length album, ''Bird Songs of a Killjoy'', which was released June 21, 2019.<ref name="consequenceofsound">{{cite web |last1=Corcoran |first1=Nina |title=Bedouine announces new album, Bird Songs of a Killjoy, shares "Bird": Stream |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/03/bedouine-announces-new-album-bird-songs-of-a-killjoy-shares-bird-stream/ |publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] |accessdate=June 17, 2019}}</ref><ref name="uproxx">{{cite web |last1=Gilke |first1=Chloe |title=Bedouine Announced Her New Album 'Bird Songs of a Killjoy' With The Lush, Cinematic 'Bird' |url=https://uproxx.com/music/bedouine-bird-songs-of-a-killjoy-album/ |publisher=[[Uproxx]] |accessdate=June 17, 2019}}</ref> Her second record is influenced by her own wanderlust, displacement, and curiosity. It is a soundtrack to Spring blossom, to warm air on skin, to the concept of possibility. The twelve songs on ''Bird Songs of a Killjoy'' contain several references to birds, which initially panicked Azniv. ‚ÄúOh no! What a clich√©!‚Äù she recalls. "But I have to step back and take a breath. These songs are just where I landed, and that's OK." The album is produced by Gus Seyffert ([[Beck]], [[Norah Jones]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spacebombgroup.com/artists/bedouine |website=Spacebomb}}</ref>
