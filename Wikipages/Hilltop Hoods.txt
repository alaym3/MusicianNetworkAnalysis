'''Hilltop Hoods''' are an Australian hip hop group that formed in 1991 in [[Blackwood, South Australia|Blackwood]], [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. They are regarded as pioneers of the "[[larrikin]]-like" style of [[Australian hip hop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://junkee.com/longform/australian-hip-hop|title=The History Of Australian Hip-Hop In 19 Essential Tracks|website=Junkee}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/features/hilltop-hoods-mc-pressure/I6k0NzY5ODs/22-10-14/|title=/|website=The Music}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beat.com.au/hilltop-hoods/|title=Hilltop Hoods|date=17 November 2011}}</ref> The group was founded by [[Suffa]] (Matthew David Lambert) and [[MC Pressure|Pressure]] (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first [[extended play]], ''[[Back Once Again]]'', in 1997 and have subsequently released eight studio albums, two "restrung" albums and three DVDs.

Six of their eight albums have peaked at number&nbsp;one on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Charts]], recently setting the record for most No. 1 Albums by an Australian band or group: ''[[The Hard Road]]'' (2006), ''[[State of the Art (Hilltop Hoods album)|State of the Art]]'' (2009), ''[[Drinking from the Sun]]'' (2012), ''[[Walking Under Stars]]'' (2014), ''[[Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung]]'' (2016) and ''[[The Great Expanse]]'' (2019). Three tracks have reached the top&nbsp;10 on the ARIA Singles Chart—"[[Chase That Feeling]]" (2009), "[[I Love It (Hilltop Hoods song)|I Love It]]", featuring [[Sia Furler|Sia]] (2011) and "Higher", featuring James Chatburn (2015) — while a further two tracks — "[[Cosby Sweater]]" (2014) and "[[1955 (song)|1955]]" (2016) — reached the top&nbsp;5. "1955", featuring [[Montaigne (musician)|Montaigne]] & Tom Thum, peaked at number 2 in the Australian charts.

Hilltop Hoods have toured both in Australia and overseas, including playing at music festivals: [[T in the Park]], [[Oxegen]], the [[Big Day Out]], [[Clipsal 500]], [[Southbound (festival)|Southbound]], [[The Great Escape (festival)|The Great Escape]], [[Splendour in the Grass]], [[Bassinthegrass]], [[Groovin' the Moo|Groovin' The Moo]], [[Falls Festival]], [[Pyramid Rock Festival]], [[Rollercoaster (Australian festival)|Rollercoaster]], Come Together Festival and [[Make Poverty History]].

The band are one of the most recurrent artists in the history of the [[Triple J Hottest 100]], with 21 songs voted into the annual countdowns since their first appearance in 2003. At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2006]] they won "Best Independent Release" and "Best Urban Album" for ''The Hard Road''. In [[ARIA Music Awards of 2007|2007]], they won "Best Urban Album" for their [[remix album]], ''[[The Hard Road: Restrung]]'' (2007). They won the same category in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009|2009]] for ''State of the Art'' and in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2012|2012]] for ''Drinking from the Sun''. In 2009, Debris also won "[[ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year|Engineer of the Year]]" for his work on ''State of the Art''. The band received their seventh ARIA award in 2014 when ''Walking Under Stars'' won in the Best Urban Album category at the 28th ARIA Awards.

==History==

===1987–2001: Formation and early years===
Two of Hilltop Hoods' founders first met in 1987 when MC [[Suffa]] (aka Matthew David Lambert) and [[MC Pressure|Pressure]] (Daniel Howe Smith) attended [[Blackwood High School]] in [[Eden Hills, South Australia|Eden Hills]] – a suburb of Adelaide.<ref name="Ankeny">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic | pure_url=yes | class=artist | id=p821212 }} | title=Hilltop Hoods | last = Ankeny | first = Jason | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]] | work = [[Allmusic]] | access-date = 5 December 2012 }}</ref> In 1991 they joined up with DJ Next (Ben John Hare) through a mutual friend and formed an [[Australian hip hop]] group.<ref name="Ankeny"/> Their name was supplied by fellow local MC Flak (from Cross Bred Mongrels) – the suburb of Blackwood is known by locals as the Hilltop. The band's influences include American hip hop artists: [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[KRS-One]], [[Gang Starr]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

At live shows DJ Next was the group's [[Disc jockey|DJ]], for recording he contributed [[audio engineer]]ing and all the [[scratching]]/[[turntablism]] on their early works.<ref name="Ankeny"/> He regularly competed in the local [[DMC World DJ Championships|DMC World DJ Championships (DMC)]] tournaments, winning the South Australian [[DMC World DJ Championships|DMC]] championships multiple times. Hilltop Hoods recorded a demo, ''Highlanders'', which was released on [[compact cassette|cassette tape]] only. As well as Pressure and Suffa on vocals, the group included MC Summit aka DJ Sum-1, but he did not appear on later Hilltop Hoods work.

The group's first official release, in 1997, was a vinyl-only, seven-track extended play, ''[[Back Once Again]]''. Production was handled by DJ Debris (Barry John M Francis), [[turntablism]] and [[audio engineer]]ing by DJ Next, vocals by Pressure and Suffa. The third track, "Shades of Grey", features Debris with a verse, and was co-written by Francis, Hare, Lambert and Smith.<ref name="APRAShades">{{cite web | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) &#124; [[Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society]] (AMCOS) | title = 'Shades of Grey' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Shades%20of%20Grey | access-date = 5 December 2012 }}</ref> Fifth track, "Mankind Must Suffa" also features a guest verse from Quromystix (aka [[Quro]], Andrew Michael Bradley) – a member of Finger Lickin' Good and later the Fuglemen.

The group's debut studio album, ''[[A Matter of Time (Hilltop Hoods album)|A Matter of Time]]'', was released in 1999 on CD only. As with ''Back Once Again'', it is now unavailable for retail purchase. All [[scratching]]/[[turntablism]] is performed by DJ Next, a track, "Let Me Show You", has no vocals – solely showcasing his turntable skills.<ref name="ref-discogs-hth-mot">{{cite web | publisher = Discogs | title = Ben Hare Discography at Discogs | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/483085-Ben-Hare | access-date = 22 January 2016 }}</ref> American MC Bukue One (Tion Torrence) appears for a guest verse on "Deaf Can Hear".

In 2004 he moved to [[London]]. In 1999 Debris, who was also a member of the Cross Bred Mongrels, replaced Next and became the Hilltop Hoods' full-time DJ.

Hilltop Hoods founded the Certified Wise Crew – a hip-hop collaborative – with local groups Terra Firma, Cross Bred Mongrels and After Hours. Certified Wise Crew has since expanded to include MCs Trauma, Blockade, Kolaps, Flea, with [[Vents (musician)|Vents]] and [[Funkoars]] joining in later years. Hilltop Hoods received two nominations for the Hip Hop Act of the Year Award at the [[Dance Music Awards|Australian Dance Music Awards]] and again at the 3D World Music Awards in 2001 and 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/features/11167/ |title=Hilltop Hoods: Pressure in the Hilltop Hood|publisher=InTheMix.com.au|date=24 July 2003|last=Elles|first=Katie|access-date=20 May 2009}}</ref> In 2001 the group's second album, ''[[Left Foot, Right Foot]]'', was released with Lambert, Francis and M.

===2003–2007: ''The Calling'' and ''The Hard Road''===
On 22 September 2003, Hilltop Hoods released their third album, ''[[The Calling (Hilltop Hoods album)|The Calling]]'', which became a commercial breakthrough. In an interview after the release of their fourth album, Suffa revealed that ''The Calling'' was recorded on his mother's computer and the simplicity of their 'studio' is the reason why some of the music on the album is in [[monaural]] ('mono') sound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods 'The Calling' Album Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4KZ4sSwegk|website=delta769er on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|access-date=7 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=18 January 2010}}</ref>

''The Calling'' entered the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] in March 2004 and reached No.&nbsp;53 before exiting the top&nbsp;100 in September of the same year.<ref name="The ARIA Report – 29 Mar 2004">{{cite journal | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20040407-0000/Issue735.pdf | title = ARIA Report – 29th March 2004 | journal = ARIA Report | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | issue = 735 | date = 29 March 2004 | access-date = 6 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="The ARIA Report – 6 Sep 2004">{{cite journal | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20041020-0000/ISSUE758.pdf | title = ARIA Report – 6th September 2004 | journal = ARIA Report | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | issue = 758 | date = 6 September 2004 | access-date = 6 December 2012}}</ref> By December 2006 it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units,<ref name="ARIA Alb Cert 2006">{{Cite certification|region=Australia|type=album|certyear=2006| access-date = 6 December 2012 }}</ref> becoming the first Australian hip hop album to achieve platinum status.

"The Nosebleed Section" was ranked No.&nbsp;17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. Hilltop Hoods' chart and commercial success was a turning point in the Australian Hip Hop scene because it demonstrated widespread support for the genre that reached beyond an underground fan base.

On 1 April 2006, the group followed with their fourth album, ''[[The Hard Road]]'', which peaked at number&nbsp;one.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It was the first Australian hip hop album to do so.

Its video includes fellow members from the Certified Wise Crew – Cross Bred Mongrels, Terrafirma and Funkoars.

Following the success of The Hard Road Tour in early 2006, the Hilltop Hoods began their second national tour for the year, The Stopping All Stations Tour, which visited more regional areas of Australia as well as the capital cities. They were supported by Koolism and Mystro. Late that year, Hilltop Hoods released their third single from the album, "What a Great Night". The video shows the group at a club with camera shots panning up and down to reveal a new location. It used special effects and is one of the most expensive video clips for an Australian hip hop group, mirroring the group's rise in success and popularity. Also late in the year the band won the [[J Award]] for best album of the year from Triple J.<ref name="The J Award 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jaward/2006.htm|title=The J Award 2006|publisher=[[Triple J]]|access-date=20 May 2009}}</ref> They performed the [[Homebake]] Festival and [[Falls Festival]] before the end of the year.

It peaked at No.&nbsp;8 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AusCharts"/> Like its predecessor ''The Hard Road'', it took out "Best Urban Release" at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2007|ARIA Awards of 2007]], with the group going back-to-back in the category.<ref name="List of ARIA award winners"/> The lead single from the album "Recapturing the Vibe Restrung", its video clip was on high rotation on [[rage (TV program)|rage]] and [[Triple j tv|jtv]].

===2010–2017: ''Drinking from the Sun'' and ''Walking Under Stars''===
On 28 July 2010, Hilltop Hoods completed work on a zombie movie, ''Parade of the Dead'', that the group wrote, filmed, and starred in.<ref name="Brandle"/> Using the title from a ''State of the Art'' track, it was released on 22 October with the eponymous single.<ref name="Brandle">{{cite news | url = http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/artists/2010/07/28/hilltop-hoods-make-zombie-film | title = Hilltop Hoods make zombie film | work = [[The Music Network]] | first = Lars | last = Brandle | date = 28 July 2010 | access-date = 7 December 2012 }}</ref> Filmed mostly in Adelaide, the former [[Adelaide Gaol]] was used as a "key location".<ref name="Brandle"/>

In late September, the music video for "Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom" was published online. It featured numerous Australian hip-hop artists, including [[Drapht]], [[Urthboy]], Def Wish Cast, Dazastah, Layla, Maya Jupiter and Hunter. The band explained in the production notes for the video:

<blockquote>
Not only did we want to do something unifying, we also wanted to use the platform we have to promote artists that we think deserve more exposure. Of course, not everyone involved in the filmclip needs exposure, as many of the artists involved have huge followings in their own right. But having these artists involved in the filmclip just further serves to unify and consolidate the scene ... We need to point out that this is by no means a representation of every relevant artist involved in the culture past or present. It's more a cross-section of who we have contact with, who was available and so on.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods – Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr5SnlxIZCA&list=PLsHVXvOuM_F5wmp_KJopV_zqvb_inmJVA|website=Hilltop Hoods on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|access-date=5 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=20 September 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

In November 2012, Hilltop Hoods performed a live show on UStream and announced that the title of the group's next album would be ''[[Walking Under Stars]]''—this was then confirmed on the official Hilltop Hoods Twitter and Facebook pages, following their Best Urban Album win at the 2012 ARIA Awards ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods Announce 'Walking Under Stars'… New Album For Next Year?|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/hilltop-hoods-announce-walking-under-stars-new-album-for-next-year/|work=MusicFeeds.com.au|publisher=Music Feeds|access-date=9 December 2012|author=Kiel Egging|date=1 December 2012}}</ref> The band's Facebook post read:

<blockquote>
So it’s now one year to the day since we dropped 'I Love It' and started the 'Drinking from the Sun' journey. Thanks to everyone that’s supported us over the last 12 months, it’s been amazing. We hope you join us late next year for 'Walking Under Stars'.

The announcement corresponds with a sample on ''Drinking from the Sun'' that refers to a band writing with the clear intention of formulating enough material for two albums: "They were recording enough for two albums; that was premeditated." The sample appears on the track, "The Thirst Pt. 3 (Interlude)".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods – The Thirst Pt. 3 (Interlude) [Drinking From The Sun]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUCERIxLDBg|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|access-date=23 February 2013|author=Cozmey|date=22 April 2012}}</ref>

In April 2013, the Hilltop Hoods stated that the development of ''Walking Under Stars'' was "well underway", with the trio calling the album ''Drinking from the Sun'' "part two"—the latter received a double platinum sales certification in the same month. Additionally, American clothing company [[Zoo York (company)|Zoo York]] announced a partnership with the Hilltop Hoods in April 2013, in preparation for the brand's 20th-anniversary celebrations in 2014. Lambert explained: "We've always been fans of Zoo York, they understand hip hop culture, and that's why we can’t wait to work with them."<ref>{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: HILLTOP HOODS ALBUM GOES DOUBLE PLATINUM|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2013/04/18/exclusive-hilltop-hoods-album-goes-double-platinum/|work=TheMusic.com.au|publisher=Street Press Australia Pty Ltd|access-date=13 April 2014|author=Scott Fitzsimons|date=18 April 2013}}</ref>

As part of the songwriting process, Lambert spent a day researching the status of the handshake in countries such as Sweden and India.<ref name="Music" />

The album's first official single, "Won't Let You Down"—featuring Irish singer [[Maverick Sabre]]—was released on 27 June 2014. Writing for the Faster Louder website, Matt Shea revealed in early August that the first single was met with a mixed reaction from existing fans of the band: "While many loved it, plenty of Hoods fans at the very least declared it a radio friendly single that had little to do with hip-hop. Others outright disliked it." Lambert explained in media interviews during the week prior to the album's release that the song was recorded at the [[Red Bull]] Studios in both London, UK and New York City, US, while the lyrical content is about the partners of the band members and the difficulties of being in a relationship with touring musicians. The single's musical content features Italian singer [[Zucchero Fornaciari]] singing a rendition of [[Ph.D. (band)|Ph.D's]] hit "[[I Won't Let You Down (Ph.D. song)|I Won't Let You Down]]".<ref name="Music">{{cite web|author1=Stephanie Liew|title=Hilltop Hoods Take Us Through 'Walking Under Stars', Track By Track|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2014/08/06/hilltop-hoods-take-us-through-walking-under-stars,-track-by-track/|website=TheMusic.com.au|publisher=Street Press Australia Pty Ltd|access-date=8 August 2014|date=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Matt" />

Lambert explained that his announcement, a reaffirmation of the sentiment in "Speaking in Tongues", is "very important" to the band.<ref name="Gold" />

The band announced the release date for ''Walking Under Stars'' as 8 August 2014 in mid-July and, while the album is a Golden Era Records recording, Universal Music Australia acquired the exclusive licensing rights for the domestic market—Universal will also use the license to distribute the album in Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Benelux, while Golden Era continues its partnership with Fontana for the US release. ''Walking Under Stars'' was conceived before ''Drinking From the Sun'' was written and Lambert referred to the former as "a companion piece" in an August 2014 interview. Lambert also explained that "I'm a Ghost" is four-years-old, while a segment of "Brainbox" originally appeared on the 2012 Golden Era mixtape.<ref name="Matt">{{cite web|author1=Matt Shea|title=Hilltop Hoods: "Music is not a competition"|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/40205/Hilltop-Hoods-Music-is-not-a-competition|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|access-date=8 August 2014|date=5 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808130510/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/40205/Hilltop-Hoods-Music-is-not-a-competition|archive-date=8 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Across">{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods New Album 'Walking Under Stars'|url=http://acrosstheocean.com.au/news/hilltop-hoods-new-album-walking-uder-the-stars|website=Across The Ocean|publisher=Across The Ocean|access-date=8 August 2014|date=19 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Walking Under Stars Hilltop Hoods|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/walking-under-stars/id897515026|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|access-date=8 August 2014|date=August 2014}}</ref>

Similar to the band's previous album releases, numerous collaborators appear on ''Walking Under Stars''. Lambert explained on 5 August that "we [Hilltop Hoods] try to do it in the same room" when guest artists record and, for the seventh studio album, the band worked with Sabre, New Zealand soul singer Aaradhna, Brother Ali, [[Dan Sultan]], Drapht, Canadian voice-over artist Dave Pettitt and One Above, the Adelaide producer who also worked on ''Drinking from the Sun''.

''Walking Under Stars'' debuted in the number-one position of the ARIA album charts during the week beginning 11 August 2014, providing the band with their fourth chart-topping album since ''The Hard Road'' in April 2006.

===Hilltop Hoods Initiative===
In 2005 the annual "Hilltop Hoods Initiative" was established in association with Arts SA, made possible by a donation from the Hilltop Hoods. Valued at A$10,000 (originally $3000), the Hilltop Hoods initiative helped young and emerging South Australian hip-hop artists to manufacture and distribute a CD. The initiative also included two mentorship sessions with Hilltop Hoods' former manager, PJ Murton. It acknowledges the important role South Australian government assistance played in the development of the careers of the Hilltop Hoods. In 2009, the initiative became a national grant available to entry for any emerging Australian hip-hop artist who have not issued a professional album.<ref name="JJJ" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s2775615.htm|title=The Hilltop Hoods Initiative goes national|publisher=[[Triple J]]|date=18 December 2009|access-date=31 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="Pickup"/>

In a Hilltop Hoods newsletter, released on 4 December 2012, the group communicated the following announcement:

<blockquote>
In 2013 The Hilltop Hoods and APRA are teaming up again to give a career changing $10K to the most impressive emerging Hip Hop/Soul act in Australia. Aimed at helping fund the manufacturing and marketing of an album release, the grant is open to any act who hasn't yet released anything professionally. Applications will open in early 2013 along with details on how to enter.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}</blockquote>

===Golden Era Records===
Following its departure from the Obese record label, the group launched its own label in 2009, entitled Golden Era Records. The label's title is described by the band on the label website:

<blockquote>
To some people the golden era of Hip Hop was '94. Ask someone a little older and they’ll tell you Hip Hop’s renaissance was back in '88. Ask one of our revered pioneers and they’ll tell you that the golden era came and went three decades ago, before most of today’s Hip Hop heads were born. Whatever the case these so-called golden eras weren’t only defined by the music or the fashion – they were characterised by something less tangible – an atmosphere, a movement.

This label wasn’t established to release throw-back records; instead we hope to make music that throws you back to the way you felt during the golden era of Hip Hop.

Whatever year that was for you.<ref name="About">{{cite web|title=About GE|url=http://goldenerarecords.com.au/store/about-ge|work=Golden Era Records|publisher=Golden Era Records|access-date=9 December 2012|author=Hilltop Hoods|year=2012}}</ref></blockquote>

The label is based in Stirling, South Australia, and, as of December 2012, its roster consists of the Hilltop Hoods, Briggs, Funkoars, Vents, Adfu, K21,<ref name="About" /> and most recently, Shadow

In January 2012, Fontana, an independent marketing, sales and distribution company under the Universal Music Group umbrella, signed an exclusive agreement with Golden Era Records for the American release of ''Drinking From The Sun'', as well as back catalogue titles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fontana Partners With Golden Era Records to Release New Hilltop Hoods in US|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/11/idUS181745+11-Jan-2012+PRN20120111|access-date=9 December 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=11 January 2012|author=PR Newswire|format=Press release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626193209/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/11/idUS181745+11-Jan-2012+PRN20120111|archive-date=26 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Charity===
The CanTeen youth cancer charity announced that the 2-CD fundraising album ''Australian Hip Hop Supports CanTeen'' had raised over AU$122,000 as of 15 October 2014. Released in late 2013, the album features contributions from Hilltop Hoods, as well as numerous other Australian hip-hop artists. The initiative was originally conceived of by Robert Hunter, an MC who rapped under the name "Hunter" (SBX), who died from cancer prior to the release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Christie Eliezer|title=WA Hip Hop Album Project Raises $122k For CanTeen|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/wa-hip-hop-album-project-raises-122k-canteen/|website=The Music Network|publisher=The Music Network|access-date=15 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}</ref>
