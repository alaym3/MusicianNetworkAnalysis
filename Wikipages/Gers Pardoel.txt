==Biography==
===1981–2002: Early life===
Gerwin Pardoel was born on 12 May 1981 in [[Nijmegen]], thirty-five minutes before his younger twin brother Robbie. When Pardoel was young, his father was purchaser at a nursing home. Later, his father worked for the [[theme park]] [[Efteling|De Efteling]] in [[Kaatsheuvel]]. His mother was a housewife and took care of the children.<ref name=biography/>

When Pardoel was 17 years old, his life changed when his mother died from [[cancer]]. His life was turned upside down and the relation with his father deteriorated enormously. To escape from his difficult home situation, Pardoel looked for refuge in [[roller skating]]. He was a very fanatical roller skater and wanted to reach the Dutch roller skating top. Together with Steffen Haars and Huub Smit (nowadays known as the characters of ''[[New Kids]]''), he practiced almost every day in an inline skate hall in [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. The hall became a "new home" for Pardoel. He reached the ninth position in a national roller skating competition.<ref name=biography/><ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomassnoeijs.nl/?p=32|first=Thomas|last=Snoeijs|title=Interview Gers Pardoel|language=Dutch|work=OOR1|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref>

===2002–2010: Career beginnings===
Pardoel became interested in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. In [[Rotterdam]], he met rapper [[Postmen|Postman]] (Remon Stotijn). Postman and his then-wife [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] helped him to discover the world of hip hop. They made up Pardoel's [[stage name]] Gers. Despite the fact that the name Gers is very similar to his own name Gerwin, "gers" also means "cool" or something like that in Rotterdam [[dialect]]. Postman highly influenced Pardoel's performing stile.<ref name=biography/><ref name=interview/>

Pardoel improved his rapping skills and began developing himself as a producer. He started working on songs for a future album. At some point, Pardoel showed his old friend Steffen Haars (who had become director of ''[[New Kids]]'' in the meantime) some of his raps. Haars was impressed and put him in touch with rappers Sef and Big2. That resulted in the recording of the song "[[Broodje Bakpao]]". The hit single, which was included in the soundtrack of the movie ''[[New Kids Turbo]]'' and reached the first position in the [[Mega Single Top 100]], resulted in an enormous rise of fame for Pardoel. Due to this success, Pardoel received a recording contract at Dutch label [[TopNotch]].<ref name=biography/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Opposites+feat%2E+Gers+%26+Sef&titel=Broodje+bakpao&cat=s |title=The Opposites feat.

This song, by [[The Partysquad]] featuring Gers Pardoel, Adje, Jayh and Reverse, became a popular song among teenagers.

===2011–present: ''Deze wereld is van jou'' and ''De toekomst is van ons''===
On 14 October 2011, Pardoel released his debut studio album ''[[Deze wereld is van jou]]''. After a lot of work (the recordings of the album started already in 2009), the release was finally there. The second single of the album, "[[Ik neem je mee]]", became a great success and reached the number-one position in both the [[Dutch Top 40]] and the [[Mega Single Top 100]]. The album was certified Platinum by the NVPI.<ref name=platinumdezewereld/> The album also included the single "[[Bagagedrager]]" among others. Three years later, another studio album was released, called ''De toekomst is van ons''. It didn't match the success of its predecessor, but includes the Platinum-certified single "Louise".
