In a 2004 interview, Bianca described their childhood, stating "we spent our summers hiking from [[Indian reservation|reservation]] to reservation... I remember being in peyote circles as a kid, sitting in [[Tipi|tepees]] full of smoke... not being able to breathe and trying to sneak air out of the bottom of the tepee... We always felt pretty much like freaks, but we felt good about it. We didn't have any rules or anything. We had total freedom. It was hard to meet people who had the same values as us. We just sort of carry that with us today. We have pow-wows in our apartment, with bottles of cheap beer. It has to manifest itself somehow."<ref name="Petridis"/>

=== Musical influence ===
At the time, the sisters generally disliked their childhood experiences, but came to appreciate aspects of them that would later influence CocoRosie's music.<ref name="Kitty" /> In a 2007 interview, Sierra stated that the track "Rainbowarriors" from their third album ''[[The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn]]'' is "based on personal experiences and the Native American idea of the rainbow trail, but our own interpretation of that,"<ref name="Cocorosie interview by Renae Mason"/> and, in another 2007 interview, said that she and Bianca refer to themselves as "rainbowarriors".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kerr|first=Dave|date=2007-03-28|title=CocoRosie: Once in a Lifetime|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1801166-cocorosie--once-in-a-lifetime|access-date=2020-07-15|website=DrownedInSound|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719100231/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1801166-cocorosie--once-in-a-lifetime|archive-date=2020-07-19}}</ref> Later, in a 2015 interview with [[PopMatters]] discussing their sixth album ''[[Heartache City]]'', Bianca stated that she felt she didn't have "certain rights" as child, and that she and Sierra "didn't really have the space to be children." She explained that in their music they "explore... expressing from a child's point of view... because a child sees what's going on around them but doesn't really judge, and tends to reflect back certain ugliness and then they also don't have shame necessarily, or certain social restrictions on the way that they talk."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-09-17|title="It's Supposed to Be Weird": An Interview with CocoRosie|url=https://www.popmatters.com/its-supposed-to-be-weird-an-interview-with-cocorosie1-2495488229.html|access-date=2020-07-15|website=PopMatters|language=en}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview, discussing the track lyrics of ''[[The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn]]'', Bianca briefly mentioned that as child she "would burn ants and hunt rabbits" with Sierra, and that on the album is "talk about family members and our experiences... It’s not about what we have been doing, more major experiences, like moments from our childhood."<ref name="CocoRosie"/>

The Casady sisters' mother, Christina Chalmers, died in March 2020 during the production of CocoRosie's seventh album, ''[[Put the Shine On]]'', eleven days after providing [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for the track "Ruby Red", which is about her life.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CocoRosie: Put the Shine On|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cocorosie-put-the-shine-on/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== 2003−2004: Formation and ''La Maison de Mon Rêve'' ===
In 2000, after having lived in New York City for two years,<ref name="Eberstadt" /> Sierra moved into a "tiny" [[apartment]] in the [[Montmartre]] district of Paris, France to study at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], pursuing a career as an [[opera|opera singer]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Byblos International Festival|url=https://www.byblosfestival.org/Archives/ByblosFestival2009/CocoRosie.html|access-date=2020-07-17|website=www.byblosfestival.org}}</ref> Casady cheated to gain entrance to the Conservatoire, stating "I pretended I could sight-read when I couldn't."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/mediaroom/coco/coco_nyt_mag_july_2008-2.pdf |title=How Two Girls Named Coco and Rosie Grew Up To Be the Freakiest Freak Folk Band of Them All |publisher=Touch and Go Records |access-date=2020-12-15}}</ref> During this period she had no contact with Bianca, who by 2002 was living in [[Brooklyn]]<ref name="Byblos International Festival"/> and studying [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], and [[visual arts]]. Bianca had been "really involved in the literary community" in New York, claiming she "had a small press, was making books and hosting book clubs and curating shows" in her home.<ref name="brightestyoungthings.com">{{Cite web|date=2009-09-02|title=BYT Interview: CocoRosie ⋆ BYT // Brightest Young Things|url=https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interview-cocorosie|access-date=2020-07-15|website=BYT // Brightest Young Things|language=en-US}}</ref> According to a 2007 [[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] interview, the sisters had "hardly spoke a word to each other for ten years" at that point, with Bianca saying they "had seen each other a few times, but... abstained from speaking to each other. It was less of children being split up and more of us choosing not to connect."<ref name="CocoRosie"/>

In early 2003, Bianca made an impromptu visit to Paris to rejoin Sierra, and the two spent months creating music in Sierra's bathroom which, according to them, was the most isolated room in the apartment and had the best [[acoustics]].<ref name="Byblos International Festival"/> The sisters took a [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]] approach to production, utilizing a distinct [[Human voice|vocal]] style, traditional instruments, and various [[Found object|improvised instruments]] such as [[toy]]s, all recorded with one microphone and a "broken" pair of headphones.<ref>Alexis Petridis, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/nov/12/popandrock1 "Tub thumping"].

Initially, the sisters wanted only a few copies of the album to be produced, planning to give the copies to friends.<ref name="Byblos International Festival"/> However, the CocoRosie act was signed to the [[independent record label]] [[Touch and Go Records]] in 2004, after the label allegedly "pursued them" and persuaded them to,<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Maison De Mon Rêve by CocoRosie|url=https://genius.com/albums/Cocorosie/La-maison-de-mon-reve|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Byblos International Festival"/> and the album was released on March 9, 2004 to unexpected critical acclaim.

=== 2005−2006: ''Beautiful Boyz'' and ''Noah's Ark'' ===
CocoRosie released their second album, [[Noah's Ark (album)|''Noah's Ark'']], in 2005. The album includes collaborations with [[Anohni]] from [[Antony and the Johnsons]] ("Beautiful Boyz"), [[Devendra Banhart]] ("Brazilian Sun"), and French rapper Spleen ("Bisounours").<ref name="Cassidy" /> The album was recorded in a variety of locations as the sisters traveled.<ref>Matt Walton, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A5553641 "CocoRosie Session: The Casady sisters return with another creaking beauty"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814180324/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A5553641 |date=2014-08-14 }}.

In 2006, Sierra started a side project, Metallic Falcons, with friend Matteah Baim. The project is signed to Voodoo Eros Records, a new label started by Bianca with business partner Melissa Shimkovitz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/voodooerosenlig/|title=Voodoo-EROS/Enlightened Family {{!}} A Record Label & Store 2|website=BrooklynVegan|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> Bianca also opened the Voodoo Eros Museum Of Nice Items, an art gallery and performance space in New York City (123 Ludlow St) most recently home to an exhibition of Bianca's art ''Red Bone Slim VS.

In May 2007, while touring in support of ''The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn'', the band was involved in an incident which resulted in the cancellation of the remainder of the North American leg of the tour. No official explanation was released; vague and unconfirmed reports claimed that unidentified members of the band were arrested and deported while crossing the Canada–US border.<ref>[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=232632 "CocoRosie Arrested and Deported"] ''Fucking in the Streets Missing in Action'' May 30, 2007.

=== 2008: "God Has a Voice, She Speaks Through Me" ===
On May 13, 2008, CocoRosie released a new single entitled "[[God Has a Voice, She Speaks Through Me]]". The song was released digitally and as a 7" picture disc single (limited to 3000 pieces). The B-side of the 7" features a short and untitled song, which merely consists of noises. Though the picture on the B-side of the vinyl has lyrics from the song "Hairnet Paradise", which was previously only performed live, the actual song on the recording is very different. The duo spent much of 2008 writing and recording in various locations such as New York city, Réunion, Paris and Berlin where they also teamed up with artist Neda Sanai that is the spoken word voice on the song "R.I.P Burn Face".

=== 2009: ''Coconuts, Plenty of Junk Food'' ===
In 2009, CocoRosie's relationship with Touch and Go Records became unclear. A self-released EP entitled ''[[Coconuts, Plenty of Junk Food]]'' was made available for sale exclusively at CocoRosie shows on June 3, 2009.

=== ''Word to the Crow'' ===
An article in the [https://www.hisvoice.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HIS-Voice_2007_04.pdf April 5, 2007 issue] of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[magazine]] ''HIS Voice'' about ''The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn'' mentioned a previously unknown body of work, created by the Casady sisters, titled ''Word to the Crow''. Shortly after, on April 13, an article about CocoRosie on [[Czech Republic|Czech]] news website [https://www.aktualne.cz/ Aktuálně] claimed that on the day before the release of ''La Maison de Mon Rêve'', the sisters recorded an "improvised [[Rapping|rap]] album" of the same title.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-04-13|title=Sestry povyrostly: hippies si hrají s elektronikou {{!}} Aktuálně.cz|url=https://magazin.aktualne.cz/kultura/hudba/sestry-povyrostly-hippies-si-hraji-s-elektronikou/r~i:article:397790/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|language=cs}}</ref> It is unknown where the claim originated.

On May 3, 2009, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] music blog [http://themojorising.blogspot.com/ mojorising] claimed that the sisters recorded "a hip hop album" titled ''Word to the Crow'' "just a few days before" recording ''La Maison de Mon Rêve,''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Miguel|date=3 May 2009|title=mojorising: CocoRosie|url=http://themojorising.blogspot.com/2009/05/cocorosie.html|access-date=2020-07-16|website=mojorising}}</ref> and later on May 21, the official website of the [[Byblos International Festival]] published an article claiming that the sisters had "completed... a hip hop recording" of the same title prior to recording ''La Maison de Mon Rêve''.<ref name="Byblos International Festival"/> On June 19, 2011, [[Russia]]n blog [https://lisaalya.livejournal.com/ lisaalya] claimed that ''Word to the Crow'' was a "hip-hop record" and a "full album", recorded at the same time and in the same location as ''La Maison de Mon Rêve''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=lisaalya|date=2011-06-19|title=CocoRosie|url=https://lisaalya.livejournal.com/9529.html|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Curiouser and Curiouser}}</ref> On April 17, 2014, the claim was added to CocoRosie's "artist description" on [[Last.fm]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=CocoRosie hometown, lineup, biography|url=https://www.last.fm/music/CocoRosie/+wiki|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Last.fm|language=en}}</ref> and on June 19, 2018, All American Entertainment website and [[Talent agent|booking agency]] [https://www.aaemusic.com/ AAE Music] added the claim to their description of the group.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CocoRosie Artist Profile {{!}} AAE Music|url=https://www.aaemusic.com/artist/cocorosie|access-date=2020-07-16|website=AAE Music: Premier Booking Agency for Bands, Musicians and Artists.|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite a mild degree of circulation, no evidence to support the existence of the album has surfaced, and the Casady sisters have never spoken about such an album.

The track "The Moon asked the Crow" from the 2010 album ''Grey Oceans'', described by critics as "a [[Surrealism|surreal]] mixture of [[Classical music|classical]] tinkling... accompanied by a juddering hip-hop bounce"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Robert|date=2010-04-28|title=Single Review: CocoRosie - Grey Oceans|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15333/reviews/4139827|access-date=2020-07-16|website=DrownedInSound|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716193122/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15333/reviews/4139827|archive-date=2020-07-16}}</ref> and "[[Baroque music|baroque]] piano noodling with a thumping, body-moving hip-hop beat",<ref>{{Cite web|title=CocoRosie: Grey Oceans|url=https://music.avclub.com/cocorosie-grey-oceans-1798164903|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Music|language=en-us}}</ref> as well as having "hip-hop elements",<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-05-11|title=CocoRosie: Grey Oceans "American Songwriter|url=https://americansongwriter.com/cocorosie-grey-oceans/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref> a "moody, hip hop-inherited boom-boom-clap beat"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pattison|first=Louis|title=BBC - Music - Review of CocoRosie - Grey Oceans|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f24z/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref> and a "catchy hip-hoppy beat",<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-05-11|title=The Weird Sisters: CocoRosie's Grey Oceans|url=https://themillions.com/2010/05/the-weird-sisters-cocorosies-grey-oceans.html|access-date=2020-07-16|website=The Millions|language=en-US}}</ref> could be inspired by or derived from the style of, if it exists, ''Word to the Crow''.

==Personal life==
In August 2021, the Casady family house burned down in a forest fire. Bianca stated that "The fire took everything, our family history in a material sense, all of our mother’s artwork and possessions, all of our family photographs, our collection of musical instruments and recording equipment, our costumes and on and on..." Although insurance covered the cost of rebuilding the house, it did not cover other expenses such as the cost of the music studio or musical instruments, so the Casady sisters launched a GoFundMe to cover costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/cocorosie-launch-gofundme-after-losing-home-in-forest-fire-3019113 |title=CocoRosie launch GoFundMe after losing home in forest fire |date=14 August 2021 |publisher=NME |accessdate=2021-10-17}}</ref>
