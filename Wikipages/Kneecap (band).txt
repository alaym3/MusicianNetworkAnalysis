They first began releasing music in 2017 with their single "C.E.A.R.T.A." (Irish for "RIGHTS" as in human rights). They released their first album ''3CAG'' in 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=3CAG YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNDAC2NQp_k|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> and continued to release various singles such as "Get Your Brits Out".

== History ==
The group began when Móglaí Bap was out spray-painting with a friend the day before the [[Irish Language Act]] march in Belfast. He had written "Cearta" on a bus stop when the police arrived and arrested his friend while Móglaí escaped. The friend refused to speak English, and ended up spending a night in the cells awaiting a translator. This was the inspiration for their song "C.E.A.R.T.A.", which they intended to release "''just for the craic. No plans for after''," Mo Chara said they wanted to "''stick the feelers out and see how it would go down. Luckily people enjoyed it, so we're still at it.''"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mullally|first=Una|title=Kneecap: 'Low-life scum' of west Belfast rap whose day has come|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/kneecap-low-life-scum-of-west-belfast-rap-whose-day-has-come-1.3854738|access-date=2020-09-04|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref>

In late 2017<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|last=O'Toole|first=Lucy|title=KNEECAP spark controversy in Belfast with 'Brits Out' chant|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/kneecap-spark-controversy-belfast-brits-chant-22768104|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Hotpress}}</ref> their song "C.E.A.R.T.A." was banned from the Irish language radio [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] (RnaG) for "drug references and cursing". Fans started a petition which garnered 700 signatures to put the song back on air. Kneecap defended the song as "a caricature of life in west Belfast" and "a satirical take on life for young people, particularly in west Belfast".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Belfast Irish language rappers Kneecap banned by radio station|language=en-GB|work=belfasttelegraph|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/belfast-irish-language-rappers-kneecap-banned-by-radio-station-36448252.html|access-date=2020-09-04|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

In February 2019 they received condemnation from South Belfast [[Democratic Unionist Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLA]] [[Christopher Stalford]] after videos of the trio were posted online, showing them chanting 'Brits Out' at a concert performed in the Empire Music Hall in Belfast. The concert took place the day after [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]] visited the venue.<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Dornan|first=David |title=Watch: Belfast rappers chant 'Brits out' at Empire following Royal visit|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/watch-belfast-rappers-chant-brits-out-at-empire-following-royal-visit-37871955.html|access-date=2021-09-28|website=Belfast Telegraph - Sunday Life|language=en-GB}}</ref>
