'''Womack & Womack''' was the singing and songwriting partnership of American musicians [[Linda Womack]] and her husband, [[Cecil Womack]]. The duo were successful as songwriters for other artists, and had several international hits as a singing duo in the 1980s and 1990s. Later recordings, with other members of their family, were credited to '''The House of Zekkariyas'''.

==Background==
[[Cecil Womack]] was born in 1947 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and performed with his older brothers [[Bobby Womack|Bobby]] (1944–2014), [[Harry Womack|Harry]] (1945–1974), Friendly, and Curtis (born Howard Curtis Womack on 22 October 1942, died 21 May 2017 in a [[Bluefield, West Virginia]] hospital of respiratory heart failure),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaverfuneralservice.com/obitlink?obit_id=1967988#_ga=2.24428659.874375584.1496274269-414300500.1495217004|publisher=www.seaverfuneralservice.com|title=Howard Curtis Womack|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> as a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[musical group|group]]. After meeting [[Sam Cooke]], they changed their name to [[The Valentinos]] and in 1961 began to sing and record "the devil's music" for secular audiences, to the horror of their religious father.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web|author=Pierre Perrone |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cecil-womack-half-of-the-husbandandwife-duo-known-for-their-soul-hits-of-the-1980s-8489040.html |title=Cecil Womack: Half of the husband-and-wife duo known for their soul hits of the 1980s - Obituaries - News |work=The Independent |date=2013-02-10 |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref> The Valentinos had a hit record with "[[Lookin' for a Love]]," selling two million copies, later becoming a no. 39 U.S. hit for [[The J.

Retrieved 5 February 2013</ref>

In the 1960s, Cecil Womack worked primarily as a songwriter and producer. He first met Linda, who is Sam Cooke's daughter, born in 1953, when he was thirteen and she was eight.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Womack%20&%20Womack.html |title=Womack & Womack Page |publisher=Soulwalking.co.uk |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref> Although Linda and Cecil were close, particularly after her father's death in 1964, he married singer  [[Mary Wells]] in 1967 and wrote material for her, including the hit "[[The Doctor (Mary Wells song)|The Doctor]]", released on Jubilee Records. They had three children, and he managed her career until their break-up in 1977.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> Linda Cooke also worked as a songwriter, co-writing Bobby Womack's "[[Woman's Gotta Have It (song)|Woman's Gotta Have It]]."<ref>[http://www.noise11.com/news/cecil-womack-dies-at-age-65-20130204  VVN Music, ''Cecil Womack Dies At Age 65'', Noise 11, 4 February 2013].

Cecil Womack and Mary Wells divorced in 1977, and he and Linda married shortly afterwards.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met--womack-and-womack-1403513.html  The Independent, ''How we met: Womack & Womack'', 30 January 1994].

==Performers==
In 1983, Cecil and Linda began performing and recording together as Womack & Womack, and released a successful album, ''[[Love Wars]]'' produced by [[Stewart Levine]] on [[Elektra Records]]. The first single from the album, "T.K.O.", reached the  ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[R&B chart]]; the next single, "Love Wars", reached no.14 on the [[UK singles chart]] in early 1984, and the third single from the album, "Baby I'm Scared Of You", was successful in both the US (no. 25, R&B chart) and the UK (no. 72).<ref name="whitburn r&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research}}</ref>{{rp|491}}<ref name="betts">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6}}</ref>{{rp|856}} As with most of the tracks they recorded together, the songs were written by the pair. Drawing from their own, convoluted, personal experiences, Cecil and Linda, knowing each other since childhood, were experts at capturing the trials, travails and tribulations of love.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> Their next album, the self-produced  ''[[Radio M.U.S.C. Man]],'' released in 1986, included songs which Sam Cooke had started to write and which Cecil and Linda completed, along with a cover of the [[Beatles]]' "[[Here Comes The Sun]]". The album only produced one hit, "Strange & Funny", the pair's last chart entry in the US, and they left Elektra to record for the  [[Manhattan Records|Manhattan]] label.<ref name="whitburn r&b"/> Their only release for the label, 1986's "''Starbright,''" an ill-fated stab at the charts with little of their past sound, was barely released in the U.S., but produced a single, "Soul Love/Soul Man" that reached no. 58 in the U.K. Always popular in England, they headlined at the  [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1987.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

Their success in the UK and other parts of the world was rekindled in 1988 with the "naggingly catchy"<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> single "[[Teardrops (Womack & Womack song)|Teardrops]]", taken from their fourth album (and first for the [[Fourth & Broadway Records|Fourth & Broadway]] label), ''[[Conscience (Womack & Womack album)|Conscience]]''. The single reached no. 3 in the U.K., no. 1 in the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand; and no. 2 in Germany and Switzerland.<ref>[http://tsort.info/music/yr1988.htm  The World's Music Chart: Songs from the year 1988].  retrieved 4 February 2013</ref> Two other album tracks charted in England, "Life's Just A Ballgame" (U.K. no. 32) and "Celebrate the World" (U.K. no. 19).<ref name="betts"/> The album itself went gold in ten countries and platinum in three.<ref>Liner Notes ''Womack & Womack: Live in Concert'' DVD</ref> An eleven-song [[VHS]], ''Womack & Womack: Live In Concert'' was released in 1989, filmed during their "Celebrate The World" tour in Australia, America, England, Spain and France. It was re-released on [[DVD]] in 2009 by Cherry Red Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk |title=Cherry Red Records |publisher=Cherryred.co.uk |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref>

Their next album, 1991's ''Family Spirit'' was released on [[RCA]] in the U.S., and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]/[[Arista Records|Arista]] in the rest of the world. It didn't chart, but the single "Uptown" was a club and radio hit. After traveling to [[Nigeria]], they discovered ancestral ties to the Zekkariyas tribe, and adopted African names. Now recording for  [[Warner Bros. Records]], in 1993 they released what was to be their last album of new material under the name of Womack & Womack, ''Transformation To The House Of Zekkariyas''.<ref name=allmusic/> It produced their last charting single, "Secret Star," which reached no. 46 in the U.K. A compilation,  ''Tear Drops: Greatest Hits,'' was released in 1993 in the U.K. on the ''Spectrum''/''[[PolyGram]]'' label, and re-released on [[CD]] in 1998 as ''Greatest Hits''.<ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com |title=Database and Marketplace for Music on Vinyl, CD, Cassette and More |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref> Rather than being career-spanning retrospectives, the compilations contain single/remix versions taken from the singles off  ''Conscience'', and live versions of "Love Wars," [[John Denver]]'s "[[Take Me Home Country Roads]]," "Family" and "Rejoice", taken from the concert film. ''Strange & Funny (The Best Of 1984-1993)'', an Australian compilation released on Raven Records, does a much better job at documenting the career of Womack & Womack - although all tracks are the album versions.

The Womacks, now using their adopted African name Zekkariyas, began recording as a family. Zek (Cecil) and Zeriiya (Linda), along with their children Zeumoja, Zeniya, Zeimani, and Zeapree, Lil Squal, and long-time backing group ''Sly, Slick & Wicked'', released ''Sub Conscience'' aka ''Subconscience'' as ''ZEK'' in 2001 on their own ''Z Life Grooves'' label. ZEK is short for Zekkariyas Enlightenment Kingdom. Basically a re-working of various tracks from throughout their career, a companion remix album, ''Circular Motion'' was released in 2004 on their ''S.A.R. Starship'' imprint, not 2007 as erroneously listed in many references.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/circular-motion-mw0001706255  ''Circular Motion'' at Allmusic.com].  Retrieved 3 February 2013</ref> The original [[SAR Records]] was [[Sam Cooke]]'s record label.

==Songwriters==
Linda commenced a songwriting career in 1964 at the age of 11, composing "I Need A Woman", and would also co-write "I'm In Love" for [[Wilson Pickett]] and "A Woman's Gotta Have It" in 1972 for [[Bobby Womack]]. It was also recorded by  [[James Taylor]], along with many others.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> Cecil had also written numerous songs, sometimes collaborating with then wife [[Mary Wells]]. After beginning her personal and professional relationship with Cecil, the pair started their career working as a writing team for  [[Philadelphia International Records]]. They composed tracks for artists such as  [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[The Dramatics]], [[The O'Jays]] ("I Just Want To Satisfy") and [[Patti LaBelle]] ("Love Bankrupt" and "Love Symphony").<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> Cecil's "[[Love TKO]]" (written with Gip Noble, Jr.) was a major hit for [[Teddy Pendergrass]], and was later recorded by several artists, including [[Debbie Harry]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Boz Scaggs]] and [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]].<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

On their own they hit a creative purple patch, composing material that went on to be recorded by [[George Benson]] ("New Day"), [[Randy Crawford]] (four tracks on her "Nightline" album),  [[Eric Clapton]] ("Lead Me On") and "I Wish I Had Someone To Go Home To" for brother Bobby Womack. [[Bonnie Raitt]] covered "Good Man Monologue" as "Good Man, Good Woman" and [[Chaka Khan]] covered "It's My Party". The title track of their first album, "Love Wars," was covered by  [[The Beautiful South]] for the 1990 [[Elektra Records]] anniversary compilation ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|Rubáiyát]]'', and "[[Teardrops (Womack & Womack song)|Teardrops]]" has been recorded by [[k.d. lang]], [[Elton John]], [[Joss Stone]] and [[The XX]].<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> The Womacks also wrote and produced for [[Culture Club]] and [[Bryan Ferry]] backup vocalist turned solo artist [[Ruby Turner]]. Her album  ''[[Paradise (Ruby Turner album)|Paradise]]'' featured their songs "Sexy" and "See Me," while they wrote and produced four cuts on her next album ''The Other Side''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-other-side-mw0000263692 |title=The Other Side - Ruby Turner &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref>

==Cecil Womack's death==

Zekkariyas spent his final years traveling the world with his wife and children, using his time to explore his African heritage, spirituality, and knowledge of the continent as well as making music. He died of unknown causes in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, on January 25, 2013, at age 65.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|author=John Lewis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/05/cecil-womack |title=Cecil Womack obituary &#124; Music |date=5 February 2013 |publisher=theguardian.com |access-date=2014-06-28}}</ref>
