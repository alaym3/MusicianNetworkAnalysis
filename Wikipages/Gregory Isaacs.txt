Milo Miles, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Isaacs as "the most exquisite vocalist in reggae".<ref name="Miles">Miles, Milo (1992), "[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/arts/recordings-view-gregory-isaacs-the-ruler-of-reggae.html RECORDINGS VIEW; Gregory Isaacs, the Ruler of Reggae"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 February 1992.</ref><ref name="Kiviat">Kiviat, Steve (1996), "[https://archive.today/20130105080353/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=11669 Gregory Isaacs]", ''[[Washington City Paper]]'', 6 – 12 December 1996 (Vol. 16, No. 49).</ref>

==Early career==
In his teenage years, Isaacs became a veteran of the talent contests that regularly took place in Jamaica. In 1968, he made his recording debut as Winston Sinclair, with the single "Another Heartache", recorded for producer [[Byron Lee]].<ref name="Thompson127" /> The single sold poorly and Isaacs went on to team up with [[Errol Dunkley]] to start the [[African Museum]] record label and shop, and soon had a massive hit with "My Only Lover", credited as the first [[lovers rock]] record ever made.<ref name="Thompson127" /> He recorded for other producers to finance further African Museum recordings, having a string of hits in the three years that followed, ranging from ballads to [[roots reggae]], including "All I Have Is Love", "Lonely Soldier", "Black a Kill Black", "Extra Classic" and his [[cover version]] of [[Dobby Dobson]]'s "Loving Pauper".<ref name="Thompson127" /> In 1974, he began working with producer [[Alvin Ranglin]], and that year he had his first Jamaican no. 1 single with "Love Is Overdue".<ref name="Thompson127" />

Isaacs recorded for many of Jamaica's top producers during the 1970s, including [[Niney the Observer|Winston "Niney" Holness]], [[Gussie Clarke]] ("My Time"), Lloyd Campbell ("Slavemaster"), [[Glen Brown]] ("One One Cocoa Fill Basket"), [[Harry Mudie]], [[Roy Cousins]], [[Sydney Crooks]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] ("Mr. Cop").<ref name="Thompson128">Thompson, p. 128.</ref> By the late-1970s, Isaacs was one of the biggest reggae performers in the world, regularly touring the US and the UK, and only challenged by [[Dennis Brown]] and [[Bob Marley]].<ref name="Thompson128" /><ref name="larkin136">Larkin, Colin (1998), ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae'', Virgin Books, p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}.</ref> Between 1977 and 1978, Isaacs again teamed up with Alvin Ranglin, recording a string of hits including "Border" and "Number One" for Ranglin's GG's label.

He opened the Cash and Carry shop at 118 Orange Street, later moving to no. 125, next door to [[Prince Buster]]'s Record Shack, which was also the base for the Cash and Carry record label that he ran with Trevor "Leggo" Douglas.<ref name="Mural">"[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20150719/isaacs-honoured-orange-street Isaacs Honoured At Orange Street]", ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 19 July 2015. Retrieved 23 July 2015.</ref>

==International success==
International stardom seemed assured in 1978 when Isaacs signed to the [[Virgin Records]] offshoot Front Line Records, and appeared in the film ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', in which he performed "Slavemaster".<ref name="Thompson128" /> The ''Cool Ruler'' (which became one of his nicknames) and ''Soon Forward'' albums, however, failed to sell as well as expected,<ref name="Thompson128" /> although they are now considered among his best work.<ref name="Barrow197">Barrow, p. 197.</ref> In 1981, he made his first appearance at the [[Reggae Sunsplash]] festival (returning annually until 1991), and he moved on to the [[Charisma Records]] offshoot Pre, who released his ''The Lonely Lover'' (another nickname that stuck) and ''More Gregory'' albums along with a string of increasingly successful singles including "Tune In", "Permanent Lover", "Wailing Rudy" and "Tribute to Waddy".<ref name="Thompson129">Thompson, p. 129.</ref> He signed to [[Island Records]] and released the record that finally saw him break through to a wider audience, "[[Night Nurse (Gregory Isaacs song)|Night Nurse]]", the title track from his first album for the label (''[[Night Nurse (album)|Night Nurse]]'' (1982)).<ref name="Thompson129" /> Although "Night Nurse" was not a chart hit in either the UK or US, it was hugely popular in clubs and received heavy radio play, and the album reached number 32 in the UK.<ref name="OCC">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24990/gregory-isaacs/ Gregory Isaacs], [[Official Charts Company]]. Retrieved 28 April 2016</ref> It was also used in adverts for an [[over the counter]] cold & [[influenza|flu]] remedy of the same name.

This success for Isaacs coincided with drug problems with [[cocaine]] that saw him serve a six-month prison sentence in Kingston in 1982 for possession of unlicensed firearms.<ref name="Thompson129" /><ref name="Perry">Perry, Andrew (2007), "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3662457/The-cool-ruler-of-reggae-makes-a-comeback.html The cool ruler of reggae makes a comeback"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 January 2007.</ref> Isaacs claimed that he had the weapons only for protection, but it emerged that this was his 27th arrest and that he had become involved in drug dealing and was addicted to [[crack cocaine]].<ref name="Perry" /> He celebrated his release from prison with his second album for Island, ''Out Deh!'' (1983).<ref name="Thompson129" /> [[Yellowman]] wrote the song ''Gregory Free'' also celebrating Isaacs release, and was later featured on the [[Young, Gifted and Yellow]] album. He was featured in the 1982 documentary ''[[Land of Look Behind]]''.

When his contract with Island ended, Isaacs returned in 1984 with the "Kool Ruler Come Again" single, and began a period of prolific recording, working with producers including [[Prince Jammy]], Hugh "Redman" James, [[Robert Dixon (musician)|Bobby Digital]], [[Tad Dawkins]] and [[Steely & Clevie]], maintaining a consistent standard despite the volume of work produced.<ref name="larkin136" /><ref name="Thompson129" /> Isaacs then built a strong relationship with Gussie Clarke of the Music Works label. They began with Isaacs' 1985 album ''Private Beach Party'', and had a massive hit with "Rumours" in 1988, which was followed by further popular singles including "Mind Yu Dis", "Rough Neck", "Too Good To Be True" and "Report to Me".<ref name="Thompson129" /> The association with Clarke continued into the early 1990s, teaming up with singers including [[Freddie McGregor]], [[Ninjaman]] and [[J.C. Lodge]].<ref name="Thompson129" /> He dueted with [[Beres Hammond]] on the 1993 [[Philip "Fatis" Burrell]]-produced "One Good Turn", Burrell also producing Isaacs' 1994 album ''Midnight Confidential''.<ref name="Thompson129" />

In the 1990s the African Museum label continued to release all of Isaacs' music, and that of artists he produced. In 1997 [[Simply Red]] covered "[[Night Nurse (Gregory Isaacs song)|Night Nurse]]" and had a hit with it. Isaacs continued to record and perform live in the 2000s. In 2005 [[Lady Saw]] produced another version of "Night Nurse" with her [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] over the original [[lyrics]].

Isaacs' drug addiction had a major impact on his voice, with most of his teeth falling out as a result.<ref name="Perry" /> Isaacs said of his addiction in 2007: "Drugs are a debasing weapon. It was the greatest college ever, but the most expensive school fee ever paid – the Cocaine High School. I learnt everything, and now I've put it on the side."<ref name="Perry" />

He also performed at the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2007]] Inauguration at Jamaica.

In 2007 he collaborated with the Spanish rap group [[Flowklorikos/Rafael Lechowski]] album ''Donde Duele Inspira''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2008, after some 40 years as a recording artist, Isaacs released a new studio album ''Brand New Me,'' which was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards]] for 2010. The album received positive reviews from critics, such as this review from Reggae Vibes: "Gregory is back, and how! 'Brand New Me' is a very suitable album title for the cool ruler's new album. He is back in a different style, more or less like we were used to from this great 'lovers & roots' artist"<ref>[http://www.reggae-vibes.com/rev_sin/brandnew.php Review of ''Brand New Me''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731102305/http://www.reggae-vibes.com/rev_sin/brandnew.php |date=31 July 2008 }}, Reggae Vibes.</ref> This was followed in 2009 by the album ''My Kind Of Lady''.

In 2010, Gregory Isaacs put out the last of his albums to be released while he was still living; ''Isaacs Meets Isaac,'' with Zimbabwean reggae singer King Isaac. In November 2010, ''Isaacs Meets Isaac'' was nominated for Best Reggae Album for the 2011 Grammy Awards, giving Gregory Isaacs his fourth Grammy nomination, and Zimbabwe's King Isaac his first.

In 2016 it was announced that the Jamaican government would posthumously award Isaacs the [[Order of Distinction]] (Officer Class) in recognition of his contribution to the country's music.<ref>Morgan-Lindo, Simone (2016) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Gregory-Isaacs---Officer-of-Class_71363 Gregory Isaacs...Officer of Class]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 August 2016.
