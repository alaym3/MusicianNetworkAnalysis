'''Oxbow''' is an American [[experimental rock]] band from San Francisco, California. Founded in 1988, the band has released seven studio albums.

==History==
Oxbow began as a recording project. In 1988 bandmates Eugene Robinson (vocals, lyrics) and Niko Wenner (guitar, bass, keyboards, music) wrote songs with an approach decidedly different from their band at the time [[Whipping Boy (American band)|Whipping Boy]]. Wenner concocted an underlying musical architecture for his abrasive-then-plangent music, through use of [[arch form]] and musical [[palindrome]]s unusual in the [[noise music]] genre the band was often placed. This organizing structure later grew to encompass the second Oxbow recording as well, and drew relationships between the two.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wenner|first=Niko|title=Fuckfest|year=2009|publisher=Hydra Head Industries|location=CD reissue liner notes}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wenner|first=Niko|title=King of the Jews|year=2011|publisher=Hydra Head Industries|location=CD reissue liner notes}}</ref>  For his part Robinson changed his vocal approach to include in-the-studio improvisations and extensive vocal multi-tracking. This first record, titled ''Fuckfest'' has drumming split evenly between Greg Davis and Tom Dobrov. Dan Adams (bass in Oxbow, drums in Whipping Boy) joined immediately on completion of the first recording. All but Davis and Dobrov were at various times members of Whipping Boy, Wenner and Dobrov had been bandmates in the hardcore band Grim Reality<ref name="Ankeny">Ankeny, Jason "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/oxbow-mn0000499303 Oxbow Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved July 17, 2012</ref><ref name="Blush">{{cite book| first = Steven| last = Blush| authorlink = Steven Blush| editor-first = George| editor-last = Petros| editor-link = George Petros| title = [[American Hardcore: A Tribal History]] | date = Oct 1, 2001| page = 130 | publisher = [[Feral House]]| isbn = 9780922915712}}</ref><ref name="Pehling">Pehling, Dave (2002) "[http://www.sfweekly.com/2002-09-11/music/uneasy-listening/ Uneasy Listening: Oxbow drags experimental rock into the heart of darkness]", ''[[SF Weekly]]'', September 11, 2002, retrieved July 17, 2012</ref> Dobrov departed amicably after the band's 1995 European tour, but performed as guest second-drummer, with Davis, for the studio recording of "Shine (Glimmer)" on the 2002 album ''An Evil Heat.''<ref name="Wenner">Wenner, Niko (1995) "[http://www.theoxbow.com/oxbow_content/d95n_01.htm/ Tour Diary: 1995 (Niko)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112170300/http://www.theoxbow.com/oxbow_content/d95n_01.htm |date=November 12, 2006 }}", retrieved September 15, 2012</ref><ref name="Oxbow">Oxbow (2012) "[http://www.facebook.com/OXBOW/posts/328719863885351]", ''http://www.facebook.com/OXBOW'', August 1, 2012, retrieved September 15, 2012</ref>

The first album from Oxbow, [[Fuckfest (album)|''Fuckfest'']], was released in 1989. It was described as "one of the most unique first statements in modern [[avant-rock]]" by ''[[Rock-A-Rolla]]'' magazine, "staggeringly eclectic" by [[Simon Reynolds]], and "a fierce, rigorous album that challenges almost every preconception rock listeners might have" by [[Allmusic]].<ref name="Ankeny" /><ref name="RaR">"[http://rock-a-rolla.com/main/?p=619 Classic album: Oxbow ‘Fuckfest’]", ''[[Rock-A-Rolla]]'', April 15, 2010, retrieved July 17, 2012</ref><ref name="Reynolds">Reynolds, Simon "[http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.com/search?q=fuckfest]", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 1989, retrieved August 1, 2012</ref><ref name="Freeman">Freeman, Phil "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/fuckfest-mw0000795653 ''Fuckfest'' Review]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved July 17, 2012</ref> ''Fuckfest'' was followed by [[King of the Jews (album)|''King of the Jews'']] (1991) and then by two [[Steve Albini]]-recorded albums: [[Let Me Be a Woman (album)|''Let Me Be a Woman'']] (1995) and ''[[Serenade in Red]]'' (1996–97), the latter featuring guest vocals from [[Marianne Faithfull]].<ref name="Ankeny" /> ''An Evil Heat'' followed in 2002 on [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]]' [[Neurot Recordings]] label.<ref name="Pehling" /><ref name="York">York, William "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-evil-heat-mw0000215150 ''An Evil Heat'' Review]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved July 17, 2012</ref> Oxbow's 2007 album ''The Narcotic Story'' was named the number one album in the "Best of 2007" by ''[[Rock-A-Rolla]]'' magazine, and was listed with three other bands' albums in the nomination of [[Joe Chiccarelli]] as 'Producer of the Year' at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Rock-A-Rolla">Rock-A-Rolla "[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rockarolla.htm#2007]", retrieved September 9, 2012</ref><ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071208065050/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx 50th Annual Grammy Awards Nomination List]" (archived version), retrieved July 19, 2012</ref>
