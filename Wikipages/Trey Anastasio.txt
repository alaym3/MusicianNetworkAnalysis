==Biography==
[[File:Trey Anastasio's childhood home.JPG|alt=Treys childhood home in Princeton, New Jersey. A ranch style house and driveway.|thumb|Trey's childhood home in Princeton, New Jersey.]]
Anastasio was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], when he was three. His father, Ernest Anastasio Jr., was an executive vice president at the [[Educational Testing Service]]. His mother, Dina, was a children's book author and editor of ''[[Sesame Street Magazine]]''. He grew up with his sister Kristy.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=The Phish Companion: A Guide to the Band and Their Music|edition=2nd}}</ref>

Anastasio attended Princeton public schools through the fourth grade, then transferred to [[Princeton Day School]]. He graduated from the [[Taft School]] along with Steven Pollak, better known as [[the Dude of Life]], who later helped pen such Phish compositions as "Suzy Greenberg", "Fluffhead", "Run Like An Antelope", "Slave to the Traffic Light", and "Dinner and a Movie". At Taft, he formed his first two bands, Red Tide and Space Antelope.

Trey enrolled at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) as a philosophy major, where he met original Phish bandmates [[Jon Fishman]], [[Mike Gordon]], and [[Jeff Holdsworth]]. On December 2, 1983 the group played their first gig at a dance in the Harris-Millis Cafeteria at UVM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/setlists/?d=1983-12-02 |title=December 02, 1983 Setlist >|website=Phish.net |access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> The setlist consisted of cover songs, including "[[Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress|Long Cool Woman]]" and "[[Proud Mary]]" which was performed twice. The band was very primitive at this time and used hockey sticks as mic stands. After performing one set, [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' album was put on by a party-goer to drown out the band. The band would not return to play but were still paid for the performance. At UVM, he hosted an early morning [[radio program]], ''Ambient Alarm Clock''.

While living at home for a semester he attended [[Mercer County Community College]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Puterbaugh | first=Parke | title=Phish : the biography | publisher=Da Capo  | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-306-81920-9 | oclc=649801260}}</ref> While there, he reconnected with his childhood friend [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]], and the pair began a songwriting collaboration and recorded material that would appear on the ''[[Bivouac Jaun]]'' demo tape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/band-history|title=FAQ - Phish.net|website=Phish.net|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>  Anastasio met up with childhood friends [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]], his future writing partner, and [[Marc Daubert]] who would officially join Phish as percussionist from September 1984 to February 1985. After seeing a Phish show, pianist [[Page McConnell]] joined Phish in the autumn of 1985. Anastasio, along with Jon Fishman, transferred to [[Goddard College]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

During this time he began a musical association and close friendship with composer [[Ernie Stires]], who taught him composition, theory, and arranging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/stires.html |title=Vermont's Phinest Composer – Take it from Trey, he owes it all to Ernie Stires|author=Ruth Horowitz |website=Phish.net |access-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> While at [[Goddard College|Goddard]], he composed the song cycle ''[[The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday]]'' as his senior project. These songs became mainstays of the Phish catalog. He graduated from [[Goddard College|Goddard]] in 1988.

==Phish==
{{Main|Phish}}
Anastasio is a founding member  of the rock band [[Phish]], serving as lead guitarist and vocalist since their inception. Phish is noted for their [[musical improvisation]], extended [[jam session|jams]], exploration of a broad range of genres, and original live performances. Formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 (with the current line up solidifying in 1985), the band includes bassist and vocalist [[Mike Gordon]]; percussionist, vacuum player, and vocalist [[Jon Fishman]]; and keyboardist and vocalist [[Page McConnell]]. Phish performed together for over 20 years, releasing 10 studio albums, before taking a disbanding in August 2004. They reunited in March 2009 for a corresponding tour, released a reunion album ''[[Joy (Phish album)|Joy]]'' and have since resumed performing regularly.

===Phish-related projects===
*[[Bivouac Jaun]] in 1984 was a project featuring Anastasio, Phish lyricist [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]], and one-time Phish percussionist [[Marc Daubert]]. The group recorded a four-track project during Phish's short hiatus in the summer of 1984. Much of the project would be retooled and later featured on the first Phish album, ''[[The White Tape]]'', in 1986.
*Bad Hat, formed in the spring of 1994, included [[Jon Fishman]] on drums, Jamie Masefield on [[mandolin]], and Stacey Starkweather on bass. They casually played improvisational jazz around Burlington, Vermont, for a few months, with the first of several shows at Last Elm Cafe. They billed themselves as "the quietest band around".
*[[Surrender to the Air]] was a free jazz ensemble led by Anastasio and featuring Fishman, as well as [[Marshall Allen]], Damon Choice, and [[Michael Ray (trumpeter)]] of the Sun Ra Orchestra, [[John Medeski]], [[Marc Ribot]], [[Oteil Burbridge]] and several other musicians.  The group performed two concerts at the New York City Arts Academy in April 1996 and disbanded shortly thereafter. The concerts, like the group's sole album, consisted of completely improvised music.
*[[Phil Lesh and Friends]] (commonly referred to as ''Phil Lesh and Phriends'') in 1999 featured Anastasio and [[Page McConnell]], [[Grateful Dead]] members [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]], guitarist [[Steve Kimock]], and drummer John Molo performing three nights of Dead and Phish material at The Warfield in San Francisco. It was the first time members of both Phish and the Dead shared the stage together. On February 12, 2006, Anastasio joined Lesh again for a full show at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York City. He did so again on October 20, 2007 in Glens Falls, New York.
*[[SerialPod]] is a trio featuring Anastasio, Gordon and Grateful Dead drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]. On December 17, 2005, the band performed at the 14th annual [[Warren Haynes]] Christmas Jam in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], North Carolina. The group performed a series of Grateful Dead and Phish classics, plus covers from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and others. Ivan Neville joined the group on keyboards for much of the performance.
*A quartet consisting of the [[Benevento/Russo Duo]], Gordon and Anastasio traded opening and closing spots with Phil Lesh and Friends during their co-headlining summer 2006 tour before touring on their own for a number of shows in July 2006.
* Ghosts of the Forest is a side project for Anastasio and Fishman, which also features vocalist Jennifer Hartswick, guitarist Celisse Henderson, bassist [[Tony Markellis]], and keyboardist [[Ray Paczkowski]]. The group was formed in 2018 and performed a short tour in the spring of 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trey Anastasio Forms New Band Ghosts Of The Forest |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/trey-anastasio-ghosts-of-the-forest-tour |website=JamBase |access-date=19 December 2018 |date=11 December 2018}}</ref> The ''Ghosts of the Forest'' album, which is credited to Anastasio as a solo artist, was released on April 12, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trey Anastasio Talks Ghosts Of The Forest Album & Tour |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/trey-anastasio-ghosts-of-the-forest-album-tour |website=JamBase |access-date=31 March 2019 |date=26 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ghosts of the Forests by Trey Anastasio |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ghosts-of-the-forests/1457758236 |access-date=2 April 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref>

==Trey Anastasio Band==
{{Main|Trey Anastasio (band)}}
Trey Anastasio Band debuted in 1998 as Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes, as a local band in Vermont fronted by Anastasio, on April 17 of that year at the opening week of the nightclub Higher Ground, co-owned by his brother-in-law. The band debuted a number of songs heard in Anastasio's live performances today, including "First Tube", "Last Tube", and "Mozambique". [[The Sextet|The Trio]] in 1999 was an evolution of Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes. Anastasio's first solo tour was with the trio, which included himself, [[Russ Lawton]], and [[Tony Markellis]]. Markellis was an early influence on Anastasio and seeing the bassist perform with the Unknown Blues Band was a major reason he decided to attend UVM.<ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/features/2018/07/03/twenty-years-later-tony-markellis-talks-tab/ Jambands.com</ref>  The trio reunited in late 2008 (along with keyboardist Ray Packowski) for a tour of the Northeast United States. The band expanded to a [[The Sextet|sextet]] in 2000 with three horn players added to the band (Dave Grippo on alto sax, Jennifer Hartswick on trumpet and tuba, and Andy Moroz on trombone). Some of the music originally performed by the sextet was later seen on his 2002 release, ''[[Trey Anastasio (album)|Trey Anastasio]]''. A year later they evolved into [[The Octet]] which added [[Ray Paczkowski]] on keyboards and Russell Remington on tenor sax and flute; and [[The Dectet]] in 2002 through 2004 explored complex arrangements and changes of some songs included on ''Trey Anastasio'', and was an evolved version of the octet, now a ten-piece band with the addition of [[Peter Apfelbaum]] on barritone sax and percussion, and [[Cyro Baptista]] on percussion.

On August 10, 2008, Trey Anastasio and Classic TAB played a set at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] at [[Liberty State Park]] in New Jersey. They opened with "Sand" and played a few other classic Anastasio/Markellis/Lawton compositions (songs that were also later recorded by Phish) including "Gotta Jibboo" and "[[Heavy Things]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/sideshows/trey-anastasio-band/?d=2008-08-10 |title=Setlist for TAB, 8/10/08|website=Phish.net |access-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

On the twentieth anniversary of the original Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes show, April 17, 2018, Anastasio, Markellis and Lawton embarked on a tour featuring performances of Anastasio songs previously performed by Phish, such as "No Men In No Man's Land", "Camel Walk" and "Party Time" (written by Jon Fishman).

==Solo work==
Anastasio was featured on the album [[True Love (Toots & the Maytals album)|''True Love'']] by [[Toots and the Maytals]], which won the [[Grammy Award]] in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Gwen Stefani]] / [[No Doubt]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Manu Chao]], [[The Roots]], [[Ryan Adams]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], Jackie Jackson, [[Ken Boothe]], and [[The Skatalites]].<ref>[http://www.tootsandthemaytals.net/linear-cd-notes/ "True Love – Linear CD Notes"], Toots and the Maytals. {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20161110054527/http://www.tootsandthemaytals.net/linear-cd-notes/ |date=November 10, 2016 }}>. Retrieved November 9, 2016.</ref> Anastasio can be heard playing guitar on the song "Sweet and Dandy".

In September 2004, he performed with the Vermont Youth Orchestra at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/sideshows/trey-anastasio-band/?d=2004-09-14|title=Setlist for Trey & VYO, 9/14/04|website=Phish.net |access-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Trey toured with Mike Gordon and the Benevento/Russo Duo. The project, known unofficially as G.R.A.B. played a number of shows with Phil Lesh.<ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://web.archive.org/web/20060707202852/http://www.relix.com/cgi-bin/content_details.php?id=1850 Relix</ref>

The east coast premier of  "[[Time Turns Elastic]]" was performed on May 21, 2009 with conductor [[Marin Alsop]] and the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall]] in Baltimore, Maryland. The performance also included the debut of the orchestral version of Anastasio's "First Tube".

On September 12, 2009 Trey performed "An Evening with Trey Anastasio and the New York Philharmonic" at [[Carnegie Hall]] in Manhattan with the [[New York Philharmonic]], playing various compositions including "Divided Sky","[[You Enjoy Myself]]", and "Time Turns Elastic".

Trey continues performing solo tours with TAB.
Periodically embarking on national tours where he performs only with his acoustic guitar and minimal pedal effects. Labeled "An Acoustic Evening with Trey Anastasio," those types of concerts began in the fall of 2019 and happen periodically since

On July 30, 2020, Trey released ''Lonely Trip'', a collection of original songs written during the COVID-19 pandemic and recorded at his home studio in New York. The LP was mixed by Bryce Goggin and features lyrical collaborations with Tom Marshall and Scott Herman.

==Guitar playing style and stage equipment==
Anastasio has employed the services of his friend, luthier and audio-technician [[Paul Languedoc]] (Phish's soundman from 1986 to 2004) throughout his career. The highly resonant hollow-body electric guitars built by Languedoc<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guitargearhead.com/languedoc-guitar-review-from-acceptance-email-to-jamming/|title = Languedoc Guitar Review - from Acceptance Email to Jamming|date = June 30, 2021}}</ref> for Anastasio, his [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]]s, and Ross Compressors are key to his signature tone. Anastasio has several custom Languedoc hollow-body electric guitars, which make use of set maple necks with 24-fret ebony fretboards and dual [[Seymour Duncan]] SH-1 '59 [[humbucker]] pickups. During Phish's 2018 Halloween "musical costume" set, Anastasio deviated from his Languedoc guitars and performed with a white [[Ed O'Brien]] model [[Fender Stratocaster]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish Succeeds In Ultimate Prank, Delivers New Music As Kasvot Växt For 2018 Halloween Costume [Videos/Photos] |url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/news/phish-vegas-10-31-18/ |website=L4LM |access-date=11 January 2019 |date=1 November 2018}}</ref>

Anastasio's electric guitar technique is largely conventional; he does not typically make use of [[tapping]] techniques and does not usually play [[slide guitar]] (an example of when he does is in the [[Oysterhead]] section of [[Les Claypool]]'s ''[[5 Gallons of Diesel]]'') but is known to be competent at both techniques. He normally uses a 2.0mm Adamas graphite [[guitar pick]], but does not always do so. Melodically, he often incorporates [[mode (music)|modes]], notably the [[dorian mode|dorian]], [[mixolydian]], and [[locrian mode|locrian]], as well as [[pentatonic scale]]s. In addition to scales, Anastasio makes abundant use of [[arpeggios]] while improvising as well as in his compositional material. Anastasio's guitar influences include [[Robert Fripp]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Pat Metheny]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish Scales: Trey Anastasio Breaks Down His Improvisation Techniques |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/phish-scales-trey-anastasio-breaks-down-his-improvisation-techniques |website=Guitarworld.com |date=September 30, 2013 |access-date=8 October 2018 |language=en}}<br>- {{cite magazine |last1=Anastasio |first1=Trey |title=100 Greatest Artists: Frank Zappa |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/frank-zappa-3-86388/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=8 October 2018 |date=3 December 2010}}<br>- {{cite book |last1=Kitts |first1=Jeff |last2=Tolinski |first2=Brad |title=Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time!: From the Pages of Guitar World Magazine |date=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=9780634046193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fg838EcECUwC&q=trey+anastasio+hendrix+%22machine+gun%22&pg=PT195 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Audio signal processing|Effects processors]] play a crucial role in achieving Anastasio's guitar tone. He uses effects such as two Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamers (with Analogman's Silver Mod) in sequence, the famous Univibe clone the Black Cat Vibe, and a Ross compressor. He switched to Analogman's Bicompressor around 1998, dropped the compressor from his rig in 2002, and resumed use of the Ross Compressor in 2008 when a group of fans who desired the return of Anastasio's "signature" Ross compressor sound pooled their resources to obtain a vintage Ross Compressor and sent it to Anastasio in an attempt to compel him to return the vintage effect pedal to his rig.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phantasytour.com/phish/boards_thread.cgi?threadID=1760766 |title=PT &#124; Phish &#124; FINAL Ross Compressor Thread |website=Phantasytour.com |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=February 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314013636/http://phantasytour.com/phish/boards_thread.cgi?threadID=1760766 |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}<br>- {{cite web |url=http://picasaweb.google.com/MarshMtn/RossCompressor2?authkey=JBWQ7aDBG5o&feat=directlink# |title=Ross Compressor 2 – TMarsh – Picasa Web Albums |website=Picasaweb.google.com |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=February 27, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Anastasio responded through friend and longtime collaborator [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]]'s website explaining that he had lost his original Ross Compressor and that he was so touched that people cared about his effects and guitar tone that he would add the gift to his rig in the original configuration where it has remained ever since.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Vilanova |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phish-fans-hungry-for-trey-anastasios-old-tone-present-guitarist-with-ross-compressor-20090107 |title=PT Phish FINAL Ross Compressor Thread |work=Rolling Stone |date=January 7, 2009 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> He also uses a [[wah wah pedal]] (usually a Real McCoy Custom 3 by Geoffrey Teese), a Boomerang phrase sampler, Custom Audio Electronics Super [[Tremolo]], Ibanez DM2000 delay, Alesis Microverb II (set to reverse), Whammy II pitch shifter, as well as a [[Leslie speaker|Leslie]] rotating speaker horn. In 2009, Anastasio added a Nova Repeater (delay). He controls these devices singularly or in batch with a Custom Audio Electronics RS-10 footpedal bank.
( the effects system was hugely changed in late 2017- see treysguitarrig.com for most current info)

In the early 1990s, Anastasio employed a custom 2x12 speaker cabinet powered by either a 100W [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark III head or, later, a Custom Audio Electronics 3-channel preamp and Groove Tubes power amp. In mid-1997, he switched to a pair of modified 1965 Fender Deluxe Reverb amps, one serving as a backup. When Phish returned in 2009, Anastasio was back to using the Mesa Boogie MKIII. In 2013 he added a Bogner Shiva amp to his arsenal, which can still be seen on stage as recently as Summer Tour '14, though has not been used much during this tour.

Anastasio played three different [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] guitars by [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]]. The first is a D-45E which has East Indian Rosewood sides and back and a solid Sitka Spruce top. In 2005, Martin released a Trey Anastasio signature model acoustic guitar, with a dreadnought body with a curved Venetian cutaway. The guitar also has an Italian alpine spruce top, mahogany sides and a three-piece back with "wings" of mahogany and a center wedge of flame-figured Hawaiian koa (similar to a D-35). The guitar is finished with a flamed koa headplate and snowflake fingerboard inlays. Martin built only 141 of these guitars, which quickly sold out.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
As of 2017+, a Martin 1943 D28 is main guitar for standard tuning, Martin 1934 00028 for finger-style/open tunings, 1968 D35 for Drop and slack key tunings.

The history of Anastasio's guitars, rig and equipment has been meticulously documented by music writer Ryan Chiachiere on the blog Trey's Guitar Rig.<ref>{{cite web |title=Episode 119: Trey's Guitar Rig w/Ryan Chiachiere from Helping Friendly Podcast |url=https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/helping-friendly-podcast/e/51691041?autoplay=true |website=Stitcher.com |access-date=24 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

==Composition work==
In college, Anastasio studied composition under composer and arranger Ernie Stires. "Guelah Papyrus", featured on Phish's major label debut ''[[A Picture of Nectar]]'', includes a Stires-influenced [[fugue]] instrumental section called "The Asse Festival" as a bridge between verses. In the early years of Phish, many of Anastasio's compositions were [[through-composed]], intricate and detailed in conception (for example, "The Divided Sky", "[[You Enjoy Myself]]", "The Asse Festival", "The Squirming Coil", "Reba", "Fluff's Travels").  Anastasio has used [[improvisation]] as the driving force behind simplified songwriting, particularly in the music he has written for his touring and recording projects apart from Phish.
[[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]], a [[New Jersey]] computer systems professional and friend of Anastasio since his [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] childhood, has been his primary songwriting collaborator, acting as lyricist. Anastasio has often pulled lyrics for his music from large notebooks of poems and prose kept by Marshall, and the pair have taken working retreats during which they wrote and/or recorded demos of new material. One such demo, ''[[Trampled By Lambs and Pecked by the Dove]]'', has been commercially released, and many of the songs included on this release were reincarnated into Phish's 1998 album ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]''. Anastasio also writes a number of his own lyrics, including all of the lyrics on his first release with [[Columbia Records]], 2005's ''[[Shine (Trey Anastasio album)|Shine]]''.

One of Anastasio's signature compositional techniques is the use of episodic (or organic) form. "Fluff's Travels" and "You Enjoy Myself" are good examples of through-composed pieces which evolve from one musical idea to the other, never returning to a previous musical statement. This technique had been used in a rock music setting by relatively few before Phish ([[Frank Zappa]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] are two such examples).

Anastasio employs modal improvisation, first made popular by [[Miles Davis]] in the late 50s/early 60s.

Anastasio has also demonstrated skill at composing [[chamber music]] and music for orchestra, most notably on ''[[Seis De Mayo]]'', his second solo album, and in his collaborations with the Vermont Youth Orchestra.

On September 27, 2008, Anastasio and Orchestra Nashville premiered a new work titled ''Time Turns Elastic'', an original long-form piece that was orchestrated by composer and arranger Don Hart, and featured Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals. Anastasio previously collaborated with Hart and Orchestra Nashville in his orchestral performance of "Guyute" at Bonnaroo 2004. He performed the same composition at [[Carnegie Hall]] with the Vermont Youth Orchestra on September 14, 2004 and with the New York Philharmonic on September 12, 2009.  Trey played the Walt Disney Concert Hall accompanied by the Los Angeles Philharmonic on March 10, 2012.

Anastasio's 2012 album ''Traveler'' was a collaboration with producer Peter Katis, whose longtime band The Philistines Jr. opened for Phish at UVM early in their career.<ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/reel-time-trey-anastasio-discusses-traveler10/ Relix</ref>

Trey was nominated for a 2013 Best Original score Tony Award, an Outstanding New Score Drama Desk Award, and Outstanding Music and Outstanding Orchestrations Outer Critics Circle Awards for the musical ''Hands on a Hardbody''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html |title=The Tony Award Nominees  |publisher=Tony Awards |date=May 21, 2013 |access-date=March 4, 2014}}</ref> That year, he also received the Frederick Loewe Award from the Dramatists Guild of America, which recognizes achievement in a theatrical score.<ref name="auto"/>

''Hands on a Hardbody'' received nine 2012–2013 Drama Desk Awards, tying for most nominations, and winning in the Best Sound Design in a Musical category.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon Cox |url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/news/hands-on-a-hardbody-goes-the-distance-with-drama-desk-1200424332/ |title='Hands on a Hardbody' Goes the Distance With Drama Desk |work=Variety |date=April 29, 2013 |access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref>

Anastasio co-wrote the music for ''Hands on a Hardbody'' (along with Amanda Green) for a Broadway opening in March 2013. After only 56 performances, the show closed on April 13, making it the "fastest closing new musical of the season."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rothman |first=Lily |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/04/09/fastest-closing-new-broadway-musical-of-the-year-hands-on-a-hardbody/ |title=Fastest-Closing New Broadway Musical of the Year: Hands on a Hardbody |location=New York City |magazine=Time |date=April 9, 2013 |access-date=April 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Media appearances==
On March 15, 2010, Anastasio inducted one of his favorite bands, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], claiming it was "impossible to overstate what impact this band and musical philosophy had on me as a young musician. I'm forever in their debt."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8569584.stm | title= Abba receive Hall of Fame honour |work=BBC News  | date=March 16, 2010}}</ref> In addition to Anastasio's speech, Phish appeared and performed two Genesis songs, "[[Watcher of the Skies]]" and "[[No Reply At All]]". Genesis did not perform.

In June 2010, Anastasio appeared as a surprise musical guest on [[Conan O'Brien]]'s "[[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]]" stop at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theater]] where he performed "Alaska."

''Between Me and My Mind'', a documentary film directed by [[Steven Cantor]] about Anastasio's musical projects and Phish's 2018 New Year's Eve concert, was screened at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=A New Trey Anastasio Documentary, 'Between Me and My Mind,' Will Debut at the Tribeca Film Festival |url=https://relix.com/news/detail/a-new-trey-anastasio-documentary-between-me-and-my-mind-will-debut-at-the-tribeca-film-festival/ |website=Relix Media |access-date=31 March 2019 |date=14 March 2019}}</ref>

==The Barn==
"[[The Barn (recording studio)|The Barn]]", also known as "The Farmhouse", is the name given to Anastasio's rehearsal and recording facility in the countryside near [[Westford, Vermont]] in the state's Lamoille Valley region. It was reconstructed between 1996 and 1998 from an existing structure, the Alan Irish Barn. The Barn has been used by Phish and most of Anastasio's projects since 1999. The cover photo of the Phish album ''Farmhouse'' is of the outhouse located right next to The Barn.

Other artists who have recorded or performed at The Barn include Gordon Stone Band, [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Béla Fleck]], Swampadelica, [[John Patitucci]], [[DJ Logic]], [[Toots & the Maytals]], [[Tony Levin]], [[The Slip (band)|The Slip]], [[RAQ]], [[John Medeski]], [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]], Nicholas Cassarino, Van Ghost and Addison Groove Project, among others.

Beginning in 2006, The Barn was transformed from a commercial recording facility into a studio environment providing accommodations and work space for artists participating in the Seven Below residency program.
