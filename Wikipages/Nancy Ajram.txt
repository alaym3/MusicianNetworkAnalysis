Nancy Ajram was born into a [[Maronite Christian]] family on May 16, 1983, in [[Achrafieh]], a district in [[Beirut]], Lebanon. She is the eldest child of Nabil Ajram and Raymonda Aoun. She has one sister, Nadine, and one brother, Nabil Jr.<ref>{{cite web|title=بالصّور- تعرّف إلى شقيق نانسي عجرم وشقيقتها|url=http://www.mbc.net/ar/programs/arab-idol-s3/news/articles/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%91%D9%88%D8%B1--%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%91%D9%81-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B4%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-.html|website=MBC|language=ar}}</ref> Ajram was only eight when she started her journey singing the good oldies with her grandmother. She carried on with successful participation in children's contests in two local television stations, [[Télé Liban|TL]] and [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International|LBC]]. In 1995, at the age of twelve, Ajram took part in a variety show, [[Noujoum Al-Moustakbal]] (English: ''Stars of the Future'') on [[Future TV]], a Lebanese reality television competition, which finds new solo musical talent. Ajram won a gold medal in the Tarab category after singing a song by [[Umm Kulthum]].<ref name=gold>{{cite web|title=مشوار نانسي عجرم من الطفولة الى الشهرة بالصور|url=http://mashaheeri.yasmina.com/article/%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1_a18885/1|website=Mashaheeri|language=ar}}</ref> Ajram studied music with renowned Lebanese musicians and although she was less than 18 years old, the syndicate of professional artists in Lebanon accepted her as a member. At the age of 13, she released her first singles. The first was "Hobbak Allam Albi El Gheere", written by Antoine Harfouch and composed by Abdo Mounzer. The second was "Oulha Kelma Ala Shani".<ref>{{cite web|title=بالفيديو.. نانسي عجرم من الطفولة الى النجومية!|url=http://www.lebanondebate.com/news/183263|website=Lebanon Debate|language=ar}}</ref> At the age of 15, Ajram released her debut album, ''[[Mihtagalak]]'', followed by ''[[Sheel Oyoonak Anni]]'' three years later.

=== 2002–2004: Breakthrough and new image ===

In early 2002, Ajram signed a contract with renowned Lebanese producer and artist manager Jiji Lamara, four months after his splitting with Aline Khalaf. They started working together in preparation for the third studio album shifting her musical style and image away from the decent girl.<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم: أنا 'بنوتة بـ100 راجل' عند الضرورة|url=http://www.lahamag.com/article/5446-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A_%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85%3A_%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A7_%27%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%80100_%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%27_%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9|website=Laha Magazine|language=ar|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref> Ajram's breakthrough single, "Akhasmak Ah", was released in December. The music video caused a controversy; reminiscent of older [[Arabic]] films, she appeared as a café manager who dances and flirts with its customers. It received criticism from various news publications, and it was meant to be banned on several Arabic televisions due to its sexually suggestive content. However, in early 2003, Ajram rose to fame, propelled by the success of the single, and the release of her third studio album, ''[[Ya Salam]]'' which was a best-seller.<ref>{{cite web|title=دفاعاً عن الفنانة نانسي عجرم|url=http://www.almustaqbal.com/v4/Article.aspx?Type=np&Articleid=13733|website=Al Mustaqbal|language=ar|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908200706/http://www.almustaqbal.com/v4/Article.aspx?Type=np&Articleid=13733|archive-date=September 8, 2017}}</ref>

Her fourth album, ''[[Ah W Noss]]'', was released on April 14, 2004, and it was also an important marking point in Ajram's career. The tremendous success that ''Ah W Noss'' achieved, stabilized Ajram's position as an A-List star in the Arab music industry. Ajram then filmed "Lawn Ouyounak" (Color of Your Eyes), which portrayed Ajram as a bride in a traditional Lebanese wedding. After the release of the album, Ajram signed-up with [[Coca-Cola]] to be their official celebrity spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa region. Her first Coke commercial featured her hit, "Oul Tani Keda?" (Say That Again?), which was filmed with the international Italian director Luca Tomassini. The commercial's success led to it being filmed as a music video behind the scenes of the commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي وال'كوكا كولا'..!|url=http://www.farfesh.com/Display.asp?catID=159&mainCatID=158&sID=5084|website=Farfesh|language=ar}}</ref> The 4th hit single from the album, "Inta Eyh?" (What Are You?), was a slow composed by Samir Sfeir. [[Nadine Labaki]] directed another clip that featured Ajram as a wife who sees her husband cheating on her yet she hides it in torment to save their relationship. The music video received tremendous positive reviews and Ajram was greatly praised. Leading Egyptian actors and directors, like [[Faten Hamama]] praised Ajram's acting abilities and movie offers doubled for Ajram.<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم – لا أرضى أن يخونني رجل أحبه|url=https://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2005/07/28/15364.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|language=ar|date=July 28, 2005}}</ref>

=== 2005–2007: ''Ya Tabtab...Wa Dallaa'' and ''Shakhbat Shakhabit'' ===

Her fifth album, ''[[Ya Tabtab...Wa Dallaa]]'' was released on February 21, 2006. ''Ya Tabtab'' was considered Ajram's best album back then, with six music videos released, eight radio hits, and five songs used for commercials.<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم: لا أريد شهرة عالمية مقابل مبلغ مالي ادفعه..|url=http://www.farfesh.com/Display.asp?catID=159&mainCatID=158&sID=14460|website=Farfesh|language=ar}}</ref>
The title track's music video was Ajram's last collaboration with [[Nadine Labaki]], as she then started working on her movie [[Caramel (film)|Caramel]].<ref>{{cite web|title="سكّر بنات" عالم نسائي مبهج ومبسّط عائم فوق تناقضات مدينة ومجتمع|url=http://www.almustaqbal.com/v4/Article.aspx?Type=np&Articleid=245984|website=Al Mustaqbal|language=ar}}</ref> Ajram then released the video of her [[Coca-Cola]] hit "Moegaba" (Admirer), as well as a video and commercial for her newly signed Damas Jewellery contract advertising their "Farfasha" set. The song used was "Ana Yalli" (I'm the One) which was promoted before the album's release.<ref>{{cite web|title=اختيار نانسي عجرم سفيرة للشباب|url=http://www.almustaqbal.com/v4/article.aspx?type=NP&ArticleID=154707|website=Almustaqbal|language=ar}}</ref> Ajram then cooperated for the first time with prominent Lebanese director Said El Marouk, filming "Ehsas Jdeed" (A New Sentiment) which is widely considered to be the most successful song of the album. The video, which was a salute from Said to his deaf and mute parents, depicted the story of a rich woman who falls in love with a deaf and mute man.<ref>{{cite web|title=سعيد الماروق: لغة الصم والبكم إحساس وليست إشارات|url=http://archive.aawsat.com/details.asp?issueno=9896&article=390236|website=Asharq Alawsat|language=ar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=السر وراء كليب نانسي عجرم..

"El Donia Helwa", Ajram's seventh commercial, is considered one of her most successful commercials representing her style and [[Coca-Cola]]'s with colors, happiness, and music, and it led her to release a Live album featuring the single.<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم تتفوق على كاظم الساهر

Ajram's first album which was fully dedicated to children included a variety of songs aimed towards teaching children good values and morals, something she has wanted to do for a long time. The music video was her second cooperation with Said El Marouk and featured four songs from her album, the most successful of which were "Shakhbat Shakhabit" & "Shater Shater".<ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم "شخبط شخابيط" مهرجان للأطفال|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/257473|website=Al Riyadh|language=ar}}</ref> Ajram performed these songs at several fund-raising events for children and other children's events, such as the children's TV channel [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC3]], and the children's entertainment TV Show "Star Zghar".<ref>{{cite web|title=mbc3 تحتفل بانطلاقتها الثالثة بحضور الأطفال ونانسي عجرم|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/301617|website=Al Riyadh|language=ar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=نانسي عجرم "معجبة" بمواهب "ستار صغار"|url=http://elaph.com/Web/Music/2009/12/512950.htm|website=Elaph|language=ar}}</ref> She then filmed with Fadi Haddad, the director of photography of her previous works with El Marouk, a video for the song "Risala Lil Aalam" (A Message to the World) which talks about world peace. The video was released on May 25, 2008, the day the Lebanese president General Michel Suleiman was elected ending a deadlock that lasted since November. It was the first video for Ajram that had an entirely graphical world that implied the suffering of children worldwide and the need to bring out a more colorful and happy world for them. Old rumors claimed that the video was presented to the [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/72256005|title=Rissal ila al A'alam (Nancy Ajram video Clip)|via=vimeo.com}}</ref>

[[File:Nancy Ajram - Bahrain Concert 2010 - Dec 4, 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ajram during a concert in [[Bahrain]], 2010]]
On September 28, 2009, ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' aired an episode titled "Fame Around the World" that talked about the most famous celebrities around the globe in brief reports. Representing the Middle East region and Arab world, Ajram appeared in a report featured on the show and was described by Oprah as "the [[Britney Spears]] of the Middle East". Ajram is the first and only Middle-Eastern artist ever mentioned on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waleg.com/archives/017549.html|title=The Real Deal About Nancy on Oprah|website=Waleg}}</ref>

In the summer of 2010, Ajram was nominated by [[Coca-Cola]] the Middle East to sing, along with [[K'naan]], his international hit and song for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], "[[Wavin' Flag]]". The Arabic version, titled "Shaggaa Be Alamak" and directed to the Middle East region, had its [[Arabic]] parts written by Ayman Bahgat Amar (who previously wrote Ah W Noss, Ya Tabtab and Eftah Albak for Ajram) and the music remastered by Tarek Madkour. The original music video was used for [[K'naan]]'s parts while Ajram's parts were filmed separately in Lebanon on the same protocol under [[Leila Kanaan]]'s co-direction. Both the video and song were aired heavily during the FIFA season and part of the song was particularly played during commercial breaks on [[Al Jazeera]] channel, which exclusively aired the games to the Arab world. One month later, Ajram filmed a commercial for her newly signed contract with [[Lactalis]] advertising their [[Lactel]] yoghurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnation.me/news/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9/|title=نانسي عجرم وجه اعلاني لشركة عالمية مرة جديدة|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref>

Ajram herself sustained a minor injury on her right leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/79360/Nancy-Ajram-s-husband-kills-Syrian-who-entered-their-villa|title=Nancy Ajram's husband kills Syrian who entered their villa for theft|magazine=Egypt Today|first=Angy|last=Essam|date=January 5, 2020|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> On January 7, El Hachem was released from prison with prevention from travelling abroad until investigations are concluded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://al-ain.com/article/nancy-ajram-fadi-alhashem-release-murder|title=إخلاء سبيل زوج نانسي عجرم.. وأسرة القتيل تفجر مفاجأة|website=al-ain.com|language=ar|date=7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.egyptindependent.com/lebanese-court-releases-singer-nancy-ajrams-husband-fady-al-hashem/|title=Lebanese court releases singer Nancy Ajram’s husband Fady al-Hashem|website=Egypt Independent|date=8 January 2020}}</ref> Ajram noted that her husband's "reaction to the killer was after intense threatening that took place for almost 6 to 7 minutes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/79578/28-lawyers-announced-their-solidarity-with-Ajram’s-villa-slain|title=28 lawyers announced their solidarity with Ajram’s villa slain|last=Essam|first=Angy|date=2020-01-12|website=EgyptToday|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>

Other sources reported that the murdered trespasser was born in 1989 in [[Basqala]], [[Idlib Governorate]], Syria, who was married with kids, and used to work as a gardener for El Hachem, hence he broke in with a fake unloaded gun, asking for his unpaid financial dues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/entertainment/2020/1/8/%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%82-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7|script-title=ar: تعليق نانسي عجرم ووالد القتيل على جريمة الفيلا|website=alaraby.co.uk|language=ar|date=8 January 2020}}</ref> Meanwhile, Ajram denied that they knew him nor he worked for them.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRGvSu2UVA#t=137 |script-title=ar:المؤتمر الصحافي الكامل للفنانة نانسي عجرم |trans-title=The full press conference of the artist Nancy Ajram |publisher=LBCI Lebanon |language=ar |date=8 January 2020 |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The trespasser was seen masked via [[CCTV]], who waited outside for a couple of hours before entering the villa, despite the existence of bodyguards. Later on, he pointed a gun at El Hachem before he entered the children's room, when El Hachem claimed that he acted in self-defense and shot and killed the trespasser. According to the forensic pathology report, Al-Moussa was shot 17 times with a [[Glock 17]] pistol:<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLUI-qlHLE&ab_channel=MBC1#t=2m1s |script-title=ar:وقت إطلاق النار ونوع المسدس الذي استخدمه زوج نانسي عجرم للدفاع عن نفسه.. دقائق تحبس الأنفاس |trans-title=The time of shooting and the type of pistol that Nancy Ajram's husband used to defend himself ... minutes are breathtaking |website=MBC1 |language=ar |date=17 October 2020 |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> once in the right forearm, twice in the left shoulder, once under the left armpit, three shots in the chest, two shots in the abdomen, seven shots in the back, and one shot in the left thigh.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200116-nancy-ajrams-husband-charged-with-intentional-murder-by-lebanon-prosecutor/ |title=Nancy Ajram's husband charged with 'intentional murder' by Lebanon prosecutor |website=Middle East Monitor |date=16 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alhurra.com/a/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A3%D9%85-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85/528264.html|title=سارق أم عامل لدى زوجها؟ تفاصيل جديدة عن حادثة منزل نانسي عجرم|website=alhurra.com|language=ar|date=7 January 2020}}</ref> In the meantime, Ajram was hiding in the bathroom shaking while calling her father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/nancy-ajram-speaks-out-for-the-first-time-since-burglar-was-killed-at-her-home-i-was-shaking-and-in-an-indescribable-condition-1.961639|title=Nancy Ajram speaks out for the first time since burglar was killed at her home: 'I was shaking and in an indescribable condition'|website=The National|date=8 January 2020}}</ref> The family of the burglar initially refused to take his corpse from hospital, since El Hachem was released from custody before burial, which contradicts their traditions;<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmqyB_CGAec#t=50 |script-title=ar:والد السارق الذي قتل على يد فادي الهاشم زوج نانسي عجرم يطل للمرة الأولى ويؤكد نحن عشائر |trans-title=The father of the thief who was killed by Fadi Al-Hashem, Nancy Ajram's husband, appears for the first time and confirms that we are clans |website=Aljadeed Fan |language=ar |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> however, they took the corpse to be buried in Damascus as investigations should continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emaratalyoum.com/life/four-sides/2020-01-08-1.1293343|title=أسرة "قتيل" منزل نانسي عجرم توافق على تسلّم الجثة لدفنها في دمشق|website=emaratalyoum.com|language=ar|date=8 January 2020}}</ref>
