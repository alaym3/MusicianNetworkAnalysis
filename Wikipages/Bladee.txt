== Early life ==
Benjamin Reichwald was born 9 April 1994 in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]<ref name="Thanks" /> and was raised mainly in the [[Skanstull]] area.<ref name="BeingBladee" /> It was here where, in 2004, he met fellow Gravity Boys member Zak Arogundade, also known as [[Ecco2K|Ecco2k]]. The two were classmates and formed punk band Krossad (Swedish for 'crushed') when Reichwald was 13, which led to Reichwald's interest in music.<ref name="BeingBladee">{{Cite web |last=Angell |first=Jack |date=2019-09-17 |title=Being Bladee: In a rare interview, the Drain Gang CEO opens up about the distinctive world he’s created. |url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/17/bladee-interview-drain-gang-trash-island |url-status=live |access-date=2021-09-24 |website=[[The Fader]] |language=en |archive-date=2019-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920085056/https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/17/bladee-interview-drain-gang-trash-island }}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Nast|first=Condé|date=2021-04-06|title=Meet Bladee, the Swedish Musician Who Stars in the New Heaven by Marc Jacobs Lookbook|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/meet-bladee-benjamin-reichwald-swedish-musician|access-date=2021-09-24|website=Vogue|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416120741/https://www.vogue.com/article/meet-bladee-benjamin-reichwald-swedish-musician|url-status=live}}</ref>

He eventually became friends with Swedish rapper [[Yung Lean]], who was a friend of Reichwald's brother. Reichwald eventually sent a message to Sad Boys member Yung Sherman on SoundCloud, asking to collaborate, which resulted in a working relationship between his own Gravity Boys collective and Lean's Sad Boys Entertainment. Reichwald and Lean then made "Heal You // Bladerunner" from Lean's Unknown Death 2002 mixtape, which gave him attention from Lean's fanbase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2014/07/16/taking-arizona-iced-tea-and-making-it-cry-an-interview-with-yung-lean-and-the-sad-boys|title="Taking Arizona Iced Tea and Making It Cry": An Interview with Yung Lean and the Sad Boys|website=The FADER|language=en|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-date=2019-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422194819/http://www.thefader.com/2014/07/16/taking-arizona-iced-tea-and-making-it-cry-an-interview-with-yung-lean-and-the-sad-boys|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
Reichwald has described his style as "pain" though saying, as of 2018, he had "evolved into some sort of auto-tuned dark angel".<ref name="need to know" /> He often experiments, incorporating various genres. He has stated that he finds the process therapeutic.<ref name="BeingBladee" />

In an interview with Reichwald, Jack Angell, a music writer for [[The Fader]], described Reichwald's sound as "frostbitten futurism" and remarked that Reichwald's music evokes "a wide spectrum of emotion".<ref name="BeingBladee" /> He has received attention for his collaborations and live performances with [[Yung Lean]].<ref name="debut Decay">{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Steffanee |title=Bladee debuts "Decay," our first taste of new album Red Light |url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/05/02/bladee-decay-video-red-light-album |website=[[The Fader]] |publisher=Andy Cohn |access-date=19 July 2018 |archive-date=19 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719233919/https://www.thefader.com/2018/05/02/bladee-decay-video-red-light-album |url-status=live }}</ref>
