'''Wonder Girls''' ({{ko-hhrm|원더걸스}}) was a South Korean [[girl group]] formed by [[JYP Entertainment]]. The group debuted in February 2007 with the single "[[Irony (Wonder Girls song)|Irony]]" and 5 members: [[Park Ye-eun|Yeeun]], [[Sunye]], [[Sunmi]], [[Hyuna]] and [[Ahn So-hee|Sohee]]. After Hyuna's departure in July, [[Kim Yu-bin (musician)|Yubin]] was added into the group prior to the release of their debut studio album, ''[[The Wonder Years (Wonder Girls album)|The Wonder Years]]'' (2007). The album spawned the hit single "[[Tell Me (Wonder Girls song)|Tell Me]]," which topped various South Korea's on and offline music charts.

Wonder Girls further established themselves as one of the top girl groups in the country with the hit singles "[[So Hot]]" and "[[Nobody (Wonder Girls song)|Nobody]]," released in 2008. After being released as a single in the U.S. in 2009, "Nobody" charted at #76 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making Wonder Girls the first South Korean act to enter the chart.<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266974/jay-sean-recaptures-hot-100s-top-slot|title=Jay Sean Recaptures Hot 100's Top Slot|first=Silvio|last=Pietroluongo|date=October 22, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=October 22, 2009|archive-date=April 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426070513/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266974/jay-sean-recaptures-hot-100s-top-slot|url-status=live}}</ref> The group began their entry into the American market the same year as an opening act for the [[Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009|Jonas Brothers' World Tour]], performing English versions of their songs.

In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career and was replaced by [[Woo Hye-lim|Hyerim]] prior to the Korean & US releases of the single "2 Different Tears." Their second studio album, ''[[Wonder World (album)|Wonder World]]'' (2011), yielded the successful single "Be My Baby." In 2012, Wonder Girls starred in the [[TeenNick]] movie ''The Wonder Girls'', and released their last 3 singles as a quintet, notably "[[Wonder Party|Like This]]" and "[[Like Money (song)|Like Money]]," before going on a 3-year long hiatus. In 2015, it was announced that Sunye and Sohee decided to leave the group while Sunmi would resume promotion with the remaining members. The 4-piece adapted a [[Band (rock and pop)|band]]-oriented concept for their acclaimed third and final studio album, ''[[Reboot (Wonder Girls album)|Reboot]]'' (2015), and the #1 2016 single "[[Why So Lonely]]."

[[File:Wonder Girls-HanyangUniv 05R.jpg|thumbnail|left|Wonder Girls performing "Irony" at [[Hanyang University]] in March 2007. From left to right: Sohee, Hyuna, Yeeun, Sunye and Sunmi]]
After Park Jin-young revealed the name of his first girl group Wonder Girls in May 2006, the Wonder Girls were introduced through a TV show titled ''[[MTV Wonder Girls#Season 1|MTV Wonder Girls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Wonder_Girls|title=Wonder Girls - generasia|website=www.generasia.com|access-date=June 25, 2017|archive-date=June 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621064735/http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Wonder_Girls|url-status=live}}</ref> The first four episodes outlined the characteristics and profiles of each member. Shortly after selecting [[Park Ye-eun|Yeeun]] as the fifth member, the Wonder Girls held their first showcase in the MTV Studio. They performed a cover version of "[[Don't Cha]]" by the [[Pussycat Dolls]] as well as original songs, including "Irony" and "{{lang|ko|미안한 마음}}" ("It's Not Love"). [[Sunye]] sang her version of [[Destiny's Child]]'s "[[Stand Up for Love]]", while [[Hyuna]] performed a showcase of her dancing skills. The other three members—Yeeun, [[Sunmi]] and [[Ahn So-hee|Sohee]]—performed a cover version of [[Janet Jackson]]'s "[[Together Again (Janet Jackson song)|Together Again]]".

The Wonder Girls officially debuted in early 2007 on [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]]'s ''[[Show! Music Core]]'', performing "[[Irony (Wonder Girls song)|Irony]]", the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] single from their first album, ''The Wonder Begins''.

Their first full-length album, ''[[The Wonder Years (Wonder Girls album)|The Wonder Years]]'', was released the following week with "Tell Me" as the lead single. Due to the last-minute addition of Yubin, the album version does not contain her part. However, the performance version of the song was reworked to include a bridge with rapping by Yubin.

==Artistry and influences==

===Musical styles===
The Wonder Girls are known for their signature retro sound and concept. Their music has been noted to contain elements from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="popcrush.com"/> The Wonder Girls are known as "South Korea's Retro Queens",<ref name="auto"/> as their music has been noted to contain elements from the 1960s, such as in their hit "Nobody", 1970s, such as in the [[reggae]] track "Why So Lonely", and 1980s, heard on the songs "Tell Me", "So Hot", "2 Different Tears", "Be My Baby" and "I Feel You". Their music videos also allude to vintage fashion and performance, with "Nobody" being mostly inspired by African-American 1960s culture and famous R&B group [[The Supremes]], while "I Feel You" takes place in 1987 and shows the members playing their own instruments and various other scenes with heavy 1980s inspiration.

==Band members==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}
The group consisted of five members at the time of its debut in 2007: [[Sunye]], [[Ahn So-hee|Sohee]], [[Hyuna]], [[Sunmi]] and [[Park Ye-eun|Yeeun]]. Shortly after, in the same year, Hyuna left the group due to concerns over her health, which led to the addition of [[Kim Yu-bin (musician)|Yubin]] as replacement. In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career, and trainee [[Woo Hye-lim|Hyerim]] was selected as her replacement. Sohee departed from the group in late 2013 following the expiration of her contract with JYP Entertainment, while Sunye left the group in late 2014; their departures were officially announced in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolwow.com/latest/sunye-and-sohee-confirm-they-will-never-return-to-wonder-girls-20150721|title=Sunye and Sohee Confirm Wonder Girls Departure - IdolWow!|date=July 21, 2015|website=idolwow.com|access-date=June 25, 2017|archive-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812074844/http://idolwow.com/latest/sunye-and-sohee-confirm-they-will-never-return-to-wonder-girls-20150721|url-status=live}}</ref> For the group's 2015 comeback, Sunmi returned to the group, and served as a member alongside Yeeun, Yubin, and Hyerim; the Wonder Girls remained as four-piece band until their disbandment in 2017.
