'''Carlos Coy''' (born October 5, 1970), known professionally as '''SPM''' (a [[backronym]] for '''South Park Mexican'''), is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, founder of [[Dope House Records]], and convicted sex offender. His stage name is derived from the [[South Park, Houston, Texas|South Park]] neighborhood in [[Houston, Texas]] where he was raised.

Coy started his musical career in 1994. One year later, he, his brother Arthur, and one of their friends founded Dope House Records. Coy debuted as South Park Mexican that same year with the album ''Hillwood'' under the same label. 

In 2002, Coy was convicted of [[sexual assault|aggravated sexual assault of a child]] and sentenced to 45 years [[incarceration]], and is currently serving his sentence at the [[Ramsey Unit]] in [[Rosharon, Texas]]. He is eligible for [[parole]] in 2024. While incarcerated, he has continued to record music.

==Early life==
Coy's father Arturo was a [[United States Marines|Marine]] from [[Falfurrias, Texas]]; Coy's mother dropped out of high school to marry Arturo. Their marriage ended three years after Coy's birth. Coy's sister, Sylvia, described herself as his "mother/sister". He attended various elementary schools, before entering the music magnet program at Welch Middle School. His family moved from southeast Houston to [[South Park, Houston|South Park]], and he attended [[Woodson K-8 School|Woodson Middle School]]. He became a [[crack cocaine]] dealer during this time (in his early teens). Rapper [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] (real name Brad Jordan) also attended Woodson. He attended [[Milby High School]] until he was expelled in 1987 while in the ninth grade. Coy obtained a [[GED]] and enrolled in [[San Jacinto Junior College]] for a business 
[[associate's degree]] but failed all his classes there. He then worked at a chemical plant for minimum wage, but after being again unemployed he worked as a door-to-door perfume salesman and continued being a [[crack cocaine]] dealer.<ref name="South Park Monster">{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/news/south-park-monster-6587539|title=South Park Monster|last=Lomax|first=John Nova|date=June 6, 2002|work=Houston Press|access-date=August 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317171955/http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-06-06/news/south-park-monster/full|archive-date=March 17, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
Coy began his career as a [[Christian hip hop|Christian rapper]], but felt that doing so made him an outcast. In 1994, Coy started rapping and recording songs as South Park Mexican and SPM. In 1995, Coy, along with his brother Arthur Jr. and friend Jose Antonio Garza from [[McAllen, Texas]], founded his own record label, [[Dope House Records]].<ref name="South Park Monster"/> As South Park Mexican (SPM), Coy released his debut album, ''[[Hillwood (album)|Hillwood]]'', in March 1995. Coy promoted his first album for two years and by 1997 he started working on his second album. He released his second album, ''[[Hustle Town]]'', in March 1998. The album became a hit in the Houston underground rap scene.

On December 22, 1998 Coy released his third album, ''Power Moves: The Table'', which garnered mainstream attention. On November 23, 1999, he released his fourth album, "[[The 3rd Wish: To Rock the World]]"; its lead single, "High So High" charted at #50 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Rap Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1999_3179397|title=SPM creating a buzz with 'Third Wish'|last=Guerra|first=Joey|date=November 23, 1999|work=Houston Chronicle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604162234/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1999_3179397|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Billboard"/> In February 2000, he signed a joint venture between his label and Universal Music Group which earned him a $500,000 advance and national distribution.<ref name="South Park Monster"/> Universal released three of Coy's albums: ''Time is Money'' and ''The Purity Album'' (2000) and ''Never Change'' (2001). ''The Purity Album'' included the single "You Know My Name", which peaked at #99 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart and #31 on the rap chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' writer Ramiro Burr summarized South Park Mexican's lyrical content in a 2001 profile: "SPM delivers raunchy lyrics about growing up in the barrio and living the party life. But he says he also focuses on working hard and having hope for a better life."<ref name="stop the party">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010213210504/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/features/burr/787713|archive-date=February 13, 2001|title= South Park Mexican says it's time to stop the party |last=Burr|first=Ramiro|work=Houston Chronicle|date=January 5, 2001|url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Latin-music-South-Park-Mexican-says-it-s-time-to-2007267.php|access-date=August 7, 2020|url-status=dead}}</reF>

His Universal releases did not gain much mainstream attention; Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] suggested,"Coy's [[hardcore rap]]ping proved to be too harsh for the masses". His 2002 album ''Reveille Park'', a compilation of [[freestyle rap|freestyles]], was released by Dope House.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/south-park-mexican-mn0000742236/biography|title=South Park Mexican > Biography|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|year=2002|publisher=allmusic|access-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref> Dope House released two new albums that Coy recorded while incarcerated: ''When Devils Strike'', released in 2006, debuted at #46 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542847/20061011/evanescence.jhtml|title=Evanescence Butcher The Killers In Battle For Billboard #1|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=October 11, 2006|publisher=MTV News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130012837/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542847/20061011/evanescence.jhtml|archive-date=November 30, 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref> and ''The Last Chair Violinist'' followed in 2008.
