'''Pedro the Lion''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. [[David Bazan]] formed the band in 1995 and represented its main creative force, backed by a varying rotation of collaborating musicians. In 2006 Pedro the Lion was dissolved as Bazan went solo; Bazan reformed the band and resumed performing under the Pedro the Lion moniker in late 2017. Releasing five full-length albums and five EPs over 11&nbsp;years, the band is known for its [[first person narrative]] lyrics with political and religious themes.

== Biography ==
Pedro the Lion was formed by [[David Bazan]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web | title=David Bazan – Official Website | work=DavidBazan.com | url=http://www.davidbazan.com/pedro-the-lion.php | access-date = 2006-12-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208204658/http://www.davidbazan.com/pedro-the-lion.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-12-08}}</ref> In 1997 they released their debut EP ''Whole'' with Bazan playing nearly every instrument, a format he continued on the band's first two full-length albums, ''[[It's Hard to Find a Friend]]'' (1998), and ''[[Winners Never Quit]]'' (2000).

''Winners'' marked Pedro the Lion's first [[concept album]].<ref name="other journal">{{cite web|title=An interview with David Bazan|url=http://www.theotherjournal.com/article.php?id=32|author=Josh Holden|publisher=The Other Journal at [[Mars Hill Graduate School]]|access-date=2010-03-29|date=2004-01-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115093828/http://www.theotherjournal.com/article.php?id=32|archive-date=2007-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After its completion, Bazan has claimed he initially decided not to continue writing concept albums.<ref name="other journal"/>  However, in the process of writing his next full-length ''[[Control (Pedro the Lion album)|Control]]'', he realized he had inadvertently created a narrative link "about 70% of the way through [the album]" and decided to finish it in the same vein.<ref name="other journal"/>  The album's thematic content criticizes American [[capitalism]], which Bazan notes was largely inspired by the sentiments surrounding the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|World Trade Organization protests in 1999]].<ref name="other journal"/>

''Control'' also saw Casey Foubert of [[Seattle]]-based Seldom join Pedro the Lion to play bass on the album. Additionally, he co-wrote "Penetration" and "Second Best", the third and eighth tracks, respectively, on the album, which was released in 2002.

''[[Achilles Heel (album)|Achilles Heel]]'' followed, released on May 24, 2004, and marked the beginning of Bazan's partnership with [[Tim Walsh (musician)|TW&nbsp;Walsh]] as the band's primary writers and musicians.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pedro the Lion: Sharing the Lion's Den | work=TimMcMahan.com | url=http://www.timmcmahan.com/pedro2.htm | access-date = 2006-06-09}}</ref>  Bazan described the tracks in the third full-length from Pedro the Lion as a return to the songwriting characterized by ''Friend'' and the ''Secure''&nbsp;EP in the sense that there was no "pretense of anything bigger", an allusion to his previous concept albums.<ref name="other journal"/>

In early January 2006, Pedro the Lion formally announced that they had split. The split was amicable; Bazan and Walsh continue to be good friends. Bazan said that their friendship has even been strengthened by the breakup.<ref>{{cite news | first=Matthew | last=Brundage | title=Interview with David Bazan | date=February 11, 2006| publisher=Iota Club and Cafe, Arlington, VA}}</ref>  Bazan toured in support of ''[[Fewer Moving Parts]]'', his solo debut EP. Walsh returned to his career as a Web application developer and is busy with his band, [[The Soft Drugs]], and their debut release, ''In Moderation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardtofindafriend.blogspot.com/2006/11/conversation-with-tw-walsh_20.html|title=A Conversation with TW Walsh|work=hardtofindafriend.com|access-date=2007-10-27}}</ref>  David Bazan released his debut solo LP, ''[[Curse Your Branches]]'', on [[Seattle]]-based [[Barsuk Records]] in 2009.

The Pedro The Lion catalog was remastered for vinyl by TW&nbsp;Walsh and reissued in 2012.

Bazan is a member of [[Overseas (band)|Overseas]] with [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]] of  [[Centro-matic]] and [[Bubba & Matt Kadane]] of [[Bedhead (band)|Bedhead]] and [[The New Year]]. Their self-titled debut album was released on June 11, 2013.

Beginning in spring 2017, Bazan began forming a new band which he initially envisioned billing as "David Bazan Band" or something similar.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sasquatchfestival.com/lineup#/lineup_groupings/full-lineup |title=Sasquatch! 2018 Music Festival Lineup |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018-05-01 |website=Sasquatch Festival |publisher=LiveNation |access-date=2018-05-07 |quote=Last spring, after 11 years of performing and recording under his own name, Dave Bazan's growing fatigue with working alone hit a tipping point. "I missed the energy of making music with other people on stage and constantly traveling alone was starting to really sting", Bazan recalls. "I needed to be in a band again". At that point, assuming this new band would be billed as "David Bazan Band" or similar, he began to set the wheels in motion to make it happen. He rented a rehearsal space again, hired a couple buddies for upcoming tours, and started fleshing out demos for the band to cue off of. He didn't realize it at first, but by mid-summer something big started to dawn on him: he had stumbled back into the very same process that yielded the first three Pedro the Lion records. "To my surprise, it felt a bit like coming home."}}</ref>  In October 2017, Bazan announced that Pedro the Lion would be reforming beginning with several shows in December 2017.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=David Bazan |author-link=David_Bazan |user=davidbazan |number=915595037601275905 |date=2017-10-04 |title=Here we go}}</ref> Asked if there would be new material Bazan explained that the band will initially be playing Pedro the Lion's existing catalog along with limited performances of songs from [[Headphones (band)|Headphones]] and Bazan's solo catalog, with new material to follow.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=David Bazan |author-link=David_Bazan |user=davidbazan |number=915597747096449024 |date=2017-10-04 |title=Full band playing pedro catalog to start.
