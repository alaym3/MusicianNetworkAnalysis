On December 23, 2015, Marx married entrepreneur and former [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] [[Daisy Fuentes]] in [[Aspen, Colorado]], as confirmed on his official Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/richardmarxmusic/photos/a.181896790554.155690.170148395554/10153921062390555/?type=3&theater|title=Wedding Announcement|publisher=Richard Marx Music Official Facebook|date=December 25, 2015|access-date=December 25, 2015}}</ref>

On December 21, 2016, it was reported that Marx helped [[Korean Air]] flight attendants pacify an unruly, possibly intoxicated passenger while he and his wife were aboard a flight bound from Hanoi to Seoul,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2016/12/21/richard-marx-helps-subdue-unruly-passenger-mid-flight/|title=Richard Marx helps subdue unruly passenger mid flight|publisher=Reuters|via=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|access-date=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38388451|title=Singer Richard Marx 'restrains unruly man' on Korean Air flight|date=December 21, 2016|publisher=BBC|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> even providing photographic evidence of the incident.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=richardmarx|first=Richard|last=Marx|number=811154610882637824|title=You will be hearing about our flight#480 on @KoreanAir_KE .

In response to this, Korean Air said in a press conference that they will be more assertive about passengers exhibiting similar violent behavior, even to hiring more male flight attendants and "readily use [[Taser|stun guns]]" in case of more serious behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kal-safety/stun-guns-and-male-crew-korean-air-to-get-tough-on-unruly-passengers-idUSKBN14G02M|date=December 27, 2016 |title=Stun guns and male crew: Korean Air to get tough on unruly passengers|first=Hyunjoo|last=Jin|publisher=Reuters|access-date=September 19, 2017}}</ref>
