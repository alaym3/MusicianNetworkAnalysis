'''Muna''' (stylized as '''MUNA''') ({{ipac-en|ˈ|m|uː|n|ə}} {{respell|MOON|ə}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xModLBUY9uQ|title=4 Things About MUNA You Should Know!|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[YouTube]]|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=March 22, 2021}}</ref>) is an American [[electronic pop]] band consisting of Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin, and Naomi McPherson.

==History==
Based in [[Los Angeles]], the trio met in college at the [[University of Southern California]] and began working together in 2013 with Maskin and McPherson playing together on guitars and Gavin adding synth bass and vocals. Gavin and Maskin were music majors, while McPherson double-majored in Narrative Studies and American Studies & Ethnicity.<ref name="auto">Avery Stone, "[https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/muna-on-their-own-terms-interview MUNA On Their Own Terms: "If We're Lucky Enough to Have a Platform, We Should Use That to Help People"]", ''Noisey'', May 10, 2016</ref> The two guitarists, Maskin and McPherson, had been used to playing [[ska]] and [[progressive rock]], but settled on a different sound when their initial collaboration with singer Gavin resulted in a pop song.<ref name="auto1">Mark Savage, "[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37476668 Muna interview: Defiant pop from LA rising stars]", ''BBC'', September 28, 2016</ref>

Beginning their collaboration in an experimental mode, they evolved towards hooky [[electronic pop]]. In the summer of 2014, they self-released their debut EP, ''More Perfect'', on [[Bandcamp]] and [[SoundCloud]]. Its success led to their signing by [[RCA Records]] in the US and [[Columbia Records]] in the UK. RCA released their self-produced debut major label EP, ''Loudspeaker'', in May 2016. Their debut full-length album, ''[[About U]]'', was released on February 3, 2017.

All three members identify as [[queer]]<ref name="auto1"/> and McPherson is [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/flurtcobain/status/965453829742514176|url=https://twitter.com/flurtcobain/status/965453829742514176|access-date=2021-04-10|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> Initially wary of being pigeonholed as a "queer band," they later came to embrace the opportunity to use their musical notoriety to help inspire younger people to be comfortable with their identities. Their songs frequently address issues of sexuality and gender. They describe one early song, "So Special", as "an anthem for the slut-shamed girls of the world who have to assert their own value."<ref name="auto1"/> According to McPherson, "It would have meant a lot to me when I was, say, 12, to know of someone in a band and think they were cool ''and'' know they were out."<ref name="auto"/> McPherson added, "I am out and I feel safe being out because the three of us are a little army for one another. I don't feel afraid to be myself. That makes me proud to be queer. That's the whole point of why we do this. We want a safe haven."<ref>Ian David Monroe, "[http://vmagazine.com/article/muna-pioneering-new-identity-pop-music/ MUNA Are Pioneering a New Identity in Pop Music]", ''V Magazine'', November 4, 2016</ref>

In 2017, their song "I Know a Place" was featured in [[The Carmilla Movie]], following the original [[Carmilla (series)|web series]] based on [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s [[Carmilla|novella of the same name]]. In 2018, Muna was featured playing "I Know a Place" live in the Netflix movie, [[Alex Strangelove]], which chronicles the sexual awakening of its teen protagonist, Alex Truelove.

In 2018, the band began work on their second full-length record. In June 2019, the band announced their second album, ''[[Saves the World]]'', which was released on September 6, 2019. The album was preceded by its lead single, "Number One Fan", followed by the singles "Who" and "Stayaway". Following their London shows at the Village Underground,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2SGFk4hkoN/|title=Rᴀᴄʜ ✿ on Instagram: "muna were so good last night, even mum enjoyed the show! #concert #muna #music"|website=Instagram}}</ref> it was announced that Muna would be returning to the UK for their Saves the World Tour in December 2019.

In May 2021, it was announced that the band signed with [[Phoebe Bridgers|Phoebe Bridgers']] record label Saddest Factory, which operates in partnership with Secretly Group's [[Dead Oceans]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-19|title=MUNA sign to Phoebe Bridgers' label Saddest Factory Records|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/muna-sign-to-phoebe-bridgers-label-saddest-factory-records-2944114|access-date=2021-05-19|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On Sept, 7, 2021 the band released their single "Silk Chiffon" ft Phoebe Bridgers, their first since signing to Saddest Factory. With [[Rolling Stone]] calling it an "Buoyant track with an uncharacteristically bright declaration of Queer Love."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zemler|first=Emily|date=2021-11-09|title=Phoebe Bridgers Takes Muna to Prom With 'Silk Chiffon' on 'Corden'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/phoebe-bridgers-muna-silk-chiffon-corden-1255237/|access-date=2021-11-17|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>
