'''Zebda''' is a [[France|French]] music group from [[Toulouse]], [[France]], known for its political activism and its wide variety of musical styles.  The group, which was formed in 1985, consisted of seven musicians of diverse nationalities, and the themes of much of their music involved political and social justice, the status of immigrants and minorities in France, and the inhabitants of the French ''[[banlieues]]'', or suburbs.<ref name="devoir">{{cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/2003/08/02/33069.html | title=Zebda aux Francofolies – La fête avec du sens | last=Lamarche | first=Bernard |work=Le Devoir |location=Canada  | date=3 August 2003 | access-date=18 December 2008 | quote=Zebda continue de parler d'exclusion, de racisme, de tolérance et de son contraire.|language=fr}}<br/>English: "Zebda continues to talk about exclusion, racism, tolerance and its opposite."</ref> Zebda earned widespread recognition, as well as several awards, for its 1998 single "[[Tomber la chemise]]" ("Take Off Your Shirt").<ref name="burke"/> In 2001, the band spearheaded an independent political party that won over 12% of the first-round vote in [[2001 French municipal elections|Toulouse's municipal elections]].  The group disbanded in 2003 but reformed in 2011.

==History==
Zebda was first formed in 1985 when [[Magyd Cherfi]], a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] at the time, organized a small group of his musician friends to shoot a video for a community organization for which he was working.<ref name="RFI">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6150.asp |work=[[Radio France Internationale]] |title=Zebda |date=September 2005 |access-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202143800/http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6150.asp |archive-date=2 December 2008 }}</ref> More members joined the group later—several of the members met one another through involvement in community projects geared towards supporting arts and music involvement among Toulouse youth.<ref name="JE4">{{cite journal | url=http://www.acme-journal.org/vol7/JEr.pdf | journal=Acme Journal | last=Ervine | first=Jonathan | volume=7 | title=Citizenship and Belonging in Suburban France: The Music of ''Zebda'' | access-date=29 October 2008 | issue=2}} Page 4.</ref> The group began performing together regularly in 1988.<ref name="RFI"/> The band gained widespread recognition when they performed at the [[Printemps de Bourges]] music festival in 1990 and then performed on an international tour which included venues in Great Britain, [[Italy]] and [[France]].<ref name="RFI"/>

The group released its first album, ''[[L'arène des rumeurs]]'', in 1992, under the label of [[Barclay Records]].<ref name="RFI"/> As the band toured and performed, the members continued to be active in community work, and Zebda became known for its politicized lyrics. Its 1995 album, ''[[Le bruit et l'odeur (album)|Le bruit et l'odeur]]'' ("The Noise and the Smell") took its name from a gaffe made by then-president [[Jacques Chirac]] in reference to the conditions in the French ''banlieues'', many of which have large immigrant populations.<ref name="JE3">{{cite journal | url=http://www.acme-journal.org/vol7/JEr.pdf | journal=Acme Journal | last=Ervine | first=Jonathan | volume=7 | title=Citizenship and Belonging in Suburban France: The Music of ''Zebda'' | access-date=29 October 2008 | issue=2}} Page 3.</ref> The record itself had a strong critical and commercial reception and has been said to have "cause[d] a major stir" in France.<ref name="RFI"/>

In 2003, Zebda released its only live album, ''[[La Tawa (album)|La Tawa]]'', after which the band split up.<ref name="RFI"/><ref name="JE4"/>

The group reformed in 2011 and toured France.

''Zebda'' (زبدة, [[DIN 31635|transliterated]] ''Zibdah''), the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for butter (''beurre'' in French), is a play on the word ''[[beur]]'', a [[Verlan|French slang]] word referring to French citizens of Arab origin<ref name="burke">{{cite news|last=Burke|first=Rose Marie|date=11 February 2000|work=[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]|title=Rai Music Reigns in France As 'Bears' Assert Their Roots |quote=One big 1999 hit was "Tomber la Chemise" ("Take Off Your Shirt") by the Franco-Arab group Zebda (meaning butter, or beurre in French, a play on the word Beur)...|access-date=18 December 2008|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB950225549485884683?mod=googlewsj}}</ref><ref name="Crumley">{{cite web | url=http://www.culturekiosque.com/nouveau/portrait/rhezebda.html | last=Crumley | first=Bruce | date=29 September 1999 | access-date=29 October 2008 | title=Zebda: the Sound of the New France | work=Culture Kiosque}}{{Dead link|date=March 2021}}</ref><ref name="mahieux">{{cite web | url=http://www.politis.fr/Tomber-la-chemise,388.html | title=Tomber la Chemise | last=Mahieux | first=Léonore | date=19 February 2007 | access-date=18 December 2008 | work=[[Politis (France)|Politis]]|language=fr}}<br/>"''En verlan, arabe se dit beur.

Difference, discrimination, and exclusion are themes that feature heavily in ''J'y suis, j'y reste'' [a song from the album ''[[Utopie d'occase]]'']."<ref name="JE7">{{cite journal | url=http://www.acme-journal.org/vol7/JEr.pdf | journal=Acme Journal | last=Ervine | first=Jonathan | volume=7 | title=Citizenship and Belonging in Suburban France: The Music of ''Zebda'' | access-date=29 October 2008 | issue=2}} Page 7.</ref> The themes of Zebda's music were known for dealing in issues of racism and intolerance.<ref name="devoir"/>

In 1997, three members of Zebda formed a group called "Tactikollectif,"<ref name="JE4"/> which was involved in [[Fundraising|fund-raising]] and advocacy for immigrant groups in the ''banlieues''.  In the [[2001 French municipal elections|2001 municipal elections]], Zebda sponsored and spearheaded a list of independent candidates, ''Les Motivé-e-s'' ("The Motivated Ones"),<ref name="wsws">{{cite web | language=fr | url=http://www.wsws.org/francais/News/2001/mars01/15mars01_elemunfr.shtml | date=15 March 2001 | access-date=29 October 2008 | title=Les élections municipales en France | last=Dubois | first=Francis | work=World Socialist Web Site | quote=''Un exemple typique de ces groupes sont les listes «Motivé-e-s» qui ont surgi dans de nombreuses villes et qui parfois ont fait des scores relativement élevés (12 pour cent à Toulouse).

After the band's breakup in 2003, the individual members continued to be active in local politics and other activities for social advocacy.<ref name="JE4"/>

==Musical style==
Zebda's music is influenced by these band members' multicultural as well as music from all over the world; the group's songs have incorporated rock, and [[reggae]] styles, and musical instruments and styles as diverse as [[Latin American music|Latin music]], [[Arabic music|Arab]], and French [[accordion]].<ref name="Crumley"/> While the content and themes of their music are politically serious, typically detailing racism and discrimination, the group has been said to have a positive and "upbeat" sound that represents the ideal of peaceful coexistence and cultural diversity.<ref name="Crumley"/><ref>Oscherwitz, Dayna.

The group is best known for its single "''Tomber la chemise''" ("Take Off Your Shirt"), from the 1998 [[Music recording sales certification|platinum album]] ''[[Essence ordinaire]]''.  In addition to being a commercial success, the song went on to be named the best French song of 2000 at both the [[Victoires de la musique]]<ref name="RFI"/> awards and the [[NRJ Music Awards]].<ref name="MZLR">{{cite web | url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2008/02/26/437316-Musique-Zebda-le-retour.html | title=Musique.
