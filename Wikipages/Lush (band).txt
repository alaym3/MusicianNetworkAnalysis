'''Lush''' were <!-- not "was"; British English is used for this article. See WP:ENGVAR for more info. -->an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1987. The original line-up consisted of [[Miki Berenyi]] (vocals, guitar), [[Emma Anderson]] (vocals, guitar), Steve Rippon (bass guitar) and [[Chris Acland]] (drums). [[Phil King (musician)|Phil King]] replaced Rippon in 1991. They were one of the first bands to have been described with the "[[shoegazing]]" label. Following the death of Acland, the group disbanded in 1996.

The group reunited for a short time between 2015 and 2016 with Berenyi, Anderson, King and [[Justin Welch]]. They toured and recorded an EP of new material.<ref name="lushreunion">{{cite web |title=We've been away for ages and ages, but we're really excited... |url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=756569207802366&id=604331643026124|website=Facebook|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/lushbandofficial/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED|title=Lush|website=Facebook|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early sound (1987–88)===
The band was formed in 1987 in London, initially named the Baby Machines (after a line in the [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] song "[[Arabian Knights (song)|Arabian Knights]]"),<ref>{{cite web |title=Chorus Lines - Lush In Conversation With Martin Aston |url=http://4ad.com/forewords/choruslines/lush-readonly.html
|publisher=4AD |access-date = 5 April 2016}}</ref> with a line-up of [[Meriel Barham]] (vocals), Anderson (guitar, vocals), Berenyi (guitar, vocals), Steve Rippon (bass guitar) and [[Chris Acland]] (drums).<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2000) ''Alternative Rock'', Miller Freeman, {{ISBN|0-87930-607-6}}, p. 478-9</ref><ref name=avalyn>{{cite web|url=https://everything2.com/index.pl?node=lush|author=Avalyn|title=Lush|website=Everything2|date=12 March 2003|accessdate=14 September 2021}}</ref> Their influences were diverse; they were inspired by the [[garage rock]] scene of the ''[[Nuggets (series)|Nuggets]]'' series, [[Cocteau Twins]], Siouxsie and the Banshees, [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Byrds]].<ref>{{cite web|first=AD |last=Amorosi |title=Lush Life: The Sirens Return |website=Flood Magazine |url=http://floodmagazine.com/35680/lush-life-the-sirens-return/|date=20 April 2016|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>

Anderson and Berenyi had been school friends, having known each other since the early 1980s, and together published the ''Alphabet Soup'' fanzine.<ref name=shelton>{{cite book|url=http://www.lightfromadeadstar.org/Biographies/Index.htm|title=Contemporary Musicians|editor=Angela M Pilchak |volume=13|author=Sonya Shelton|date=December 1994|accessdate=14 September 2021|publisher=Cengage Gale|year=|isbn=978-0810357372 |via=''Light From A Dead Star''}}</ref> In 1986, Anderson joined the Rover Girls as bass guitarist and Berenyi joined the Bugs, also as a bass guitar player. Neither band lasted long, and in 1987, they joined Barham and Acland in the Baby Machines.<ref name="Thompson" /> Rippon joined shortly thereafter and the band members decided on a change of name to Lush, making their live debut at the Camden Falcon on 6 March 1988.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name=shelton/> Barham left the band and later joined [[Pale Saints]]. Berenyi then took over on lead vocal.<ref name="Thompson" />

Anderson said of the band's beginnings, "We were kind of punk rock in one way. We did think, 'Well, if they can do it, why the fuck can't we?' Basically, our idea was to have extremely loud guitars with much weaker vocals. And, really, the vocals were weaker due to nervousness – we'd always be going 'Turn them down! Turn them down!{{'"}} Berenyi said, "We started by writing crappy [[riot grrl]] anthems... which was probably charming in a juvenile way. But there was a very rapid shift from the minute we started to write for records. The music, the lyrics became much more thoughtful and expressive, more important, really. I remember that change beginning when Emma wrote Thoughtforms, it certainly made me think I needed to get my act together."<ref name=lightbios/>

===''Scar'', EPs and ''Spooky'' (1989–93)===
In 1989, the band signed to [[4AD Records]] and released their first recording ''[[Scar (Lush album)|Scar]]'', a six-track mini-album. Critical praise for ''Scar'' and a popular live show established Lush as one of the most written-about groups of the late 1980s/early 1990s UK indie scene. Anderson told Everett True in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', "I remember when I couldn't play, I wasn't in a band, didn't know anyone else who could play, and now we've got a record out on 4AD. I sometimes find it impossible to come to terms with what's happening."<ref name=shelton/>

Not long after, the British music press tagged them with the "shoegazing" label. The following year, the [[Extended play|EP]]s ''[[Mad Love (EP)|Mad Love]]'' (produced by [[Robin Guthrie]] of [[Cocteau Twins]]) and ''[[Sweetness and Light (EP)|Sweetness and Light]]'' (produced by [[Tim Friese-Greene]]) were released.<ref name="lightdisc" /> All three releases were eventually combined into the ''[[Gala (album)|Gala]]'' compilation album, which was produced mainly for the US and Japanese markets. The band recorded a live session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] show in 1990 and contributed a [[cover version]] of "[[Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep]]" later that year to the anti-[[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] album ''Alvin Lives (In Leeds)''.<ref name="Thompson" />

The band's profile was raised by extensive touring, including an appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 1990 and tours of Japan in late 1990 and the US (with [[Ride (band)|Ride]]) in the spring of 1991.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name=gigo /> Preceded by the ''[[Black Spring (EP)|Black Spring]]'' EP issued in October 1991, Lush's first full-length album of completely new material, ''[[Spooky (album)|Spooky]]'', was released in January 1992. Again produced by Guthrie, ''Spooky'' featured a sound very similar to Guthrie's band Cocteau Twins, with [[wall of sound|walls of sound]] and a great deal of [[guitar effects]]. Reviews were mixed and critics of the album held that Guthrie's production brought the sound away from the band's original creative vision, although it sold well, reaching No. 7 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Thompson" /> The album was preceded by the band's first [[UK Singles Chart|UK top 40]] single, "For Love",<ref name="Thompson" /> which was partly re-recorded and remixed by Mark Freegard. He also produced the single's B-sides: the original recording of "Starlust", [[Wire (band)|Wire]] cover "Outdoor Miner" and the only Lush track with lead vocals by Anderson, "Astronaut". [[Gil Norton]] remixed "Superblast!" for the Japanese single release.

Rippon left the band after recording the "For Love" EP to concentrate on writing, though his book ''Cold Turkey Sandwich''—a fictionalised chronicle of his time touring—was rejected by publishers. He was replaced by [[Phil King (musician)|Phil King]].<ref name=lightbios/> During the summer of 1992, Lush toured America as part of the second edition of the [[Lollapalooza]] festival.<ref name="Thompson" /> Lush was added to the roster by Lollapalooza organiser [[Perry Farrell]], the [[Jane's Addiction]]/[[Porno for Pyros]] frontman, who personally requested Lush.<ref name=avalyn/>

===''Split'', ''Lovelife'' and break-up (1994–97)===
Lush approached [[Bob Mould]] to produce their second album. The band stated that Mould was too busy to produce them, but Mould said in a ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' article that he backed out because "I kept picking the wrong girl's songs... I had to get out before I broke up the band!"<ref name="Thompson" /> The band found completing ''[[Split (Lush album)|Split]]'' frustrating. It was recorded by [[Mike Hedges]] at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales. Then Hedges along with the band went to mix the recordings, first at [[Abbey Road Studios]], and then at Hedges' studio in Domfront, France. However, neither the band nor [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] of their label [[4AD]] were satisfied with the sound; eventually [[Alan Moulder]] was hired to remix it.<ref name=france /><ref name=radar1994 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rank-your-records-lush-emma-anderson|title=Rank Your Records: Emma Anderson Ranks Lush's Five Albums|date=7 January 2016|website=Noisey.vice.com|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref> Unusually, the band released two EPs from the album ("Hypocrite" and "Desire Lines") both on the same day (30 May 1994).<ref name=radar1994/> Neither single broke into the UK Top 40. Released on 13 June 1994, ''Split'' was less successful than ''Spooky''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The band concentrated on the American market, on the advice of their management, but failed to make a breakthrough. A third EP from "Split", planned for release in the autumn of 1994, was to have featured "Lovelife" as the lead track along with a version of "The Childcatcher" recorded during the "Split" sessions; but the release was shelved by management. This first version of "The Childcatcher" was released three times: on the ''Secret Tracks 2'' free cassette included in the May 1994 issue of ''Select'' magazine, on the 4AD compilation ''All Virgos Are Mad'' and as part of the double 7" compilation EP ''From Greer to Eternity'', issued on [[Fierce Panda Records]] later that year. They suffered further setbacks when tours of Japan and the UK were cancelled.<ref name="Thompson" /> They decided to break from their manager, Howard Gough, and begin work on a new album. However, the new management also prioritised achieving success in America.<ref name=radar1996 />

''[[Lovelife (album)|Lovelife]]'', the band's fourth album, was released in March 1996. It was produced by Pete Bartlett, the band's live engineer. ''Lovelife'' represented a change in production, with less reliance on heavy guitar effects. It became the biggest seller of their career, possibly as it was more in step with the contemporary [[Britpop]] style.<ref name="allmusiclovelife"/> ''Lovelife'' included the hit singles "Single Girl", "[[Ladykillers (song)|Ladykillers]]" and "500 (Shake Baby Shake)", and also featured a guest appearance by [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] duetting with Berenyi on the song "[[Ciao! (song)|Ciao!]]".<ref name="lightdisc"/>

Instead of capitalising on their success in the UK, the band's management sent them on an ill-conceived American tour with the [[Gin Blossoms]].<ref name=ginblossoms />{{r|phil|time=35:14}} With the band members feeling pressured and tired, Anderson discussed leaving. She stated she could not make another ''Lovelife'' but would rather make a smaller, more personal album. The other band members were amenable to this idea, with Berenyi, in particular, being keen to keep the band together.<ref name=radar1996/><ref name=radar2007 />{{r|phil|time=37:07}}

In September 1996, the band played their last performance, prior to reuniting, in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/lush-announce-first-live-show-for-almost-twenty-years-70941 |title=Lush announce first live show for almost twenty years |publisher=Uncut |access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref> A month later, tragedy struck the band when drummer Acland died by hanging himself in his parents' garden on 17 October. The band effectively went on an extended hiatus, officially announcing their break-up on 23 February 1998.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name=avalyn/><ref name=radar1996/>{{r|phil|time=38:00}}

===Post-breakup (1998–2014)===
Berenyi went on to work as a production editor at two major magazine publishers.<ref name=radar2007/> In 1998, Anderson formed a new group, [[Sing-Sing (band)|Sing-Sing]], with singer Lisa O'Neill. Sing-Sing released two full-length albums, but in January 2008, announced they were disbanding. Anderson lived in Hastings and has held various jobs in the music business in management, PR, accountancy and at a booking agency. King played bass for [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]] and also worked for ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine as a picture researcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davecromwellwrites.blogspot.com/2012/08/phil-king-exclusive-interview.html|title=DaveCromwell Writes: Phil King - Exclusive Interview|date=21 August 2012|website=Davecromwellwrites.blogspot.com|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>

===Reformation and second break-up (2015–16)===
In September 2015, the music press suggested a reunion might be planned after Anderson posted a cryptic "7 day." message on social media and an official band website appeared.<ref name=hint /><ref name=radarhint /> On 28 September, Lush announced their reunion on their [[Facebook]] page.<ref name="lushreunion" /> The reunited band consists of Anderson, Berenyi and King with the addition of Justin Welch ([[Elastica]]) on drums, an old friend of Chris Acland.<ref name="lushreunion" />

{{cquote|We wish it could have been sooner but, for many years, it was just too painful to contemplate without Chris, and then all kinds of life-changing commitments made it impossible. Now, at last, the three of us are in the right place at the right time to play music together again.<ref name="lushreunion" />}}

To celebrate their return, 4AD released a limited red vinyl double LP of their compilation ''[[Ciao! Best of Lush]]'' on 7 November 2015, followed on 11 December by ''Chorus'', a CD-only, 5-disc box set containing almost all of their released material along with a selection of rarities, radio sessions and demos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4ad.com/news/28/9/2015/chorusthecompletealbumcollectionbylush |title='Chorus', The Complete Album Collection By Lush |publisher=4AD |access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref> For [[Record Store Day]] 2016, 4AD released a limited edition 5-LP colour vinyl box set titled ''Origami'', comprising ''Gala'' (clear vinyl), ''Spooky'' (silver vinyl), ''Split'' (red vinyl), ''Lovelife'' (pink vinyl) and the first vinyl release of the Canadian version of ''Topolino'' (yellow vinyl), with revised artwork by Chris Bigg. The UK/European version was packaged in a white cardboard "pizza box" emblazoned with three different Lush logos from 1990, 1994 and 1996.

Lush also announced a show at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London on 6 May 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/61394-lush-announce-first-live-show-in-20-years/ |title=Lush Announce First Live Show in 20 Years &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref> and later added a second date, 7 May 2016, after the first show sold out in six hours.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2015/09/29/lush-reform-for-the-first-time-in-twenty-years-to-play-the-london-roundhouse-next-year/ | title=NEWS: Lush add second London date following reformation | publisher=God Is In The TV | date=29 September 2015 | access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> They alluded to further dates in North America,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanyaland.com/2015/09/29/ciao-bella-we-think-lush-just-promised-some-north-american-reunion-shows/ |title=Ciao Bella: We think Lush just promised some North American reunion shows |publisher=Vanyaland & Redefined |date=29 September 2015 |access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> confirmed on 19 January 2016 when their first North American tour in 20 years was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/63023-lush-announce-tour/|title=Lush Announce Tour - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>

On 15 April 2016. the band announced the release of the ''[[Blind Spot (EP)|Blind Spot]]'' EP, the band's first new material since 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/news/62752-lush-announce-blind-spot-ep-share-out-of-control-video/ | title=Lush Announce Blind Spot EP, Share "Out of Control" Video | publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] | date=19 February 2016 | access-date=19 February 2016 | author=Minsker, Evan and Jazz Monroe}}</ref> It was produced by [[Jim Abbiss]] and [[Ladytron]] member [[Daniel Hunt]].

On 18 October 2016, the band announced the departure of bassist King on their official website. On 15 November 2016, Lush issued a statement announcing that Michael Conroy of [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]] would play bass for the final show at Manchester Academy, and confirming the band would split after the show.<ref name="lushofficial.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lushofficial.com/news |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030073921/http://www.lushofficial.com/news |archive-date=30 October 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

{{cquote|It’s been a fantastic year for Lush. We received an incredible reception to our ''Blind Spot'' EP and the three beautiful career-spanning 4AD releases, sold out two Roundhouse shows, toured North America with great success and had a ball at our European festival appearances. It’s been wonderful to revisit our old music and to create new material. However, it is now time for us to return to our families and homes, and bring our time together as a band to a close. We offer heartfelt thanks to all our fans – this reunion would never have happened without your overwhelming support and dedication.<ref name="lushofficial.com"/>}}

===Piroshka (2018)===
In September 2018, the formation of new band Piroshka was announced, a quartet including Berenyi, Welch, Conroy and former [[Moose (band)|Moose]] member K.J. "Moose" McKillop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/members-of-lush-elastica-moose-and-modern-english-form-new-band-piroshka/|title=members of Lush, Elastica, Moose, and Modern English form new band Piroshka|website=Brooklynvegan.com|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> Their debut album, ''Brickbat'', was released by [[Bella Union]] on 15 February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2020988/piroskhka-everlastingly-yours-lush-miki-berenyi/premiere/|title=Piroskhka - "Everlastingly Yours"|date=6 November 2018|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

==Rubinoos-Lavigne lawsuit==
Lush's cover of [[the Rubinoos]] song "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" (retitled "I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend" for Lush's authorised version) was cited in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the Rubinoos against [[Avril Lavigne]], whose song "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]" bore similarities to the Lush cover of the Rubinoos song. A settlement in the case has since been reached.<ref name=star /><ref name=mtv />
