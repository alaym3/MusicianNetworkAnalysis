Her father, having moved from Zambia, met her mother while they were both at the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] in Sunderland. The family moved to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, when she was four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/sande-i-felt-like-an-alien-in-scotland.22356263|title=Sande: 'I felt like an alien in Scotland'|work=Herald Scotland|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>

Sandé wrote her first song at the age of 11, for her primary-school talent show.<ref name="sande4"/> She remembers that that, “was the first time I thought I might be a songwriter. I always knew I wanted to be a musician and I knew I wanted to write because the people I was listening to all wrote. I never thought it was an option to sing anyone else's songs.”<ref name="sande4"/> The first song she wrote was called "Tomorrow Starts Again" – the song had proper structure and even a [[middle eight]].<ref name="sande4"/>

Sandé attended school at [[Alford Academy]], where her father was a teacher. She said, "I hated to be ill and to miss a day because I was so hungry to learn. I was very shy, nerdy and extremely well-behaved. Inevitably, throughout secondary school, it was part and parcel of my identity that I was Mr. Sandé's daughter. No way could I muck about or get into trouble, because it would've got back to him within minutes. And Dad was strict, let me tell you."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Yz4AgAAQBAJ&q=%22I+hated+to+be+ill+and+to+miss+a+day+because+I+was+so+hungry+to+learn%22&pg=PT11|title=Emeli Sande: Read All About It|first=John|last=Dingwall|date=17 March 2014|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781783230518|via=Google Books}}</ref>
''[[Choice FM]]'' invited the 15-year-old Sandé to London to take part in their "Rapology" competition. [[Richard Blackwood]] also had her down to MTV's Camden studios to sing [[gospel music|gospel]].<ref name="sande4"/> It was the first London appearance of her career.<ref>{{cite book|title=Emeli Sande Read All About It|last=Dingwall|first=John |date=2014|publisher=Omnibus Press|page=23|isbn=978-1-78305-357-5}}<!--|access-date=15 October 2014--></ref> By the time she reached the age of 16, she had a record deal with [[Telstar]] within reach.

Her manager Adrian Sykes, she said, had waited patiently from when she was 16: "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that I finish university".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2009/08/28/emeli-sande-signs-new-publishing-deal-1714/|title=Deadline News talks about Sandé's time at University|publisher=Deadlinenews.co.uk|date=28 August 2009|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>

There have been many who have inspired Sandé throughout her life. One important influence was [[Frida Kahlo]], so important that she has a tattoo of the artist's portrait on her forearm.<ref name="sande4">{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/emeli-sande |title=Emeli Sande information, BRIT Awards 2012 |publisher=Brits.co.uk |access-date=28 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020081536/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/emeli-sande |archive-date=20 October 2014 }}</ref> Just after leaving medical school, she made the decision to get the tattoo, which, for her, represented strength and bravery. Kahlo was inspirational for Sandé due to the unique story of her battle with polio at a very young age that went on to inspire her artwork. She knew that her decision to pursue music and quit school would require a sense of fearlessness that she gained through Kahlo's expression of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Frida's+art+on+my+sleeve%3B+For+a+new+series+of+ITV's+Perspectives,+pop...-a0367719692 |title=Frida's art on my sleeve; For a new series of ITV's Perspectives, pop star Emeli Sande reveals how the celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo has inspired her throughout her life|date= 11 May 2014|access-date= 15 October 2014}}</ref>

==Career==

===2008–2010: Career beginnings===
Sandé's sister made a video of her playing the piano and singing to one of her favourite songs, "Nasty Little Lady".<ref name="sande4"/> They sent the clip to [[Trevor Nelson]]'s [[BBC]] [[Urban music]] competition. Sandé won the show and was offered a record deal, but the management that she met via the competition decided against the deal.<ref name="sande4"/>
Emeli had become involved in the Urban Scot collective who helped and encouraged her career by promoting her in Scotland, and – according to ''Emeli Sandé: The Biography'' by [[David Nolan (British author)|David Nolan]] (2013)<ref>David Nolan, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emeli-Sande-Biography-David-Nolan-ebook/dp/B00EU9XI38 "Emeli Sande – The Biography"] at Amazon.</ref> – also released an album of songs called ''Have You Heard?'' on Glasgow's Souljawn Records, which was sold at gigs. Several tracks were also made available to download.

Her parents also sent [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] a CD of her songs. [[Ras Kwame]] played her on his "Homegrown Sessions", and four artists that year were asked to do a show in [[Soho]]. She met with Watford-born music producer/writer Shahid Khan aka [[Naughty Boy]],<ref name=WatfordObserver1>{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/5049729.Watford_music_producer_notches_up_another_chart_hit/ |title=Watford music producer Shahid Khan has notched up another chart hit |last=Mulderrig |first=Amie |date=9 March 2010 |work=The [[Watford Observer]] |access-date=24 April 2012}}</ref> who had previously worked with [[Ms Dynamite]] and [[Bashy]],<ref name="sande4"/> and they began writing tracks for artists such as [[Alesha Dixon]], [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]], [[Professor Green]], [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]], [[Preeya Kalidas]], [[Cheryl Cole]], and [[Tinie Tempah]]. Sandé soon signed a record deal with [[Virgin Records]] and [[EMI Records]].<ref name=r1/>

In an interview, she said "I was doing a show in London for 1Xtra and I met this guy called [[Naughty Boy]]. We got in the studio and we clicked work wise. We just started writing, not necessarily for me, we just thought 'let's write a pop tune' and experiment. And we wrote the Chipmunk track and I thought nothing of it. Naughty Boy sent it off to Chipmunk who really liked it and wrote his stuff around it."<ref name=r1>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2009/08/28/emeli-sande-signs-new-publishing-deal-1714/|title=R&B singer Emeli Sande signs new publishing deal|publisher=Deadlinenews.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> She signed a record deal with [[Virgin Records]] in 2010.

She revealed: "I changed it as soon as Adele came out. I just thought, 'You've kind of taken the [name] now', so I went with my middle name. She was just getting bigger and bigger, so I thought I just really need it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a336003/emeli-sande-changed-name-because-of-adele.html|title=Emeli reveals why she changes name|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=19 August 2011 |access-date=19 August 2011}}</ref>

Sandé began working in the studio with [[Naughty Boy]] in 2009, where the pair first worked together on [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]]'s debut album, ''[[I Am Chipmunk]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the [[lyrics|lyric]], rather than there just be throwaway [[pop (music)|pop music]].<ref name=NEN>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/what-s-on/music/emeli_sande_going_it_alone_to_success_1_1338326 |title=Talks about what she wanted to achieve with ''Our Version of Events'' |publisher=[[Norwich Evening News]] |date=3 April 2012 |access-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423121508/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/what-s-on/music/emeli_sande_going_it_alone_to_success_1_1338326 |archive-date=23 April 2012 }}</ref> [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lauryn Hill]] were also major influences for the album.<ref name="sande4"/>

She said that she is [[Simon Cowell]]'s favourite songwriter at the moment{{when|date=July 2016}}; due to her writing songs for [[Leona Lewis]] and [[Susan Boyle]].<ref name="dailyrecord"/> Sandé stated in an interview; she said that she would love to meet Boyle after writing songs for her saying, "I haven't met her yet. I just sent her the song. I'd love to meet her because I think she is a bit of a rock star."

She draws on influences for her music from [[Nina Simone]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Amy Winehouse]].<ref name="sande4"/> Sandé said that all her songs were about [[World peace]] and [[political issue]]s.<ref name="sande4"/> Sandé said that the key to a good song when songwriting is using "honesty" and "raw emotion" as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is "too smart", the creative process will not work for her. "Kill the Boy" was one of the first ideas that came to Sandé's head. She said if she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it, as she said it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, that the idea for the song would be almost instant.<ref name="sande4"/>
