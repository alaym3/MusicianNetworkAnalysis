'''Zapp''' (also known as the '''Zapp Band,''' '''Zapp & Roger''') is an American [[funk]] band that emerged from [[Dayton, Ohio]], United States, in 1977.  Particularly influential in the [[Electro (music)|electro]] subgenre of funk, Zapp were known for their trademark use of the [[talk-box]] effect. The original line-up consisted of four Troutman brothers—frontman [[Roger Troutman|Roger]], [[Larry Troutman|Larry]], Lester and Terry—and non-Troutman family members Bobby Glover, [[Gregory Jackson (singer/songwriter)|Gregory Jackson]], Sherman Fleetwood, Jerome Derrickson, Eddie Barber and Jannetta Boyce. Zapp also worked closely with [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Bootsy Collins]] of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group gaining a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1979.

Zapp released its [[Zapp (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1980, and achieved mainstream recognition from the single "[[More Bounce to the Ounce]]". The group's follow-up ''[[Zapp II]]'' was released in 1982, selling well and becoming certified [[Gold record|gold]]. In the 1990s, Zapp would also be an influence on the regional [[G-funk]] sound and the broader cultural scene of [[West Coast hip-hop]] itself. The band disbanded in 1999 after the deaths of Roger and Larry Troutman in a [[murder-suicide]] apparently carried out by Larry. Zapp reformed briefly in 2003 with the remaining brothers of the Troutman family to produce the album ''[[Zapp VI: Back By Popular Demand]]''.

==Career==

===1966–80: Early career and major record deal===
Born on November 29, 1951, in Hamilton, Ohio,<ref name="p. 281">''Funk - The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One''.

[[File:Roger and Zapp performing.jpg|thumbnail|Roger and Zapp performing, ca.1980]]
In the late 1970s Roger Troutman continued to record with his brothers, losing the name Roger & The Human Body and adopting the Zapp nickname from his brother Terry in 1977.<ref name="pp. 333-334">''Third Ear - Funk'' (2001). pp. 333-334</ref> The group searching for recognition, began playing at various small venues locally around Ohio. The Troutman family had long-standing friendships with Ohio natives [[Phelps "Catfish" Collins]] and [[Bootsy Collins|William Earl "Bootsy" Collins]],<ref name="pp. 333-334" /> who had both been involved with [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in the early 1970s. Phelps and Bootsy were attendees at a performance, and were impressed with Zapp's musical abilities, prompting Bootsy to invite Roger to the United Sound Studios in Detroit (the P-Funk studio base) which was frequently used by Parliament-Funkadelic.<ref name="p. 334">''Third Ear - Funk'' (2001). p. 334</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soul-patrol.com/funk/zapp_int.htm |title=1996 Interview with Roger -Courtesy of Funk-U Magazine & P-VIEWS |website=Soul-patrol.com |date=1996-02-03 |access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/zapp-frontman-roger-troutman-talk-box/ |title=Zapp frontman Roger Troutman popularized the talk box |website=Waxpoetics.com |date=2013-05-22 |access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> Roger Troutman subsequently wrote and recorded the demo for "[[More Bounce to the Ounce]]" in 1978.<ref name="p. 334" /> [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], the leader of Funkadelic liked the recording and encouraged Troutman to present the demo to [[Warner Bros.

The album's sound, which is highly influenced by Parliament-Funkadelic, contrasts largely with Zapp's later releases. "More Bounce to the Ounce" reached number two on the [[Billboard R&B chart|Billboard Hot R&B tracks]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roger-troutman-mn0000305501 |title=Roger Troutman |at=para.2 |last1=Hogan |first1=Ed |date= January 17, 2014 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref> for two weeks during the autumn of 1980.

He advised us to loop that section and put the other talk-box parts over it. At that time, this was considered a genius act, because you had to actually cut the tape and make the right cut, line it up and loop it.

===1980–81: Split with George Clinton, Uncle Jam and CBS===
After the 1980 release of Zapp's debut album, tensions rose between Roger Troutman and George Clinton. Troutman's solo album ''[[The Many Facets of Roger]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger – The Many Facets Of Roger|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-many-facets-of-roger-mw0000212101|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref> was primarily funded by Clinton, through CBS, and was slated to be released on his own [[Uncle Jam Records]] label.<ref name="p. 334" />  By the early 1980s, Clinton and his musical projects were experiencing financial troubles due to his poor management skills and shifting tastes in music.<ref name="pp. 248-249">''Funk - The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One''. (1996). pp. 248-249</ref> Around the time that Troutman's debut was due to be released, Warner Bros. Records dropped Clinton from their label.<ref name="p. 271">''Funk - The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One''. (1996). p. 271</ref> Funkadelic's final recording with Warner Bros., on which Troutman had worked briefly, was ''[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]''.<ref name="p. 334" /> Under pressure from the label, it was cut from a double album to a single disc. Warner Bros. did not promote the release, which emerged in early 1981 and made little impact.<ref name="p. 271" />

Troutman could see the disarray surrounding Clinton and severed their partnership by accepting a higher offer for the demo recordings of his album from Warner Bros. With Clinton out of the picture, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's subsequent work. When ''The Many Facets of Roger'' was finally released in August 1981 it was on the Warner Bros. label.<ref name="Company1981">{{cite journal|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Jet|journal=Jet : 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA159|date=5 November 1981|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=159|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> In Clinton's biography ''George Clinton: For the Record'', Troutman was quoted as off-handedly commenting, "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money".<ref name="p. 334" /> Clinton's view, expressed in his response, was that "CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don't like to go into it on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million [dollars], and a lot of people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling".<ref name="p. 334" /> The financial loss from the rupture with Troutman is credited as one of the factors that derailed Clinton's musical career and sent Funkadelic into hiatus.<ref name="p. 334" />

===1982–89: ''Zapp II'' and later albums  ===
Zapp released its second album, ''[[Zapp II]]'', on October 14, 1982. Electronic production techniques featured prominently, including liberal use of the talk-box that became Troutman's signature. Despite the contrasting styles between the first and the second albums, ''Zapp II'' attained gold status by September 21, 1982.<ref name="RIAA"/> The album fared almost as well as Zapp's debut, peaking at number two on the Billboard R&B chart, and reaching 25 on The Billboard 200 Albums chart. The single "Dancefloor (Part I)" peaked at number one on the R&B singles chart of 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp II Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-ii-mw0000199209/awards|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618132238/http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-ii-mw0000199209/awards|archive-date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

Zapp spawned several more albums in close succession, retaining the slick electronic style that ''Zapp II'' had adopted, but with diminishing success. ''[[Zapp III]]'' was released in 1983, and managed to gain a gold certification,<ref name="RIAA"/> but peaked at only 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R&B chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp III Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-iii-mw0000738540/awards|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520051411/http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-iii-mw0000738540/awards|archive-date=May 20, 2013|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref> ''<nowiki>Zapp III'</nowiki>''s poorer commercial performance became a sign that the band's popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s, with post-disco music falling out of trend. By the release of ''[[The New Zapp IV U]]'' in October 1985, the downward trajectory was evident.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp IV Credits |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-new-zapp-iv-u-mw0000199937/awards |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618083916/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-new-zapp-iv-u-mw0000199937/awards |archive-date= June 18, 2013 |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= January 17, 2014}}</ref> The album did not attain gold status until 1994, almost a decade after its initial release.<ref name="RIAA"/> Zapp's presence faded further in the latter half of the 1980s, as Troutman focused his attention on his solo career.<ref name="p. 334" /> The final release by Zapp before Troutman's death was ''[[Zapp V]]'' in September 1989, which achieved only moderate commercial success and failed to receive an RIAA certification.<ref name="p. 334" />

===1993–96: Later career===
The increasingly dominant West Coast hip-hop scene of the early- to mid-1990s briefly brought Zapp and Roger back into the spotlight as their material came into favour as a source of samples for hip-hop tracks. Troutman gained recognition for providing talk-box backing vocals for both the original and remixed version of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s 1995-96 comeback single "[[California Love]]"; the alternate version of the music video features Troutman playing the keyboard and talk-box during a party. Roger's involvement in "California Love" awarded him a Grammy nomination for "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group" in 1997.<ref name="p. 334" /><ref>{{cite web| title=39th Grammy Awards - 1997 (held February 26, 1997)| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm|work=Rockonthenet| access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

===1996–present: Deaths of Roger and Larry Troutman, disbandment, and current activity===
On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as a result of an apparent murder–suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Dayton)|Good Samaritan Hospital]], but died shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp's Roger And Larry Troutman Killed In Apparent Murder-Suicide|date=April 26, 1999|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433975/zapps-roger-larry-troutman-killed-apparent-murder-suicide.jhtml|publisher=MTV|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref> Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear. Larry had been experiencing increasingly severe financial problems managing the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises, which eventually filed for [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] owing $400,000 in tax.<ref name="p. 334" /> Larry might also have been bitter after Roger fired him as manager of his music career, a position Larry had held for several years.

During Roger's funeral, his nephew Clet Troutman performed a talk-box rendition of "[[Amazing Grace]]". Roger was survived by his six sons and five daughters; his eldest son, Roger Lynch Troutman Jr., died of head injuries just a few years after the murder of his father (January 31, 1970 – January 22, 2003).<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Roger Troutman, Jr. in Minneapolis|last=Scholtes|first=Peter|date=May 6, 2003|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/pscholtes/2003/05/remembering_roger_troutman_jr.php |at=para.4|work=Citypages|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

After Troutman's death, [[Ice Cube]] said that "More Bounce To The Ounce" introduced him to hip-hop. "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, and he used to bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [the dance group] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard '[[Rapper's Delight]]' yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain."<ref>{{cite web|title=California Loved|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2002-08-14/news/california-loved/|work=Sfweekly|last1=Williams|first1=P-Frank|date=August 14, 2002|at= para.2-3|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

The resulting impact of Roger and Larry's deaths left the band stranded, halting production. Without Roger serving as the creative source, they effectively disbanded, and quietly left the music industry altogether. Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label, bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close. A few years later, Zapp resurfaced for a short period after the establishment of its own independent label, Zapp Town Records,<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp Town Records|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/149097-Zapp-Town|publisher=discogs|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref> managed by the Troutman family. The label released its only album, ''[[Zapp VI: Back by Popular Demand]]'', in 2003. Zapp returned to performing only in live concert, touring across the U.S. at various venues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp tour schedule|url=http://www.thezappband.com/#!schedule-and-results/c1x9v|work=Zapp official website|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>
