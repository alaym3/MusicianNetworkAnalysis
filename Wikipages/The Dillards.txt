==''The Andy Griffith Show''==
Though The Dillards were already an established bluegrass band,<ref name=bluegrasshall>{{cite web |title=The Dillards |url=https://www.bluegrasshall.org/inductees/the-dillards/ |website=Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame}}</ref> their biggest claim to fame is performing musically as members of the fictional [[The Darlings|Darling]] family on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', introducing bluegrass to many Americans who had never heard it.<ref name=Rifkin/> This was a recurring role and the Dillards were led by veteran character actor [[Denver Pyle]] as their father and [[Jug (musical instrument)|jug]] player, Briscoe Darling. [[Maggie Peterson]] played Charlene Darling, their sister and the focus for the attentions of character [[Ernest T. Bass]], played by [[Howard Morris]]. The appearances of the Dillards as the Darlings ran between 1963 and 1966. In 1986, the Dillards reprised the role in the reunion show ''[[Return to Mayberry]]''.{{cn|date=May 2021}} As part of their 2012 tour, Rodney Dillard answered questions about the TV series. He said the songs such as "Dooley" are about people the family knew.<ref name=Rifkin/>

On the October 1963 episode "[[The Andy Griffith Show (season 4)|Briscoe Declares for Aunt Bee]]", the Dillards performed the first wide scale airing of the 1955 [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith]] composition [[Dueling Banjos|Feudin' Banjos (Dueling Banjos)]].

According to Jim Clark of The Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club, three albums have been produced with songs performed on the show. Clark says ''Songs That Make Me Cry'' is the only one currently available with real performances and has the three songs which included Maggie Peterson as Charlene. ''Back Porch Bluegrass: Live Almost'' includes five songs that were sung on the show, and Rodney Dillard released another album with the real performances of other songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.journalnow.com/news/ask_sam/ask-sam-where-can-i-find-songs-by-the-darlings/article_613886cc-9f50-5665-9944-8da547bc9948.html|title=Ask SAM|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=November 30, 2019|access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref>
