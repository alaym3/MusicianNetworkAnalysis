Erik Santos was ABS-CBN's Star in a Million Grand Champion last January 2004. A young balladeer known for his soulful voice, Erik made his way to stardom through the music scene owing the title '''Prince of Pop'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/asap/videos/2017/12/10/16121017-asapinoy-presents-the-music-of-the-prince-of-pop-erik-santos|title=ASAPinoy presents the music of the Prince of Pop Erik Santos|website=entertainment.abs-cbn.com|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> His much-awaited debut album aptly titled "This Is The Moment" shows that Erik's moment has indeed come.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Erik-Santos-This-Is-The-Moment/release/12322747|title=Erik Santos (2) â€“ This Is The Moment|publisher=discogs|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>
His passion for music started during his childhood years. He participated in various singing competitions.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://mmk.abs-cbn.com/episode/telebisyon-erik-santos|title=Maalaala Mo Kaya: Telebisyon (Erik Santos) (2004)|website=Maalaala Mo Kaya|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>
His Platinum debut album and succeeding albums, sold-out concerts and a demand for corporate shows, accolades from Awit Awards, Star Awards and Aliw Awards, endorsements for a bank (Bank of the Philippine Island's Express Remit), theme songs for radio stations, and even movies earned him an unusual popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2015/11/13/news/erik-santos-as-the-king-of-theme-songs-11613|title=Erik Santos as the 'King of Theme Songs' {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/philippines/article/Lea-Salonga-and-Erik-Santos-Among-Aliw-Award-Recipients-20181216|title=Lea Salonga and Erik Santos Among Aliw Award Recipients|author=BWW News Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>
His first single, Pagbigyang Muli, remained number one of WRR's hit chart for more than 20 weeks together with his other songs filling up the chart simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2018/09/05/best-ballad-boy|title=Best Ballad Boy|website=Manila Bulletin Entertainment|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>
Amidst all these, Erik still remains charming and this "realness" becomes one of the biggest factors why Erik has won audiences nationwide.

==Early life==
Santos was born on October 10, 1982 in [[Malabon]], [[Metro Manila]], Philippines. When he was four, his passion for singing started. He participated in numerous small-town singing competitions.<ref name=":1" />
He graduated in high school at [[Immaculate Conception Parochial School]] â€“ Malabon
He studied at the [[Centro Escolar University]] and took up dentistry, but later shifted to Psychology. As soon as he won the singing competition ''[[Star in a Million]]'' in 2003, he temporarily stopped studying, because of his busy schedule. Eventually, he came back to school and finished college. He graduated in March 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pep.ph/lifestyle/21882/erik-santos-proudly-says-education-is-the-foundation-of-his-career|title=Erik Santos proudly says education is the foundation of his career|website=PEP.ph|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>

===''Star in a Million''===
In 2003, Santos joined ''Star in a Million'' singing contest, and became part of the wildcard entry to the Final 10 of the show.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2004/05/09/249300/erik-santos-one-million|title=Erik Santos: One in a Million|website=The Philippine Star|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> He had a good start in the competition, but got eliminated during the third week of the show, when it was still a part of the Sunday noontime variety show ''ASAP''. Nevertheless, his second chance came, and his rendition of [[R. Kelly]]'s "[[I Believe I Can Fly]]",<ref name=":2" /> won him the tenth and final slot for the semi-finals round. Eventually he became one of the three grand finalists along with [[Sheryn Regis]] (first runner up) and Marinel Santos (2nd runner up) in the showdown for the title of ''Star in a Million''. "This is the Moment", a song from the musical ''[[Jekyll and Hyde]]'', popularized by [[Martin Nievera]], won him the title.<ref>{{Citation|title=Erik Santos Star in a Million 2003 Grand Finals â€“ This Is The Moment|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV5CaoKguo8|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>
