=== 2010–2013: ''Once Upon a Time'', record deal and endorsements ===
{{main|Once Upon a Time (Tiwa Savage album)}}
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#bbccff |salign=center
|quote  = This album is straight from my heart and it's something that I've worked so tirelessly for. A lot of people wondered why it took me so long a time to drop my own album. That's because we had to go through a lot of legal processes to clear some of the samples that we used, and that took us some months. Also, we wanted to work with notable producers outside the shores of the country like Oak who produces Rihanna. So, we had to work around his schedule and waited for them to have our time. But this album is something that I really took my time with because I didn't want it to be the usual Nigerian album that contains just party tracks from the beginning till the end.
