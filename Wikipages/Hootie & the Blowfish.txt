The group was also popular in Canada, having had three number-one singles in the country.<ref name="rpm"/>

==History==
===Early years===
[[Darius Rucker]] and [[Mark Bryan]] met in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in the mid-1980s when they were both freshmen at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=RollingStone2005>Bashe, P. R., & George-Warren, H., ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Third ed.). New York, Fireside, 2005, p. 443</ref> Bryan, a guitar player, heard Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. The pair began playing [[cover version|cover]] tunes as the Wolf Brothers. 

Eventually they collaborated with bassist Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan's, and Brantley Smith, a drummer. In 1986, they adopted the name Hootie & the Blowfish, a conjunction of the nicknames of two of their college friends.<ref name="hoot_Hoot">{{Cite web|title=Hootie & the Blowfish|work=hootie.com|access-date=January 1, 2015|url= http://www.hootie.com/internal.asp?catID=21210#content|quote=The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends.

Smith was replaced by [[Jim Sonefeld|Jim "Soni" Sonefeld]]. The band's lineup has remained the same ever since.

The band independently released two cassette demo [[Extended play|EP]]s in 1991 and 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1993, they pressed 50,000 copies of a self-released EP, ''[[Kootchypop]]''. They were signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in August 1993, after being discovered by Atlantic [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative [[Tim Sommer]], a former music journalist and member of the art rock band [[Hugo Largo]].<ref name="sommer">{{cite web|last1=Sommer|first1=Tim|title=My Life in the Bush of Hootie: How I Signed the Biggest Band of 1995|url=http://observer.com/2016/07/my-life-in-the-bush-of-hootie-how-i-signed-the-biggest-band-of-1995/|website=Observer|access-date=16 July 2016|date=14 July 2016}}</ref> Sommer recalled that other record labels were uninterested in signing Hootie & The Blowfish because their sound was radically different from the [[grunge]] music that was popular at the time.<ref name="sommer"/>

===1994–1995: ''Cracked Rear View'' and mainstream success===
Their mainstream debut album was ''[[Cracked Rear View]]'' (1994). Released in July 1994, the album's popularity grew after its release, becoming the best-selling album of 1995, and was one of the fastest-selling debut albums of all time. The album, which was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States in January 1995 and incrementally rose to 12x platinum by January 1996 and 16x platinum by March 1999. In May 2019, the certifications level was updated from 16x platinum to 21x platinum.

The album featured four hits, "[[Hold My Hand (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Hold My Hand]]" (U.S. No. 10), "[[Let Her Cry (song)|Let Her Cry]]" (U.S. No. 9), "[[Only Wanna Be with You]]" (U.S. No.&nbsp;6), and "[[Time (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Time]]" (U.S. No. 14).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book | first= Martin C. | last= Strong | year= 2000 | title= The Great Rock Discography | edition= 5th | publisher= Mojo Books | location= Edinburgh | page= 459 | isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> The album's last single, "[[Drowning (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Drowning]]", was not as successful as its predecessors, peaking only on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish and [[Bob Dylan]] reached an out-of-court settlement for the group's unauthorized use of Dylan's lyrics in their song "Only Wanna Be with You".<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/news/rock_clock/11_3/index.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla Rock Clock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030628/http://www.vh1.com/news/rock_clock/11_3/index.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla |date=2007-10-01 }}, November 3.

===1996–1997: ''Fairweather Johnson'' and promotional singles===
The band won the "Best New Artist" award at the 1996 [[Grammy Awards]]. Hootie & the Blowfish appeared on ''MTV Unplugged'' on the eve of the release of their second album, ''[[Fairweather Johnson]]'' (1996). It contained the hit single "Old Man and Me" (U.S. No. 13), and sold four million copies in the United States. Hootie & the Blowfish has since released three more studio albums: ''[[Musical Chairs (Hootie & the Blowfish album)|Musical Chairs]]'', ''[[Hootie & the Blowfish (album)|Hootie & the Blowfish]]'' and ''[[Looking for Lucky]]''. They also released a [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities [[compilation album|compilation]] titled ''[[Scattered, Smothered and Covered]]'' (2000). This album is named in tribute of [[Waffle House]], a popular Southern chain of all-night diners. Specifically, the title refers to an order of [[hash browns]]—shredded potatoes scattered on the grill, smothered with diced onions and covered with melted cheese.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/03/hootie.sessions/index.html Hootie & the Blowfish like songs "covered".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319162913/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/03/hootie.sessions/index.html |date=2007-03-19 }} Cnn.com Archive, November 3, 2000.

In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish contributed the song "[[Hey, Hey, What Can I Do]]" to the ''[[Encomium (album)|Encomium]]'' tribute album to [[Led Zeppelin]]. Their [[cover version|cover]] of Canadian group [[54-40 (band)|54-40]]'s "[[I Go Blind]]", released on the soundtrack to the television series ''[[Friends]]'' in 1995, did not appear on ''Cracked Rear View'' or ''Fairweather Johnson'', but became a hit on radio in 1996 after three singles from ''Fairweather Johnson'' had been released. Both "Hey, Hey, What Can I Do" and "I Go Blind" were later released on the compilation ''Scattered, Smothered and Covered''.

===2008–2018: Hiatus and solo work===
In 2008, Rucker announced in an [[AOL Sessions]] interview that Hootie & the Blowfish would be going on hiatus so Rucker could pursue his solo career as a [[country music]] performer. Although the band will no longer be recording or touring, Rucker confirmed that they will still perform their scheduled charity concerts, stating, "We have four charity gigs every year and we will still do them, but we will not do a record or tour."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/hootie%20leaves%20the%20blowfish_1078882 |title=Darius Rucker – Hootie Leaves the Blowfish |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=2008-08-29 |access-date=2011-11-13}}</ref> Rucker also said that the split will last "for five or six years, or until I record three or four country albums". He later amended his statement, saying, "To be honest with you, we're not even split up right now, and we're not really thinking about splitting up."<ref>[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090103175131/http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article.asp?id%3D1250 Hootie and the Blowfish to Return in 2009].

Rucker has recorded a solo album, ''[[Learn to Live]]'', for [[Capitol Records]]. It includes the singles "[[Don't Think I Don't Think About It]]", "[[It Won't Be Like This for Long]]", "[[Alright (Darius Rucker song)|Alright]]", all three of which have reached no. 1 on the U.S. [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, and "[[History in the Making (song)|History in the Making]]", which peaked at no. 3 on the U.S. [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Rucker's second solo album ''[[Charleston, SC 1966]]'' was released October 2010. A third solo album, ''[[True Believers (Darius Rucker album)|True Believers]]'', was released May 2013.  That album included Rucker's [[cover version]] of the standard "[[Wagon Wheel (song)|Wagon Wheel]]" which hit no. 1 on the [[US Hot Country]] singles chart and which was also a massive crossover pop hit. The [[Christmas music|Christmas-themed]] ''[[Home for the Holidays (Darius Rucker album)|Home for the Holidays]]''  followed in 2014; and a fourth solo album, ''[[Southern Style (Darius Rucker album)|Southern Style]]'', came out March 2015.

The band reunited for a one-time performance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in the run-up to Letterman's retirement from the show in May 2015. That same year, in August, Darius Rucker said on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' that the band members were working on new songs and would record a new album when they had enough material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/darius-rucker-hootie-and-the-blowfish-reunion/|title=Darius Rucker: Hootie Reunion Will Be 'Real Soon'|website=Taste of Country}}</ref>  The band got together on occasion during their decade-long hiatus to play live shows, usually for charity, but they made no announcements regarding future albums or tours until December 2018.
