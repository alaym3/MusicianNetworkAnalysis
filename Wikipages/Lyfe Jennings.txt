==Biography==

Lyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978 in [[Toledo, Ohio]] to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. As stated in  "Ghetto Superman" and "More Than A Girl" from ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'', Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called "The Dotsons". "The Dotsons" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe  began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at the age of 14.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWA2y21XKA</ref>

==Career==

===2002-2005===

In 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo "residency." His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to [[New York City]] and pursue a major-label deal. [[Columbia Records]] provided him with a contract and released his debut, [[Lyfe 268-192]] in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of "Hypothetically" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia.

===2005-2013===

Lyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'' arrived in August 2006, with [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Young Buck]] making guest appearances. [[Lyfe Change]] released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from [[T.I.]] Jennings. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with [[Warner Bros.]] and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Warryn Campbell]], [[Fabolous]], [[Bobby Valentino (American musician)|Bobby Valentino]], [[Ludacris]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], and [[Jazmine Sullivan]]. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute.

===2013-Present===

He returned to music in October 2013 with ''[[Lucid (Lyfe Jennings album)|Lucid]]'', released on the Mass Appeal label. Like all of his previous studio releases, it peaked in the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B chart. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/308649/lyfe-jennings/biography|title=Lyfe Jennings|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/jennings-lyfe|title=Jennings, Lyfe - Dictionary definition of Jennings, Lyfe - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/lyfe-jennings/3035923|title=Lyfe Jennings Biography - ARTISTdirect Music|website=www.artistdirect.com}}</ref> On his new album, ''Tree of Lyfe'', Lyfe Jennings describes it as his most personal work to date and produced the majority of the album at  his home studio in Greenwood, Mississippi . When asked about his current musical mindset, Lyfe Jennings response is one of reflection and experience, "Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don’t think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I’m not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|title=[EXCLUSIVE] S2S Visits Lyfe Jennings At Home [VIDEO] - S2SMagazine.com|work=S2SMagazine.com|access-date=April 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416004215/http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|archive-date=April 16, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/radio-active/jet-interview-lyfe-jennings/|title=JET Interview with Lyfe Jennings|work=JetMag.com}}</ref>
