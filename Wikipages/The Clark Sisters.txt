==History==
===Early years===
The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, to gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky). After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's [[Church of God in Christ]], and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother.<ref>Court Stroud, 
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/courtstroud/2020/04/10/the-writer-behind-lifetimes-new-clark-sisters-movie-shares-her-inspiration/?sh=4a8072e145b6 The Writer Behind Lifetime’s New Clark Sisters Movie Shares Her Inspiration], forbes.com, USA, April 10, 2020</ref> Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created "the Clark Sisters" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has a Lot to Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref> The first television appearance of the Clark Sisters was on ''[[TV Gospel Time]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kgeb.net/gospel-music-pioneers-who-paved-the-way/|title=Gospel Music Pioneers Who Paved The Way|publisher=KGEB TV 53|access-date=September 7, 2021}}</ref>

The following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]'', which hit the top 20 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Spiritual LPs chart.<ref name="Spiritual LPs Nov 1 1980"/><ref name="Spiritual LPs Dec 6 1980"/> By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living in Vain'', in 1980. Their debut live recording was first ranked on the 1981 ''Billboard'' Spiritual Albums year-end chart at number 21, before topping the year-end Spiritual Albums chart of 1982.<ref name="Spiritual Year-End 1981">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCQEAAAAMBAJ&q=is+my+living+in+vain+billboard&pg=PT83|title=SPIRITUAL ALBUMS|page=YE-32|date=December 26, 1981|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Google Books]]|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Top Spiritual Albums 1982"/> Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative "Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex-produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on "Speak Lord" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on "Now Is the Time". Another hit from this release, "Expect Your Miracle", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name="theclarksisters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archive-date=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Mainstream success (1981-1984)===
Their next release, ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' (1981), became successful due to its title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]]", the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors across the country, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at number 16 on ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Black Singles]], number 27 on [[Dance Club Songs]] and in 2020 – the ''[[Live: One Last Time]]'' (2007) recording – hit number 11 on the [[Hot Gospel Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> The album was also a commercial success, peaking at number nine on the US [[Top Gospel Albums]] chart and also appeared on both the 1983 and 1984 year-end charts at number two and 25 respectively.<ref name="Gospel Year-End 1983">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1983/gospel-albums|title=Top Gospel Albums – Year End (1983)|work=[[Billboard.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Gospel Year-End 1984">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1984/gospel-albums|title=Top Gospel Albums – Year End (1984)|work=[[Billboard.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref> Furthermore, ''Billboard'' ranked The Clark Sisters as the number-four Top Gospel Albums Artist of 1982 and number-one Top Gospel Albums Artist of 1983.<ref name="Gospel Albums Artist Year-End 1982">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1982/gospel-albums-artists|title=Top Gospel Albums Artists – Year End (1982)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Billboard.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Top Gospel Albums Artists - Year End (1983)">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1983/gospel-albums-artists|title=Top Gospel Albums Artists – Year End (1983)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Billboard.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>

The sisters delivered another album in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included "Name It, Claim It" and the politically charged "World". Though its success was overshadowed by ''You Brought the Sunshine'', the sisters received their first [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus|Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group]] for the album at the [[26th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name="theclarksisters.com"/><ref name="Grammys"/> Shortly after winning the Grammy nomination, the Clark Sisters won the [[NAACP Image Award]] for best gospel group for 1983.<ref name="crisis84">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSoEAAAAMBAJ&q=NAACP+Entertainer+of+the+Decade+1983+michael+jackson&pg=PA119 |title=The Crisis | date=March 1984 |page=119 |access-date=September 17, 2020}}</ref> After receiving a second Grammy nomination in the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group category for the song, "He'll Turn Your Scars into Stars" – later included on the album ''Heart & Soul'' (1986) –<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-01-11-ca-8552-story.html |title=GRAMMYS MAY OFFER A FEW SURPRISES |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 11, 1985 |access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref> the sisters were invited to perform live on the following [[27th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1985, alongside their mother, where they performed "Hallelujah" as part of a medley with the year's fellow gospel nominees.

===Denise's departure and subsequent projects (1986-1994)===
In 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]]. This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'', featuring the mainstream single "Time Out". This project made a top-five debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a Dove Award. It featured the original versions of "Jesus Is a Love Song", "There Is a Balm in Gilead", and "Pray for the USA", all of which have been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure but was later removed from the album. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were "Smile, God Loves You", "I Am Blessed", and the funky "He'll Turn Your Scars into Stars".<ref name="theclarksisters.com"/>

In 1988, The Clark Sisters released their ''Billboard'' chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines, and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like "The Darkest Hour Is Just Before the Day", "Take Me Higher", "For the Love of the People", "Computers Rule the World", and the original studio version of "Jesus Forevermore".<ref name="theclarksisters.com"/>

In 1989, The Clark Sisters released their live album, ''Bringing It Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from The Clark Sisters on Word Records' Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It also featured guest appearances from [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name="theclarksisters.com"/>

In 1994, The Clark Sisters (Jacky, Dorinda, and Karen) released their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', which was the first album recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] and [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc featured a commercialized version of the Clark Sisters classic "Expect Your Miracle" (now titled "Miracle") and a remake of "Jesus Is the Best Thing". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with "Work to Do". The album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name="theclarksisters.com"/>

===Solo careers (1995-2006)===
Following their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power''. In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''. She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020.

Karen delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring The Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award]]. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]]'', and ''[[Destined to Win]]''.

Dorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, ''[[Dorinda Clark-Cole]]'' in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album.

Jacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features The Clark Sisters on the track "Blessing Me". In 2014, she released an urban-inspired single, "My Season", followed by singles "Cover Me" and "Shout". In February 2020, she released a single "Feel Good", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.

The Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.

===''Live...One Last Time'' and Grammy recognition (2007-2009)===

==Artistry==
==="The Clark Sound"===
Since early in the group's development, Twinkie has been the chief songwriter, vocal arranger, and producer for the group. The Clark Sisters as a whole are renowned for their group style, dubbed as "the Clark Sound." They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]] or "squalls". While they have been praised for their precise harmonies, The Clark Sisters are also known for their individual, distinctive vocal styles, and while there is no single lead vocalist in the group, each sister has lead a handful of songs over the years.

The Clark Sisters have cited [[Aretha Franklin]], who also grew up in [[Detroit]], as a major musical influence. When Franklin died of pancreatic cancer in 2018, the Clark Sisters sang one of their signature songs, "Is My Living in Vain", at her service.
