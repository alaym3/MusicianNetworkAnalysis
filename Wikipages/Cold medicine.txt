'''Cold medicines''' are a group of [[medicinal|medications]] taken individually or in [[Combination drug|combination]] as a [[Symptomatic treatment|treatment for the symptoms]] of the [[common cold]] and similar conditions of the upper respiratory tract. The term encompasses a broad array of drugs, including [[Analgesic|analgesics]], [[Antihistamine|antihistamines]] and [[Decongestant|decongestants]], among many others. It also includes drugs which are marketed as '''cough suppressants''' or antitussives, but their effectiveness in reducing cough symptoms is unclear or minimal.<ref name=Cochrane2014/><ref name=Mal2017>{{cite journal |last1=Malesker |first1=MA |last2=Callahan-Lyon |first2=P |last3=Ireland |first3=B |last4=Irwin |first4=RS |last5=CHEST Expert Cough |first5=Panel. |title=Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Acute Cough Associated With the Common Cold: CHEST Expert Panel Report. |journal=Chest |date=November 2017 |volume=152 |issue=5 |pages=1021–1037 |doi=10.1016/j.chest.2017.08.009 |pmid=28837801|pmc=6026258 }}</ref><ref name=Sp2018>{{cite journal |last1=Speich |first1=B |last2=Thomer |first2=A |last3=Aghlmandi |first3=S |last4=Ewald |first4=H |last5=Zeller |first5=A |last6=Hemkens |first6=LG |title=Treatments for subacute cough in primary care: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials. |journal=The British Journal of General Practice |date=October 2018 |volume=68 |issue=675 |pages=e694–e702 |doi=10.3399/bjgp18X698885 |pmid=30201828|pmc=6145999 }}</ref>

==Types==
There are a number of different cough and cold medications, which may be used for various coughing symptoms. The commercially available products may include various combinations of any one or more of the following types of substances: 
* [[Mucokinetics]], or mucolytics, are a class of drugs which aid in the clearance of mucus from the airways, lungs, bronchi, and trachea. Examples are [[carbocisteine]], [[ambroxol]], and [[bromhexine]].
* [[Expectorant]]s are substances claimed to make coughing easier while enhancing the production of mucus and phlegm. Two examples are [[acetylcysteine]] and [[guaifenesin]].
* Antitussives, or cough suppressants, are substances which suppress the coughing itself. Examples are [[codeine]], [[pholcodine]], [[dextromethorphan]], [[noscapine]], and [[butamirate]]. 
* [[Antihistamine]]s, for allergic rhinitis may produce mild sedation and reduce other [[Flu-like syndrome|associated symptoms]], like [[rhinorrhea|a runny nose]] and watery eyes. Examples are [[diphenhydramine]], [[chlorpheniramine]], [[brompheniramine]], [[loratadine]], and [[cetirizine]].
* [[Decongestant]]s may improve nasal congestion in a sinus infections. Examples are [[ephedrine]], [[phenylephrine]], [[pseudoephedrine]], and [[oxymetazoline]].
* [[Antipyretic|Fever]] or [[Analgesic|pain]] medication. Examples are [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]].
* Also employed are various substances supposed to soften the coughing, like honey or supplement syrup.

A 2009 review found that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of [[zinc]] is mixed with respect to cough,<ref name="pmid19874728" /> and a 2011 [[Cochrane review]] concluded that zinc "administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration and severity of the common cold in healthy people".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh M, Das RR |title=Zinc for the common cold |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD001364 |year=2011 |pmid=21328251 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub3}}</ref> A 2003 review concluded: "Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms."<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hulisz D |title=Efficacy of zinc against common cold viruses: an overview |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (2003) |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=594–603 |year=2004 |pmid=15496046 |doi= 10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz|pmc=7185598 }}</ref> Zinc gel in the nose may lead to long-term or permanent loss of smell.

[[Heroin]] was originally marketed as a cough suppressant in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Taking the Medicine: A Short History of Medicine's Beautiful Idea, and Our Difficulty Swallowing It|last = Burch|first = Druin|publisher = Random House|year = 2009|isbn = 9781407021225|pages = 118}}</ref>  It was, at the time, believed to be a non-addictive alternative to other opiate-containing cough syrups. This was quickly realized not to be true as heroin readily breaks down into morphine in the body.  Morphine was already known to be addictive.

===Poisoning===
{{Main|Toxic cough syrup}}

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', at least eight mass poisonings have occurred as a result of counterfeit cough syrup in which medical-grade [[glycerin]] has been replaced with [[diethylene glycol]], an inexpensive, yet toxic, glycerin substitute marketed for industrial use. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in [[Panama]], which were associated with cough syrup containing diethylene glycol.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/world/06poison.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Jake | last2=Hooker | date=2007-05-06 |access-date=2010-04-30}}</ref>
