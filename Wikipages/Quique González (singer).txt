==Career==
Following less-than-successful exploits in Mallorca and London, he returned to Madrid in order to pursue his love of music. González began performing locally and collaborating with artists like Enrique Urquijo. González's song "Aunque Tú No Lo Sepas" appeared on one of Urquijo's records, leading to the pair performing the song live on television in 1998. The appearance offered González his first national exposure. A two-song demo entitled "Cantautores: La Nueva Generación" quickly followed. Frustrated in talks with Polygram, González decided to release his full-length debut independently, though it floundered without major-label support. The album's quality, however, secured a contract with Polygram, who released González's sophomore effort, ''Salitre 48'', in 2001. González's reputation as a writer with wry wit and personal sensitivity grew with the release of ''Pájaros Mojados'' in 2002. As the record industry shifted beneath him, González sought an alternative to working with the multi-national labels he claimed were preoccupied with pop stars and reality television. He established Varsovia!!! Records in 2003 with the release of ''Kamikazes Enamorados''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1446107/new-labels-proliferate-in-spain-in-2003 |title=New Labels Proliferate In Spain In 2003 |website=[[Billboard.com]] |publication-date=3 February 2004}}</ref> He released a total of two records on his boutique label before signing with the Spanish powerhouse label DRO Atlantic. His pursuits with the label, including ''Ajuste de Cuentas'' (2006) and ''Avería y Redencíon'' (2007), became the most successful of his career.<ref>[http://allmusic.com/artist/quique-gonzlez-p658063/credits=3 All Music Credits]</ref>
