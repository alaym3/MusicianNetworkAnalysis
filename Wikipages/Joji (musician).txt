{{redirect|Pink Guy|Michael Maxfield|Pink Man}}
Miller always had a passion for music composition. He has expressed that even before his YouTube career, he had an interest in creating music and created his YouTube channel as a means of promoting it. In an interview with ''[[Pigeons and Planes]]'', he said, "I've always wanted to make normal music. I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music. But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it."<ref name="Pigeons and Planes" />

Miller's music under Pink Guy is often comical, staying true to the nature of his YouTube channel.

=== Joji (2015–present) ===
Aside from the comedic and often rap-based music he created under the Pink Guy alias, Miller also created more serious and traditional music under another stage name, Joji, which became his primary focus in late 2017. Speaking on his transition from his YouTube career to his music career as Joji, Miller said to ''Billboard'' "now I get to do stuff that I want to hear."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8061822/joji-interview-will-he-filthy-frank|title=Singer/Producer Joji on His Career Flip From Crude Viral Comedy to Understated R&B: 'Now I Get to Do Stuff That I Want to Hear'|work=Billboard|access-date=22 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608065523/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8061822/joji-interview-will-he-filthy-frank|archive-date=8 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In the article by ''Billboard'', he specified that 'Joji' isn't a character like Filthy Frank and Pink Guy. "I guess that's the difference," he continues. "Joji's just me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8061822/joji-interview-will-he-filthy-frank|title=Singer/Producer Joji on His Career Flip From Crude Viral Comedy to Understated R&B: 'Now I Get to Do Stuff That I Want to Hear'|website=Billboard|access-date=11 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608065523/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8061822/joji-interview-will-he-filthy-frank|archive-date=8 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

During his time growing up in [[Higashinada-ku, Kobe]], Japan, Miller began to produce music and sing with friends as a side-hobby and a way to pass the time. After relocating to [[Manhattan]], New York, Miller expanded upon his music career by starting his Pink Guy persona, which paved the way for his Joji persona.<ref name="Pigeons and Planes 3">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3habuLgROU|title=Joji's Journey from Viral Videos to Quality Music Music Life|publisher=Pigeons and Planes|date=1 November 2017|access-date=3 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228064952/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3habuLgROU|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Miller originally announced his Joji album on 3 May 2014 alongside the first Pink Guy album.

Miller intended to keep the music made under Joji a secret from his fanbase due to them mainly wanting his comedic music.
