==Early life==
Born in London, England, Wrekonize was raised in a cultured household of both British and African descent. His mother was England born and father had immigrated to England from [[Cape Town]], South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://305hiphop.com/miami-music-news/wrekonize-soiree-skeptics |title=Wrekonize – A Soiree For Skeptics |publisher=305hiphop.com |access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref> Moving to the U.S. in 1988, his parents had formed a local band together. They performed on occasion with MC Guru for his original ''[[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1|Jazzmatazz]]'' album.<ref name="allmusic1"/> (According to Wrekonize on 19 May 2018 at Ratfest 3 in an interview with [[Interview Under Fire]], his parents were never in a band with MC Guru. He said it was a rumor started back in 2008.) At the age of 11, Wrekonize was introduced to Guru, who helped inspire him to make his own music.<ref name="allmusic1"/>

At the age of 13, Wrekonize was part of the popular cult of [[graffiti]]. Attempting to imitate the works of Miami graffiti artists [[Os Gêmeos]], he spotted "Wrekonize" in [[Martha Cooper]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodakgirl.com/ |title=KodakGirl.com |publisher=KodakGirl.com |access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref> Subway Art book. Admiring the graphic he chose to adopt it as his stage name because to him it meant, "observant and always alert to the surrounding and the people in them".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meddafore.blogspot.com/2010/06/let-em-know-wrekonize.html |title=Meddafore: Mr. Let 'em Know: Let 'Em Know: Wrekonize |publisher=Meddafore.blogspot.com |access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref>
