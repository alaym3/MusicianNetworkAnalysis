After studying [[English literature]] at [[University College London]], he made his feature debut with ''[[Following]]'' (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), for which he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005–2012), ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Best Original Screenplay.

Nolan was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], an independent school in [[Hertford Heath]], [[Hertfordshire]], and later read [[English literature]] at [[University College London]] (UCL).

In 1998, Nolan released his first feature, ''[[Following]]'', which he wrote, directed, photographed and edited. It depicts an unemployed young writer ([[Jeremy Theobald]]) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. From Nolan's experience of living in London and having his apartment burgled, he observed that the common attribute between larceny and pursuing someone through a crowd was that they "both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary social relations".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/SLAISFAlumni/Christopher+Nolan |title=The Man behind the Mask |publisher=UCL |date=8 December 2008 |access-date=12 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180241/https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/SLAISFAlumni/Christopher+Nolan|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Co-produced by Nolan with Thomas and Theobald,<ref name="nolandotnet">{{cite web |url=http://www.christophernolan.net/following_making.php |title=The Making of Following |last=Duncker |first=Johannes |date=6 June 2002 |publisher=christophernolan.net |url-status=dead |access-date=12 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513200348/http://www.christophernolan.net/following_making.php |archive-date=13 May 2008 }}</ref> it was made on a budget of £3,000.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/39-christopher-nolan "Interview with Christopher Nolan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505141213/http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/39-christopher-nolan |date=5 May 2010 }}.

[[Geoff Andrew]] of the [[British Film Institute]] and ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' magazine, called Nolan "a persuasively inventive storyteller", singling him out as one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. He also pointed out that his films are as notable for their "considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair" as for their "brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions".<ref>{{cite news
