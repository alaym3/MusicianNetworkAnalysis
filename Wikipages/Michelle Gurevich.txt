"I eventually tried to write a song and found it was not only cheaper but much easier to get a good result."<ref name=Natale /><ref>{{cite web|title=Premiere: Going Ape with Chinawoman's Video for "A Woman Is Still A Woman" – Noisey|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/premiere-chinawoman-video-woman-still-a-woman|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>

Gurevich began her career recording in her bedroom.<ref name=Natale/><ref name=Chater/> The stage name "Chinawoman" was chosen as a spur-of-the-moment joke when [[Garageband]] prompted her for a band name.<ref name=Radilova/><ref>{{cite web|title=Wie wunderbar brennt mein Haus|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/wie-wunderbar-brennt-mein-haus/4419024.html|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> After receiving criticism for being a non-Chinese woman inappropriately using the word Chinawoman, Gurevich distanced herself from her stage name and began to perform under her own name.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boyarinov |first1=Denis |title=Мишель Гуревич: "Я рада, что это в прошлом" |trans-title=Michelle Gurevich: I'm happy, that [this] is in the past |language=Russian |url=https://www.colta.ru/articles/music_modern/14781-mishel-gurevich-ya-rada-chto-eto-v-proshlom |website=Colta.ru |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref>

Gurevich has cited [[Alla Pugacheva]], [[Adriano Celentano]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Francis Lai]], [[Nino Rota]], [[Xavier Dolan]], [[Todor Kobakov]], [[Jennifer Castle]], and filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]] as influences on her music.<ref name=Natale/><ref>{{cite interview |last=Michelle |first=Gurevich |interviewer=Nadia Says |title=From LA to Berlin: Chinawoman |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |url=http://www.localsuicide.com/interview-series-from-la-to-berlin-chinawoman/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218083020/http://www.localsuicide.com/interview-series-from-la-to-berlin-chinawoman/ |archive-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gurevich possesses a [[contralto]] range.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reportersombra.com/michelle-guervich-ou-a-filha-das-limitacoes/|title = Michelle Gurevich, ou a filha das limitações|date = 13 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, "Russian Ballerina" was featured on the commercial for the [[Nokia Lumia 1020]].
