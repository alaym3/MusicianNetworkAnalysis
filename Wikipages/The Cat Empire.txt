'''The Cat Empire''' are an Australian rock band formed in 1999. Their core members are [[Felix Riebl]] (percussion and vocals), [[Harry James Angus]] (trumpet and vocals), Will Hull-Brown (drums), Jamshid "Jumps" Khadiwhala (decks, percussion), [[Ollie McGill]] (keyboard and backing vocals). Founding member [[Ryan Monro]] (bass and backing vocals) retired from the band in March 2021. They are often supplemented by The Empire Horns, a [[brass instrument|brass]] duo composed of Ross Irwin (trumpet) and Kieran Conrau (trombone), among others. Their sound is a fusion of jazz, ska, [[funk]] and [[Rock music|rock]] with heavy [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] influences.

==History==
===1999–2003: Beginnings===
The Cat Empire's origins are traced back to Jazz Cat, a Melbourne-based band, led by Steve Sedergreen in 1999. Jazz Cat was a nine-piece group from different schools and backgrounds which debuted at the Manly Jazz Festival in Sydney. They gigged around Melbourne's jazz club scene including at Dizzy's (Sedergreen was a part-owner). Late that year, Jazz Cat spawned The Cat Empire, originally as a three-piece, with [[Ollie McGill]] on keyboards, [[Felix Riebl]] on percussion and vocals and [[Ryan Monro]] on double bass.<ref name="Rage2010"/><ref name="MusicAusBio"/> The band's name was taken from the title of a drawing by Riebl's younger brother, Max,<ref name="BandHist"/> and its distinctive cat's eye icon, known as "Pablo", was created by Ian McGill, Ollie McGill's father. For a few months both groups performed alternate Thursdays at Dizzy's. The Cat Empire's sound is a fusion of jazz, ska, [[funk]], indie and [[Rock music|rock]] with heavy [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] influences. They started playing a variety of gigs at other clubs including [[Bennetts Lane Jazz Club|Bennett's Lane]]. The band expanded in July 2001 by adding Harry James Angus on trumpet, Will Hull-Brown (ex-Jazz Cat) on drums and Jamshid "Jumps" Khadiwala as a DJ on turntables (later on percussion).<ref name="Rage2010"/><ref name="Highlights"/>
[[File:CatEmpireTrumpet.jpg|thumb|Harry James Angus, [[West Coast Blues & Roots Festival]], April 2011]]
In late 2001, the band appeared in the [[Spiegeltent]] at the [[Melbourne Festival]]. By year's end, they had released an independent single "Feline" that October, and a live six-track extended play, ''Live @ Adelphia'' was released in December.<ref name="Highlights"/> In early 2002, the group played gigs at the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], and in March, they headlined the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and [[St Kilda Film Festival]]. The ensemble commenced its first overseas tour on the West Coast of the United States playing at [[The Matrix (club)|The Matrix]] in San Francisco and at the Napa Valley Wine Auction in June. The band received a Music for the Future grant to fund the recording of a live album, ''[[The Sun (Cat Empire album)|The Sun]]'', at Melbourne's Adelphia studio. At the [[Edinburgh Festival]], they played sixteen successive shows in the Late 'n' Live slot between 3{{nbsp}}am and 5{{nbsp}}am. They performed at the 2002 Melbourne Festival and a series of local gigs; [[Kate Ceberano]] appeared as a guest vocalist at their final show for the year.<ref name="Highlights"/>

===2003–2005: Debut album===
The Cat Empire recorded its debut studio album, ''[[The Cat Empire (album)|The Cat Empire]]'', in seven months during 2003 with producer Andy Baldwin in Melbourne. Between recording sessions they toured Australia, including appearing at the [[St Kilda Festival]] with Ceberano, and at the [[East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival]] in April. The ensemble was nominated in two categories at the [[Australian Jazz Bell Awards]]. They successfully applied for an International Pathways grant from The Australian Arts Council. The band was featured on [[BBC Four]] performing at the 2003 [[WOMAD]] Festival. The lead single, "[[Hello (The Cat Empire song)|Hello]]", was placed on high rotation on [[BBC Radio 1]] in August. The group's growing live and critical reputation enabled them to approach record companies for a deal to issue the album in August. They signed with [[EMI]] and [[Virgin Records]], and, in the UK, with an independent label.

===2005–2006: ''Two Shoes''===
The Cat Empire released their second album, ''[[Two Shoes]]'' on 19 April 2005.

[[Allmusic]]'s Jeff Tamarkin wrote "Skipping merrily from alt-rock crunch to hip-hop beats, landing on reggae/ska, Latin jazz, and points in between, ''Two Shoes'' is clever and brainy, danceable and absorbing".<ref name="AMGTwoShoes"/> The Australian version contains a [[hidden track]], called "1001", which is coupled with the track, "The Night That Never End".<ref name="TroveTwoShoes"/> The lead single, "[[Sly (single)|Sly]]", was issued ahead of the album on 28 March and reached the top&nbsp;30. The song appeared on EA Sports' ''[[FIFA 08#Soundtrack|FIFA 08]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="FIFA08Sound"/> "[[The Car Song]]", written by Angus, was released as the second single in July, and peaked in the top&nbsp;50.<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="APRACar"/>

Later in the month, they performed a set on Sunday evening of [[Sheep Music]] ([[Presteigne]], Wales) Festival for [[World music]]. In October, ''Two Shoes Deluxe Edition'' DVD was released, which contained live footage of Lullaby and The Car Song, a documentary on the making of the album in Cuba, the original video clips created for the album, and behind-the-scenes footage. The ensemble also featured on a Triple J CD entitled ''[[Like a Version]]'', featuring cover versions of songs performed by artists on [[Mel Bampton]]'s show, ''Mel in the Morning''. Their track was a version of "[[Hotel California]]" (originally by [[the Eagles]]), sung in French by Angus. By the end of 2005, ''The Cat Empire'' achieved double platinum certificate and ''Two Shoes'' achieved platinum status.<ref name="ARIACert2005"/>

In March 2020, the band embarked on a UK and Spain tour, of which the band played 4 shows before it was abruptly cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|Covid-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-16|title=UK & Spain Tour Cancelled - The Cat Empire|url=https://thecatempire.com/uk-spain-tour-cancelled/|url-status=live|access-date=9 July 2021|website=The Cat Empire}}</ref> After returning to Australia, the band began to work on new material. During this time, they launched a social media initiative, ''#lockdowngetdown'', encouraging listeners to make playlists using their favorite music and share them with others, in an effort to support artists who had lost their source of income due to the impact of the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-03-19|title=The Cat Empire Launch 'Lockdown Get Down' Initiative To Help Aussie Artists Suddenly Income-less During Pandemic|language=en-US|work=Music Feeds|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/the-cat-empire-launch-lockdown-get-down-initiative-to-help-aussie-artists-suddenly-income-less-during-pandemic/|access-date=9 July 2021}}</ref>
