The band has cited label mates [[Frightened Rabbit]] and [[The Twilight Sad]] as influences, alongside [[Biffy Clyro]]'s early material.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Siwicki |url=http://www.comfortcomes.com/2009/04/30/we-were-promised-jetpacks/ |title=We Were Promised Jetpacks |publisher=ComfortComes |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Grabow|first=Henning|title=Interview: We Were Promised Jetpacks – "We won every tournament we went in for!"|url=http://nbhap.com/interviews/we-were-promised-jetpacks/|publisher=NBHAP|access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

Thompson also cited Scotland itself as a major influence on their music: "It's rainy and miserable in Scotland and there are lots of angry people. In a way, that's a big part of why our music sounds the way it does. It's music that sounds sort of like that".<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview HN|url=http://hearnebraska.org/feature/we-were-promised-jetpacks-this-is-my-house-this-is-my-home-concert-preview/|website=hearnebraska.org|publisher=Hear Nebraska}}</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings===
We Were Promised Jetpacks formed in [[Edinburgh]], in 2003. The band played their first gig at their school's "battle of the bands" competition, which they won. The four-piece eventually relocated to [[Glasgow]]:

<blockquote>"There was a time when we first moved to Glasgow (we grew up and went to school in Edinburgh, then three of us moved to Glasgow and one of us to [[Stirling]]) and started playing proper gigs in proper venues. Playing in Edinburgh before was weird as we were underage, so ended up playing some odd nights. Which was cool, but when we moved to Glasgow we were of drinking age and we started playing places like Sleazy's and whatnot. We felt like a proper band."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Rich |url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/04/introducing-we-were-promised-jetpacks/ |title=Introducing: We Were Promised Jetpacks |publisher=The Line of Best Fit |date=13 April 2009 |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In September 2008, the band supported [[Frightened Rabbit]] during their tour for ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]''.  The band signed to [[Fat Cat Records]] after the label listened to some tracks on their MySpace following a recommendation from future label mates Frightened Rabbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/artist/we+were+promised+jetpacks |title=Fatcat Records &#124; Home |publisher=Fat-cat.co.uk |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/interview-we-were-promised-jetpacks-rocket-on-1-783649 |title=Interview: We Were Promised Jetpacks rocket on |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=25 December 2009 |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref>

In March 2010, the band released a new EP, entitled ''[[The Last Place You'll Look]]''. In October 2010 the band toured in North America to open for [[Jimmy Eat World]]. On 15 October 2010, their song "Quiet Little Voices" was featured on the [[Persian language|Persian-language]] political satire show, ''[[Parazit]]'', on [[Voice of America]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVbH3-Z9OX4 |title=Parazit 25-part 1 Oct 15 (season two) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 December 2009 |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref> and their song "An Almighty Thud" was featured in the opening sequence in ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' episode, "Turas", on 2 November 2010.

The band recorded four of the album's tracks ("Roll Up Your Sleeves", "This Is My House, This Is My Home", "An Almighty Thud", and "Ships With Holes Will Sink") for a 30 June 2010 [[Daytrotter]] session. The track "Keeping Warm" was also featured in the trailer for the 2013 [[coming-of-age]] [[comedy-drama]], ''[[The Kings of Summer]]''.

In 2019, to mark the album's 10th anniversary, it was reissued on vinyl and digitally with extra tracks, all recorded during gigs or radio sessions.

===''In the Pit of the Stomach''===
[[File:We Were Promised Jetpacks Dundee May 2012.JPG|thumb|We Were Promised Jetpacks performing in [[Dundee]] in May 2012.]]

It was met with general approval from [[music criticism|music critic]]s, and achieved an overall rating of 7.3/10 at<ref name="AnyDecentMusic?">{{cite web|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/3688/We-Were-Promised-Jetpacks-In-the-Pit-of-the-Stomach.aspx|title=Reviews of in the Pit of the Stomach|publisher=Anydecentmusic.com|access-date=19 October 2011}}</ref> [[AnyDecentMusic?]] based on 23 reviews.

===''Unravelling''===

===''The More I Sleep The Less I Dream''===
After the band revealed that they changed labels to [[Big Scary Monsters]], they announced their fourth album, and it was released on 14 September 2018. As the members matured, the band collectively feared losing the playfulness that made them indie rock critic's favourites.<ref name="nbhap.com">{{cite web|url=https://nbhap.com/stories/we-were-promised-jetpacks-the-more-i-sleep-the-less-i-dream|title='The More I Sleep The Less I Dream' - We Were Promised Jetpack unravel ambitious new LP|date=19 July 2018}}</ref> Instead of fighting that dread, the band channelled it into the most refined, mature record to date. The band members have been playing together since their teenage years, and were all turning 30 which influenced the process and sound of the music.<ref name="nbhap.com"/> The album was recorded in early 2018 with producer Jonathan Low ([[The National (band)|The National]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Kurt Vile]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|the War on Drugs]]) at Miner Street in Philadelphia and [[Long Pond (New York)|Long Pond]] in New York's Hudson Valley. Prior to that it took them a while to write the right songs, as they essentially wrote an album and decided they didn't like any of it; threw the material away to make the album that was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/we_were_promised_jetpacks_announce_first_new_album_in_four_years_share_hang|title=We Were Promised Jetpacks Announce First New Album in Four Years, Share "Hanging In"|website=www.undertheradarmag.com}}</ref> The band's official press release on the album describes the album as: "The More I Sleep The Less I Dream marks a new chapter in We Were Promised Jetpacks' career. It's about going back to the heart of who they are, a high school band that never stopped. It's about four people who have grown up together, making a conscious choice to keep writing music and seeing where that takes them".

In July 2019, guitarist Michael Palmer announced he was leaving the band, concluding a US tour with the band. Further gigs that year were performed with guest musicians Andy Monaghan ([[Frightened Rabbit]]) or Ross Clark (Fiskur).

===''Enjoy the View''===
The band's fifth album is scheduled for release on 10 September 2021, again on [[Big Scary Monsters]]. The album was preceded by the singles "If It Happens", "Fat Chance" and "Not Me Anymore".
