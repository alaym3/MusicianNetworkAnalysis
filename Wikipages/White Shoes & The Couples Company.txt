==Overview==
White Shoes & The Couples Company also known as WSATCC consists of Aprilia Apsari, Saleh, Yusmario Farabi, John Navid, Ricky Virgana, and Aprimela Prawidiyanti. Apsari and Farabi met each other while they were both studied at the fine art faculty in ''Institut Kesenian Jakarta'' (Jakarta Institute Of Arts). The two formed the band with their colleague, Saleh in 2002. In 2004, Ricky Virgana, John Navid and Aprimela Prawidiyanti  (Ricky Virgana’s wife) joined.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2007/09/white-shoes-couples-company/|title=White Shoes & the Couples Company|date=28 September 2007|website=Spin.com|accessdate=24 November 2020}}</ref> The band came up with the name due to the fad of wearing white shoes at the school where they met. The band sings the majority of its songs in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].<ref>[http://amplifiermagazine.com/reviews/cds/white_shoes_the_couples_compan.php] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

In 2005, the band released their self-titled album on Aksara Records. In 2007, they released an EP titled ''Skenario Masa Muda'' in 2007. Eventually, the band was signed by Minty Fresh, and re-released their self-titled album for an international release. With Apsari’s vocals trilling in English and her home tongue and classical music instruments and phrasings (the eight-minute “Nothing to Fear”) standing out alongside groovy, bouncy nuggets like “Top Star” and “Brother John.” That blend has landed White Shoes & The Couples Company on nearly a half-dozen film soundtracks in its home country.

The band was honored by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the best 25 bands on [[MySpace]]. They were also honored by [[Allmusic]] as one of the 25 most crushworthy bands of 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/white-shoes-the-couples-company-mw0000491583|title=White Shoes & The Couples Company - White Shoes & the Couples Company &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|accessdate=24 November 2020|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>
