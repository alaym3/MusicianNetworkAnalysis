|format=[[Ogg]]}}"'''Nuages'''" ({{IPA-fr|nɥaʒ}}) is one of the best-known compositions by [[Django Reinhardt]]. He recorded at least thirteen<ref>[http://www.gould68.freeserve.co.uk/nuages.htm Dave Gould's Guitar Pages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026142836/http://www.gould68.freeserve.co.uk/nuages.htm |date=2008-10-26 }}</ref> versions of the tune, which is a [[jazz standard]] and a mainstay of the [[gypsy swing]] repertoire. English<ref>[http://www.djangobooks.com/archives/Nuages.pdf "It's the Bluest Kind of Blues", lyrics for "Nuages" by Spencer Williams]</ref> and French [[lyrics]] have been added to the piece which was originally an [[instrumental]] work. The title translated into English is "Clouds", but the adaptation with English lyrics is titled "It's the Bluest Kind of Blues".

In 1940, Django made two recordings of Nuages in F major, and with a clarinet melody. (Some later recordings are in G  major, perhaps to suit the violin.) Unhappy with the first recording, Reinhardt added a second clarinet, creating a renowned arrangement for the December 1940 recording. Reinhardt's 1946 recording (as can be heard in the sample) is in the key of G major. A final recording was made just before he died at a 1953 session, where we hear Django with only Maurice Vander on piano, Pierre Michelot on bass, and Jean-Louis Viale on drums. He was using an electric guitar by this time. "Nuages" was released by Django Reinhardt and the [[Quintet of the Hot Club of France]] on the French Swing label as a 78-RPM single in 1940. The flip side is "Les Yeux Noirs".
