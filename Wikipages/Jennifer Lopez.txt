'''Jennifer Lynn Lopez'''<ref name=Cartlidge-book /> (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname '''J.Lo''', is an American singer, actress, and dancer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a [[List of In Living Color cast members#Fly Girls (house dance troupe)|Fly Girl]] dancer on ''[[In Living Color]]'', where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 [[Selena]] [[Selena (film)|biopic of the same name]], Lopez became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), and established herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Solid as a Rock|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=July 2003|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yYEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>

Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album ''[[On the 6]]'' (1999), which helped propel the [[Latin American music in the United States#1990s Latin Explosion|Latin pop movement]] in American music, and later starred in the psychological horror ''[[The Cell]]'' (2000). With the simultaneous release of her second studio album ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' and her romantic comedy ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 release, ''[[J to tha L–O! The Remixes]]'', became the first remix album in history to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Later that year, she released her third studio album ''[[This Is Me... Then]]'' and starred in the film ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]''.

After starring in ''[[Gigli]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'' (2004) and ''[[Monster-in-Law]]'' (2005). Her fifth studio album, ''[[Como Ama una Mujer]]'' (2007), received the highest first week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' and released her seventh studio album ''[[Love?]]''. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the [[Police procedural|police drama]] series ''[[Shades of Blue (TV series)|Shades of Blue]]'' and performed a residency show, [[Jennifer Lopez: All I Have]], at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas]]. Lopez also produced and served as a judge on ''[[World of Dance (TV series)|World of Dance]]'' (2017–2020). In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama ''[[Hustlers (film)|Hustlers]]''.

Lopez is considered a [[pop icon|pop culture icon]], and is often described as a [[Triple threat (entertainer)|triple threat entertainer]].<ref name="BBMAs 2014" /><ref name="People Magazine Awards" /><ref name="Time Review" /> With a cumulative film gross of US$3.1 billion and estimated global sales of 70 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin entertainer in North America.
