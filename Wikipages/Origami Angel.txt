[[pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] gave the album a generally positive score of 7.0, writer Ian Cohen saying "Origami Angel never let up for more than five seconds save for the twinkly arpeggios that serve as ''Somewhere City'''s introductory scene setting... ''Somewhere City'' is an invigorating place to spend a half hour, but Origami Angel would be wise to explore the darkness on the edge of town."<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=Ian |title=Origami Angel: Somewhere City |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/origami-angel-somewhere-city/ |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=3 July 2020}}</ref> Leor Galil for Chicago Reader complimented the album's energy, saying "Heagy and Doherty use their instrumental skills to work flamboyant, sometimes playful parts into neat, hook-filled songs, lending emotional resonance to what might otherwise seem like merely athletic displays."<ref name="chicagoreader">{{cite web |last1=Galil |first1=Leor |title=Origami Angel help set the tone for emo's next decade with Somewhere City |date=10 January 2020 |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/origami-angel-help-set-the-tone-for-emos-next-decade-with-somewhere-city/Content?oid=76966111 |publisher=[[Chicago Reader]] |accessdate=3 July 2020}}</ref>
