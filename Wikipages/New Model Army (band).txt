'''New Model Army''' are an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Bradford]], West Yorkshire, in 1980 by lead singer, guitarist and main composer [[Justin Sullivan]], bassist Stuart Morrow and drummer Phil Tompkins.  Sullivan has been the only continuous member of the band, which has seen numerous line-up changes in its four-decade history. Their music draws on influences across the musical spectrum, from [[punk rock|punk]] and [[folk music|folk]] to [[soul music|soul]], [[metal music|metal]] and [[classical music|classical]]. Sullivan's lyrics, which range from directly political through to spiritual and personal, have always been considered as a key part of the band's appeal.  By the time they began making their first records in 1983, [[Robert Heaton]], a former drum technician for [[Hawkwind]], had replaced Tompkins.

Whilst having their roots in punk rock, the band have always been difficult to categorise. In 1999, when asked about this, Sullivan said "We've been labelled as punks, post-punks, Goth, metal, folk – the lot, but we've always been beyond those style confines".<ref name="CYBE">{{cite book|last1=Ayers|first1=Michael|title=Cybersounds: Essays on Virtual Music Culture|date=2006|publisher=David Lang|isbn=9780820478616|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cybersoundsessay00ayer/page/137 137–138]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cybersoundsessay00ayer/page/137}}</ref>  Following a large turnover of personnel, both permanent and as touring members, as of 2021 New Model Army comprise Sullivan, Dean White (keyboards and guitar), Michael Dean (drums), Marshall Gill (guitar) and Ceri Monger (bass).

==History==

===Formation and ''Vengeance'' (1980–1984)===
[[File:Blacksheep festival 2014 rs SA 1964.JPG|thumb|Justin Sullivan]]
The band were formed in [[Bradford|Bradford, West Yorkshire]] in the autumn of 1980, taking their name from [[New Model Army|the army established by Parliament during the English Civil War]],<ref name=ROBH>{{cite web|title=Robert Heaton obituary|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-heaton-532435.html|work=The Independent|access-date=4 January 2016 | date = 8 November 2004 | first = Pierre|last= Perrone}}</ref> and played their first concert in Bradford in October, playing songs based on their shared love of punk rock and [[Northern soul]].<ref name="NMAB" />

Until the mid-1980s, Sullivan used the alter ego of "Slade the Leveller" (Levellers being a radical political movement of the 1640s), supposedly so that he would not lose his [[unemployment benefits]] if the authorities realized he was making money from music.<ref name="NMAS">{{citation|title=Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story|date=2015|publisher=Cadiz Music/Hustler Street Films}}</ref><ref name="TROC" /> They continued to gig around the United Kingdom with little recognition, but in 1983 released their first singles "Bittersweet" and "Great Expectations" on Abstract Records, and were given airplay by Radio 1's [[John Peel]].<ref name="NMAB">{{cite web|title=New Model Army biography|url=http://www.newmodelarmy.org/index.php/the-band/biography|website=www.newmodelarmy.org|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>

In February 1984, they were invited to play on popular music show ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'', being introduced by presenter [[Muriel Gray]] as "the ugliest band in rock and roll".<ref name=TROC>{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Tom|title=New Model Army: Rock's Ultimate 'Outsider' Band|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-10-31/new-model-army-rock-s-ultimate-outsider-band|website=Team Rock|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=DREC>{{cite web|last1=Dingwall|first1=John|title=Justin Sullivan on his cult band New Model Army and why he's proud they've never had a hit|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/justin-sullivan-cult-band-new-2671981|publisher=The Daily Record|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>  The producers of the show however were concerned about the lyrics of "Vengeance", which the band were due to perform ("I believe in justice / I believe in vengeance / I believe in getting the bastards") and so the band played "Christian Militia".<ref name="NMAB" />

Following this performance, the band's first mini-album ''[[Vengeance (New Model Army album)|Vengeance]]'' reached Number 1 in the UK independent chart in early 1984, pushing [[The Smiths]] from that position.<ref name="ROBH" />  After a further single "The Price" also reached a high placing in the independent charts, the band were signed by major label [[EMI]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|title=New Model Army biography|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/new-model-army/biography/|website=www.mtv.com|publisher=MTV|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref>

=== The major label years (1985–1993) ===

The band then made four studio albums (plus a live album) for EMI and one studio album for [[Epic Records|Epic]], in a period of eight years.<ref name="DISC">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/134825-New-Model-Army|title=New Model Army discography|website=discogs.com|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref>  1985's ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (New Model Army album)|No Rest for the Wicked]]'' and associated single "No Rest" both made the mainstream Top 30 in the UK,<ref name="OFCH">{{cite web|title=New Model Army chart placings|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/22148/new-model-army/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> the latter leading to some controversy when the band sported T-shirts with the phrase "Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin" during an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name="BDAW">{{cite web|last1=Chapple-Gill|first1=Laurence|title="Between Dog and Wolf" review|url=http://louderthanwar.com/between-dog-and-wolf-the-new-model-army-story-film-review/|publisher=Louder Than War|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref>  During the "No Rest" tour, Morrow left the band, and after some delay was replaced by 17-year-old [[Moose Harris|Jason "Moose" Harris]].<ref name="NMAB" />  However the band were refused work permits to enter the [[United States]], as the US Immigration Department had said the band's work was of "no artistic merit".<ref name=LAT>{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Duncan|title=Two Sides To Every Model Army Song|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-14/entertainment/ca-760_1_new-model-army|access-date=10 January 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=14 August 1987}}</ref>

[[File:New Model Army 2006-02-01 03.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nelson, bassist from 1990 to 2011]]
In December 1986 the band finally got permission to tour in the US.<ref name="NMER">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|  publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| pages= 412–425| id= CN 5585}}</ref> By this time ''[[The Ghost of Cain]]'', produced by [[Glyn Johns]], had been released, and was named best album of the year for 1986 in [[The Times]] by David Sinclair, who said that it "was the best thing to happen to English rock music since the first [[The Clash|Clash]] album".<ref name="NMAS" />  Concerts included Reading Festival and a gig with [[David Bowie]] in front of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Warwick on David Bowie|url=https://www.hotpress.com/David-Bowie/music/interviews/Tribute-Ricky-Warwick-on-David-Bowie/16710900.html|website=Hot Press|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> and the band for the first time expanded their touring line-up to include a second guitarist in the shape of [[Ricky Warwick]], as well as harmonica player [[Mark Feltham (musician)|Mark Feltham]] from [[Nine Below Zero]].<ref name="NMAB" />

''[[Thunder and Consolation]]'' was released in February 1989, and saw the band moving towards a more folk-rock sound, especially on the tracks including violinist [[Ed Alleyne-Johnson]].<ref name="MTV1">{{cite web|last1=Huey|first1=Steve|title=New Model Army biography|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/new-model-army/biography/|website=mtv.com|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref>  Described as the band's "landmark" album,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Britton|first1=Amy|title=Revolution Rock: The Albums Which Defined Two Ages|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781467887113|page=139}}</ref> it reached No.20 in the UK charts, the singles "Stupid Questions" and "Vagabonds" made an impression in America<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jason|title=Thunder and Consolation review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/thunder-and-consolation-mw0000569651|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> and the band was able to tour the album there with Alleyne-Johnson also providing additional guitar and keyboards.  At the end of the year however, Harris left the band, to be replaced by Peter "Nelson" Nice, who would play with the band for more than 20 years.<ref name="MTV1" /> 1990's ''[[Impurity (New Model Army album)|Impurity]]'', continued the folk-driven theme with Alleyne-Johnson still to the fore,<ref name="ROBH" /> and [[Adrian Portas]] joining the band on guitar.<ref name="MTV1" />

The next album was to be a musical change of direction; as Sullivan later said, "just as this folk-cum-[[rave]]-cum-[[Indie rock|crusty]]-cum-[[New Age#Music|new-age]] thing broke and became big in the early 1990s, we went – whoosh – done that – and went and made a very angry hard rock album".<ref name="NMAS" /> ''[[The Love of Hopeless Causes]]'', New Model Army's only release on [[Epic Records]], appeared in 1993 and led with the single "Here Comes the War", which spawned controversy when it came packaged with instructions on how to construct a nuclear device.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|title=The Love of Hopeless Causes review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-love-of-hopeless-causes-mw0000099283|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref>

===Hiatus and return to independence (1994–2000)===
The band had previously decided to take a year out to concentrate on personal and other musical issues, and reconvened in late 1994 with Dean White, playing keyboards and guitar, replacing Alleyne-Johnson.<ref name="MTV1" /> It became clear, that all was not well between Sullivan and Heaton; Sullivan later said "We wrote ''Thunder and Consolation'' and it was brilliant, but very shortly after that, we started falling out, which went on during the making of that album. His life went in one direction and mine went in another".<ref name="3AMM">{{cite web|last1=Unsworth|first1=Cathi|title=Interview with Justin Sullivan|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/this-musicians-life/|website=3AM Magazine|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> It was agreed that they would go their separate ways after the forthcoming album and tour.<ref name="NMAB" /> ''[[Strange Brotherhood]]'' was released in May 1998 to mixed reviews,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|title=Strange Brotherhood review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/strange-brotherhood-mw0000330684|website=Allmusic|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> but then Heaton was diagnosed with a brain tumour.  He suggested that his drum technician Michael Dean take over from him to tour the album.<ref name="3AMM" />  By this time the band had formed their own independent label, Attack Attack,<ref>{{cite web|title=Attack Attack records|url=http://www.propermusic.com/label/Attack-Attack-4775|website=Proper Music|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> and former tour manager Tommy Tee had returned to manage the band.<ref name="NMAS" />  A live album "''[[...& Nobody Else]]''" followed in 1999, and eighth studio album ''[[Eight (New Model Army album)|Eight]]'' in 2000.<ref name="DISC" />

===Death of Robert Heaton, and ''Carnival'' to ''Today is a Good Day'' (2001–2009)===
[[File:Blacksheep festival 2014 rs SA 1948.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Marshall Gill, guitarist from 2005–present]]
After touring ''Eight'', the band again took time out, most notably so that Sullivan could concentrate on his solo album ''Navigating by the Stars'' which was eventually released in 2003,<ref name="TGRB">{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=MC|title=New Model Army biography|url=http://thegreatrockbible.com/portfolio-item/new-model-army-biography/|website=The Great Rock Bible|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> and toured by Sullivan, Dean and White.<ref name="NMAB" />  As the band got together to record their ninth album, Robert Heaton died from pancreatic cancer on 4 November 2004.<ref name=ROBH/> ''[[Carnival (New Model Army album)|Carnival]]'' was finally released in September 2005, and includes Sullivan's reaction to Heaton's death, "Fireworks Night".<ref name="NMAB" /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Parrish|first1=Peter|title=Carnival review|url=http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/new-model-army/carnival.html|website=Stylus Magazine|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>  Dave Blomberg was unable to take part in touring the album, and was replaced by current guitarist Marshall Gill.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tipping|first1=Helen|title=Interview with Juston Sullivan|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/3783/Interviews/New-Model-Army--Interview-with-Justin-Sullivan|website=Penny Black Music|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>

The band's tenth studio album, ''[[High (New Model Army album)|High]]'', was produced relatively quickly and was released in August 2007.  The tour suffered a slight setback when the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] again denied the band visas; this time the issue was relatively quickly resolved<ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army interview|url=http://www.lightsgoout.co.uk/?p=13656|website=Lights Go Out|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> and the dates rescheduled for early 2008.  Soon afterwards, the band was again shaken as manager Tommy Tee died unexpectedly at the age of 46.<ref name=BIGT>{{cite news|last1=Rabid|first1=Jack|title=RIP Tommy Tee, New Model Army manager|url=http://bigtakeover.com/news/rip-tommy-tee-new-model-army-manager-and-friend-of-big-takeover-issue-63-on-the-stands|access-date=17 January 2016|work=The Big Takeover|date=27 December 2008}}</ref>  By 2009, though, the band were again back in the studio. ''[[Today Is a Good Day]]'' was a far more uncompromising album, the heavy rock title track and others directly referencing the [[Stock market crash#Crash of 2008.E2.80.932009|stock market crash of 2008]].<ref name="INTQ">{{cite web|last1=Burrows|first1=Marc|title=New Model Army interview|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/13469-new-model-army-interview|publisher=The Quietus|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army interview|url=https://www.sonicabuse.com/new-model-army-speak-to-sonicabuse/|website=Sonic Abuse|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>  As the tour to promote the album came to an end, it was drawing close to 30 years since the band had started.

===30th anniversary to present (2010–present)===
[[File:Blacksheep festival 2014 rs SA 1867.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ceri Monger, current bassist]]
Towards the end of 2010, the band's 30th anniversary was celebrated with special shows across four continents every weekend from September until early December; in most cities, the shows were across two nights with completely different sets,<ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army celebrating 30 years w/ special shows|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/new-model-army-2/|website=Brooklyn Vegan|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> the band having promised to play at least four songs from each of their eleven studio albums plus ''[[Lost Songs (New Model Army album)|Lost Songs]]'' and ''[[B-Sides and Abandoned Tracks]]'', their rarities and B-sides collections.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army: 30th anniversary shows|url=https://www.journalism.co.uk/press-releases/new-model-army---30th-anniversary-boxset-and-exclusive-uk-tour-dates/s66/a540969/|website=journalism.co.uk|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=30th Anniversary shows|url=http://www.newmodelarmy.org/index.php/links/the-archive/411-30th-anniversary-shows|website=newmodelarmy.org|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref>  The final shows at the [[The Forum, London|Kentish Town Forum]] in London were collected on a double CD and DVD release containing all 58 songs played over the nights of 3 and 4 December.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army – 30th Anniversary Concerts DVD/CD|url=https://www.discogs.com/New-Model-Army-30th-Anniversary-Concerts/release/3471214|website=discogs.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>

After the band had played their traditional Christmas shows the following year, the news was released that Nelson had decided to leave the band for personal reasons, a decision that had been taken some time before.<ref name="NMAB" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bond|first1=Chris|title=New Model Army battle on|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/what-s-on/music/new-model-army-still-battle-on-to-rise-from-the-ashes-1-4353961|access-date=22 May 2016|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=16 March 2012}}</ref> A few days later, on Christmas Eve, a fire destroyed the band's studio and rehearsal space in Bradford.  Numerous guitars and other instruments were lost along with recording equipment and memorabilia.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Model Army studio destroyed by fire|url=http://music-news.com/news/UK/47310/Read|access-date=17 January 2016|publisher=Music News|date=29 December 2011}}</ref>  However, the studio was back in operation within three months, and after a number of auditions, Ceri Monger was announced as the band's new bassist and multi-instrumentalist.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Model Army to release new album 'Between Dog and Wolf' in September |url=http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2013/07/23/new-model-army-between-dog-and-wolf/ |website=[[Slicing Up Eyeballs]] |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>

In 2013, the band's twelfth studio album, ''[[Between Dog and Wolf]]'', mixed by [[Joe Barresi]], was released and became the band's most successful since ''The Love of Hopeless Causes'' 20 years earlier.<ref name="OFCH" />  The album showed a marked shift away from the band's traditional sounds,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Myers | first=Ben| title=Album reviews – Between Dog and Wolf | journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] | issue= September 2013|page=88}}</ref> including rhythms that were described as "tribal", though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – "We really like complex [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]] rhythms, we really like that pounding (beat)".<ref name="INTQ" />  A year later, ''[[Between Wine and Blood]]'' was released, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the ''Between Dog and Wolf'' sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Model Army mix studio, live tracks on 'Between Wine and Blood'|url=http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2014/07/30/new-model-army-between-wine-and-blood/|website=[[Slicing Up Eyeballs]]|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>  In October 2014, a documentary feature film about the band's career, ''Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story'' by director Matt Reid premiered at the [[Raindance Film Festival]] in London and the [[Festival du nouveau cinéma]] in Montreal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Geraghty|first1=Max|title=Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story|url=http://www.film-news.co.uk/review/UK/1065/Read|access-date=17 January 2016|publisher=Film News|date=6 October 2014}}</ref>  The band's 14th studio album, ''[[Winter (New Model Army album)|Winter]]'', was released on 26 August 2016.<ref name="WIN1">{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=Scott|title=New Model Army announce 14th studio album|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2016-04-22/new-model-army-announce-14th-studio-album|website=Team Rock|access-date=28 April 2016}}</ref> ''[[Winter (New Model Army album)|Winter]]'' was named the #1 album of 2016 by [[The Big Takeover]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Rabid's Best of 2016 list: Top 150 LPs (new recordings), Top 50 Retrospective/Reissue releases, and Top 30 stand alone singles and EPs|url=http://bigtakeover.com/news/jack-rabid-s-best-of-2016-list-top-150-lps-new-recordings-top-50-retrospective-reissue-releases-and-top-30-stand-alone-singles-and-eps|website=The Big Takeover|date=10 January 2017}}</ref> On 23 August 2019, the band's 15th studio album, ''[[From Here]]'', was released.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Model Army: a hypnotic swirl of captivating darkness |url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/new-model-army-from-here-album-review |website=Louder Sound |access-date=25 August 2019}}</ref>

=="The Family"==
Over the years, New Model Army have gathered a wide selection of fans, many of whom dedicatedly follow the band. Originally calling themselves "The Militia", after the song "Christian Militia",<ref name="NMAS" /> they later universally adopted the term "The Family" for their multi-generational and gendered group.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maconie|first1=Stuart|title=The People's Songs: The Story of Modern Britain in 50 Records|date=2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780091946845|page=353}}</ref>  Joolz Denby, long-time collaborator of Sullivan<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bond|first1=Chris|title=The Big Interview: Joolz Denby|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/the-big-interview-joolz-denby-1-4413214|access-date=22 May 2016|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=9 April 2012}}</ref> and the band's main artist<ref>{{cite web|title=Joolz Denby|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/joolz-denby|website=British Council: Literature|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> has referred to The Family as "not a formal, contrived organisation, but a spontaneous sense of fellowship that has developed over the years",<ref name="DENB">{{cite web|last1=Denby|first1=Joolz|title=What is the NMA Family?|url=http://www.newmodelarmy.org/index.php/the-band/interviews/308-what-is-the-nma-family-some-thoughts-by-joolz-denby-15-02-04|website=newmodelarmy.org|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref> whilst elsewhere it has been described as "sanctuary ... and acceptance".<ref name="CYBE" />

== Influences ==
Frequently noted for their musical lyricism, Justin Sullivan has noted in interviews that some of the band's (and his own) lyrical inspiration has come from Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Gillian Welch, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan, as well as "lots of country and hip-hop artists, all for their precision and poetry."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nothingintherulebook.com/2018/08/10/creatives-in-profile-interview-with-justin-sullivan/|title=Creatives in profile: interview with Justin Sullivan|date=2018-08-10|work=nothingintherulebook|access-date=2018-08-13}}</ref>
