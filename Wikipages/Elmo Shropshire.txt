'''Elmo Shropshire''', '''[[Veterinarian|DVM]]''' (born October 26, 1936) is an American veterinarian, competitive runner and [[country music]] singer. Shropshire, who typically performs under the name "Dr. Elmo," is best known for his [[Christmas music|Christmas]] [[novelty song]] "[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]". He originally recorded the song in 1979 with his then-wife Patsy, then re-recorded it solo for the 1992 album ''Dr. Elmo's Twisted Christmas'' and again in 2000 for the album ''Up Your Chimney''. He also recorded two albums of year-round songs: ''Dr. Elmo's Twisted Tunes'' (1993) and ''Love, Death and Taxes'' (2000).
