==Musical style==
Giannascoli's music is often characterized as [[indie rock]] with a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] or "bedroom pop" aesthetic due to him recording all of his music by himself in his home. He is frequently compared to singer-songwriter [[Elliott Smith]], who is an influence of his. Other comparisons include [[Built to Spill]] and [[The Martinis]].<ref name="Fader"/> ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' praised him as "a particularly gifted melody writer" whose "fuzzy, sometimes distorted songs, which hark back to slightly askew 1990s bands such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], can't hide his skill as a pop craftsman and a constructor of elliptical narratives that call for repeated listening."<ref name="Philly"/> He stated that his creative process consists of him usually working alone in his room with his guitar and adding other instruments later. When asked about working in a professional [[recording studio]], he replied, "I feel like I'm eventually going to have to do that, but I just don't want to. Because I don't know how to work all that stuff, and I don't want anyone else to have control. I just want to follow my own ideas, and I'm uncomfortable doing it any other way."<ref name="Philly"/>
