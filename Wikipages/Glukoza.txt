===Music career===
Glukoza's musical career began when she was discovered in 2002 by record producer [[Maxim Fadeev]]. Together they recorded her first album, "[[Glukoza Nostra (album)|Glukoza Nostra]]", and released her first music video, "Nenavizhu" (''I Hate''), which was entirely computer-animated. Her singles found little popularity until 2003, when Glukoza released "Nevesta" (''Bride''), accompanied once again by a computer-animated video. "Nevesta" shot Glukoza to the top of the Russian music charts.

Other popular singles released over the following two years included "Glukoza Nostra", "Sneg idyot" (''It's Snowing''), "Oi, Oi", "Malish" (''Babe''), "Karina", and the duet with [[Verka Serduchka]] "Zhenixa Xotela" (''I Wanted a Groom'').

Her success in music earned her many accolades including the [[MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV-EMA]] award for "Best Russian Act" and the [[Muz-TV]] award for "Breakthrough of the Year", with her animated stand-in named "Character of Year" by the Russian internet search engine "[[Rambler (portal)|Rambler]]".

After 2003 and over the next three years, Glukoza gave over 500 concerts in the Far East, [[Siberia]], the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], the [[Volga]] Region, the center section of Russia, [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], Central Asia, the Caucasus, London, and the USA. The number of tickets sold for Glukoza's concerts totals over 1.5&nbsp;million.

Glukoza became the face of Avon Color Trend, the spokeswoman for Motivi clothing and 'My Scene' dolls, and lent her animated image and logo to Rekondor Ice Cream. Three perfumes were also released: G [Gloss], L [Life], and Z [Zoom]. She was featured on the cover of such magazines as Elle Girl, Hello Magazine, Seventeen Magazine, and Shape Magazine.

In June 2005 Glukoza released her second album "[[Moskva (Gluk'oza album)|Moskva]]", with hit singles "Schweine" (''Pigs''), "Yura," "Moskva" (''Moscow''), and "K Chertu" (''To hell''), bringing her total album sales to over one million. In December 2005 she recorded and released an English version of her popular song "Schweine" that never took off with the public. In late June 2006 Glukoza married Alexander Chistyakov, manager of the power supply systems of Russia. Her engagement to Alexander inspired Glukoza's manager, [[Maxim Fadeev]], to write her most recent hit single "Svadba" (''Wedding'').

Later in October 2006, Glukoza released a new single titled "Sashok", about her love for her husband Alexander. The next month, in November, Glukoza gave her rumored-to-be "final" concert in [[St. Petersburg]]. Glukoza continued to give small private concerts around Russia until January 2007, when she announced that she was taking her pregnancy leave.

After her pregnancy leave, she released another single called "Dengi" (''Money''). During the festival, "[[New wave music|New Wave]]" she sang a duet with [[Maxim Fadeev]] "Sicily". In May 2010 she released new single "Vot Takaya Lubov'", video.

Her song 'Schweine' was featured prominently in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' on the game's Eastern European-radio station [[Vladivostok FM]].

In 2011, Glukoza competed on the Russian version of the television show [[Fort Boyard (TV series)|Fort Boyard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFnvLop49wE|title=Lutte dans la boue –  Glukoza|last=Tron Jaris|access-date=December 17, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In 2017, Glukoza starred alongside [[Aleksandr Revva]] in the comedy film ''[[Naughty Grandma]]''.

== Personal life ==
She married Aleksandr Chistyakov (b. January 25, 1973) on June 17, 2006. The couple has two daughters: Lidia Chistyakova (born on May 10, 2007) and Vera Chistyakova (born on September 8, 2011). Both girls were born in Spain. She currently lives in Moscow, Russia with her family.

In August 2020 Glukoza was banned from entering [[Ukraine]] for three years because of a violation Ukrainian law "by visiting the [[Crimean peninsula]] occupied by her country,".<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [https://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/scandal/5f2d165e7bbe9 RUSSIAN SINGER GLUKOZA WAS NOT ALLOWED INTO UKRAINE AND WAS BANNED FOR 3 YEARS], [[Tablo ID]] (7 August 2020)</ref> [[Crimea]] is currently [[Political status of Crimea|under dispute by Russia and Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gutterman |first=Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140318 |title=Putin signs Crimea treaty, will not seize other Ukraine regions |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=18 March 2014|access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref>
