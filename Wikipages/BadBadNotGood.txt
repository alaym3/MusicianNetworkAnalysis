BBNG has cited a wide range of influences, including Brazilian composer [[Arthur Verocai]], [[Miles Davis]], saxophonists [[John Coltrane]] and [[Albert Ayler]], [[Sam Rivers (jazz musician)|Sam Rivers]], drummers [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and [[Art Blakey]], [[Sun Ra]], producer [[J Dilla]], [[Kurt Cobain]], and [[Wu-Tang Clan]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neil|first=Matthew Sean|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|title=Locating Jazz in 21st Century American Society|publisher=University of California Riverside|year=2018|location=Riverside, CA|pages=238–239|chapter=BadBadNotGood and Jazz Blasphemy|access-date=2020-07-01|archive-date=2020-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701232930/https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|url-status=live}}</ref>

BBNG generally eschews being called a jazz band, acknowledging that their music contains elements of rock music, Brazilian music, electronic music, and soul music, and does not maintain jazz tradition, with Whitty commenting, "all we’re really trying to do is create something that’s unique and honest to who we are... we don’t really belong in any sort of box or are following any tradition or anything like that.”<ref name=":1" /> When asked in a 2016 interview about the group's relationship with jazz,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hyman|first=Dan|date=July 26, 2016|title=VICE - BadBadNotGood Are Trying to Be Somewhat Interesting and It's Going Pretty Well|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rkqmn9/badbadnotgood-iv-interview-2016|access-date=2020-06-29|website=www.vice.com|language=en|archive-date=2020-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808013626/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rkqmn9/badbadnotgood-iv-interview-2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Sowinski explained:
{{Quote|text="We look at what we do as approaching music with jazz training. We use the jazz language when we’re writing, but we’re not proficient. We’re not the top musicians of the genre, so we don’t try to assume ourselves as prolific innovators because jazz has this history of boundary-pushing limitless constant progression, eight hours a day of practice. We’ve learned to find different interests—whether it’s production, recording techniques, writing, exploring totally different genres of music—instead of progressing our instruments per se as soloists. We listen to Coltrane and Sun Ra and all these progressives, but for us because of the internet and the age we’re a part of we love to study everything. It’s this weird ongoing thing for us to keep being educated and learning."|author=|title=|source=}}BBNG's relationship with the style is further complicated by the fact that the jazz community at large sees the group as outside of the genre but more mainstream music fans, those with less knowledge of the tradition and musicianship, perceive them to be jazz and representative of a bright future for the genre because of their accessibility. Ethnomusicologist Matthew Neil noted, “BBNG will continue to represent jazz, even as the jazz community, and even the group themselves, wish that they did not speak for jazz. Put simply: BBNG is jazz if people think they are.”<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neil|first=Matthew Sean|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|title=Locating Jazz in 21st Century American Society|publisher=University of California Riverside|year=2018|location=Riverside, CA|pages=242–248|chapter=BadBadNotGood and Jazz Blasphemy|access-date=2020-07-01|archive-date=2020-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701232930/https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite BBNG’s rising popularity and press coverage by popular music media in the early 2010s, the band went unnoticed by the jazz community at large until after the release of their second album when off-the-cuff comments disregarding the jazz establishment were perceived as inflammatory by the jazz media.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neil|first=Matthew Sean|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|title=Locating Jazz in 21st Century American Society|publisher=University of California Riverside|year=2018|location=Riverside, CA|pages=215–216|chapter=BadBadNotGood and Jazz Blasphemy|access-date=2020-07-01|archive-date=2020-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701232930/https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|url-status=live}}</ref> Critics quickly jumped to compare BBNG’s musicianship to jazz artists that had achieved similar-sized audiences, not accounting for age or experience, and thus comparing them to musicians who had spent years developing their skills.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neil|first=Matthew Sean|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6s9417q4/qt6s9417q4.pdf?t=phkcy6|title=Locating Jazz in 21st Century American Society|publisher=University of California Riverside|year=2018|location=Riverside, CA|pages=232–234|chapter=BadBadNotGood and Jazz Blasphemy|quote=Though criticisms of BBNG might not state this explicitly, I believe there is an implicit criticism in denouncements of BBNG—that the band had defiled the sacralization of jazz tradition by attempting to forego the normative path of development...

For the average local jazz group, lack of mastery at the age of 19 would not be a big deal, but because BBNG had already reached a national audience, a correction in the form of criticism of the band’s talent was needed.
