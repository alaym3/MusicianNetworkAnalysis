==Early life==
Born in [[Duncan, Oklahoma]], Axton spent his pre-teen years in [[Comanche, Oklahoma]], with his brother, John.<ref name=axtonallm>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1512|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Hoyt Axton|last=Ankeny|first=Jason| publisher= AllMusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> His mother, [[Mae Boren Axton]], a songwriter, co-wrote the classic [[rock 'n' roll]] song "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", which became a major hit for [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Pareles>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/arts/hoyt-axton-61-songwriter-singer-and-actor-in-movies.html|title=Hoyt Axton, 61, Songwriter, Singer and Actor in Movies|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 1999|author=Pareles, Jon |url-access=limited}}</ref> Some of Hoyt's own songs were also later recorded by Presley. Axton's father, John Thomas Axton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/90/Hoyt-Axton.html|title=Hoyt Axton Biography (1938–)| website= filmreference.com}}</ref> was a naval officer stationed in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida; the family joined him there in 1949.

Axton graduated from [[Robert E. Lee High School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Robert E. Lee High School]] in 1956 and left town after Knauer's Hardware Store burned down on graduation night, a prank gone wrong.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://larrycohenproductions.com/N_Fla_Music.htm| title= North Florida Music Hall of Fame| first= Larry| last= Cohen| publisher= Larry Cohen Productions| access-date= January 5, 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170820124706/http://larrycohenproductions.com/N_Fla_Music.htm| archive-date= August 20, 2017| url-status= dead}}</ref>

He attended [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]] on a scholarship,<ref name=Pareles /> and he played football for the school, but he left to enlist in the US Navy.<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

Axton was the first cousin of [[David Boren]], who served as Governor of Oklahoma, as well as three terms in the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=AX002|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|title=Axton, Mae Boren (1914–1997)|access-date=December 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
After his discharge from the Navy, Axton began singing folk songs in San Francisco nightclubs. In the early 1960s he released his first folk album, ''The Balladeer'' (recorded at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]]), which included his song "Greenback Dollar". It became a 1963 hit for [[The Kingston Trio]].<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

Axton released numerous albums throughout the 1960s and 70's. He had many minor hits of his own, such as "Boney Fingers", "When the Morning Comes", and 1979's "Della and the Dealer".<ref name=Pareles /> His vocal style featured his distinctive bass-baritone (which later deepened to near-bass) and use of [[characterization]].

Axton first appeared on television in a [[David L. Wolper]] ABC production of ''The Story of a Folksinger'' (1963). He also appeared on ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]'', hosted by [[Jack Linkletter]], during this period. In 1965, he was in an episode of ''[[Bonanza]]''<ref name=Pareles /> where he sang a duet with [[Pernell Roberts]]. In 1966, he made his film debut in the film ''[[Smoky (1966 film)|Smoky]]'' playing the role of Fred Denton, the evil brother of the character played by actor [[Fess Parker]].  He became well known in the 1970s and 1980s through his film roles, including ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), ''[[Heart Like a Wheel (film)|Heart Like a Wheel]]'' (1983), and ''[[Gremlins (film)|Gremlins]]'' (1984). His television appearances included ''[[WKRP In Cincinnati]]'' (1979) and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1984, 1985). Axton sang the jingle "The Ballad of Big Mac", touting [[McDonald's]] [[Big Mac]] onscreen in a 1969 commercial he filmed for the hamburger franchise, as well as "Head For the Mountains" in voice-overs for [[Busch Beer]] in the 1980s. He also appeared in a [[Pizza Hut]] commercial in 1985, and in a TV spot for FTD Florists with [[Merlin Olsen]] in 1989.

However, Axton's most lasting contributions were songs made famous by others: "[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]" ([[Three Dog Night]]) and "[[Never Been to Spain]]" (Three Dog Night, [[Elvis Presley]]); "Greenback Dollar" (Kingston Trio); "[[The Pusher]]" and "Snowblind Friend" ([[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]); "[[No No Song]]" ([[Ringo Starr]]); and an array of others, covered by singers such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[John Denver]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Anne Murray]]. Axton also sang a couple of [[Duet (music)|duets]] with [[Linda Ronstadt]], including "Lion in the Winter" and "[[When the Morning Comes (song)|When the Morning Comes]]" (a top 40 country hit). His composition "Joy to the World", as performed by Three Dog Night, was No. 1 on the charts for six straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. He named his record label Jeremiah after the bullfrog mentioned in the song.<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

==Personal life and death==
Axton was married four times; the first three ended in divorce.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He had five children.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/>

Axton struggled with [[cocaine]] addiction, and several of his songs, including "The Pusher", "Snowblind Friend", and "No No Song", partly reflect his negative drug experiences.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He was a proponent of medical marijuana use for many years, until he and his wife Donna were arrested in February 1997 at their Montana home for possession of approximately {{cvt|500|g|lb}} of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. His wife later explained that she offered Axton marijuana to relieve his pain and stress following his 1995 stroke. They were fined, and given [[deferred sentence]]s. Axton never fully recovered from his stroke, and he used a wheelchair much of the time afterwards. Axton died at age 61 at his home in [[Victor, Montana|Victor]], Montana, on October 26, 1999, after suffering two heart attacks in two weeks.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/><ref name=axton2>{{cite news|title=Songwriter Hoyt Axton Dead at 61 In Montana| work= Daily News|location=New York |last= Hinckley| first= David| url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-10-27/news/18115330_1_greenback-dollar-hoyt-axton-boney-fingers|date=October 27, 1999|access-date=September 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=axton3>{{cite encyclopedia| title= Axton, Hoyt Wayne (1938–1999)| encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture| publisher= Oklahoma Historical Society| last= Burke| first= Brad| url= http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AX001.html| date= October 27, 1999| access-date= September 3, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805103414/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AX001.html| archive-date= August 5, 2011| url-status= dead}}</ref>

On November 1, 2007, Axton and his mother Mae were both inducted posthumously into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=980:oklahoma-music-hall-of-fame-induction-2007&catid=55:out-a-about&Itemid=111|title= Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame Induction 2007|work= [[Tulsa Today]]| first= Jim| last= Downing | date= November 17, 2007 | url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120318054713/http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=980:oklahoma-music-hall-of-fame-induction-2007&catid=55:out-a-about&Itemid=111| archive-date= March 18, 2012| access-date= January 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://muskogeephoenix.com/local/x2128977011/-Thank-God-I-m-from-Oklahoma-inductee-says| first= D.
