==History==

===Background and formation===
Friends since grade school, all three members were born and raised in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] section of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. Erick and Meechy Darko are of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] descent. One of the first things Dimitri Simms ([[Meechy Darko]]), Antonio Lewis ([[Zombie Juice]]) and Erick Elliott ([[Erick Arc Elliott|The Architect]]) bonded over was the Japanese anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and wrestling. During their teenage years, they began experimenting with [[psychedelic drug]]s, such as [[psilocybin]] mushrooms and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. Zombie Juice, along with fellow Flatbush native [[Issa Gold]] of [[the Underachievers]] (Erick did not participate), specifically started looking into the [[Indigo children|indigo]] lifestyle. Meechy Darko said the first time he took psilocybin mushrooms, he underwent [[Ego death]] and had a sort of rebirth of [[conscience]].

===Mixtapes and rise in popularity (2010–2013)===
Erick Arc Elliott, who had been making his own solo music, decided to bring the group together musically around 2010.<ref name="clash">{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Errol |date=March 11, 2013 |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/graveyard-shift-flatbush-zombies |title=Graveyard Shift - Flatbush Zombies |journal=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref> Their first club performance took place in 2012, at 307 in Waterloo.<ref name="xxl">{{cite journal |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=May 8, 2013 |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/05/flatbush-zombies-are-rocking-dead/ |title=Flatbush Zombies Are Rocking Dead |journal=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref> The group's popularity grew after releasing the "Thug Waffle" video on [[YouTube]].<ref name="xxl" /><ref name="mtv">{{cite news |last=Mlynar |first=Phillip |date=February 1, 2012 |url=http://www.mtvhive.com/2012/02/01/flatbush-zombies-interview/?all=1 |title=Flatbush Zombies Want to Be Decapitated or Taxidermied  |publisher=[[MTV]] |access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref> Later in the year, Flatbush Zombies released their debut [[mixtape]], titled ''D.R.U.G.S.'', which stands for "Death and Reincarnation Under God's Supervision."

===Clockwork Indigo and ''3001: A Laced Odyssey'' (2014–2018)===

On February 13, 2014, Flatbush Zombies released a new song, "LiT". Flatbush Zombies revealed to ''XXL'' that their [[extended play]] (EP), ''It's All a Matter of Perspective'', had been scrapped. Instead the group told ''XXL'' to "expect an album this year."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/MusicVideo/ClickHear/flatbush_zombies-lit|title=Flatbush Zombies|work=exclaim.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/02/flatbush-zombies-announce-its-all-a-matter-of-perspective-share-new-song-lit/|title=Flatbush Zombies announce new EP, It's All A Matter Of Perspective, stream "LiT"|work=Consequence of Sound}}</ref>

In September 2014, it was announced that Flatbush Zombies would be touring with fellow Brooklyn-based rap group [[the Underachievers]], and they would be collectively known as Clockwork Indigo. The two groups subsequently released a collaborative song titled "Butterfly Effect," followed by an EP titled ''[[Clockwork Indigo EP|Clockwork Indigo]]'', on October 17, 2014. They claim that they came up with the idea of forming Clockwork Indigo, from a "strange LSD trip while watching ''[[Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''". During the Clockwork Indigo [[concert tour]], the group collectively wore white clothing as did Alex's gang in the film ''A Clockwork Orange''.

On March 15, 2015, Flatbush Zombies released a new single on SoundCloud titled "Red Eye to Paris" featuring [[Grime music|UK Grime]] artist [[Skepta]].
