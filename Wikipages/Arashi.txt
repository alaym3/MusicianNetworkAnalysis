{{Nihongo|'''Arashi'''|{{linktext|lang=ja|嵐}}||{{lit.}} "Storm"}} is a Japanese [[boy band]] consisting of five members formed under the [[Johnny & Associates]] talent agency. The members are [[Satoshi Ohno]], [[Sho Sakurai]], [[Masaki Aiba]], [[Kazunari Ninomiya]], and [[Jun Matsumoto]]. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999. The group was initially signed to [[Pony Canyon]] and released one studio album and six singles—beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label [[J Storm]] in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases.<ref name="allmusic" /> While their debut single sold close to a million copies, the group took a mixture of pop and alternate/contemporary approach to its music which attracted core followers, but subsequently faced commercially slow sales.

With the release of their eighteenth single "[[Love So Sweet]]", Arashi began to gain commercial success as it was used as the opening theme song for the high-rating [[Japanese television drama|drama]] ''[[Hana Yori Dango Returns (TV series)|Hana Yori Dango 2]]'' whose protagonist is played by Matsumoto, making it one of the top five best-selling singles of 2007 in Japan and the group's first single to exceed 400,000 copies sold overall in nearly seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artv.info/ar0701.html#hanadan2|title=Hana Yori Dango 2 ratings|website=Artv|access-date=2010-02-05| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201233222/http://artv.info/ar0701.html| archive-date= 1 February 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="annualchart2007">{{cite web|url=http://contents.oricon.co.jp/music/special/071218_01_01.html|script-title=ja:年間シングルランキング|language=ja|website=[[Oricon]]|date=2007-12-18}}</ref> For the next two years, Arashi gained a number of achievements and records as they became the first artist to place the top two rankings on the ''[[Oricon]]'' singles yearly chart for two consecutive years with their singles "[[Truth / Kaze no Mukō e]]" and "[[One Love (Arashi song)|One Love]]" in 2008 and "[[Believe / Kumorinochi, Kaisei]]" and "[[Ashita no Kioku / Crazy Moon (Kimi wa Muteki)]]" in 2009, simultaneously topped the 2009 ''Oricon'' singles, album and music DVD yearly charts, and became the third artist in ''Oricon'' history to monopolize the top three best-selling singles of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/confidence/61012/full/|script-title=ja:(年間ランキング) 嵐、19年ぶりのシングル1位、2位独占|trans-title=(Yearly Ranking) Arashi reach 1st and 2nd spots for the first time in 19 years|date=2008-12-11|language=ja|website=Oricon}}</ref><ref name="tokyograph_09rank">{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-5601|title=Arashi sweeps 2009 sales rankings|date=2009-12-18|website=Tokyograph|access-date=2009-12-18}}</ref><ref name="2009_rank">{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/71742/full/|title=嵐、史上初の"CD、DVD4 冠"達成～シングルTOP3独占は光GENJI以来21年ぶり|trans-title=Arashi is the first ever "CD, DVD 4-category champions".

On November 4, 2011, Arashi reportedly donated approximately 300 million yen to the disaster-stricken regions in northern Japan.

About 50 million yen comprises the members’ total royalties received from the sale of the pocket edition of their book ''Nippon no Arashi''. The remaining amount comes from the publisher's revenues on the book and from the sale of goods at their charity event at Tokyo Dome in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20111103-OHT1T00338.htm |title=嵐、被災３県にドーンと３億円寄付…著書＆イベント収益 |publisher=Sports Hochi |date=2011-11-04 |access-date=2011-11-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107064930/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20111103-OHT1T00338.htm |archive-date=2011-11-07 }}</ref>

On February 22, 2012, Arashi visited the temporary houses in [[Shichigahama, Miyagi]] and spoke with victims of the disaster.

===Waku-Waku School of Arashi===
After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in March, Arashi considered canceling their "ARASHI LIVE TOUR Beautiful World" concerts scheduled from June 24 to June 26, 2011, at Tokyo Dome. However, in April, they decided to use those three days to hold charity events instead.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:「嵐の学校」で２億円寄付！３日連続チャリティーイベント |url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20110626-OHT1T00303.htm |publisher=[[Sports Hochi]] |date=26 June 2011 |access-date=23 December 2018 |language=ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628165732/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20110626-OHT1T00303.htm |archive-date=28 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Part of the proceeds from a possible total audience of 225,000 were donated to charity. The release of a pocket-sized version of their book ''Nippon no Arashi'', which originally distributed to 40,000 schools in 2010, was also announced on May 19, 2011. All of the revenue was donated to charity.<ref name="tour2011" />
