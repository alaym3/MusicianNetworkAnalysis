'''Chester Charles Bennington''' (March 20, 1976&nbsp;– July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actor. He served as the lead vocalist of the bands [[Linkin Park]], Grey Daze, [[Dead by Sunrise]], and [[Stone Temple Pilots]].

Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'' (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=173 |title=Linkin Park&nbsp;– Hybrid Theory Review |publisher=sputnikmusic |date=September 2, 2006 |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Linkin Park's following studio albums, from ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'' (2003) to ''[[One More Light]]'' (2017), continued the band's success.

Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, ''[[Out of Ashes]]'', was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the [[extended play]] record ''[[High Rise (EP)|High Rise]]'' on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' (2006), ''[[Crank: High Voltage]]'' (2009), and ''[[Saw 3D]]'' (2010).

Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in [[Palos Verdes Estates, California]]; his death was ruled a [[suicide by hanging]]. ''[[Hit Parader]]'' magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bucher|first=Chris|date=July 20, 2017|title=Chester Bennington Dead: Top Linkin Park Songs & Albums|publisher=[[Heavy.com]]|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/07/linkin-park-best-top-songs-chester-bennington-suicide-albums/|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Bennington has been credited by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.<ref name=":2" /> Writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned [[Nu metal|nu-metal]] universal".<ref name=":1" />

==Career==

===Early acts===
Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? <!---The band stylized their name with a '?' --> and together they released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey Daze, a [[post-grunge]] band from [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The band recorded a demo in 1993 and two albums: ''Wake Me'' in 1994, and ''...No Sun Today'' in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998.<ref name="stone1">Rolling Stone Magazine, [http://www.lptimes.com/bio/bio_band.html Linkin Park&nbsp;– Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224225657/http://www.lptimes.com/bio/bio_band.html |date=December 24, 2005 }} (March 14, 2002), The Linkin Park Times; retrieved on June 24, 2007.</ref>

===Linkin Park===
[[File:Chester Bennington, Linkin Park @ Sonisphere.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bennington performing with Linkin Park at the 2009 [[Sonisphere Festival]]]]
Bennington had been frustrated and nearly quit his musical career altogether when [[Jeff Blue]], the vice president of [[artists and repertoire]] at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park (then 'Xero').<ref name="stone1" /> Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm<ref name="kerrang-2008" /> and traveled to California, for the audition, in which he successfully won a place in the band. He'd managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process.  

Bennington and [[Mike Shinoda]], the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record deal.<ref name="stone1" /> After the band had faced numerous rejections, Blue, now a vice president of artists and repertoire at [[Warner Bros. Records]],<ref name="stone1" /> intervened again to help the band sign with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner.]] 

On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'', through [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to ''Hybrid Theory'' based on some early material.<ref name="rolling stone 2002">Fricke, David. [http://www.lptimes.com/bio/bio_band.html "Rap Metal Rulers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224225657/http://www.lptimes.com/bio/bio_band.html |date=December 24, 2005 }}, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' No. 891, March 14, 2002</ref> Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as "everyday emotions you talk about and think about."<ref name="bbc session">[[BBC Radio 1]], Evening Session Interview with [[Steve Lamacq]], June 13, 2001</ref><ref name="text bbc session">{{cite web|url=http://lptimes.com/article/BBC_061301.html|title=BBC Session Interview|access-date=September 19, 2007|publisher=LP Times|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123122820/http://lptimes.com/article/BBC_061301.html|archive-date=January 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bennington later described the songwriting experience to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in early 2002, "It's easy to fall into that thing&nbsp;– 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like '[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down."<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> 

Bennington primarily served as Linkin Park's lead vocalist, but occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. ''[[AllMusic|All Music Guide]]'' described Bennington's vocals as "higher-pitched" and "emotional", in contrast to Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery.<ref name="mtv1" /> Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's songs.<ref name="nyrock-int">{{cite news|first = Talia|last = Soghomonian|title = interview with Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park|date = May 2003|url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2003/linkin_int.asp|work = NY Rock|access-date = September 30, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081004203828/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2003/linkin_int.asp|archive-date = October 4, 2008|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===Stone Temple Pilots===
{{further|Stone Temple Pilots}}
In February 2013, [[Stone Temple Pilots]] parted ways with long-time lead singer [[Scott Weiland]]. The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the stage at [[KROQ Weenie Roast|KROQ's Weenie Roast]] with the band. The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called "[[Out of Time (Stone Temple Pilots song)|Out of Time]]", which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official website. It was later announced by Bennington and the band in an exclusive [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a new album and tour. The song "Out of Time" is featured on their EP ''[[High Rise (EP)|High Rise]]'', which was released on October 8, 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hartmann |first=Graham |url=http://loudwire.com/linkin-park-joe-hahn-cool-with-chester-bennington-stone-temple-pilots/?trackback=tsmclip |title=Linkin Park DJ Joe Hahn Cool With Chester Bennington's Stone Temple Pilots Gig |work=[[Loudwire]] |date=October 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005115340/http://loudwire.com/linkin-park-joe-hahn-cool-with-chester-bennington-stone-temple-pilots/ |archive-date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=July 20, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Bennington reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, "Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer." Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015 and was replaced two years later by [[Jeff Gutt]].<ref name="elporvenir1" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Stanisci |first=Grace |url=https://ca.music.yahoo.com/blogs/sound-check/stone-temple-pilots-bash-lead-singer-linkin-park-171532244.html |title=Stone Temple Pilots fans bash new lead singer, Linkin Park's Chester Bennington |work=Sound Check |publisher=[[Yahoo!

[[Fred Durst]], lead singer of [[Limp Bizkit]], talked about the impact of Chester Bennington and Linkin Park on the nu metal scene, "I can say so many wonderful things about the Chester I knew. He had a way of making anyone he spoke to feel heard, understood and significant. His aura and spirit were contagious and empowering. Often those types of people have so much pain and torture inside that the last thing they want is to contaminate or break the spirit of others. He would go out of his way to make sure you knew he truly cares. As real and transparent as our conversations would be, he was always the one projecting light on the shadows. In my last conversation with him, he was holding his two cute puppies and giving me the most selfless and motivational compliments in regards to Limp Bizkit and myself and thanking me for paving the path for bands like Linkin Park. In return, I told him if it weren’t for him and his voice and his words, this genre would never have reached the masses and affected so many lives."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-07-25|title=Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst on Chester Bennington: 'He Had a Way of Making Anyone He Spoke to Feel Heard'|url=http://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/rock/7880909/limp-bizkit-fred-durst-chester-bennington-interview|access-date=2021-09-01|website=www.billboard.com|language=en}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Jon Caramanica]] commented that Bennington's ability to "pair serrated rawness with sleek melody" separated him from other contemporary singers, and also from the artists he was influenced by. Caramanica noted, "He was an [[emo]] sympathizer in a time when [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was still setting the agenda for mainstream [[hard rock]], and a [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] enthusiast who found ways to make hip-hop-informed music that benefited from his very un-hip-hop skill set". As Bennington acquired influences from [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[hardcore punk]] acts, the journalist believed this was the factor that made Linkin Park survive the "rise and precipitous fall of the rap-rock era", calling the musician "a rock music polymath".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/arts/music/chester-bennington-linkin-park.html |title=Chester Bennington Brought Rock Ferocity to Linkin Park's Innovations |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' argued, "Perhaps more than Linkin Park's influential sound, Bennington's real artistic legacy will be the message he put across&nbsp;– the reassurance he offered from the dark".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-linkin-park-chester-bennington-20170721-story.html |title=Appreciation Linkin Park's Chester Bennington was a voice of reassurance from the dark |last=Wood |first=Mikael |date=July 21, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>

The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting,
