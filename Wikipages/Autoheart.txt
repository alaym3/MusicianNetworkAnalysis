==History==
Jody Gadsden and Simon Neilson met in 2007 and began working together under the name The Gadsdens after collaborating on a song for a short film soundtrack. The original lineup also featured drummer David Roman and guitarist Drew Wilson, who was later replaced by Barney JC. Their debut single, ''The Sailor Song'', released in 2009, was championed by Bob Harris on his BBC Radio 2 Show <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rz1sf|title=BBC Radio 2 - Bob Harris Sunday, 11/04/2010|website=BBC|accessdate=2020-06-23}}</ref> and was Single of the Week on Shaun Keaveny’s [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] radio show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00npdf4|title=BBC Radio 6 Music - Shaun Keaveny, 02/11/2009|website=BBC|accessdate=2020-06-23}}</ref> The single release was accompanied by an animated music video <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUcdobQxrRU|title=The Sailor Song |publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2020-06-23}}</ref> by London-based animator and director Gavin Leisfield.

The Gadsdens appeared on The Radcliffe and Maconie [[BBC Radio 2]] show on 17 November 2009 performing three tracks, ''The Sailor Song'', ''Too Polite To Fight'' and ''Agoraphobia''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/radcliffemaconie/galleries/2797/5/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112190355/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/radcliffemaconie/galleries/2797/5/ |archive-date=2008-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' made ''The Sailor Song'' their Track of the Day, citing; “A Charming and pulsating piece of piano pop that holds no surprises, tempo shifts or digital tweaks, it’s naturally sentimental, sending strong links to Tracy Chapman, mostly due to the vocal style of frontman Jody Gadsden”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qthemusic.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207051145/http://news.qthemusic.com/2009/12/the_gadsens_-_the_sailor_song.html|url-status=dead|title=Q Magazine|archivedate=December 7, 2009|website=Q Magazine}}</ref>

The song was originally included on the [[Bugsy Malone#Soundtrack|Bugsy Malone soundtrack]].

The band were featured as The Guardian's New Band of the Day on 9 July 2013.  Gadsden's vocal style was likened to that of [[Anohni]] and [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=New Band of the Day: Autoheart|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/09/autoheart|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>  

Autoheart's debut album ''Punch'' was released on 15 July 2013 on O/R Records. With a lineup including bassist Jihea Oh, the album was produced by Danton Supple who has previously worked with [[Morrissey]] and [[Coldplay]].  It was preceded by three singles: ''Control'' (5 November 2012), ''Lent'' (11 February 2013), double A-side single ''Moscow'' / ''Agoraphobia'' (8 July 2013). The band released a final single, live favourite ''Beat the Love'' (28 January 2014), which did not feature on the album. A video for ''Moscow'', directed by Gavin Leisfield, featured kissing Russian soldiers which the band said was to show "support and love to the LGBT communities of Russia and their friends, who are faced daily with violence and the criminalisation of love and of freedom of expression." Band also released self-directed videos for ''Agoraphobia'' and ''Beat The Love''. 

The band's second album, the self-produced ''I Can Build A Fire'' was released 26 August 2016. The lineup for the album included Berlin-based singer Anne Haight, who provided additional vocals on tracks ''Oxford Blood'', ''We Can Build a Fire'', and ''Joseph''. The video for the album's lead single ''Oxford Blood'', released the same month, was directed by [[Prano Bailey-Bond]], and starred American gender non-conforming model, actor and activist [[Rain Dove]]. In June 2017, the band released an EP titled ''My Hallelujah'' featuring the title track, taken from the album along with three new songs. The video was directed by queer drag performer, artist and moving image creator Joseph Wilson.

In 2017, the band released ''Punch - Special Edition'' featuring home demo versions of album tracks, including an early demo of ''The Sailor Song''. On 27 December 2019 the band released the single ''Wretch''. A video of the band performing the song live, directed by percussionist and film-maker Ruairi Glasheen, was released at the same time. 

The band's third album is ''Hellbent'' and its first single, ''I Know That He Loves Me'' was released October 15, 2021.
