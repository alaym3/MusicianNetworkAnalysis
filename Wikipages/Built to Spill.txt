'''Built to Spill''' is an American [[indie rock]] band based in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], United States formed in 1992. Centered on guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. The band is noted for its long and often complex song structures{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} centered on Martsch's guitar playing.

==History==
Former [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} The band's name came from an invented phrase in an [[exquisite corpse]]-like game Martsch played with his wife.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Built to Spill Interview |work=[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |date=2018-02-21 |url=https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/built-to-spill-interview/ |language=en |access-date=2021-04-26 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song "Still Flat" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

Martsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major-label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and [[Scott Plouf]]. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.

In 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.

Warner Bros.

Its sixth studio album, ''[[You in Reverse]]'', was recorded in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in 2004 but was not released until April 11, 2006. The band's official lineup for the album was Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and [[Jim Roth (musician)|Jim Roth]], who was formerly only a touring guitarist. [[Brett Netson]] provided guitar work on several songs and later rejoined the band as a full-time member.

After the release of ''You in Reverse'', Built to Spill continued touring almost non-stop. In March 2006, Martsch suffered a detached [[retina]], which required surgery. This forced the band to miss an appearance at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival and postpone several dates of the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/36069-built-to-spill-postpone-us-tour-play-b-ball-instead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316225300/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/36069-built-to-spill-postpone-us-tour-play-b-ball-instead |archive-date=2008-03-16 |title=Pitchfork – Built to Spill Postpone U.S. Tour, Play B-ball Instead |publisher=PitchforkMedia.com |date=2008-03-16 |access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref> Even worse news came when former drummer Andy Capps was found dead in his home on May 18, 2006.<ref>{{cite web

The band resumed touring on June 3, 2006, with a show that included four new songs. This show and many on the tour included the dedication of the song "Car" to Capps, who had played on the track when it was recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://db.etree.org/lookup_show.php?shows_key=321364 |title=de.etree.org – Built To Spill 06/03/06 |publisher=Db.etree.org |date=2006-06-03 |access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref>

Warner Bros. Records stated that Built to Spill had been recording its follow-up to ''You in Reverse'' on and off during the 2006 tour,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38016-built-to-spill-working-on-new-album |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218052047/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38016-built-to-spill-working-on-new-album |archive-date=2008-12-18 |title=Pitchfork – Built to Spill Working on New Album |publisher=PitchforkMedia.com |date=2008-12-18 |access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref> but nothing appeared until the July 10, 2007, release of a 12" single, "They Got Away"/"Re-Arrange". "They Got Away" is a heavily [[reggae]]-influenced original song, while "Re-Arrange" is a cover of a song by the reggae band the [[The Gladiators (band)|Gladiators]].

The US tour was scheduled through October 2007, followed by an Australian tour. Martsch stated in a September 2007 interview that he didn't want to tour in the United States again until the band records;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/12782.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720075848/http://www.livedaily.com/news/12782.html |archive-date=2008-07-20 |title=LiveDaily – Built to Spill balances albums, shows |publisher=LiveDaily.com |date=2008-07-20 |access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref> however, the band then announced a one-month US national tour for spring of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47528-built-to-spill-keep-on-trucking-into-2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210025122/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47528-built-to-spill-keep-on-trucking-into-2008 |archive-date=2008-12-10 |title=Pitchfork – 2008 tour announcement |publisher=PitchforkMedia.com |date=2008-12-10 |access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref>

Later in the interview, Martsch gave his perspective on the future of Built to Spill past the current material; "I do think that Built to Spill could be something better than ever just because our lineup is better than ever ... I think there is potential for the five of us to collaborate on something that is just way better than anything that I have ever come up with by myself or that we have done in the past." Martsch also interjected that "This coming record we're not doing that—it's mostly going to be songs that I have been working on." The band extended its 2008 tour in the United States and Europe, performing the album ''[[Perfect from Now On]]'' in its entirety.

In 2009, the band announced its next album, ''[[There Is No Enemy]]''. The tracklist and album art were revealed on August 17, 2009, the first single, "Hindsight", was released on September 8, and the album was released on October 6, 2009.<ref name="enemy">[http://pitchfork.com/news/35548-built-to-spills-doug-martsch-talks-new-lp/ Built to Spill's Doug Martsch Talks New LP], Pitchfork Media, June 9, 2009.</ref> The band toured from August through November 2009<ref>[http://www.builttospill.com/news/2009/08/26/built-spill-hit-road-headlining-us-tour-august Built to Spill hit the road for headlining U.S. tour in August].

In July 2010, Martsch appeared on the first release from Brett Nelson's the [[The Electronic Anthology Project|Electric Anthology Project]], in which Nelson creates covers from an artist in a synth-pop style, featuring the vocalist from the original version. This self-titled EP, which featured one song from each Built to Spill record (using anagrams of their original titles) and newly recorded vocals by Doug Martsch, received a moderately favorable review in Pitchfork, even though "it was obviously released as a goof," and the "good moments almost make you wish Martsch had taken this concept more seriously."<ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2010/07/built-to-spill-remix-their-own-songs/1 Built to Spill remix their own songs].

On October 25, 2012, Built to Spill played a secret, invitation-only show at the Bunk Bar in Portland, Oregon, with a new rhythm section consisting of Jason Albertini ([[Helvetia (band)|Helvetia]], [[Duster (band)|Duster]]) on bass and Stephen Gere (Uzala, Brett Netson Band, Atomic Mama) on drums.<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: Built to Spill secret show at Bunk Bar|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2012/10/review_built_to_spill_secret_s.html|access-date=30 October 2012|newspaper=Oregonian|date=26 October 2012}}</ref> On January 7, 2013, Martsch, Netson and guitarist Jim Roth announced that Albertini and Gere would be permanent replacements for Plouf and Nelson, who were departing the band amicably.<ref>Deeds, Michael (January 7, 2013).

''Idaho Statesman''.</ref> Built to Spill continued touring periodically as a five-piece but didn't release another album for several years. Martsch would later state that a 2012 album was abandoned due to the departure of Nelson and Plouf and his dissatisfaction with the songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2015/apr/09/built-spills-new-album-was-long-time-coming/ |title=Built to Spill's New Album Was a Long Time Coming  |last1=Miasnikov |first1=Cassandra |date=April 9, 2015}}</ref>

''[[Untethered Moon]]'' was released on April 18, 2015. The album was recorded as a trio with Martsch, Albertini, and Gere and was co-produced by Martsch and frequent Built to Spill guest keyboardist and Quasi frontman [[Sam Coomes]]. The band toured summer/fall 2015 in support of the new album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mixdownmag.com.au/built-spill |title=Built to Spill: Follow the Leader |last1=Welby |first1=Augustus |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

Brett Netson and Jim Roth left the band in the latter half of 2015 and a trio lineup of Martsch, Albertini and Gere debuted on a spring 2016 West Coast run.

On September 14, 2017 Built to Spill announced on their Facebook page that they were moving on from Warner Brothers and taking over the management of builttospill.com. 

In October 2018, Martsch announced through a post on the Built to Spill Facebook page that the band will return to its initial idea of having a shifting rotation of members for each release. So BtS transitioned from a five-piece to a trio with new members Melanie Radford on bass and Teresa Esguerra on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/10557801524/posts/10155388988431525/ |title=Built to Spill – After a couple long stints of playing... |website=Facebook.com |access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> On June 12, 2020, they released the cover album ''Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston''.<ref>Matthew Strauss (March 3, 2020).
