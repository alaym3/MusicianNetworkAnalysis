==Music career==

===1993–1999: Early career===
In 1993, at the age of 14, he joined the band Slam, later to be called Reverse Polarity.<ref name="early">{{cite web|url=http://andrewwk.com/about/page/4|title=About: Early Work|publisher=AndrewWK.com|access-date=January 3, 2008}}</ref> In 1996, a song recorded by W.K. entitled "Mr. Surprise" was included on ''Plant the Flower Seeds'', a compilation by the [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]-based record label Westside Audio Laboratories, marking his first publicly-released recording.{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=18}} Over the next five years, W.K. would play in a number of Detroit-based [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands,<ref name="Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/andrew-wk-mn0000041283/biography|title=Andrew W.K. > Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 3, 2015|last=Phares|first=Heather}}</ref> including The Pterodactyls; Lab Lobotomy; Music Band; Mr. Velocity Hopkins; playing drums in [[grindcore]] metal band, Kathode;<ref name="early"/> in addition to forming the [[noise rock]] project Ancient Art of Boar, later known as AAB, which served as an outlet for his early solo material.<ref name="early"/>

In 1998, W.K. moved from Michigan to New York City, where he worked as a bubblegum machine salesman, an opera ticket salesman, a fashion photographer, a window decorator at the [[Bergdorf Goodman]] department store, a milkshake maker and waiter for a Mexican restaurant and in the offices of avant-garde fashion company [[Comme des Garçons]], among other short-lived jobs.<ref name= popmusic/><ref name=loudwire/> He ended the AAB project and began recording new solo material under his full "Andrew Wilkes-Krier" name; the year saw the release of a cassette-only single entitled ''Room to Breathe'' on [[Hanson Records]].<ref name="early"/> A follow-up release entitled ''You Are What You Eat'' was scrapped when the master recordings went missing.<ref name="early"/><ref>However, a single copy of ''You Are What You Eat'' was recently discovered by a fan who had purchased a used copy of ''Room To Breathe'' and found that the tape ''You Are What You Eat'' was also dubbed onto the tape. The fan sent a copy of the music to Andrew's management. Andrew confirmed the recording as ''You Are What You Eat'', and discussed the possibility of someday re-releasing both records.</ref> W.K. also recorded the soundtrack for an independent film named ''Poltergeist'' made by [[Aaron Dilloway]] and himself, one track of which appeared on the Hanson Records compilation ''Labyrinths & Jokes''.<ref name="early"/> In 1999, he moved to [[Seffner, Florida]], to start building his live band with drummer [[Donald Tardy|Donald "D.T." Tardy]], of [[death metal]] band [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]].<ref name=popmusic/>

=== 2000–2003: Solo breakthrough, ''I Get Wet'' and ''The Wolf'' ===
In March 2000, Wilkes-Krier released his first [[extended play|EP]], ''Girls Own Juice'', also abbreviated as ''AWKGOJ'', on [[Bulb Records]], which would be his first solo release under the moniker Andrew W.K. (he had first been credited as "Andrew W.K." for a remix entitled "Wolf Eyes Rules (What Kinda Band?)" for the noise rock band [[Wolf Eyes]]{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=52}}) and marked the beginnings of a [[hard rock]]-influenced musical style with elements of his more experimental tendencies, described as "[[Judas Priest]] mixed with [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]" by Magas, a collaborator of W.K.'s.{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=53}}

The release increased buzz for W.K., centered around his "hedonistic, so-dumb-it's-smart rawk."<ref name="Bio"/> Andrew W.K. continued to build his reputation by performing various solo gigs in the New York and other East Coast areas. Wilkes-Krier and his then manager, [[Matt Sweeney]], later shopped out a number of Andrew W.K. demo tapes, each accompanied by a handwritten letter. One tape reached [[alternative rock]] musician [[Dave Grohl]]; impressed, Grohl offered Andrew W.K. a slot opening for his band [[Foo Fighters]] at a concert in [[San Francisco]], which he accepted.{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=55}}

Another tape reached [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] executive Lewis Largent, who liked the demos enough to attend an Andrew W.K. gig at the [[Mercury Lounge]], where Largent was impressed by how W.K. "won over every last person in the audience."{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=55}} Wilkes-Krier reacted with surprise to Island's interest in him, and "despite his manager's advice that you classically don't go with the first offer, [he] 'wanted to get down to work as quickly as possible and not fuck around", as Sweeney recalls.{{sfn|Crandall|2014|p=55}} ''Girls Own Juice'' was followed by another Bulb Records EP entitled ''[[Party Til You Puke]]'' in October 2000.<ref name="early"/> Following the release of ''Party Til You Puke'', Andrew W.K. left Bulb Records amicably to sign with [[Island Records]].<ref name="early"/>

W.K.'s major-label debut studio album, ''[[I Get Wet]]'', was released on November 13, 2001 on Island Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musosguide.com/andrew-wk-i-get-wet/4844|title=Andrew WK – I Get Wet|publisher=Muso's Guide|date=June 9, 2009|access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Klosterman">{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/409316675/|title='I Get Wet': Dripping With Hollow Delights|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 31, 2002|page=G2|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck}}</ref> Continuing the sound established by his previous Bulb Records EPs, ''I Get Wet'' is characterized by its [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[punk rock]] influences and lyrical content revolving around partying.<ref name="Bio"/>

The album is known for its cover art: a photograph by [[Roe Ethridge]] of Andrew W.K. with a stream of blood running from his nose onto his chin and neck,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/409310449/|title=Andrew W.K.

''I Get Wet'' earned positive press from publications such as ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and featured two UK hit singles, "[[Party Hard]]" and "[[She Is Beautiful]]", also rising to the top spot on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers]] albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/andrew-wk-mn0000041283/awards|title=Andrew W.K. > Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 2, 2012}}</ref> At the same time, W.K. also developed a reputation for his highly energetic live shows.<ref name="Bio"/> Andrew W.K. joined [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s [[Ozzfest]] that summer, and a number of ''I Get Wet''{{'}}s tracks, such as "Party Hard", "It's Time to Party", and "Fun Night" were licensed for use in various video games, films, TV series, and commercials. In 2002, W.K., Gibson Goodness and Alec Rominger re-recorded his song "We Want Fun" from ''AWKGOJ'' for the soundtrack of ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]''; an accompanying music video was also produced, filmed and directed by [[Jeff Tremaine]] with additional camera work by [[Spike Jonze]].

In late 2003, W.K. released his second studio album ''[[The Wolf (Andrew W.K. album)|The Wolf]]''. In contrast to ''I Get Wet'', which was recorded by W.K. with his live band, ''The Wolf'' featured W.K. playing all instruments, with heavy use of [[overdub]]bing of these instrument sections in production. The album spawned the singles "Tear It Up" and "Never Let Down" in the United States, while the song "Long Live the Party" was a minor hit in Japan. The single "Tear It Up" was included as menu music in the video-game Nascar Thunder TM 2004.<ref name="bio"/>

On tour for ''The Wolf'', W.K. was injured on stage and broke his foot. After the concert, he signed autographs from the ambulance. Not wanting to let his fans down, he performed the remainder of the tour in a wheelchair.<ref name="bio"/><ref name=loudwire/>

=== 2004–2008: ''Close Calls with Brick Walls'' ===
[[File:Andrew WK.jpg|thumb|right|W.K. in 2006]]

Though ''Close Calls with Brick Walls'' failed to see wide release in 2006, W.K. continued to be active, releasing a live concert DVD entitled ''[[Who Knows? (album)|Who Knows?]]'' in February that year and presenting five screenings of the film in New York and Hollywood.<ref name="page5">{{cite web|url=http://andrewwk.com/about/page/5|title=About: Music|publisher=AndrewWK.com|access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> In March 2006, during an episode of [[Sex Pistols]] guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]' radio show ''Jonesy's Jukebox'', W.K. debuted a new song entitled "I'm a Vagabond".<ref name="page5"/> On November 26, 2008, under [[Universal Music Group]], he released his fourth studio album, ''[[The Japan Covers]]'', which consists of cover versions of [[J-pop]] songs, as well as a compilation entitled ''The Very Best So Far''.<ref name="page5"/>

=== 2009–2019: ''55 Cadillac'', ''You're Not Alone'' and other releases ===
In February 2009, Wilkes-Krier claimed to have found a loophole in his contractual constraints allowing him to form his own record label, Skyscraper Music Maker, based in London and Manhattan.<ref name="label">{{cite web|url=http://andrewwk.com/about/page/10|title=About: Record Label|publisher=AndrewWK.com|access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> The label released ''DAMN!

"I avoided working with other people for many years, partly out of paranoia, and partly out of an earnest desire to stand on my own. After a while, I got tired of thinking that way, and it just seemed natural to do the opposite of what I had done before. I like making music with other people. I can still make music by myself too.".<ref>[http://www.andrewwk.com/production.php Production]. Andrew W.K.. Retrieved 2012-06-29.</ref>

They met again a few months later in New York at a taping for W.K.'s in-development TV series ''Smokeshow.'' "I ended up meeting people from Narnack that night and I expressed my admiration for Lee," W.K. says. "I asked what he was doing for his next album and said I'd like to be involved.

The song is called, "Sonna no Kankei Ne Rock", which celebrates a then popular catch-phrase by a TV Talent, "Sonna no Kankei Ne, Hai Oppappi!" This translates to, "I Don't Give A Damn, Yes Oppappi!" The ringtone was first announced on a Japanese national T.V. program called ''Music Station'' and had over 3,500 downloads that day. Cumulative sales of ringtone are over 20,000. Andrew's song debuted at No.1 in Label Mobile's International daily ringtone chart. Label Mobile is the biggest mobile retailer in Japan.<ref>[http://www.andrewwk.com/news.php News]. Andrew W.K..

=== Live music venue ===
In the spring of 2008, Andrew and three partners opened a multi-level nightclub and live concert hall in downtown Manhattan, New York City. The venue was named [[Santos Party House]], and featured {{convert|8000|sqft|m2}} of dance floor and concert facilities, and over 150 loud-speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santospartyhouse.com |title=Manhattan, Nyccc |publisher=Santos Party House |access-date=2012-04-02}}</ref> The space was designed for disco dancing and live music.

=== Radio ===
On April 28, 2015, W.K. announced a new radio show called ''America W.K.'' on [[TheBlaze Radio Network]], the new show will be a two-hour Saturday program focusing on "what it is to be alive—meaning, motivation, mind set, and making dreams come true, all included in a celebration of life itself—and all with a positive and honest outlook".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ritz|first1=Erica|title=Media You Might Not Have Expected This Person to Be the Newest Addition to TheBlaze Radio Network|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/04/28/you-might-not-have-expected-this-person-to-be-the-newest-addition-to-theblaze-radio-network/|website=The Blaze|access-date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>

==Ghostwriting allegations==
In November 2004, W.K.'s official website was hacked with threats of blackmail from someone who claimed to have co-created Andrew W.K.'s persona, and demanded to be included in the production of the third album, claiming to be "Steev Mike".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2015589/andrew-wk-steev-mike/columns/sounding-board/ |publisher=Stereogum.com |title=The Crying Of Lot 55: The Unsolved Mysteries And Alternate Realities Of Andrew W.K.|date=September 21, 2018 }}</ref> W.K. responded stating, "Please don't believe Steev Mike.

In subsequent years, W.K. denied various theories accusing him of being a fake entity, declaring himself to be "a real person who thinks for himself" and "not the victim of anyone or group of people trying to influence my career or life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santospartyhouse.com/index/event/id/1249 |title=Ask Andrew W.K.

In September 2009, W.K. acknowledged legal disputes around his name: "At the end of 2004, an old friend of mine got in some business trouble and basically decided to take it out on me... they were able to turn my life and career upside down. I wasn't allowed to use my own name within certain areas...
