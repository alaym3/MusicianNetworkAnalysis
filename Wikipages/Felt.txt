'''Felt''' is a [[textile]] material that is produced by matting, condensing and pressing [[fibers]] together. Felt can be made of [[natural fiber]]s such as [[wool]] or animal fur, or from [[synthetic fibers]] such as [[petroleum]]-based [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] or [[acrylonitrile]] or [[wood pulp]]-based [[rayon]]. Blended fibers are also common.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanfeltandcraft.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/woolfelt/|title=What's the difference between wool, acrylic, wool blend, and eco felt?

Most likely felt's origins can be found in central Asia, where there is evidence of feltmaking in Siberia (Altai mountains) in Northern Mongolia and more recently evidence dating back to the first century AD in Mongolia. Siberian tombs (7th to 2nd century BC) show the broad uses of felt in that culture, including clothing, jewelry, wall hangings, and elaborate horse blankets. Employing careful color use, stitching, and other techniques, these feltmakers were able to use felt as an illustrative and decorative medium on which they could depict abstract designs and realistic scenes with great skill. Over time these makers became known for the beautiful abstract patterns they used that were derived from plant, animal, and other symbolic designs.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|21}}

From Siberia and Mongolia, feltmaking spread across the areas held by the Turkic-Mongolian tribes. Sheep and camel herds were central to the wealth and lifestyle of these tribes, both of which were critical to producing the fibers needed for felting. As nomads traveling frequently and living on fairly treeless plains, felt provided housing (yurts, tents, etc.), insulation, floor coverings, and inside walling, as well as many household necessities from bedding and coverings to clothing. In nomadic peoples, an area where feltmaking was particularly visible was in trappings for their animals and for travel. Felt was often featured in the blankets that went under saddles.<ref name=":0" />

Dyes provided rich coloring, and colored slices of pre-felts (semi-felted sheets that could be cut in decorative ways), along with dyed yarns and threads were combined to create beautiful designs on the wool backgrounds. Felt was even used to create [[totems]] and [[amulets]] with protective functions. In traditional societies, the patterns embedded in the felt were also imbued with significant religious and symbolic meaning.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|21–23}}

Feltmaking is still practised by [[nomadic people]]s (such as [[Mongols]] and [[Turkic people]]) in [[Central Asia]], where [[carpet|rug]]s, [[tent]]s and [[clothing]] are regularly made.<ref name="GoldsteinBeall1994">{{cite book|author1=Melvyn C.

==Manufacturing methods==
===Wet felting===
[[Image:Wool Felt making KG.jpeg|thumb|Wooden rolling pin used during the wet felting process]]
In the wet felting process, hot water is applied to layers of animal hairs, while repeated agitation and compression causes the fibers to hook together or weave together into a single piece of fabric.<ref>{{cite book|title=Forestry Leaves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6alOAAAAMAAJ|year=1963}}</ref> Wrapping the properly arranged fiber in a sturdy, textured material, such as a bamboo mat or [[Hessian fabric|burlap]], will speed up the felting process.

In order to make multi-colored designs, felters conduct a two-step process in which they create pre-felts of specialized colors—these semi-completed sheets of colored felt can then be cut with a sharp implement (knife or scissors) and the distinctive colors placed next to each other as in making a mosaic. The felting process is then resumed and the edges of the fabric attach to each other as the felting process is completed. Shrdak carpets (Turkmenistan) use a form of this method wherein two pieces of contrasting color are cut out with the same pattern, the cut-outs are then switched, fitting one into the other, which makes a sharply defined and colorful patterned piece. In order to strengthen the joints of a mosaic style felt, feltmakers often add a backing layer of fleece that is felted along with the other components. Feltmakers can differ in their orientation to this added layer—where some will lay it on top of the design before felting and others will place the design on top of the strengthening layer.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|29}}

The process of felting was adapted to the lifestyles of the different cultures in which it flourished. In Central Asia, it is common to conduct the rolling/friction process with the aid of a horse, donkey, or camel, which will pull the rolled felt until the process is complete. Alternately, a group of people in a line might roll the felt along, kicking it regularly with their feet. Further fulling can include throwing or slamming and working the edges with careful rolling.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|26}}In Turkey, some baths had areas dedicated to feltmaking, making use of the steam and hot water that were already present for bathing.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|37}}

==== Development of felting as a profession ====
As felting grew in importance to a society, so, too, did the knowledge about techniques and approaches. Amateur or community felting obviously continued in many communities at the same time that felting specialists and felting centers began to develop. However, the importance of felting to community life can be seen in the fact that, in many Central Asian communities, felt production is directed by a leader who oversees the process as a ritual that includes prayers—words and actions to bring good luck to the process. Successfully completing the creation of felt (certainly large felt pieces) is reason for celebration, feasting, and the sharing of traditional stories.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|38–40}}

In [[Turkey]], craft guilds called "ahi" came into being, and these groups were responsible for registering members and protecting the knowledge of felting. In Istanbul at one time, there were 1,000 felters working in 400 workshops registered in this ahi.{{Rp|33}}<ref name=":0" />

===Needle felting===
[[Image:Needle-felt-making-1080204.jpg|thumb|Needle felting process to create small animal figurines]]
Needle felting is a method of creating felted objects without using water. The special needles used to make 3D sculpture, jewelry, adornments and 2D art have notches along the shaft of the needle that catch fibers and tangle them with other fibers to produce felt. These notches are sometimes erroneously called "barbs", but barbs are protrusions (like barbed wire) and would be too difficult to thrust into the wool and nearly impossible to pull out. There are many sizes and types of notched needles for different uses while working. Needle felting is used in industrial processes as well as in individual crafting.

The needles used for felting are generally quite thin, and sometimes fitted in holders that allow the user to utilize 2 or more needles at one time to sculpt wool objects and shapes. The single thin needles are used for detail and the multiple needles that are paired together are used for larger areas or to form the base of the project. At any point in time a variety of fiber colors may be added for detail and individuality, using needles to incorporate them into the project.

The kawaii style of needle felting was made popular by the Japanese culture. Kawaii means cute in Japanese and to felt in the kawaii style just means to make the object cute. Most kawaii needle felt sculptures have small, minimal-detail faces and are brightly colored. They are more cute and playful compared to the more traditional needle felt which is more rustic and earthy.<ref>“Everything You Need to Know to Start Needle Felting.” Wunderlabel, 22 Aug. 2017, wunderlabel.com/blog/everything-need-know-start-needle-felting.</ref><ref name="KennedyStoehrer2013">{{cite book|author1=Alicia Kennedy|author2=Emily Banis Stoehrer|author3=Jay Calderin|title=Fashion Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the History, Language, and Practice of Fashion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76p1khskZK4C&pg=PA153|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=978-1-59253-677-1|pages=153–}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=Wonderful West Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAdOAQAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Department of Natural Resources}}</ref> [[Ikuyo Fujita]]（藤田育代 ''Fujita Ikuyo''）is a Japanese artist who works primarily in needle felt painting and [[Pipe cleaner|mogol (pipe cleaner)]] art.

Needle felting can also be used to create realistic 3 dimensional animals. A wire armature can be created to help the process and provide support, around which a needle felted body and coat can be added. The art of needle felting is becoming very popular worldwide.

More recently, needle-felting or embellishment machines have become popular for art or craft felters. Similar to a sewing machine, these tools have several needles that punch fibers together as the user pushes fibers through in a manner very similar to feeding a sewing machine. The embellishment machine allows the user to create unique combinations of fibers and designs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Embellish, stitch, felt : using the embellisher machine and needle-punch techniques|last=Smith|first=Sheila|date=2008|publisher=Batsford|isbn=978-1-906388-05-8|location=London|oclc=227279237}}</ref>

===Arts and crafts===
Felt is used for framing paintings. It is laid between the slip mount and picture as a protective measure to avoid damage from rubbing to the edge of the painting. This is commonly found as a preventive measure on paintings which have already been restored or professionally framed. It is widely used to protect paintings executed on various surfaces including canvas, wood panel and copper plate.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

A felt-covered board can be used in storytelling to small children. Small felt cutouts or figures of animals, people, or other objects will adhere to a felt board, and in the process of telling the story, the storyteller also acts it out on the board with the animals or people.
