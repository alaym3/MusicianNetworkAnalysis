'''John Mogensen''' (May 5, 1928&nbsp;&ndash; April 10, 1977) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] singer, songwriter and pianist.

Morgensen was a member of the vocal quartet [[Four Jacks (quartet)|Four Jacks]] from 1956-1963. While still a member of the group, he gained popularity as a songwriter and launched a solo career in 1971. With his rough voice and frank and direct language, he formed a link between traditional pop and [[folk song]]s, alternating between direct criticism of society, simple love songs, and reflections from the pub milieu that he knew so well. Several of his songs remain popular, for example, ''Der er noget galt i Danmark'', ''Så længe jeg lever'', and ''Fut i fejemøjet''.

After his early death, he became almost a [[cult figure]] to his followers. Some of his songs were re-issued and a [[Musical theatre|musical]] based upon his life was performed for several years.

A biographical movie based on John Mogensen's life, ''The Way to Mandalay'', was released In 2018 with [[Rasmus Bjerg]] in the leading role.
