'''1000 Homo DJs''' was a [[side project]] of American [[industrial rock]] band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]. The project released two singles, one of which featured a cover of [[Black Sabbath]]'s "[[Supernaut (song)#1000 Homo DJs version|Supernaut]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3xwpk/rank-your-records-wax-trax-records-julia-nash|title=Wax Trax!

1000 Homo DJs began as a side project to release outtakes from Ministry's ''[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]''. The credits read "Another Luxa/Pan Production", which was the production pseudonym for Ministry members [[Al Jourgensen]] and [[Paul Barker]].<ref name="Goldmine '93">{{Cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Jo-Ann |date=April 2, 1993 |title=Ministry |magazine=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]] |volume=19 |issue=7 (331)|pages=32, 38|issn=1055-2685|via=''Prongs.org'' archive}}</ref>{{rp|32}}
==Origin of name==
In a 2004 interview,<ref>{{cite news| title = Concert Review: Ministry| work = Orlando CityBeat| publisher = [[Pollstar]]| date = April 2, 1993| url = http://www.pollstar.com/resultsVenue.aspx?CommentPageIndex=1549#bottom| accessdate = February 16, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050315214245/http://www.pollstar.com/reviews/reviews.cgi?Page=Detail&Artist=MINIST&Post=464&Sort=PerformanceDate#bottom| archive-date = March 15, 2005| url-status = dead}}<!--Среди комментариев один содержит как раз интервью дяди Эла.--></ref> Jourgensen explained that when he played demos (presumably those which became ''Apathy'') for Wax Trax! co-owner Jim Nash, the latter replied, "No one's gonna buy this. It'll take one thousand [[homo (slang)|homo]] DJs to play this for one person to buy it."

However, according to the Wax Trax! box set ''[[Black Box - Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years|Black Box]]'' released in 1994, Jourgensen and Nash were in the label's office listening to an unauthorized remix of the [[Revolting Cocks]]' (Jourgensen's former band) single "[[Big Sexy Land|We Shall Cleanse the World]]". Nash comforted Jourgensen, who disapproved of the remix's existence, by assuring him that it would only ever be heard by "a thousand homo DJs".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Blackbox - WaxTrax!

==Members==
The members of 1000 Homo DJs were identified by pseudonyms in the CD [[liner notes]]. However, most of their identities are fairly certain.

===Trent Reznor's involvement===<!-- This section is linked from [[Trent Reznor]] -->
The nature of [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]]'s contribution to 1000 Homo DJs' records has been debated. What is certain is that Reznor recorded the original vocals for "[[Supernaut (song)#1000 Homo DJs version|Supernaut]]". This performance was not officially used because Reznor's label, [[TVT Records]], refused to allow his appearance on the release.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bains|first=Jon|title = Nine Inch Nails|work = Convulsion|url=http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.5.html|accessdate=August 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045622/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.5.html|archive-date= September 27, 2007 }}</ref> Reznor's version would ultimately be released as "Supernaut (Trent Reznor Vocal Version)" by TVT four years later on the retrospective ''[[Black Box - Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years]]'', following TVT's purchase of Wax Trax!.

Jourgensen's immediate response to TVT's ultimatum is uncertain. An oft-repeated story tells that instead of recording new vocals, Jourgensen merely ran Reznor's performance through a [[Distortion#Audio distortion|distortion]] effect to mask its identity.<ref>{{cite web

  | quote = No matter what you hear, Trent sings on all the versions of Supernaut out there. … Al went back into the studios and just distorted Trent's vocals to confuse the lawyers, label and so on... }}</ref> According to this story, every WaxTrax! recording of "Supernaut" contains Reznor's vocals. However, a dissenting group claims this is an [[urban legend]], and that Jourgensen did record new vocals for the EP—albeit in a similar style to Reznor's initial performance. Statements made by both Reznor and Jourgensen seem to confirm the latter view. In a 1992 [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] post regarding "Supernaut", Reznor said, <blockquote>[I] finally told Al to redo it without me. The version that Wax Trax put out is Al, the version on the NIN <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[bootleg recording|bootleg]]] single is me.<ref>{{cite web

Jourgensen made a similar statement in a 2003 interview. When asked whose vocals appear on "Supernaut", Jourgensen replied, referring to the WaxTrax! EP, ''Black Box'', and ''[[Greatest Fits]]'' versions, respectively (and corroborating that only the "Trent Reznor Vocal Version" contained Reznor's performance, and that Jourgensen in fact sang on most versions of the song): <blockquote>That would be me on the original, on WaxTrax! The later version released on TVT was Trent Reznor... then the remixed version had my vocals on it.<ref>{{cite news
