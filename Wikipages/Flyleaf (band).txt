== History ==

=== Early years (2002–2004) ===

Early on [[Lacey Sturm]] started playing with James Culpepper. Guitarists Jared Hartmann and Sameer Bhattacharya were later recruited. "Sameer and Jared are really experimental with melodies and [[Effects pedal|pedals]], and we all had different influences that were all blending together with the same passionate and hopeful heart, and that brought out this beautiful feeling. It was magical," said Sturm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyleafonline.com/media/interviews.php |title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more |publisher=Flyleaf Online |access-date=2016-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222103201/http://flyleafonline.com/media/interviews.php |archive-date=February 22, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Bassist Pat Seals joined after leaving his previous band The Grove.

As Passerby, the band released three EPs and played over 100 shows in Texas alone over the span of two years under the booking and promotion company Runt Entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In 2004, Passerby played a showcase for [[RCA Records]] in New York City in hopes of getting signed. RCA passed on the band, but the president of [[A&M/Octone Records|Octone Records]] was very interested. They waited for two days in their van at a truck stop for a phone call about an Octone showcase. They were signed after the showcase, and on January 7, 2004, Octone Record's website announced their arrival to the label.

In March 2004, Passerby traveled to [[Seattle]], Washington, to record an EP with Rick Parashar. Afterwards, they toured with [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Staind]] and [[3 Doors Down]] to promote their self-titled EP. Due to legal reasons, they renamed themselves ''Flyleaf'' in June 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyleafonline.com/band/FAQ.php |title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more |publisher=Flyleaf Online |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125325/http://flyleafonline.com/band/FAQ.php |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In October, the EP was released to stores (as ''Flyleaf''), spawning their first official single and video for the EP version of "Breathe Today".

The group, starting in Seattle, Washington, on September 28, 2009, held VIP listening parties throughout the country inviting fans to be the first to hear a selection of songs from the new record and view brand new music videos before they aired nationwide. By partnering with Eventful, fans were given the opportunity to demand that their city get routed into the "Road to Memento Mori" using Eventful's "Demand It!" service.

Based on overwhelming demand there were over 10 events. Fans saw Sturm, Sameer Bhattacharya, and Jared Hartmann, who made special appearances at these intimate gatherings across the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=127554 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - FLYLEAF: 'Memento Mori' Listening Parties Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=October 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201232613/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=127554 |archive-date=December 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Flyleaf's other video, "Beautiful Bride," was shot in early August 2009 by director Don Tyler.

Future singles are set to include "Chasm" for rock stations and "Missing" for alternative.

Flyleaf toured throughout the United States with [[Breaking Benjamin]] and [[Three Days Grace]] from January to March 2010. They embarked on a headlining tour called the "Unite & Fight Tour" with [[10 Years (band)|10 Years]] and [[Fair to Midland]]. The tour began on April 28, 2010, and ended on June 6, 2010.

== Christianity ==

Former lead vocalist Lacey Sturm is a Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ransom.tv/notes/lacey-sturm|title=Lacey Sturm|work=Ransom|access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref> While faith has influenced the band's music, Sturm said that she doesn't believe that necessarily makes Flyleaf strictly a Christian band. The band says they are Christians who play in a rock band, and their faith is heard within their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=7457032&blogID=356095186 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708014919/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=7457032&blogID=356095186 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=Lions and tigers and Christian bands, oh my! van Flyleaf op Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=February 9, 2008 |access-date=October 21, 2011 }}</ref> "We all share the same faith."

In November 2006, Flyleaf performed a free concert at [[Los Angeles Pierce College]] for a Christian group called The Revolt, which was a three-day event. The band performed a half-hour set Thursday night. It was The Revolt's opening night at Pierce College and the first time the campus has been used as an outdoor music venue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theroundupnews.com/2006/11/17/positive-message-rocks-youthbr |title=Flyleaf Round Up |publisher=Roundupnews.com |date=November 17, 2006 |access-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107114531/http://theroundupnews.com/2006/11/17/positive-message-rocks-youthbr/ |archive-date=November 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In a May 2010 interview, Sturm was asked how it felt to be in a Christian rock band and play in Las Vegas: <blockquote>Well, you know what? I don't know what you mean by a "Christian rock band." It's hard to say that because people all have a different definition of what that means. If it means that we're Christians, then yeah, we're Christians, but if a plumber's a Christian, does that make him a "Christian plumber?" I mean we're not playing for Christians. We're just playing honestly and that's going to come out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/arts-and-entertainment/Flyleaf-is-Mindful-of-Death-94283274.html |title=Flyleaf Is Mindful of Death |author=Jeff Schwachter |date=May 19, 2010 |publisher=Atlanticcityweekly.com |access-date=October 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909011136/http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/arts-and-entertainment/Flyleaf-is-Mindful-of-Death-94283274.html |archive-date=September 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

Former lead vocalist May has felt the band's fans believe she's "not Christian enough" despite professing to be a Christian. She also hopes that people don't discount the band by using the "Christian" label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/kristen-may-flyleaf-interview |title= Interview: Kristen May of Flyleaf Cryptic Rock |publisher=Crypticrock.com |date=July 12, 2013 |access-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>

Although the band relies on themes transcending many faiths and ways of life, they insist being a Christian will always be a part of them and influence their writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://substreammagazine.com/2014/07/interview-flyleaf-talks-about-their-new-album-at-their-music-video-shoot/|title=INTERVIEW: Flyleaf Talks about Their New Album at their Music Video Shoot|work=Substream Magazine|access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref>
