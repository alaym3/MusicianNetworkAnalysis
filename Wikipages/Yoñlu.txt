==Biography==

===Early life===
Vinícius Gageiro Marques was born on September 1, 1989{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} in [[Porto Alegre]], Rio Grande do Sul, [[Brazil]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} to Ana Maria Gageiro, a [[psychoanalyst]] and college professor, and Luiz Marques, also a college professor, and former [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Secretary of Culture]].<ref name="paste">{{cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/08/a-permanent-exile-the-tragedy-of-vinicius-gageiro.html|title=A Permanent Exile: The Tragedy of Vinicius Gageiro Marques|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref> Marques' family moved to France when he was three, where he started learning French, but they moved back to Brazil when he was seven.  He rapidly developed his English language skills through watching television, reading on the internet and listening to music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wonderingsound.com/spotlight/the-secret-society-of-yonlu-2/|title=The Secret Society of Yonlu|work=Wondering Sound|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref> Sometime after, he taught himself to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and to read Spanish. At age nine, Marques started therapy due to what his father called a "chemical imbalance".<ref name="paste" />

Marques's musical interest was evident from an early age.  At age 4, he experimented playing the drums for the first time, and soon after took up the piano and guitar.<ref name="liter">{{cite web|url=http://domicilioliterario.blogspot.com/2013/06/yonlu_30.html|title=Breve história de Yoñlu|work=Domicílio Literário|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref>

===Teenage years===
During his teenage years, Marques was depressed and felt out of place at school and at home; he had a frequent presence on the Internet. At age 13, he started capturing his daily life via a camera.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} On July 26, 2004, he signed up for gaming forum [[RLLMUK]], where he would eventually become a regular.<ref name="rrlmuk">{{cite web|url=http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/profile/3918-yo%C3%B1lu/content/|title=Yoñlu's Content|access-date= October 29, 2016}}</ref> He also made a blog via [[Blogspot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yonnerz.blogspot.com|title=Yonlu's Blog|access-date = October 29, 2016}}</ref> and over the course of his teenage years, he collaborated with others in music, photographic projects, and drawings, including a collaboration with [[Sabrepulse]]<ref name="thread">{{cite web|url=http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/127772-thread-in-which-yonlu-posts-some-of-his-songs/\|title=Thread in which Yonlu posts some of his songs|access-date = October 29, 2016}}</ref> He expressed admiration for such musicians as [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] singer-songwriters [[Gilberto Gil]] and [[Caetano Veloso]], and was shown to have been influenced by [[Toquinho]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]. Other influences included [[Leonard Cohen]], [[John Frusciante]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Grandaddy]], and [[Gorky's Zygotic Mynci]].<ref name="rrlmuk" />  <!-- I looked through his entire post history on RLLMUK and picked out artists he had mentioned and things he did on the forum.  It's all there. --> He was an avid reader of [[Franz Kafka]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yonlu-mn0001015450/biography|title = Yonlu, Biography & History|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date = October 29, 2016}}</ref>

Marques was first shown to be suicidal in May 2006, when he posted on RLLMUK stating "Quick, someone say something really nice about my songs before I decide to KILL MYSELF."  However, after the supporting response this post received, he decided to postpone his suicide; he frequently mentioned killing himself online and whilst sharing his songs with others up until his death.<ref name="thread" />

At around this time, his mother found the lyrics to his song "Suicide" on his bed, and confronted him about it; she eventually found evidence of his [[suicidal ideation]] online and got him into therapy again. In therapy, Marques seemed to be improving.<ref name="liter" />

==Death==
On the afternoon on July 26, 2006, Marques told his parents that he would be having friends over for a [[barbecue]], and had them leave the apartment for the day since he wanted to impress a girl.  However, he had made plans to commit suicide through [[smoke inhalation]] by locking himself in his bathroom with two barbecue grills, and had posted on a forum asking for help killing himself.  While some people in the thread pleaded him to stop, others gave him the advice he wanted; after Marques reported he couldn't stand the heat inside the bathroom, a retired firefighter told Marques what to do to make the suicide attempt more bearable.  His last post was at 3:02&nbsp;pm [[GMT-3]].

A Canadian online friend of Marques's learned of the suicide attempt and called the [[Porto Alegre]]<!-- not sure if actually porto alegre, correct if needed --> police, giving them Marques' address. Although the police and [[paramedics]] were able to enter the apartment and clear the smoke, Marques was pronounced dead by suicide via [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] at approximately 3:30&nbsp;pm, after multiple attempts at resuscitation.<ref name="liter" />

Marques left a CD-R with some of his music and a suicide note addressed to his parents, which cleared them from any responsibility over his death, and thanked them for their support.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

==Legacy==
After Marques' death, his father looked through his computer and found more of his recorded music. In 2008, the album ''Yoñlu'' was released in Brazil on the [[Allegro Records|Allegro]] label.  However, in 2009, [[Luaka Bop]] internationally released ''A Society in Which No Tear Is Shed Is Inconceivably Mediocre''{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} after former [[Talking Heads]] frontman [[David Byrne]], the label's founder, took an interest in Yoñlu's story.  The album was well-received by critics, although few reviewed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/33455/Yonlu-A-Society-In-Which-No-Tear-is-Shed.../|title=Yonlu – A Society in Which No Tear is Shed...

A film based on Marques' life, titled [[Yonlu (film)|''Yonlu'']], was released in 2017. It was directed by Brazilian director [[Hique Motanari]] and starred [[Thalles Cabral]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmow.com/yonlu-t122502/|title=Yonlu – 2017 Filmow|access-date = October 29, 2016}}</ref> The film was released in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6682424/|title=Yonlu (2017) – IMDb|access-date= January 27, 2018}}</ref>
