==History==
===Background===
Prior to the band's formation, two of the brothers toured as a [[duet (music)|duo]], known simply by their names as Eddie and Finbar Furey.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=930/1}}</ref> For a while in 1969–1970, the duo performed with [[The Clancy Brothers]] and appeared on two of the Irish folk group's albums.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The second of these albums contained two songs composed by the Fureys, "Flowers in the Valley" and "Jennifer Gentle". In the meanwhile, their youngest brother Paul Furey had, together with [[Davey Arthur]] and Brendan Leeson, formed a band called The Buskers.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Eddie and Finbar and the Buskers appeared together in Germany at the "Irish Folk Festival" in 1974, where they performed as The Furey Brothers. The Buskers, now with the addition of George Furey, appeared there again a year later as The Furey Family, when they were joined by their father Ted, a renowned traditional [[fiddler]], who was 73 at that time. Ted Furey had recorded a solo fiddle album ''Toss the Feathers'' released by the Outlet label in 1967.<ref>OCLC record 31905018 viewed on 27 July 2010.</ref>

===Band===
Finbar, Eddie, and Paul Furey formed a folk group called [[Tam Lin|Tam Linn]] in 1976 with Davey Arthur.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> When their brother George joined them later that year, the band changed its name to The Furey Brothers and Davey Arthur.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They eventually simplified their name to The Fureys and Davey Arthur (and just The Fureys when Arthur did not perform with them).<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1981, The Fureys released their most successful single "[[When You Were Sweet Sixteen]]", which became a worldwide hit, reaching No. 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

They also had two [[Top 40]] British albums called ''Golden Days'' and ''At the End of the Day''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Other notable songs include "Gallipoli", "The Red Rose Cafe", and "Steal Away". As of October 24, 2019 the band was still recording and touring. In 2018, the band celebrated their 40th anniversary.

Finbar left the band to begin his own solo career in 1996, with Eddie, George, and Davey Arthur continuing some touring in Ireland, the UK and the European continent. Paul Furey died suddenly in June 2002.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fureys & Davey Arthur for Ballinasloe show|url=http://www.galwaynews.ie/20229-fureys-davey-arthur-ballinasloe-show|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=[[Galway City Tribune]]|date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

All four of the brothers married and had children. Finbar's son, Martin Furey, is a folk singer and musician with [[The High Kings]]. George's son Anthony is the singer with the Young Folk. Eddie's daughter Sarah-Jane is a streamer in the video gaming industry.{{fact|date=January 2020}}
