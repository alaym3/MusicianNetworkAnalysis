A '''Twinkie''' is an American [[snack cake]], described as "golden [[sponge cake]] with a [[whipped topping|creamy]] filling". It was formerly made and distributed by [[Old HB|Hostess Brands]]. The brand is currently owned by Hostess Brands, Inc. ({{NASDAQ|TWNK}}), having been formerly owned by [[private equity firm]]s [[Apollo Global Management]] and [[C. Dean Metropoulos|C. Dean Metropoulos and Company]] as the second incarnation of [[Hostess Brands]]. During bankruptcy proceedings, Twinkie production was suspended on November 21, 2012, and resumed after an absence of a few months from American store shelves, becoming available again nationwide on July 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2013/07/12/news/companies/walmart-twinkies/index.html|title='First batch' Twinkies go on sale at Walmart|publisher=CNN|author=Parija Kavilanz|date=July 12, 2013|access-date=July 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_23652203/hostess-twinkies-make-an-early-return-southland-shelves|title=Hostess Twinkies make an early return to Southland shelves|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|author=Staff and wire reports|date=July 12, 2013|access-date=July 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715201700/http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_23652203/hostess-twinkies-make-an-early-return-southland-shelves|archive-date=July 15, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Return of Twinkies to U.S. market===

On March 18, 2013, it was reported that Twinkies would return to store shelves in May of that year. Twinkies, along with other Hostess Brands, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Co for $410 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://money.cnn.com/2013/03/12/news/companies/twinkies-buyer/ | title = Twinkies due on shelves by summer as $410 million bid OK'd | author = Chris Isidore | work = CNNMoney | date = March 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.laobserved.com/biz/2013/03/hooray_the_twinkie_i.php | title = Hooray, Twinkies are coming back | author = Mark Lacter | date = March 12, 2013 | work = LA Observed }}</ref>

===Deep-fried Twinkie===
[[File:Deep-fried twinkie.jpg|thumb|right|A deep-fried Twinkie]]
A [[deep frying|deep-fried]] Twinkie involves freezing the cake, dipping it into [[batter (cooking)|batter]], and deep-frying it. A story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the deep fried Twinkie with its inventor‚ÄîChristopher Sell, originally from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], England‚Äîdescribed this way: "Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil. The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies, impregnating the [[sponge cake]] with its luscious vanilla flavor.... The cake itself softens and warms, nearly melting, contrasting with the crisp, deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way. The ''[[wikt:pi√®ce de r√©sistance|pi√®ce de r√©sistance]]'', however, is a ruby-hued berry sauce, adding a tart sophistication to all that airy sugary goodness."<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/15/dining/fry-that-twinkie-but-hold-the-chips.html | work=The New York Times | title= Fry That Twinkie, But Hold the Chips |date= May 15, 2002 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> The [[Texas State Fair]] had introduced the fried Twinkie to great popular acclaim, and the notion spread to other [[state fair]]s across the U.S., as well as some establishments that specialize in fried foods.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/09/18/offbeat.twinkie.reut/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124151542/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/09/18/offbeat.twinkie.reut/|url-status= dead| archive-date=January 24, 2013 | publisher = CNN | title=New junk food fad: Deep-fried Twinkies |date= September 18, 2002| access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref> Fried Twinkies are sold throughout the U.S. in fairs as well as ball games, and in various restaurants.

==Cultural references==
{{in popular culture|section|date=September 2018}}

===Television and film===
* In 1984 the Twinkie became known worldwide in countries that did not sell the confection, due to a reference in the hit film ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=hays>{{cite web|last1=Hays|first1=Julia|title=Celebrate the New Ghostbusters With Slime-Filled Twinkies|url=http://www.eonline.com/au/news/743749/celebrate-the-new-ghostbusters-with-slime-filled-twinkies|website=E! Online|access-date=26 February 2018|date=26 February 2016}}</ref> In the film, the character [[Egon Spengler]] describes a speculated level of psychokinetic energy and uses a regular-sized Twinkie to represent the normal level of such energy in [[New York City]]. He then says that based on a recent sample, the Twinkie representing New York would be over {{convert|35|ft|m}} long and weigh approximately {{convert|600|lb|kg}}, to which the character [[Winston Zeddemore]] replies, "That's a big Twinkie."<ref name=hays/>
* The 1988 action film ''[[Die Hard]]'' makes light of Twinkie ingredients in an exchange between characters John McClane (played by Bruce Willis) and Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson).
* The 2011 anti-hero film ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' makes light of the popular misconception that Twinkies will not become stale or deteriorate. The film's antagonist, who has the power of decay, grabs items of food, only to see it decay in his hand; when he grabs the Twinkie, it does not change.
* The plot of the 2009 film ''[[Zombieland]]'' (also featuring Bill Murray) is partly driven by a tireless search for America's last Hostess Twinkie. Woody Harrelson's character, Tallahassee, mentions Twinkies' reputation for longevity.

===Song lyrics===
* Twinkies are one of various products mentioned in "[[Junk Food Junkie]]", a [[Top 40]] 1976 novelty song by [[Larry Groce]].
* [[John Fogerty]]'s 2004 album ''[[Deja Vu All Over Again (album)|Deja Vu All Over Again]]'' includes the satirical, somewhat world-weary song "Nobody's Here Anymore", which ponders people's infatuation with modern technology and its ever more sophisticated consumer devices. "He got a stash of Twinkies up in his room" is a line lamenting the self-absorption and social isolation of the protagonist of the song's first verse.
* "[[Habits (Stay High)]]", a 2013 song by Swedish singer [[Tove Lo]], mentions Twinkies in the line "I get home, I got the munchies / Binge on all my Twinkies / Throw up in the tub / Then I go to sleep."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.relationshipcentersv.com/blog/2015/2/6/heart-break-for-the-self-respecting-woman |title=Heart Break For The Self-Respecting Woman |last1=Pathak |first1=Shirani M. |date=6 October 2014 |website=Relationship Center of Silicon Valley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090742/http://www.relationshipcentersv.com/blog/2015/2/6/heart-break-for-the-self-respecting-woman |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=11 February 2016 }}</ref> In an interview, the singer confessed she had thought that "twinkie" was a synonym for "cookie" and that Hostess had sent her a sample of the product after the success of the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/04/tove-lo-interview.html |title=Tove Lo on Coming Back from Surgery and the Stupidity of Censorship |last1=Held |first1=Joey |website=[[Paste Magazine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815065801/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/04/tove-lo-interview.html |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |access-date=11 February 2016 }}</ref>

===Twinkie defense===
{{Main|Twinkie defense}}

"Twinkie defense" is a derisive label for an improbable [[Defense (legal)|legal defense]]. It is not a recognized legal defense in [[jurisprudence]], but a catch-all term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant [[Dan White]] for [[Moscone‚ÄìMilk assassinations|the murders]] of [[San Francisco]] city Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] and Mayor [[George Moscone]]. White's defense was that he suffered [[Diminished responsibility|diminished capacity]] as a result of his depression. His change in diet from healthful food to Twinkies and other sugary foods was said to be a symptom of depression. Contrary to common belief, White's attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White's actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression.<ref name="latimes-twinkie-defense" />

===Theological Twinkie===
[[Jeffrey R. Holland]], a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), used the expression "theological Twinkie" at the Church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] in April 1998, in reference to teaching methods that may be pleasing or entertaining, but lack sufficient spiritual and doctrinal substance. In his words: "Are we really nurturing our youth and our new members in a way that will sustain them when the stresses of life appear? Or are we giving them a kind of theological Twinkie‚Äîspiritually empty calories?" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god?lang=eng|title="A Teacher Come from God" - Jeffrey R.

===Shelf life===
A common [[urban legend]] claims that Twinkies have an infinite [[shelf life]], and can last unspoiled for a relatively long time of ten, fifty, or one hundred years due to the chemicals used in their production.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/twinkies.asp |title=Forever Twinkies | publisher=Snopes ‚Äì Urban Legends Reference Pages |date=May 19, 2011 |access-date=August 30, 2011 }}</ref>
