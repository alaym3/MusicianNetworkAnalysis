Knight cites [[Michael Jackson]], [[Boyz II Men]] and [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] as the main inspirations behind his music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Music Showcase - Zack Knight|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/er62fx/acts/abvhj5|access-date=2021-01-11|website=BBC Music Events|language=en}}</ref> He produces, composes and engineers his own music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Get ready to groove on Zack Knight-Jasmin Walia's 'Bom Diggy'|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/get-ready-to-groove-on-zack-knightjasmin-walias-bom-diggy/1133586|access-date=2021-01-11|website=www.outlookindia.com/}}</ref> He is a [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] artist, chaining together lyrics in [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], as well as elements of [[Arabic]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

=== 2007–10: The Zeekay Years ===
Operating under the stage name 'Zeekay'/'Zee Kay', Knight began his career primarily as a songwriter, writing songs for artists such as [[Tinie Tempah]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Stylo G]], [[Iyaz|IYAZ]] and various X Factor contestants. His first major success was with writing the hit single "Baby (Dil Deewana)", for US R&B artist [[Ginuwine]], in 2007. Shortly after, he started producing several R&B/Hip-hop singles himself; his debut single "My Moment", released in 2008, reaching third in the Myspace R&B charts,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-06-24|title=ZeeKay - My Moment|url=http://desi-box.com/videos/qmy-momentq-zeekay-full-video/|access-date=2021-01-11|website=Desi-Box.com|language=en-US}}</ref> which consequently led to him landing a production deal with "Mr Skills", creator of "Big Brova's", with whom he had been working on his debut album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exclusive 'Zee Kay' Interview|url=https://www.simplybhangra.com/interviews/1543-exclusive-zee-kay-interview.html|access-date=2021-01-11|website=Bhangra Website|language=en-gb}}</ref> From here, Knight produced several other singles across the span of 2 years, including "In Denial" (which he performed at various Live shows), "Love U Right (ft [[Tinie Tempah]])", "Save It" and "Inspiration".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zeekay biography|url=http://artistwiki.com/zeekay/biography|access-date=2021-01-11|website=artistwiki.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=ZeeKay (Zack Knight) All Songs - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiAN7zu1_VE2dhHqbs4ww-YwEHgkEN2ka|access-date=2021-01-14|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Zack Knight supported the likes of [[Taio Cruz]], [[Mario (singer)|Mario]] and [[Jessie J]] in live concerts and shows.<ref>{{Cite web|title=iamzackknight - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/c/Zackofficial/about|access-date=2021-01-11|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Simultaneously, he was studying for a Degree in [[Economics]], which he had to put on hold in order to concentrate on his musical aspirations. He eventually graduated; however, after 2010, he had to re-brand his music from under his stage name/alias, Zeekay, to under his real name, Zack Knight, as he is still known by now.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-01-23|title=Zack Knight clears the air about his name|url=http://desi-box.com/urban-news/zack-knight-clears-the-air-about-his-name/|access-date=10 January 2021|website=Desi-Box.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 2011–14: Re-branding, Covers and Albums ===
After 2010, Zack Knight, now operating without his stage name/alias, produced several singles and albums. As a result of the re-branding, he was now working with new artists and producers, therefore his style of music changed, with a less of a focus on hip-hop mainstream music to more of a pop music sound.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Admin|date=2015-09-19|title=The talented Zack Knight's bollywood medley|url=https://www.britishmuslim-magazine.com/2015/09/19/zack-knight/|access-date=2021-01-11|website=British Muslim Magazine|language=en-GB}}</ref> He received regional and national support from his debut single "All Over Again" in 2012, and his second single "Who I Am" was also featured as one of [[iTunes]] "New & Noteworthy" picks of the month, which was followed by his third single "When I'm Gone".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Admin|date=2015-09-19|title=The talented Zack Knight's bollywood medley|url=https://www.britishmuslim-magazine.com/2015/09/19/zack-knight/|access-date=2021-01-11|website=British Muslim Magazine|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Zack Knight releases 'When I'm Gone' {{!}} Asian Sunday Newspaper|url=https://www.asiansunday.co.uk/zack-knight-releases-when-im-gone/|access-date=2021-01-11|language=en-GB}}</ref> (although these three singles later become incorporated into his 2016-released album ''On Repeat'').

=== 2014–present ===
In 2014, Knight signed a deal with [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] which propelled him to fame both in the UK Asian industry as well as in the Indian subcontinent.
