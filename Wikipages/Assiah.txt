{{Four Worlds}}
'''Assiah''' (or ''''Asiyah''', also known as ''Olam Asiyah'', עוֹלָם עֲשִׂיָה in Hebrew, literally "the World of Action" and Aishah in Arabic) is the last of the four spiritual worlds of the [[Kabbalah]] —[[Atziluth]], [[Beri'ah|Beriah]], [[Yetzirah]], 'Asiyah— based on the passage in {{bibleverse|Isaiah||43:7}}.

According to the ''Maseket Aẓilut,'' it is the region where the [[Ofanim]] rule and where they promote the hearing of prayers, support human endeavor, and combat evil. Their ruler is [[Sandalphon]]. According to the system of the later [[Land of Israel]] Kabbalah, 'Asiyah is the lowest of the spiritual worlds containing the Ten Heavens and the whole system of mundane Creation. The light of the [[Sefirot]] emanates from these Ten Heavens, which are called the "Ten Sefirot of 'Asiyah"; and through them spirituality and piety are imparted to the realm of matter—the seat of the dark and impure powers.<ref>[[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Cordovero, Moses ben Jacob]], ''Pardes Rimmonim''</ref><ref>[[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Vital, Hayyim ben Joseph]], ''’Eẓ Ḥayyim''</ref>

Representing purely [[Nature|material existence]], it is known as the World of Action, the World of Effects or the World of Making. In [[Western mystery tradition|western occultism]] it is associated with the [[Suit of Coins|Suit of Pentacles]] (or Coins or Disks, the terminology varies according to the deck) in the [[Tarot]]. The world of [[Yetzirah]] precedes it.
