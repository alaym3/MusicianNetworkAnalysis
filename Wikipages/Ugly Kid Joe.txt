'''Ugly Kid Joe''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal band]], from [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], [[California]], formed in 1989. The band's name spoofs the glam metal band [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd's]] name.<ref name="rs">{{Cite web|last=Johnston|first=Keith Harris,Maura|last2=Harris|first2=Keith|last3=Johnston|first3=Maura|date=2014-03-31|title=Love Me Two Times: 20 Greatest Two-Hit Wonders of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/love-me-two-times-20-greatest-two-hit-wonders-of-all-time-12752/|access-date=2021-06-13|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="vh1"/><ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-07-25|title=Top 40 Hard Rock Songs That Nirvana Couldn't Kill|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/07/best-hard-rock-songs/|access-date=2021-06-13|website=SPIN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Rolling Stone|date=2013-09-05|title=Where Are They Now? 1992's Biggest Pop Acts|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/where-are-they-now-1992s-biggest-pop-acts-18258/|access-date=2021-06-13|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ugly Kid Joe makes fun but crude songs|url=https://ew.com/article/1992/04/10/ugly-kid-joe-makes-fun-crude-songs/|access-date=2021-06-13|website=EW.com|language=en}}</ref>

To date, Ugly Kid Joe have released four full-length albums, two compilation albums and two EPs. Their best selling records are ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' (1991) and ''[[America's Least Wanted]]'' (1992), which were both certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]];<ref name="RIAA albums">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=ugly_kid_joe&perPage=25 |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - August 20, 2010: Ugly Kid Joe certified albums|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=August 20, 2010}}</ref> the former is notable for being the first EP to go platinum.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&format=short_form_album&perPage=25 RIAA Gold & Platinum Database] (sort by "Certification Date")</ref> The band broke up in 1997, but announced a reunion in 2010 and has ever since both reformed and recommenced activity.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/uglykidjoetheband Facebook] - Ugly Kid Joe</ref>

==History==
===Early history (1990–1991)===
Childhood friends [[Whitfield Crane]] and Klaus Eichstadt took an interest in music while growing up in [[Palo Alto, California]]. In 1989 James Lambert and Eichstadt joined Crane's band in Isla Vista, California, and the trio recorded a demo with another Palo Alto native, record producer [[Eric Valentine]]. After several band member changes, the band signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1991. By this time the ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' line-up was formed; consisting of Crane, Eichstadt, Mark Davis, Roger Lahr, and Cordell Crockett.<ref name="mtvke">{{cite web|title=Ugly Kid Joe's Klaus Eichstadt|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/570216/ugly-kid-joes-klaus-eichstadt/|website=MTV|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>

Initially named Overdrive, then Suburban White Alcoholic Trash, the band got its name Ugly Kid Joe as a parody of L.A. glam band [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]], initially for a one night show in Santa Barbara opening for Pretty Boy Floyd. Pretty Boy Floyd would pull out of the show and have the gig cancelled, but the band decided to keep the name.<ref name="mtvke" />

The band became popular in the early 1990s, mixing satirical humor and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Its logo was a cartoon embodiment of an "ugly kid" wearing a backwards baseball hat and giving [[the finger]]. Heavily influenced by [[Black Sabbath]], Ugly Kid Joe covered several of the veteran band's songs, including "[[Sweet Leaf]]" and "[[N.I.B.]]" The group toured the [[United States]] several times, making its second tour in support of [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], and later opening for former Black Sabbath lead vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

The band released the EP ''As Ugly as They Wanna Be'' in October 1991, garnering success in 1992 with the single "[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]", which peaked at No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made it into the Billboard Top 10. Later in the year, the song would be used in the movie ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. ''As Ugly As They Wanna Be'' went on to sell over one million copies in the U.S. alone.

===Commercial success (1992–1996)===
The band spent 2 months in the studio to record ''[[America's Least Wanted]]''. During the process, Roger Lahr left the band due to musical differences and was eventually replaced by [[Sugartooth]] guitarist [[Dave Fortman]] in April 1992. [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]] was a guest vocalist on the song "Goddamn Devil". The band sped up the recording process for their album in order to get a spot as a supporting act for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s "No More Tears" tour. The band eventually landed a spot for the tour, only to have Crane fly back to L.A. several times to finish edits on the album. The album caused controversy with its cover, which features the band's mascot posing as the Statue of Liberty holding up the middle finger and holding a porno magazine in his hand instead of the hallowed Declaration. As some stores would not carry the album due to the cover image, the band decided to have an alternative cover made with the band's mascot chained and gagged.

''America's Least Wanted'' appeared on the U.S. charts at No. 27 having sold over 600,000 units upon release and was considered a favorite among fans and critics. One critic praised the album as, "A rock record you can play all day." The album achieved Gold status in both Canada and Australia, Silver status in the United Kingdom, and went Platinum in the U.S.A. A cover of [[Harry Chapin]]'s "[[Cat's in the Cradle]]" was subsequently released as a well-received single that sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart.

After finishing up with Ozzy, they opened up for [[Def Leppard]] on the European leg of their tour which was sold-out in 6 weeks. Ugly Kid Joe then made a stop at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and thereafter  spent 3 weeks playing sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.  They became the Reader's Choice for Best New Artist voted by ''[[Metal Edge]]'' and ''[[Raw magazine (rock)|Raw]]'' magazine.  They also presented The Favorite Heavy Metal band award to [[Metallica]] at the [[American Music Award]]s in 1993. The band would also get nominated for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist but lost to [[Pearl Jam]].

After their tour in support of their 1992 album ''America's Least Wanted'', the band searched for a replacement drummer, as Mark Davis left to pursue a life away from the spotlight. The band tried out for new drummers, such as Bob Fernandez who only appeared on a cover of Black Sabbath's "[[N.I.B.]]" for the ''[[Nativity in Black]]'' Black Sabbath tribute album. He also showed up in Brazil with the band at the [[Hollywood Rock]] festival in 1994 as headliners along with [[Aerosmith]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], among others.  After attending a [[Souls at Zero (band)|Souls at Zero]] show in Colorado, Crane became immediately impressed with the band's drummer, [[Shannon Larkin]]. Crane later called up Larkin to join Ugly Kid Joe to which Larkin agreed. The band then wrote some new song material with Larkin and embarked on a short tour titled the "Excuse To Go Snowboarding Tour" with guests [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] and [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]]. Larkin's contributions led to a grittier sound for the second album ''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'', released in the summer of 1995. The album was recorded in Palacio Del Rio in northern Santa Barbara.

The band embarked on a tour in support of the album. They did a snowboard tour, a small club tour, and later a stadium tour opening for [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Van Halen]]. The band excluded "Everything About You" from their set list in order to show the fans that they stand tall on their recent material. At a show in Wembley Stadium in London, the band was joined on stage by Ozzy Osbourne's son, [[Jack Osbourne]] before playing Sabbath's "N.I.B".

''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'' received much praise from the press and fans, and [[United Kingdom|UK]] rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it as a contender for album of the year. Despite success overseas and a successful [[Europe]]an tour, the album was given little encouragement from [[Mercury Records]] and subsequently failed in the United States.

After being dropped by Mercury, Ugly Kid Joe formed its own independent label, Evilution Records, for the release of the band's next album. With distribution support from [[Castle Communications]], ''[[Motel California]]'' was released in late 1996, and again the band toured Europe to smaller crowds. The tour was named "Late Check-out Tour", underlining the band's characteristic sense of humor. ''Motel California'', an album lead vocalist [[Whitfield Crane]] described as "heavy, funky, and has everything in it", initially received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, though it has gained a minor cult following in recent times.

===Break-up and aftermath (1997–2009)===
Ugly Kid Joe disbanded in 1997. Drummer Shannon Larkin has been a member of [[Godsmack]] since 2002, while lead vocalist Whitfield Crane took the then vacant vocalist spot for [[New York City]] rock band [[Life of Agony]] whose former singer [[Keith Caputo]] had left the group in 1997. After his quick departure from Life of Agony, Crane collaborated with some [[Soulfly]] members on a new project called [[Medication (band)|Medication]] (1999–2003) and Godsmack members on [[Another Animal]] (2006–2009).

In 2005, an unreleased video for "Bicycle Wheels" was made public onto the Ugly Kid Joe forum site (created in January 2004 by J.Goldman, aka DMJ, a fan from Israël). In 2007, an official Myspace page was made of the band, with old photographs of the band and other candid pictures along with promotional artwork and uploaded live footage and another unreleased music video for "Sandwich". Some of the other footage included footage of the band playing at the UC Santa Barbara campus before getting signed. Soon videos were turning up on YouTube by fans, some included live recordings of them in concert and television recordings. Meanwhile, the band's main page featured live tracks and rare songs including a demo of "C.U.S.T." and a few tracks from ''Motel California'' and ''Menace to Sobriety''.

===Reunion (2010–present)===
Klaus Eichstadt stated in the December 2009 issue of the German edition of the music magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', that the members of Ugly Kid Joe were planning to reunite in summer 2010, although did not specify whether their intent was to produce a new album or simply to perform together. However, rumors of a reunion were confirmed on their MySpace page on May 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/uglykidjoetheband |title=UGLY KID JOE &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |website=Myspace.com |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref> Their MySpace page also says that the reunion lineup will be the same as the last one before their breakup.

In July 2011, according to drummer [[Shannon Larkin]], a new album has been completed. He revealed the album's status in an interview with California's [[KSAN (FM)|107.7 The Bone]] at the [[Mayhem Festival]], saying "It's a fun band – it's funny, you listen to the songs and it makes you laugh. Just a good-time rock band, y'know?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/news/00577.shtml |title=Ugly Kid Joe Complete Comeback Album |website=Sleazeroxx.com |date=July 19, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref>

On September 9, 2011, vocalist [[Whitfield Crane]] made an update on the band's official Facebook page stating he appeared [[KSAN (FM)|107.7 The Bone]] the day before and played a new track called "Love Ain't True" and stating that a 6 track EP and was mixed and finished. According to official website "also in the works is an [[EPK]] documenting the reunification and the latest recording sessions along with some rare old footage of interviews, behind the scenes stuff, and live performances".

The new EP, ''[[Stairway to Hell]]'', was released digitally on June 5, 2012, while physical version surfaced a month later, July 9.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |title=UGLY KID JOE: 'Devil's Paradise' Video Released |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 24, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719151951/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |archive-date=July 19, 2012 }}</ref> In order to promote the recording, Ugly Kid Joe played a series of festivals that summer, including [[Sweden Rock Festival|Sweden Rock]] in Sweden, [[Download Festival|Download]] in England, [[Gods of Metal]] in Milan, Italy, and Belgrade Calling in Serbia. They were the main support act for [[Guns N' Roses]] in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 3, 2012, and also for [[Alice Cooper]] on his "Raise The Dead" tour in October 2012.

Ugly Kid Joe started a joint co-headlining European tour with [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] in October 2013 kicking off the tour in Southampton, UK.

In February 2015, Ugly Kid Joe successfully used pledgemusic.com in a [[crowdfunding]] effort to pay for the recording of their next album, to be titled ''[[Uglier Than They Used ta Be]]'', is the first full-length studio album since they break-up after the album was completed [[Motel California|in nearly 19 years]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/ukjrc |title=The 1st album from Ugly Kid Joe in 19 years |website=Pledgemusic.com |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150224101658/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/ukjrc |archive-date=February 24, 2015 }}</ref> set to be released on October 16, 2015.

As of July 2021, Ugly Kid Joe is working on their follow-up to ''Uglier Than They Used ta Be'' for a planned 2022 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ugly-kid-joe-to-open-for-judas-priest-in-virginia-beach/|title=UGLY KID JOE To Open For JUDAS PRIEST In Virginia Beach|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=July 30, 2021|date=July 30, 2021}}</ref>
