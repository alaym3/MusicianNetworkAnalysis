'''Inara Maryland George''' (born July 4, 1974)<ref>USA People Search</ref> is an American singer-songwriter and musician, one half of [[The Bird and the Bee]], a member of the band Merrick, with Bryony Atkinson, and a member of the trio [[The Living Sisters]], with [[Eleni Mandell]] and [[Becky Stark]].

==Early life==
George was born in Towson, Maryland. She is the daughter of [[Lowell George]], the late founder of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Little Feat]], and Elizabeth George. [[Jackson Browne]] wrote the song "Of Missing Persons" for Inara George after the death of her father. She has three half brothers named Luke, Forrest and Jed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/lowell-georges-little-feat-have-always-done-their-stuff-but-only-now-are-they-a-shoo-in-vol-9-no-14/|title=Lowell George's Little Feat Have Always Done Their Stuff, but Only Now Are They a Shoo-In|website=People.com|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref> and her father died just before her fifth birthday.

George was involved with theatre at a young age, especially [[Shakespeare]], in [[Topanga Canyon]], a community in the [[Santa Monica]] mountains. She later relocated to [[Boston]], Massachusetts to study acting in the classical theater tradition.<ref name="allmusic"/>

==Career==
While visiting home one summer, George and several high-school friends launched a band named Lode. To their surprise, the bandmates landed a deal with Geffen Records and released the 1996 album ''Legs & Arms''. Later, George joined Bryony Atkinson to form Merrick, an indie rock duo that released two albums before disbanding in 2002.

Three years later, George struck out on her own by issuing her solo debut ''All Rise'' on Everloving Records.  ''All Rise'' was produced by Michael Andrews (Donnie Darko, Freaks and Geeks) and featured musical contributions from [[Greg Kurstin]]. The two formed the [[The Bird and the Bee|Bird and the Bee]] and released a self-titled album in 2006, followed by several EPs. While preparing for the duo's second full-length release, George also found time to return to her own project, teaming up with veteran producer and family friend [[Van Dyke Parks]] for 2008's ''An Invitation''.<ref name="allmusic">Leahey, Andrew & Wilson, MacKenzie.
