== History ==

=== Early start (1992) ===
MxPx was formed in July 1992 by [[Mike Herrera]], Yuri Ruley, and Andy Husted, who were 15 years old at the time, and classmates at [[Central Kitsap High School]] in [[Silverdale, Washington]]. Initially, the band played music inspired by [[Descendents]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and other punk rock bands. 

The name, originally Magnified Plaid, was a tribute to Husted's fascination with [[Tartan|plaid]] shirts, but did not fit on the band's posters. Consequently, the name was [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] to M.P. on show posters. Yuri Ruley, who used Xs in place of periods, made the [[posters]] for the band, resulting in the four-letter [[moniker]].<ref name="MATHhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ku.edu/~parker/mxpxinfo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031013025124/http://www.math.ku.edu/~parker/mxpxinfo.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 13, 2003 |title=Magnified Plaid (MxPx) History |publisher=Math.ku.edu |access-date=October 26, 2011 }}</ref>

=== Tooth & Nail years (1993–1997) ===
{{See also|Pokinatcha|Teenage Politics|Life in General (album)}}
[[File:Mike Herrera.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Band bassist [[Mike Herrera]] performing "[[Move to Bremerton]]" in 2006]]
MxPx caught the attention of [[Tooth & Nail Records]] when the band played a showcase for the [[Record label|label]] in 1993 in Herrera's parents' back yard. The band's first major album, ''[[Pokinatcha]]'' (1994), was released while the band members were still in high school. The album, though classified as [[Christian punk]], incorporated the quick styles of [[hardcore punk]],<ref name="allmusicmain"/> and is composed of influence from skate/surf punk and punk underground. The songs are characterized by their raw punk sound, catchy rhythm, and classic punk three-chord guitar style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/mxpx/artist.jhtml |title=MxPx &#124; Music Videos, News, Photos, Tour Dates, Ringtones, and Lyrics |publisher=MTV |date=July 30, 2007 |access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loudreview.com/in/rest/topic/8A/Pokinatcha |title=Pokinatcha (Album) reviews, artists, awards, posters, videos &#124; Write a review for Pokinatcha |publisher=Loudreview.com |access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

Guitarist Andy Husted soon left the band and was replaced by Herrera's longtime friend, Tom Wisniewski. Despite only knowing power chords on guitar, Wisniewski was willing to be in the band.  MxPx released two further albums with Tooth & Nail: ''[[Teenage Politics]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Life in General (album)|Life in General]]'' in 1996,<ref name="allmusicmain"/> which features the single "[[Chick Magnet (song)|Chick Magnet]]" and artwork by the artist [[Coop (artist)|Coop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/interviews/6999/coop.html|title=Coop - Interviews - Entertainment - Bizarre Magazine UK<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

=== A&M years (1997–2004) ===
{{See also|Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo|The Ever Passing Moment|Before Everything & After}}
MxPx received a major distribution deal with [[A&M Records]]. This deal first saw a re-release of ''Life in General''. MxPx then released two more studio albums jointly distributed by Tooth & Nail and A&M: ''[[Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo]]'' was the first in 1998. It peaked at No.&nbsp;99 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold on January 27, 2000, by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="riaaa"/> ''[[At the Show]]'' is a [[live album]] recorded by MxPx, released in 1999. At the time of the recording, the band was touring in support of ''Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo'' as well as the [[B-sides]] collection ''[[Let It Happen (MxPx album)|Let it Happen]]'', also released in 1998.<ref name="HM_79"/>

This was followed by ''[[The Ever Passing Moment]]'' in 2000. MxPx gained critical recognition for this album and landed a slot supporting for [[The Offspring]] and [[Cypress Hill]] on the ''[[Conspiracy of One]]'' tour.<ref name="offspringtour"/> "[[Responsibility (song)|Responsibility]]" proved to be a minor radio hit, peaking at #24 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The video, which is directed by [[The Malloys]], features the band messing around and causing mayhem while caddying at a golf course, and also includes an appearance by ''[[Cheers]]'' star [[George Wendt]]. The song was featured in the [[Daria]] Television Movie ''[[Is It Fall Yet?]]''. After ''The Ever Passing Moment,'' the group had then fulfilled its contract obligations with Tooth & Nail and decided to part ways.<ref name="allmusicmain"/>

The band's version of the song "Scooby Doo, Where Are You?" is in the soundtrack of the 2002 movie ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]''.<ref name="allmusicmain"/> The group's studio album ''[[Before Everything & After]]'' was released by A&M in 2003.<ref name="allmusicmain"/> The album achieved the band's highest ever chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 51.<ref name=Charts/>

The group provided the song "The Empire" for ''[[The Passion of the Christ: Songs]]'', which won the [[Gospel Music Association]] [[36th GMA Dove Awards|2005 Dove Award]] for Special Event Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-passion-of-the-christ-original-songs-inspired-by-the-film-mw0000152655|title=The Passion of the Christ: Original Songs Inspired by the Film - Various Artists - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doveawards.com/past-winners/|title=Past Winners - The 47th Annual GMA Dove Awards}}</ref>

[[File:MxPx Keys to city.jpg|thumb|right|240px|L to R: Yuri Ruley, Tom Wisniewski, Mayor Cary Bozeman, [[Mike Herrera]] (the band receiving the Key to Bremerton in 2006)]]

In 2005 MxPx was dropped by A&M, signed with [[SideOneDummy Records]], and the group released its seventh full-length album ''[[Panic (MxPx album)|Panic]]''.<ref name="allmusicmain"/> This was a breakthrough album when the single "Heard That Sound" proved a minor radio hit. It also featured the [[Blink-182]]/[[+44 (band)|+44]] singer-bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] on "Wrecking Hotel Rooms." It also leaves the [[pop punk]] sound off of the group's previous album and returns to the band's skate punk/punk rock roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emusic.com/music-news/review/album/panic-mxpx/ |title=MXPX, Panic |publisher=Emusic |date=August 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=97395 |title=MxPx - Panic - Album Review |publisher=Absolute Punk |date=November 21, 2005}}</ref>

In September 2006, MxPx and the City of Bremerton started a marketing effort revolving around the band's song "[[Move to Bremerton]]". The band was given keys to the city by Mayor Cary Bozeman in recognition of the group's contributions to the city.<ref name="marketing"/><ref name="Stagg_HM_01_07"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/19781/mxpx-working-with-hometown-to-attract-young-folk-awarded-key-to-the-city|title=MXPX working with hometown to attract young folk, awarded key to the city|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/The-Insider-Oprah-s-clout-felt-second-time-around-1214800.php|title=The Insider: Guitars for Growth|date=September 17, 2006|newspaper=seattlepi.com|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref>

MxPx spent the majority of 2005 and 2006 touring in support of the band's 7th album ''[[Panic (MxPx album)|Panic]]''. On November 21, 2006, [[Tooth & Nail Records]] re-released "Let It Happen", an earlier rarities compilation, in a "Deluxe Edition" which included a bonus DVD featuring 12 [[music video]]s, new artwork, and two new songs. ''[[Let's Rock (MxPx album)|Let's Rock]]'', MxPx's second rarities album, was released on Side One Dummy Records on October 24, 2006. The album consists of many previously unreleased songs, re-recorded [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and acoustic demos.<ref name="allmusicmain"/>
