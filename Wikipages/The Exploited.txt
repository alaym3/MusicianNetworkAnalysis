'''The Exploited''' are a Scottish [[punk rock]] band from [[Edinburgh]], formed in 1979<ref name=AllMusic1/> by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan, with Buchan soon replaced by his brother [[Wattie Buchan]]. They signed to [[Secret Records]] in March 1981,<ref name=The-Exploited1>[http://www.the-exploited.net/history.htm The Exploited +++ Real Punk Rock Since 1980]. ''The-Exploited.net''. Retrieved 11 April 2012.</ref> and their debut EP, ''Army Life'', and debut album, ''[[Punks Not Dead]]'', were both released that year.<ref name=The-Exploited1/> The band maintained a large cult following in the 1980s among a hardcore working class punk and [[skinhead]] audience. Originally a [[street punk]] band, the Exploited eventually became a [[crossover thrash]] band with the release of their album ''[[Death Before Dishonour]]'' in 1987.

Although the Exploited continue to perform live, they have not released any studio material since their last album, ''[[Fuck the System]]'', in 2003. Their songs have been covered by [[Slayer]] and [[Ice-T]]. Despite many lineup changes, Wattie has remained as the Exploited's singer and leader.

==Career==

===Formation and early days (1979–1980)===
[[File:Theexploited-logo.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The Exploited logo]]
The original line-up consisted of Terry Buchan (vocals), Stevie Ross (guitar), Colin Erskine (bass) and Andy McNiven (drums). Formed in the West [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] area of Edinburgh, a large grey [[council estate]] on the north side of the city. The band's politics was reflected in its name, coined by drummer and songwriter McNiven, whose father was a [[Korean War]] veteran and a Communist. While in the early stages as a band, with little equipment, the band were invited to play their first gig at Craigmuir School. The band seemed to be a victim of their own publicity here. They had spray-painted their band name locally and had stolen Sunday papers, milk, and rolls in the early hours of Sunday morning and redistributed them outside peoples' front door, with a note saying, "a gift from the exploited". Their first gig was on Friday 15 December 1978. The date was recalled by McNiven as it coincided with a performance by the Doomed ([[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] by another name) at Clouds in Edinburgh to which they went after performing their own gig. The gig was attended by Terry's older brother [[Wattie Buchan|Wattie]], who had recently left the army and was a punk in [[London]].

Wattie soon replaced Terry, and Andy McNiven and Colin Erskine were dropped from the line-up as well. Jim Park became the drummer in January 1979, first playing on 3 February 1979 at the YMCA in Edinburgh, (the day after [[Sid Vicious]] died in [[New York City]]). After a few gigs in and around [[Edinburgh]], Stevey Hay left after an appearance in [[Aberdeen]] supporting the [[UK Subs]]. A few months later, he and Terry Buchan formed the Exposed. The Exposed split in 1980 after a gig supporting the Exploited. Terry left for London. Stevey was prominent in the Edinburgh band scene during the 1980s. Stevey died 14 July 2013 after a successful career as a blues musician. [https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/music/obituary-stevey-hay-musician-1-2996306 Obituary: Stevey Hay, musician]

[[File:WattieVorselaar.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Wattie performing with the Exploited in 2018]]
The Exploited have been controversial for their aggressive lyrics and rowdy gigs. They were considered "cartoon punks" by Ian Glasper.<ref name=Glasper>{{harvnb|Glasper|2004|p=360}}</ref> Glasper wrote: "For many, the Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses-searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter 'Wattie' Buchan's archetypal orange mohican."<ref name="Glasper"/> 

The Exploited are known for their lyrics about anarchy,<ref name=Anarchist/> politics<ref name=AllMusic1/><ref name=Red-Mag/><ref name=Radio/> and anti-authority.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-exploited-mn0000759491/biography The Exploited biography] at [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref name=Stroeja>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stroeja.com/?id=486|title=Welcome to nginx!|website=Stroeja.com}}</ref> In a 1983 interview, the Exploited said that they were not a political band,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlwNc7IIKR0 The Exploited 1983 Interview (Wattie Buchan Karl Morris)], Punk Lives Youtube Channel</ref> but their lyrics became political in the late 1980s and Wattie Buchan said in the documentary ''[[Punk's Not Dead (2007 film)|Punk's Not Dead]]'' that punk is defined by its politics. As a band with lyrics that have anarchist themes, the Exploited's vocalist Wattie Buchan describes himself as an [[anarchist]]<ref name=Nadia>{{cite web |url=http://montrealrampage.com/amnesia-rockfest-interview-with-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |title=Amnesia Rockfest Interview With Wattie Buchan of The Exploited |publisher=Nadia Blostein}}</ref> and openly hates politics.<ref name=Stroeja/> The Exploited have made songs about former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and have expressed a disdainful view towards Thatcher.<ref name=Radio/><ref name=War>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lets-start-a-war-said-maggie-one-day-mw0000651849|title=Let's Start a War...

The fans of the Exploited were nicknamed ''the Barmy Army''. During the rivalry between the Exploited and Conflict, there were occasional clashes with fans of Conflict, known as "the Conflict Crew". In addition to the anti-social behaviour of the band and some of their fans, the Exploited would often pull out of gigs at short notice in the 1980s, which led many venues to refuse to work with them.<ref name=Documentary>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E|title=The Exploited / Documentary part I|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> After the 1981 Southall riot, Oi! bands in general became associated with racism,<ref name=riot>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&dat=19810705&id=t1YLAAAAIBAJ&pg=6426,404910|title=Race riot strikes London|date=5 July 1981|agency=Associated Press|access-date=12 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |title=Oi! – The Truth |last=Bushell |first=Garry |year=2001 |work=Garry Bushell Uncensored |access-date=12 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216081325/http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |archive-date=16 December 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Baumann|first=Gerd|title=Contesting culture: discourses of identity in multi-ethnic London|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1996|series=Volume 100 of Cambridge studies in social and cultural anthropology|isbn=0-521-55554-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6o4xjpmOIgC&pg=PA59}}</ref> and the Exploited were sometimes believed to be a racist band because of Wattie's swastika tattoo, an incident in the early '80s where Wattie fought with a group of Asians in a cafe and in 1985 when "Deptford John" joined from the skinhead band [[Combat 84]].<ref name=Documentary/> The band has denied all accusations of racism.<ref name=Documentary/>

As of August 2017, the band's website contains a history of the band that mentions some of the problems that have accompanied their gigs, such as a riot after a gig at the Rainbow in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London when [[the Jam]] were playing nearby and Wattie incited the fans to attack the Mods, and having declared onstage in Argentina that the [[Falkland Islands]] are British forever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-exploited.net/history.htm|title=THE EXPLOITED +++ REAL PUNKROCK SINCE 1980 +++|website=The-exploited.net|access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> George Same has written about the fighting after the Finsbury Park gig in his book on modern music, ''Backward Moddy Boy''.<ref>George Same (2009), ''Backward Moddy Boy'', AuthorHouse, page 20</ref> In a documentary about the band, former manager Gem Howard said that he would often sneak the band out of hotels late, as they would often vandalise the hotel and steal everything that they could from the rooms.<ref name=Documentary/>
