'''Dissection''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|dissecare}}'' "to cut to pieces"; also called '''anatomization''') is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. [[Autopsy]] is used in [[pathology]] and [[forensic medicine]] to determine the cause of death in humans. Less extensive dissection of plants and smaller animals preserved in a [[formaldehyde]] solution is typically carried out or demonstrated in [[biology]] and [[natural science]] classes in middle school and high school, while extensive dissections of [[cadavers]] of adults and children, both fresh and preserved are carried out by [[medical students]] in [[medical schools]] as a part of the teaching in subjects such as [[anatomy]], [[pathology]] and forensic medicine. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a [[morgue]] or in an anatomy lab.

Dissection has been used for centuries to explore [[anatomy]]. Objections to the use of cadavers have led to the use of  alternatives including '''virtual dissection''' of [[computational anatomy|computer models]].

==Overview==

Plant and animal bodies are dissected to analyze the structure and function of its components. Dissection is practised by students in courses of [[biology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[veterinary science]], and sometimes in [[arts]] studies. In medical schools, students dissect human [[cadaver]]s to learn [[anatomy]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Anatomy teaching: ghosts of the past, present and future |last1=McLachlan |first1=John C. |date=17 February 2006 |journal=Medical Education |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02401.x |pmid=16483327 |last2=Patten |first2=Debra |volume=40 |issue = 3|pages=243–253|s2cid=30909540 }}</ref>

Dissection is used to help to determine the cause of death in [[autopsy]] (called [[necropsy]] in other animals) and is an intrinsic part of [[forensic]] medicine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interactive Autopsy |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/interactive-tools/autopsy/ |publisher=Australian Museum |access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>

For example, when removing the [[heart]], connects such as the [[superior vena cava]] and [[inferior vena cava]] are separated. If pathological connections exist, such as a [[fibrous pericardium]], then this may be deliberately dissected along with the organ.<ref name=Handbook/>

===Classical antiquity===
Human dissections were carried out by the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physicians]] [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] in the early part of the third century BC.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1=von Staden | first1=Heinrich | title=The discovery of the body: Human dissection and its cultural contexts in ancient Greece | journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=223–241 | year=1992 | pmid= 1285450 | pmc=2589595 | author1-link=Heinrich von Staden (historian) }}</ref> During this period, the first exploration into full human anatomy was performed rather than a base knowledge gained from 'problem-solution' delving.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |title=Human cadaveric dissection: a historical account from ancient Greece to the modern era |journal=Anatomy & Cell Biology |date=2015-09-01 |issn=2093-3665 |pmc=4582158 |pmid=26417475 |pages=153–169 |volume =48 |issue=3 |doi=10.5115/acb.2015.48.3.153 |first=Sanjib Kumar |last=Ghosh}}</ref> While there was a deep taboo in Greek culture concerning human dissection, there was at the time a strong push by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] government to build [[Alexandria]] into a hub of scientific study.<ref name=":0" /> For a time, [[Roman law]] forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aufderheide |first1=Arthur C. |title=The Scientific Study of Mummies |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0521177351 |page=5 |quote=Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived.}}</ref> so physicians had to use other cadavers.

===India===

The ancient societies that were rooted in India left behind artwork on how to kill animals during a hunt.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last=Jacob |first=Tony |date=2013 |title=History of teaching anatomy in India: from ancient to modern times |journal=Anatomical Sciences Education |volume=6 |doi=10.1002/ase.1359 |pmid=23495119 |issue=5 |pages=351–8|s2cid=25807230 }}</ref> The images showing how to kill most effectively depending on the game being hunted relay an intimate knowledge of both external and internal anatomy as well as the relative importance of organs.<ref name=":5" /> The knowledge was mostly gained through hunters preparing the recently captured prey.

Unfortunately, there is little that remains from this time to indicate whether or not dissection occurred, the civilization was lost to the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryan people migrating]].<ref name=":5" />

Early in the history of India (2nd to 3rd century), the [[Arthashastra]] described the 4 ways that death can occur and their symptoms: drowning, hanging, strangling, or asphyxiation.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last1=Mathiharan |first1=Karunakaran |title=Origin and Development of Forensic Medicine in India |journal=The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology |date=September 2005 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=254–260 |doi=10.1097/01.paf.0000163839.24718.b8|pmid=16121082 |s2cid=29095914 }}</ref> According to that source, an autopsy should be performed in any case of untimely demise.<ref name=":6" />

The practice of dissection flourished during the 7th and 8th century. It was under their rule that medical education was standardized. This created a need to better understand human anatomy, so as to have educated surgeons. Dissection was limited by the religious taboo on cutting the human body. This changed the approach taken to accomplish the goal. The process involved the loosening of the tissues in streams of water before the outer layers were sloughed off with soft implements to reach the musculature. To perfect the technique of slicing, the prospective students used gourds and squash. These techniques of dissection gave rise to an advanced understanding of the anatomy and the enabled them to complete procedures used today, such as rhinoplasty.<ref name=":5" />

During medieval times the anatomical teachings from India spread throughout the known world; however, the practice of dissection was stunted by Islam.<ref name=":5" /> The practice of dissection at a university level was not seen again until 1827, when it was performed by the student Pandit Madhusudan Gupta.<ref name=":5" /> Through the 1900s, the University teachers had to continually push against the social taboos of dissection, until around 1850 when the universities decided that it was more cost effective to train Indian doctors than bring them in from Britain.<ref name=":5" /> Indian medical schools were, however, training female doctors well before those in England.<ref name=":5" />

The current state of dissection in India is deteriorating. The number of hours spent in dissection labs during medical school has decreased substantially over the last twenty years.<ref name=":5" /> The future of anatomy education will probably be an elegant mix of traditional methods and integrative computer learning.<ref name=":5" /> The use of dissection in early stages of medical training has been shown more effective in the retention of the intended information than their simulated counterparts.<ref name=":5" /> However, there is use for the computer-generated experience as review in the later stages.<ref name=":5" /> The combination of these methods is intended to strengthen the students' understanding and confidence of anatomy, a subject that is infamously difficult to master.<ref name=":5" /> There is a growing need for anatomist—seeing as most anatomy labs are taught by graduates hoping to complete degrees in anatomy—to continue the long tradition of anatomy education.<ref name=":5" />

[[Tibetan medicine]] developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of [[anatomy]], acquired from long-standing experience with human dissection. [[Tibet]]ans had adopted the practice of [[sky burial]] because of the country's hard ground, frozen for most of the year, and the lack of wood for [[cremation]]. A sky burial begins with a ritual dissection of the deceased, and is followed by the feeding of the parts to [[vulture]]s on the hill tops.

An edict of the [[Council of Tours 1163|1163 Council of Tours]], and an early 14th-century decree of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] have mistakenly been identified as prohibiting dissection and autopsy, misunderstanding or extrapolation from these edicts may have contributed to reluctance to perform such procedures.<ref>'While during this period the Church did not forbid human dissections in general, certain edicts were directed at specific practices. These included the ''Ecclesia Abhorret a Sanguine'' in 1163 by the Council of Tours and Pope Boniface VIII's command to terminate the practice of dismemberment of slain crusaders' bodies and boiling the parts to enable defleshing for return of their bones. Such proclamations were commonly misunderstood as a ban on all dissection of either living persons or cadavers (Rogers & Waldron, 1986){{clarify|date=May 2016}}, and progress in anatomical knowledge by human dissection did not thrive in that intellectual climate', Arthur Aufderheide, ''The Scientific Study of Mummies'' (2003), p. 5</ref>{{efn|"It must be noted, however, that the pope did not forbid anatomical dissections but only the dissections performed with the purpose of preserving the bodies for distant burial"<ref name="P Prioreschi 2001"/>}} The Middle Ages witnessed the revival of an interest in medical studies, including human dissection and autopsy.<!--see following quote--><ref>"Current scholarship reveals that Europeans had considerable knowledge of human anatomy, not just that based on Galen and his animal dissections.

Human dissection was also practised by [[Renaissance art]]ists. Though most chose to focus on the external surfaces of the body, some like [[Michelangelo Buonarotti]], [[Antonio del Pollaiolo]], [[Baccio Bandinelli]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought a deeper understanding. However, there were no provisions for artists to obtain cadavers, so they had to resort to unauthorised means, as indeed anatomists sometimes did, such as grave robbing, body snatching, and murder.<ref name=":0" />

Anatomization was sometimes ordered as a form of punishment, as, for example, in 1806 to James Halligan and Dominic Daley after their public hanging in Northampton, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Richard D.|title="Tried, Convicted, and Condemned, in Almost Every Bar-room and Barber's Shop": Anti-Irish Prejudice in the Trial of Dominic Daley and James Halligan, Northampton, Massachusetts, 1806|journal=The New England Quarterly|date=June 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=205–233|doi=10.1162/tneq_a_00087|s2cid=57560527}}</ref>

In modern Europe, dissection is routinely practised in biological research and education, in medical schools, and to determine the cause of death in autopsy. It is generally considered a necessary part of learning and is thus accepted culturally. It sometimes attracts controversy, as when Odense Zoo decided to dissect lion cadavers in public before a "self-selected audience".<ref>{{cite web |title=Odense Zoo animal dissections: EAZA response |url=http://www.eaza.net/latest-news |publisher=European Association of Zoos and Aquaria |access-date=15 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513130558/http://eaza.net/latest-news/ |archive-date=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Animals used for scientific purposes |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/3r/key_resources/databases_en.htm |publisher=European Union |access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref>

In Britain, dissection remained entirely prohibited from the end of the Roman conquest and through the Middle Ages to the 16th century, when a series of royal edicts gave specific groups of physicians and surgeons some limited rights to dissect cadavers. The permission was quite limited: by the mid-18th century, the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and [[Company of Barber-Surgeons]] were the only two groups permitted to carry out dissections, and had an annual quota of ten cadavers between them. As a result of pressure from anatomists, especially in the rapidly growing medical schools, the [[Murder Act 1752]] allowed the bodies of executed murderers to be dissected for anatomical research and education. [[History of anatomy in the 19th century|By the 19th century]] this supply of cadavers proved insufficient, as the public medical schools were growing, and the private medical schools lacked legal access to cadavers. A thriving black market arose in cadavers and body parts, leading to the creation of the profession of [[body snatching]], and the infamous [[Burke and Hare murders]] in 1828, when 16 people were murdered for their cadavers, to be sold to anatomists. The resulting public outcry led to the passage of the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which increased the legal supply of cadavers for dissection.<ref>Cheung, pp. 37–44</ref>

By the 21st century, the availability of interactive computer programs and changing public sentiment led to renewed debate on the use of cadavers in medical education. The [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] in the UK, founded in 2000, became the first modern medical school to carry out its anatomy education without dissection.<ref>Cheung, pp. 33, 35</ref>

In the United States, dissection of frogs became common in college biology classes from the 1920s, and were gradually introduced at earlier stages of education. By 1988, some 75 to 80 percent of American high school biology students were participating in a [[frog]] dissection, with a trend towards introduction in elementary schools. The frogs are most commonly from the genus ''[[Rana (genus)|Rana]]''. Other popular animals for high-school dissection at the time of that survey were, among vertebrates, [[fetal pig]]s, [[perch]], and cats; and among invertebrates, [[earthworm]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[crayfish]], and [[starfish]].<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Orlans, F.

Dissection in U.S. high schools became prominent in 1987, when a California student, Jenifer Graham, sued to require her school to let her complete an alternative project. The court ruled that mandatory dissections were permissible, but that Graham could ask to dissect a frog that had died of natural causes rather than one that was killed for the purposes of dissection; the practical impossibility of procuring a frog that had died of natural causes in effect let Graham opt out of the required dissection. The suit gave publicity to anti-dissection advocates. Graham appeared in a 1987 [[Apple Computer]] commercial for the virtual-dissection software Operation Frog.<ref>Howard Rosenberg: [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-10/entertainment/ca-20057_1_apple-computer Apple Computer's 'Frog' Ad Is Taken Off the Air.] LA Times, November 10, 1987.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author1=F.

In the United States, 17 states{{efn|California, Connecticut, D.C., Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia all have statewide laws or department of education policies that allow students to opt out.}} along with Washington, D.C. have enacted dissection-choice laws or policies that allow students [[K–12|in primary and secondary education]] to opt out of dissection. Other states including Arizona, Hawaii, Minnesota, Texas, and Utah have more general policies on opting out on moral, religious, or ethical grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Your Right Not to Dissect |publisher=PETA2 |url=http://PETA2.com }}</ref> To overcome these concerns, [[J.

As for the dissection of cadavers in undergraduate and medical school, traditional dissection is supported by professors and students, with some opposition, limiting the availability of dissection. Upper-level students who have experienced this method along with their professors agree that "Studying human anatomy with colorful charts is one thing. Using a scalpel and an actual, recently-living person is an entirely different matter."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://emu.edu/now/news/2012/11/emus-cadaver-dissection-gives-pre-med-students-big-advantage/ |title=EMU News |last=Jenner |first=Andrew |date=2012 |work=EMU’s Cadaver Dissection Gives Pre-Med Students Big Advantage |access-date=25 April 2016 }}</ref>

==Acquisition of cadavers==
The way in which cadaveric specimens are obtained differs greatly according to country.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Gangata|first1=Hope|last2=Ntaba|first2=Phatheka|last3=Akol|first3=Princess|last4=Louw|first4=Graham|date=2010-08-01|title=The reliance on unclaimed cadavers for anatomical teaching by medical schools in Africa|journal=Anatomical Sciences Education|volume=3|issue=4|pages=174–183|doi=10.1002/ase.157|issn=1935-9780|pmid=20544835|s2cid=22596215}}</ref> In the UK, donation of a cadaver is wholly voluntary. Involuntary donation plays a role in about 20 percent of specimens in the US and almost all specimens donated in some countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe.<ref name=":1" /> Countries that practice involuntary donation may make available the bodies of dead criminals or unclaimed or unidentified bodies for the purposes of dissection.<ref name=":1" /> Such practices may lead to a greater proportion of the poor, homeless and social outcasts being involuntarily donated.<ref name=":1" /> Cadavers donated in one jurisdiction may also be used for the purposes of dissection in another, whether across states in the US,<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhCrkE2lnVQC|title=Simulation in Radiology|last1=Robertson|first1=Hugh J.|last2=Paige|first2=John T.|last3=Bok|first3=Leonard|date=2012-07-12|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199764624|pages=15–20}}</ref> or imported from other countries, such as with Libya.<ref name=":1" /> As an example of how a cadaver is donated voluntarily, a funeral home in conjunction with a voluntary donation program identifies a body who is part of the program. After broaching the subject with relatives in a diplomatic fashion, the body is then transported to a registered facility. The body is tested for the presence of HIV and hepatitis viruses. It is then evaluated for use as a "fresh" or "prepared" specimen.<ref name=":2" />

==Disposal of specimens==
Cadaveric specimens for dissection are, in general, disposed of by [[cremation]]. The deceased may then be interred at a local cemetery. If the family wishes, the ashes of the deceased are then returned to the family.<ref name=":2" /> Many institutes have local policies to engage, support and celebrate the donors. This may include the setting up of local monuments at the cemetery.<ref name=":2" />

==Use in education==
Human cadavers are often used in medicine to teach anatomy or surgical instruction.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> Cadavers are selected according to their anatomy and availability. They may be used as part of dissection courses involving a "fresh" specimen so as to be as realistic as possible—for example, when training surgeons.<ref name=":2" /> Cadavers may also be pre-dissected by trained instructors. This form of dissection involves the preparation and preservation of specimens for a longer time period and is generally used for the teaching of anatomy.<ref name=":2" />

==Alternatives==<!--Virtual dissection links to here-->

Some alternatives to dissection may present educational advantages over the use of animal cadavers, while eliminating perceived ethical issues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Balcombe |first=Jonathan |date=2001 |title=Dissection: The Scientific Case for Alternatives |url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=acwp_arte |journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=117–126 |doi= 10.1207/S15327604JAWS0402_3|s2cid=143465900 |access-date=15 February 2016}}</ref> These alternatives include computer programs, lectures, three dimensional models, films, and other forms of technology. <!--The following may belong to a different section, not here-->Concern for animal welfare is often at the root of objections to animal dissection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stainsstreet |first1=M |last2=Spofforth |first2=N |last3=Williams |first3=T |title=Attitudes of undergraduat students to the uses of animals. |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=18 |date=1993 |issue=2 |pages=177–196 |doi=10.1080/03075079312331382359 }}</ref> Studies show that some students reluctantly participate in animal dissection out of fear of real or perceived punishment or ostracism from their teachers and peers, and many do not speak up about their ethical objections.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oakley |first1=J |title=Dissection and choice in the science classroom: student experiences, teacher responses, and a critical analysis of the right to refuse. |journal=Journal of Teaching and Learning |volume=8 |date=2012 |issue=2 |doi=10.22329/jtl.v8i2.3349 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oakley |first1=J |title="I didn't feel right about animal dissection": Dissection objectors share their science class experiences. |journal=Society & Animals |volume=21 |date=2013 |issue=1 |pages=360–378 |doi=10.1163/15685306-12341267 }}</ref>

One alternative to the use of cadavers is computer technology. At [[Stanford Medical School]], software combines X-ray, ultrasound and MRI imaging for display on a screen as large as a body on a table.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Tracie |date=2011 |title=Body image: Computerized table lets students do virtual dissection |url=http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2011/05/body-image-computerized-table-lets-students-do-virtual-dissection.html |journal=Stanford Medicine: News Center |access-date=20 February 2016}}</ref> In a variant of this, a "virtual anatomy" approach being developed at New York University, students wear three dimensional glasses and can use a pointing device to "[swoop] through the virtual body, its sections as brightly colored as living tissue." This method is claimed to be "as dynamic as [[IMAX|Imax]] [cinema]".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Singer |first=Natasha |date=7 January 2012 |title=The Virtual Anatomy, Ready for Dissection |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/business/the-human-anatomy-animated-with-3-d-technology.html?_r=2 |journal=The New York Times |access-date=15 February 2016}}</ref>

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Proponents of animal-free teaching methodologies argue that alternatives to animal dissection can benefit educators by increasing teaching efficiency and lowering instruction costs while affording teachers an enhanced potential for the customization and repeat-ability of teaching exercises. Those in favor of dissection alternatives point to studies which have shown that computer-based teaching methods "saved academic and nonacademic staff time … were considered to be less expensive and an effective and enjoyable mode of student learning [and] … contributed to a significant reduction in animal use" because there is no set-up or clean-up time, no obligatory safety lessons, and no monitoring of misbehavior with animal cadavers, scissors, and scalpels.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |last1=Dewhurt |first1=D |last2=Jenkinson |first2=L |title=The impact of computer-based alternatives on the use of animals in undergraduate teaching: A pilot study |journal=ATLA |volume=23 |date=1995 |issue=4 |pages=521–530 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Predavec |first1=M |title=Evaluation of E-Rat, a computer-based rat dissection, in terms of student learning outcomes. |journal=Journal of Biological Education |date=2001 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=75–80 |doi=10.1080/00219266.2000.9655746|s2cid=85201408 }}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Youngblut |first1=C |title=Use of multimedia technology to provide solutions to existing curriculum problems: Virtual frog dissection |journal=Doctoral Dissertation |date=2001|bibcode=2001PhDT........42Y }}</ref>

With software and other non-animal methods, there is also no expensive disposal of equipment or hazardous material removal. Some programs also allow educators to customize lessons and include built-in test and quiz modules that can track student performance. Furthermore, animals (whether dead or alive) can be used only once, while non-animal resources can be used for many years—an added benefit that could result in significant cost savings for teachers, school districts, and state educational systems.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Several peer-reviewed comparative studies examining information retention and performance of students who dissected animals and those who used an alternative instruction method have concluded that the educational outcomes of students who are taught basic and advanced biomedical concepts and skills using non-animal methods are equivalent or superior to those of their peers who use animal-based laboratories such as animal dissection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patronek |first1=G.J. |last2=Rauch |first2=A |s2cid=5164145 |title=Systematic review of comparative studies examining alternatives to the harmful use of animals in biomedical education |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |date=2007 |volume=230 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.2460/javma.230.1.37 |pmid=17199490}}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=A |title=The effectiveness of humane teaching methods in veterinary education |journal=ALTEX |date=2007 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=91–109 |doi=10.14573/altex.2007.2.91 |pmid=17728975 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Some reports state that students' confidence, satisfaction, and ability to retrieve and communicate information was much higher for those who participated in alternative activities compared to dissection. Three separate studies at universities across the United States found that students who modeled body systems out of clay were significantly better at identifying the constituent parts of human anatomy than their classmates who performed animal dissection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Waters |first1=J.R. |last2=Van Meter |first2=P |last3=Perrotti |first3=W |last4=Drogo |first4=S |last5=Cyr |first5=R.J |title=Cat dissection vs. sculpting human structures in clay: An analysis of two approaches to undergraduate human anatomy laboratory education |journal=Advances in Physiology Education |date=2005 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=27–34 |doi=10.1152/advan.00033.2004|pmid=15718380 }}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Motoike |first1=H.K. |last2=O'Kane |first2=R.L. |last3=Lenchner |first3=E |last4=Haspel |first4=C |title=Clay modeling as a method to learn human muscles: A community college study |journal=Anatomical Sciences Education |date=2009 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=19–23 |doi=10.1002/ase.61|pmid=19189347 |s2cid=28441790 |doi-access=free }}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Waters |first1=J.R. |last2=Van Meter |first2=P |last3=Perrotti |first3=W |last4=Drogo |first4=S |last5=Cyr |first5=R.J. |title=Human clay models versus cat dissection: How the similarity between the classroom and the exam affects student performance |journal=Advances in Physiology Education |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=227–236 |doi=10.1152/advan.00030.2009|pmid=21652509 }}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref>

Another study found that students preferred using clay modeling over animal dissection and performed just as well as their cohorts who dissected animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DeHoff |first1=M.E. |last2=Clark |first2=K.L |last3=Meganathan |first3=K |title=Learning outcomes and student perceived value of clay modeling and cat dissection in undergraduate human anatomy and physiology. |journal=Advances in Physiology Education |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=68–75 |doi=10.1152/advan.00094.2010|pmid=21386004 }}<!--|access-date=3 February 2015 --></ref>

In 2008, the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) affirmed its support for classroom animal dissection stating that they "Encourage the presence of live animals in the classroom with appropriate consideration to the age and maturity level of the students …NABT urges teachers to be aware that alternatives to dissection have their limitations. NABT supports the use of these materials as adjuncts to the educational process but not as exclusive replacements for the use of actual organisms."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Use of Animals in Biology Education |url=http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/index.php?p=97 |website=Position Statements: National Association of Biology Teachers |publisher=National Association of Biology Teachers |access-date=3 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150513074408/http%3A//www.nabt.org/websites/institution/index.php?p%3D97 |archive-date=13 May 2015 }}</ref>

The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) "supports including live animals as part of instruction in the K-12 science classroom because observing and working with animals firsthand can spark students' interest in science as well as a general respect for life while reinforcing key concepts" of biological sciences. NSTA also supports offering dissection alternatives to students who object to the practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=NSTA Position Statement: Responsible Use of Live Animals and Dissection in the Science Classroom |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/animals.aspx |website=National Science Teachers Association |access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref>

The NORINA database lists over 3,000 products which may be used as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education and training.<ref>[http://oslovet.norecopa.no/NORINA NORINA]</ref> These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system.<ref>[http://www.interniche.org InterNICHE]</ref>
