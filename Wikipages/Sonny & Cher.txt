'''Sonny & Cher''' were an American pop and entertainment duo in the 1960s and 1970s, made up of husband and wife [[Sonny Bono]] and [[Cher]]. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] backing singers for record producer [[Phil Spector]].

The pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, "[[Baby Don't Go]]" and "[[I Got You Babe]]". Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, ''Good Times''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Sonny-Cher-Good-Times-Original-Film-Soundtrack/release/2350125|title=Sonny & Cher - Good Times (Original Film Soundtrack)|website=Discogs|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> and ''Chastity'', with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, "Chastity's Song (Band of Thieves)".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Sonny-Bono-Chastity-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/3241010|title=Sonny Bono - Chastity (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|website=Discogs|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> In 1972, after three years of silence, the couple returned to the studio and released two other albums under the MCA/Kapp Records label.

In the 1970s, they also positioned themselves as media personalities with two top ten TV shows in the US, ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Show]]''. The couple's career as a duo ended in 1975 following their divorce. In the decade they spent together, Sonny and Cher were nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s and sold over 40 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Appreciation: The Sonny Side of Life, Sonny Bono: 1935–1998|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante|work=[[CNN]]|date=January 12, 1998|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/01/12/time/Bellafante.html}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Sonny And Cher|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/sonny-and-cher/8061|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them No. 18 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=December 17, 2015|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

Performing under her first name, Cher went on to a highly successful career as a solo singer and actress, while Sonny Bono was eventually elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[U.S. Representative]] from [[California]]. The two performers were inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1998, following Sonny's death in a [[skiing]] accident.

==Career==

===1962&ndash;1964: The origin===
[[Cher|Cherilyn Sarkisian]] first met [[Salvatore Bono]] in a Los Angeles coffee shop in November 1962,<ref name="S&CBio">{{cite web |url=http://home.att.net/~movie.stars.1950/sonny_cher.html |title=Early Bio |publisher=home.att.net |access-date=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426054703/http://home.att.net/~movie.stars.1950/sonny_cher.html |archive-date=2009-04-26}}</ref> when she was sixteen.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 14-15</ref> Eleven years her senior,<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 30</ref> Bono was working for record producer [[Phil Spector]] at [[Gold Star Studios]] in [[Hollywood]].<ref name="yahoomovies">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800023318/bio |title=Cher Biography |publisher=Yahoo! Movies |access-date=2009-04-19}}</ref> The two became best friends, eventual lovers, and were supposedly married in 1964, but Bono says in his autobiography that it was not an official marriage. They were legally wed after their only child, [[Chaz Bono|Chaz]], was born. Through Bono, Cher started as a session singer, and sang backup on several of Spector's classic recordings, including "[[Be My Baby]]" by [[the Ronettes]], "[[You've Lost That Loving Feeling]]" by [[The Righteous Brothers]] and [[Darlene Love]]'s "A Fine, Fine Boy". In Darlene Love's recording, the listener can clearly hear Cher and Sonny close to the [[microphone|mic]] (along with Love, who recorded her own backing vocals).<ref name="yahoomovies"/>

===1965&ndash;1966: Career development===
[[File:Sonny-and-Cher.jpg|thumb|left|Sonny & Cher during a rehearsal break at ABC Television's Wembley studios on 26 May 1966.]]

With Bono continuing to write, arrange and produce the songs, the couple's first incarnation was as the duo "Caesar and Cleo".<ref name="S&CBio"/><ref name="About.com">{{cite web |url=http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/features/a/CherBackDean.htm |title=CHER: Back To The Dance Floor! |publisher=About.com |access-date=2009-04-20}}</ref><ref name="wardlamb">{{cite web |title= Sonny & Cher |url= http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/wilderness/468/ward.htm |publisher= Rhino Handmade |author= Lamb, Ward |date= 1999-10-13 |access-date= 2007-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101115043530/http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/wilderness/468/ward.htm |archive-date= 2010-11-15 }}</ref> They released some singles in 1964, including "The Letter", with Vault Records, and "The Letter", "Do You Wanna Dance" and "Love Is Strange", with [[Reprise Records]].<ref name="classicbands">{{cite web |url=http://www.classicbands.com/sonnycher.html |title=Sonny and Cher |publisher=classicbands.com |access-date=2009-04-19}}</ref>

In September 1964, they released "[[Baby Don't Go]]"<ref name="wardlamb"/> under the name of Sonny & Cher, which became their first regional hit. The song was later included on the 1965 Reprise compilation ''[[Baby Don't Go – Sonny & Cher and Friends]]'', which also included songs from artists such as [[Bill Medley]], [[The Lettermen]] and [[The Blendells]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The duo released their first album ''[[Look at Us]]'' in the summer of 1965.<ref name="ticketscher">{{cite web |url=http://www.ticketluck.com/concert-tickets/Cher/index.php |title=Cher Tickets |publisher=ticketluck.com |access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> The album contained the number one single "[[I Got You Babe]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1965-07-31/hot-100 |title=The Billboard Hot 100: "I Got You Babe" |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=2009-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209100832/http://www.billboard.com/charts/1965-07-31/hot-100 |archive-date=February 9, 2014 }}</ref> ''Look at Us'' peaked at number two on the [[Billboard chart]] for eight weeks in the later part of 1965.<ref name="wardlamb"/>

The couple appeared on many of the top television shows of the era including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Where The Action Is]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'', ''[[Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', ''[[Beat Club]]'', ''[[Shindig!]]'', ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name="ticketscher"/> They also appeared as themselves in the film ''[[Wild on the Beach]]'', singing "It's Gonna Rain". On their first album Bono also displayed his political interest long before running for Congress in the lyrics of the song, "The Revolution Kind".

As the followup to the success of ''Look at Us'', they released their second studio album in April 1966, ''[[The Wondrous World of Sonny & Chér]]'', which peaked at number 34.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onlinetickets.com/info/concert_tour/cher/sonny_cher_history.html |title=Sonny and Cher History |publisher=onlinetickets.com |access-date=2009-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416020139/http://www.onlinetickets.com/info/concert_tour/cher/sonny_cher_history.html |archive-date=2009-04-16}}</ref> The two dressed in animal skins with Bono wearing knee high caveman boots and Cher going barefoot.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

During 1965, five of their songs were in US Billboard Top 20, a record passed only by [[Elvis Presley]] and behind famous artists like [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and others. Periodic solo releases by Cher continued during this period, including major successes with "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]", and [[Burt Bacharach]] & [[Hal David]]'s theme from "[[Alfie (Burt Bacharach song)|Alfie]]" (as heard in the motion picture [[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]], as well as a single release), both in 1966. They sided with the young people being harassed on the [[Sunset Strip]] during the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]; they were removed from their promised position of honor in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in January 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.justabovesunset.com/2006/id186.html |title=Looking Down on Ghosts |publisher=justabovesunset.com |access-date=2009-04-19}}</ref>

===1967&ndash;1969: Career woes===
[[File:Fanclub1967SonnyCher2.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Sonny & Cher (Dutch TV, 1967)]]
In 1967 Sonny and Cher released their third album, ''[[In Case You're In Love]]''. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, "[[The Beat Goes On (Sonny & Cher song)|The Beat Goes On]]" ({{Abbr|No.|number}}&nbsp;6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and "[[Little Man (Sonny & Cher song)|Little Man]]" (No.&nbsp;21 on the Billboard Hot 100).

In an attempt to capitalize on the duo's initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in. But the 1967 feature, ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]],'' was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director [[William Friedkin]] and co-star [[George Sanders]].<ref name="cherscholar">{{cite web |url=http://www.cherscholar.com/recordreview.htm |title=Cher Sounds |publisher=Cher Scholar |author=Ladd, M.E. |access-date=2007-01-28}}</ref> After ''Good Times'' flopped in 1968, [[Columbia Pictures]] immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' to [[MGM]].<ref name="Cherimdbbio">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000333/bio |title=Cher biography |publisher=IMdB |access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref> The couple were replaced by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]]. In 1969, another film, ''[[Chastity (1969 film)|Chastity]]'', starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Sonny and Cher's career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life<ref>Bego 2004, pp. 55–56: Sonny and Cher's anti-drug position during the height of the drug culture</ref><ref>Brush 1988: The couple's monogamous marriage during the period of the sexual revolution.</ref> had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the [[psychedelic rock]] of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s.

Bono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking, glamorous singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series.

Sonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, [[Chaz Bono|Chastity]] (named after Cher's movie), born on March 4, 1969.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radioswissclassic.ch/en/music-database/orchestra/118945306d7983d24bd0ad49c4291ef6cec5a/biography|title=Radio Swiss Classic - Music database - Orchestra/Ensemble|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}</ref>

===1970&ndash;1977: TV success and divorce===
[[File:Sonny and Cher live 1971.jpg|thumb|Performing live in 1971.]]
In 1970, Sonny and Cher starred in their first television special, ''The Nitty Gritty Hour'',<ref name=Mondostars>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondostars.com/entertainment/cher.html |title=Queen of Gay Glamour |publisher=mondostars.com |access-date=2009-03-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222142627/http://www.mondostars.com/entertainment/cher.html |archive-date=2008-12-22}}</ref> a mixture of [[slapstick]] [[comedy]], [[skits]], and live music. The appearance was a critical success, which led to numerous guest spots on other television shows.<ref name="Mondostars"/> They also appeared in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' as guest stars.

Sonny and Cher caught the eye of [[CBS]] head of programming [[Fred Silverman]] while guest-hosting ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and Silverman offered the duo their own variety show.<ref name="tvparty">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/sonnycher.html |title=Sonny and Cher shows |publisher=TVParty.com |access-date=2007-01-28}}</ref> ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' debuted in 1971 as a summer replacement series.<ref name="tvparty"/> The show returned to prime time later that year and was an immediate hit, quickly reaching the Top 10.<ref name="tvparty"/> The show received 15 Emmy Award nominations during its run, winning one for direction,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tickco.com/cher_concert_tickets.htm |title=Cher Artist Information |publisher=tickco.com |access-date=2009-03-16}}</ref> throughout its initial four seasons on CBS. The duo also revived their recording career, releasing the album ''[[All I Ever Need Is You (1971 Sonny & Cher album)|All I Ever Need Is You]]'', and charting two more top ten hits: "[[All I Ever Need Is You (song)|All I Ever Need Is You]]", and "[[A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done]]" in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cherscholar.com/all-i-ever.htm |title=The Sonny & Cher ''All I ever need is you'' album (A new producer) |publisher=cherscholar.net |access-date=2009-03-21}}</ref>

Sonny and Cher's dialogues were patterned after the successful nightclub routines of [[Louis Prima]] and [[Keely Smith]]: the happy-go-lucky husband squelched by a tart remark from the unamused wife. The show featured a stock company of zany comedians, including [[Teri Garr]], Freeman King, Ted Ziegler, Billy Van and Murray Langston (later [[The Unknown Comic]] on ''[[The Gong Show]]''). One sketch satirizing [[CBS]]'s detective show ''Cannon'' and its portly star [[William Conrad]] was so successful that Sonny and Cher staged several follow-ups, with [[Tony Curtis]] as "Detective Fat". Everybody in these sketches wore wide-waisted "fat suits" (similar to hoop skirts), so Detective Fat ''and'' his clients ''and'' his suspects would spend most of the time bumping each other and bouncing across the crowded room.

By the third season of the ''Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'', the marriage of Sonny and Cher was falling apart; the duo separated later that year.<ref name="tvparty"/> The show imploded, while still rating in the top 10.<ref name=tvclassics >{{cite web |url=http://www.tvclassics.com/sc.htm |title=Sonny and Cher |publisher=tvclassics.com|access-date=2009-05-09}}</ref> What followed was a very public divorce (finalized on June 26, 1975<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=3403 |title=Sonny and Cher divorce |publisher=history.com |access-date=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501065453/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=3403 |archive-date=2009-05-01}}</ref>). Cher won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance By an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for ''The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000333/awards |title=Cher Awards |publisher=IMDb.com |access-date=2009-05-09}}</ref>
[[File:Sonny & Cher Show 1977.JPG|thumb|180px|Scene from an Egyptian soap opera skit on ''The Sonny and Cher Show'', 1977.]]
Bono launched his own show, ''The Sonny Comedy Revue'', in the fall of 1974,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/fall74/ |title=Television Obscurities - Fall 1974: ABC |publisher=tvobscurities.com |access-date=2009-05-09}}</ref><ref name="tv.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/cher/show/2946/summary.html |title=Cher |publisher=TV.com |access-date=2009-01-28}}</ref> retaining the "Sonny and Cher" troupe of comedians and writers. Cher also announced plans to star in a new variety series of her own. Critics predicted that Bono would be the big winner with a solo comedy vehicle, and held little hope for Cher's more musical showcase. After only six weeks, however, Bono's show was abruptly canceled.<ref name="tvparty"/>

The ''Cher'' show debuted as an elaborate, all-star television special on February 16, 1975, featuring [[Flip Wilson]], [[Bette Midler]], and special guest [[Elton John]].<ref name="tvparty"/> [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Jack Albertson]] both won Emmy Awards for their appearances as guest-stars a few weeks later,<ref name="tvparty"/> and the series received four additional Emmy nominations that year. The first season ranked in the Top 25 of the year-end ratings.

As a result of the divorce, Sonny and Cher went their separate ways until Cher attended the opening of one of Bono's restaurants in something of a reconciliation. ''The Sonny & Cher Show'' returned in 1976, even though they were no longer married (the duo "reunited" with a humorous handshake). After struggling with low ratings through 1977, Sonny and Cher finally parted ways for good. In 1976, [[Mego Corporation|Mego Toys]] also released a line of [[Mego Sonny & Cher Toys|toys and dolls]], in the likeness of Sonny & Cher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megomuseum.com/catalog/1976/cher1.shtml |title=Mego Catalog Library: 1976 Cher |publisher=megomuseum.com|access-date=2009-04-26}}</ref> The release of these fashion dolls coincided with the popularity of ''The Sonny & Cher Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hieroglyph.net/frameset4.html |title=Cher Dolls Fan Site |publisher=hieroglyph.net |access-date=2009-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205004329/http://www.hieroglyph.net/frameset4.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>

===1978&ndash;1999: After Sonny and Cher===
Sonny Bono went on to an acting career and later entered politics, eventually becoming a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. Cher went on to become a [[Grammy Award]]-winning solo singer and an [[Academy Award]]-winning actress.

The couple made two surprise impromptu reunion performances: the first on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' in the spring of 1979, singing a medley of "[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]" and "[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]",<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike Douglas, former TV show host, dies |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-08-11-douglas-obit_x.htm |work=USA Today |author=Bianco, Robert |date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2007-01-28}}</ref> and the second on November 13, 1987,<ref>''The New Mexican'', Santa Fe, New Mexico, US, Nov. 29, 1987, p. 35, accessed through [[NewspaperARCHIVE.com]] on March 13, 2009</ref><ref>''Aiken Standard'', Aiken, South Carolina, US, Nov. 15, 1987, p. 3, accessed through [[NewspaperARCHIVE.com]] on March 13, 2009</ref> on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' where they performed their hit song "I Got You Babe"; it turned out to be the last time the two would perform together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpAUbSPjtYw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/IpAUbSPjtYw| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=SONNY AND CHER sing "I GOT YOU, BABE" on David Letterman 1980's late night|last=Dalton Holmen|date=1 June 2012|access-date=28 August 2017|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In early 1999, ''And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story'', directed by David Burton Morris and starring [[Jay Underwood]] and Renee Faia, was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The TV movie was based on the autobiography of Bono, and focuses on the relationship between the couple during the early 1960s to their divorce in the late 1970s. This movie was also nominated for two [[Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |title=1999 Emmy Awards |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Emmy_Awards/1999 |work=IMDb |access-date=2009-07-17}}</ref>

==Bono's death, music copyright, and material loss==
[[File:Sonny&Cher-Hollywood-2507940152 (rotated).jpg|thumb|175px|Sonny and Cher's star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].]]
On January 5, 1998, Bono died of injuries from hitting a tree while skiing at Heavenly Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe. He was 62 years old.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/us/sonny-bono-62-dies-in-skiing-accident.html |title=Sonny Bono, 62, Dies in Skiing Accident |work=The New York Times |access-date=2009-06-03 | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=1998-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/US/9801/06/bono.obit/ |title=Sonny Bono killed in skiing accident |publisher=CNN |access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref> Bono's death came just days after [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy|Michael Kennedy]] died in a similar accident. Bono's widow, [[Mary Bono|Mary]], was selected to fill the remainder of his congressional term, and was re-elected in her own right, serving until she was defeated for re-election in 2012. She continues to champion many of her late husband's causes, including the ongoing fight as how to best save the [[Salton Sea]].

The funeral, unbeknownst to Cher, was broadcast live on [[CNN]]. She gave a tearful [[eulogy]], after which the attendees sang the song "The Beat Goes On". In front of millions, Cher tearfully and effusively praised Bono, calling him "the most unforgettable character I've ever met".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dying.about.com/od/famousmemorableeulogies/a/sonny_euolgy.htm |title=Cher's Eulogy for Sonny |publisher=About.com |access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> His final resting place is [[Desert Memorial Park]] in nearby [[Cathedral City, California]], the same cemetery in which [[Frank Sinatra]] was laid to rest later that same year.

In 1998, Sonny and Cher received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for Television. Cher appeared at the event with Mary Bono, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. Cher paid tribute to Bono in the CBS special ''Sonny and Me: Cher Remembers'', calling her grief "something I never plan to get over".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superiorpics.com/cher/ |title=Cher biography |publisher=Superior Pics.com |access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> During the same year, Cher also released her twenty-second album ''[[Believe (Cher album)|Believe]]'' that was highly influenced by Bono's death, and in the booklet Cher wrote "In memory of Son".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Believe (Cher album)|Believe]]|others=[[Cher]]|year=1999|type=[[Compact disc|CD]] [[liner notes]]|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

When Cher and Bono divorced, they agreed to split revenue from the songs recorded together.
