==History==
In 2017, singer and songwriter Eric Burton made his way from [[California]] to [[Texas]]. Born in the [[San Fernando Valley]], he grew up singing in church and then got heavily involved in [[musical theater]]. He started [[Street performance|busking]] at the [[Santa Monica Pier]], where he brought in a few hundred dollars a day and developed his performance skills. Burton traveled through the Western states, studying music at [[New Mexico State University]] before deciding to settle down and busk in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name="LATimes_20Nov19" /><ref name="RS_21Jan21" /><ref name="Independent_13Jan21">{{Cite web|date=2020-01-23|title=Black Pumas: 'We're not trying to make a political statement'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/black-pumas-interview-eric-burton-adrian-quesada-album-grammys-best-new-artist-a9296311.html|access-date=2021-01-13|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Spencer|date=January 3, 2020|title=Movers & Shakers 2020: Grammy nominee Eric Burton honed his musicianship in Las Cruces|url=https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/2020/01/03/black-pumas-eric-burton-grammy-nominee-honed-music-las-cruces/2760834001/|work=Las Cruces Sun-News|location=Las Cruces, New Mexico|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref>

In the meantime, Grammy Award-winning guitarist and producer Adrian Quesada was looking to collaborate with someone new. Through a mutual friend, Quesada connected with Burton. Quesada felt that Burton's vocals were a match for the retro-funk- and R&B-flavored tracks Quesada had been working on and the two joined forces in 2018 as Black Pumas.<ref name="LATimes_20Nov19" /><ref name="RS_21Jan21" /><ref name="Independent_13Jan21" />

Quesada was a member of [[Latin funk]] band [[Grupo Fantasma (American band)|Grupo Fantasma]] when it won the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album]] for the 2010 album ''[[El Existential]]'', and when it was previously nominated for the same award in 2008 for ''Sonidos Gold.''<ref name="LATimes_20Nov19" /><ref name="RS_21Jan21" /><ref name="Independent_13Jan21" />

Working out their material both in the studio and on-stage during a weekly residency at Austin's C-Boys Heart & Soul Bar, they signed a deal with [[ATO Records]] and released a pair of singles, "Black Moon Rising" and "Fire".

== Career ==

The duo released their debut album, ''[[Black Pumas (album)|Black Pumas]]'', on June 21, 2019. They performed at [[South by Southwest]] in 2019 and won a best new band trophy at the 2019 Austin Music Awards. On November 20, 2019, they were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist.<ref name="LATimes_20Nov19" /><ref name="Billboard_20Nov19" />

The album received acclaim from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', who praised "the tireless, charismatic energy of singer Eric Burton",<ref name="RS_21Jan21">{{Cite magazine|last=Browne|first=David|date=2020-01-21|title=Black Pumas: Rise of a Psychedelic-Soul Force|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/black-pumas-interview-grammys-935802/|access-date=2020-07-17|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> and [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]], who wrote "The duo's flair for drama is so stirring, they can seem acutely cinematic",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Black Pumas: Black Pumas|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-pumas-black-pumas/|access-date=2020-07-17|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> as well as [[NPR]], ''[[The Fader]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' and ''Headliner Magazine'', among others.
