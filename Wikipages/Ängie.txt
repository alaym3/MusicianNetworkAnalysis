She was described in 2017 by journalist Harriet Gibsone as, "an emblem of the liberal-minded revolution that is thriving online among teenagers and people in their early 20s. She is socially motivated, serious about her social media “art” and as committed to getting high as she is to creating a sense of community among those living in small towns as she once did."<ref name="The Guardian"/>

She supports the legalisation of cannabis. When asked in an interview in September 2016, "Is that a message you want to get across with your music? Legalise weed?" She responded "After girl power, yeah."<ref name="Loaded"/>
