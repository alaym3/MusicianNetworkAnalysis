In 1994, Jeezy spent nine months in YCA (Youth Challenge Academy), a [[recruit training|boot camp]] in [[Fort Stewart]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for narcotics possession.<ref name="XXL 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/magazine/2005/10/im-a-king/|title=I'm a King|last=Thompson|first=Bonsu|date=October 2005|work=XXL|access-date=January 13, 2011}}</ref>  Four years later, in 1998, Jeezy launched the label imprint [[CTE World]], then known as Corporate Thugz Entertainment.

In 2001, under the name Lil J, Young Jeezy released his first independent album, ''[[Thuggin' Under the Influence (T.U.I.)]]'',.<ref name="TUI">{{cite web|url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005M96X/|access-date = November 29, 2006|title=Thuggin Under the Influence }}</ref> The album included features from artists Freddy J., Kinky B, Fidank, and [[Lil Jon]], who also produced some of the songs.

In May 2004, [[Jazze Pha]]'s manager, Henry 'Noonie' Lee, showed Jeezy's demo to his friend [[Shakir Stewart]], then Vice President Artist and Repertoire (VP A&R) at Def Jam.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_ShakirStewart.html|title=Interview With Shakir Stewart|date=November 14, 2005|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|access-date=June 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111223118/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_ShakirStewart.html|archive-date=January 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Stewart "fell in love with it [the demo] the first time [he] heard it" and took it to [[L.A.

Ultimately, Jeezy decided he wanted to be in business with Stewart and Reid and signed with [[Def Jam Records]] as a result.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

In the summer of 2008, Jeezy was at the center of a controversy over his choice for president. While he had previously endorsed [[Barack Obama]], during an interview with [[Vibe (magazine)|''Vibe'']], Jeezy spoke about meeting and supporting [[John McCain]]. The statement caused a stir, and Jeezy quickly clarified his stance via a viral video. In the four-minute explanation, Jeezy made it clear, Obama was his main choice. "I represent the Democratic party. ... I've never been nor do I ever plan to be a John McCain supporter", the rapper said. "I support Barack Obama."<ref>{{cite news|last=Starbury|first=Allen|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/article/news/2008/07/5016/|title=Young Jeezy Clarifies McCain Comments, Pledges Support For Obama|work=BallerStatus.com|date=July 2, 2008}}</ref> Jeezy and [[Jay-Z]] performed in a concert to celebrate the inauguration of President Obama on January 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=St. Pierre|first=Jay|url=http://www.lsureveille.com/opinion/get_sillay_young_jeezy_enforces_country_s_racial_segregation-1.1485034|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223010844/http://www.lsureveille.com/opinion/get_sillay_young_jeezy_enforces_country_s_racial_segregation-1.1485034|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2009|title=Get Sillay: Young Jeezy enforces country's racial segregation|work=The Daily Reveille|date=February 19, 2009}}</ref> On ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] criticized their performance as a "rant that offended people", but Jeezy responded: "I got white friends.

"[[Lose My Mind (Young Jeezy song)|Lose My Mind]]" peaked at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100.

On March 4, 2010, Jeezy released "Illin", featuring [[Pusha T]] of the rap duo [[Clipse]]. On the track, Pusha T raps, "No amount of record sales could derail this ...Stuffing dead prezzies in the wall like that Yale bitch..." This line was controversial as many felt the line was in bad taste since it references Yale student Annie Le, who was [[Murder of Annie Le|murdered]] in 2009. Many felt Young Jeezy and Pusha were making light of Le's tragic death.<ref>Gendreau, Leanne.
