'''Donna Lewis''' is a Welsh singer-songwriter, pianist and record producer from [[Cardiff]]. She is best known for the 1996 pop hit single "[[I Love You Always Forever]]", which peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States. In the latter country, the song peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for nine weeks, having been held off the summit by the Bayside Boys Remix of "[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]" by [[Los Del Rio]]. It also became the highest-charting single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 by a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] artist since [[Bonnie Tyler]] topped the chart with "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" in 1983. Additionally, the single is [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number two (without hitting number one)|tied third]] among songs with the longest runs at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and at second for most weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Lewis teamed up with [[Richard Marx]] on the 1997 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary]] hit "[[At the Beginning]]" for the ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' [[Anastasia (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. In 1997, Lewis was nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Artist]].<ref name="BRITS">[http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/donna-lewis Donna Lewis BRITS Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216064849/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/donna-lewis |date=16 February 2013 }}.

After releasing her second album ''[[Blue Planet (Donna Lewis album)|Blue Planet]]'', Lewis left [[Atlantic Records]] and independently released albums ''[[Be Still (Donna Lewis album)|Be Still]]'' and ''[[In the Pink (Donna Lewis album)|In the Pink]]''. Her album ''Brand New Day'' was produced by [[David Torn]] and featured [[Ethan Iverson]], [[Reid Anderson]] and [[David King (drummer)|Dave King]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicalite.com/articles/13552/20141219/donna-lewis-new-album-brand-new-day-palmetto-records-david-king-reid-anderson-ethan-iverson-david-bowie-neil-young-damien-rice-burt-bacharach-gnarls-barkley-chocolate-genius-harry-nilsson.htm |title=Donna Lewis to Release New Album 'Brand New Day' Featuring David King, Reid Anderson and Ethan Iverson With Covers of David Bowie, Neil Young, Damien Rice and More |publisher=Classicalite |date=19 December 2014 |access-date=18 April 2015 |author=Prisco, Jaime}}</ref><ref name="Jazz">{{cite web |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/donna-lewis-brand-new-day-donna-lewis-by-ben-scholz.php?page=1 |title=Donna Lewis: Brand New Day |publisher=All About Jazz |date=10 March 2015 |access-date=4 August 2016 |author=Scholz, Ben}}</ref><ref name="Scholz">{{cite web |url=http://benjaminscholz.com/blog/26-donna-lewis-brand-new-day.html |title=Donna Lewis: Brand New Day |publisher=Benjamin Scholz |date=23 February 2015 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>

==Biography==
There are conflicting accounts regarding Lewis's birth date. According to her biography on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[AllMusic]] websites,<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/301169/donna-lewis/biography |title=Donna Lewis. Biography by Matt Collar |publisher=Billboard |date=2016 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="AMG-old">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p189104|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by John Bush |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=27 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513224049/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/donna-lewis-p189104/biography|archive-date=13 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/donna-lewis-mn0000448207/biography |title=Biography by Matt Collar |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref> written by employees of [[Rovi]],<ref name="Billboard"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/faq/topic/addartist |title=How does an artist get added to AllMusic? |publisher=AllMusic |date=2016 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref> she was born on 6 August 1973. This date appears also on her BBC page.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/donna-lewis/ |title=BBC Wales – Music – Donna Lewis |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=1 August 2009|access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref> The following information is consistent with all sources: Lewis was born in [[Cardiff]]. She began playing the piano at the age of six.<ref name="AMG-old"/> Her father, an amateur jazz pianist and guitarist<ref name="Scholz"/> lent encouragement, and at 14, she began composing original songs.<ref name="AMG-old"/> Her formal training was at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] in Cardiff, where she majored in classical composition for piano and flute. Lewis then went on to teach music for a year in [[Sussex]] before moving to [[Birmingham]] to sing in a bar band.<ref name="AMG-old"/> During that time she set up a home studio<ref name="AMG-old"/><ref name="BBC"/> and began recording demos. She became a popular live attraction and circa 1993 began sending her demos to record labels.<ref name="AMG-old"/> [[Atlantic Records]] signed her in 1994.<ref name="AMG-old"/>

An article in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' from November 1996 presents a different timeline of these events. It states that Lewis's graduation from the Royal Welsh College took place in 1979 and that she played in piano bars throughout Britain and Europe for a period of five years, so like many people in the public eye, there may have been attempts to make her age appear younger than she really is.<ref name="People">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20142679,00.html |title=The No. 1 That Got Away |publisher=Time Inc. |date=4 November 1996 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref> In November 1996, she had been married for ten years to her road manager and "[gave] her age as in her 30s".<ref name="People"/> This information, if correct, would imply that she was born between 1957 and 1966. This is roughly consistent with a statement Lewis made in an interview in 2015: "When I was in the pop world [...], I wasn't a 19 year old—I was 30 or something like that."<ref name="Jazz"/><ref name="Scholz"/> The context suggests that this refers to the time when she got her Atlantic record deal. The biography on Lewis's own website<ref name="DL">{{cite web |url=http://www.donnalewis.com/ |title=bio |publisher=Donna Lewis |date=2016 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref> does not date events prior to 1996. An article in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' from September 1996 states that Lewis "won't reveal her age—she and her husband/manager, Martin Harris, have been married for nine years, so 'you know I'm not 21'".<ref name="EW">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1996/09/13/donna-lewis-chats-us-about-her-hit-single |title=Donna Lewis chats with us about her hit single |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=13 September 1996 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref>

In 1996, Atlantic Records released Lewis's first single, "[[I Love You Always Forever]]", a love song which was a hit on [[VH1]].<ref name="AMG-old"/> It was also successful on U.S. radio, staying at No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book | last = Whitburn | first = Joel |author-link= Joel Whitburn | title = The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits |edition=8th | publisher = Billboard Books | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8230-7499-4 | page = 366 }}</ref> for nine consecutive weeks,<ref name="whitburn"/> and spending 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the airplay chart.<ref name="whitburn"/> It exceeded one million "[[spin (radio)|spin]]s" on radio, to claim its place in music industry history as the most-played single up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Donna+Lewis |title=Donna Lewis – Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and pictures at |publisher=Last.fm |access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref> The single reached No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1996, and spent 14 weeks in the chart.

It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the U.S.<ref>US certifications [https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH riaa.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |date=26 June 2007 }} Search "Donna Lewis"</ref>

Lewis recorded "[[At the Beginning]]" with [[Richard Marx]] for the 1997 film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]''. Her second LP, ''[[Blue Planet (Donna Lewis album)|Blue Planet]]'' (1998), won critical acclaim, but it was largely overlooked by the public. Although it produced a minor hit in continental Europe and Asia, "[[I Could Be the One (Donna Lewis song)|I Could Be the One]]", and a U.S. No. 1 dance single, "Love Him", Lewis parted ways with [[Atlantic Records]]<ref name="BBC"/> and independently produced her third LP, ''[[Be Still (Donna Lewis album)|Be Still]]'' (2002), which featured her on an almost entirely acoustic set. During the early 2000s, Lewis was featured as a guest vocalist on several [[trance music]]/[[house music]] recordings. Her fourth LP, ''[[In the Pink (Donna Lewis album)|In the Pink]]'', was released in 2008; its first single was "Shout," which was included in the soundtrack to the Marian Quinn film ''[[32A]]''. Lewis also sang lead vocals for her side project, Chute, which released their debut EP in April 2010. In March 2015, she released ''[[Brand New Day (Donna Lewis album)|Brand New Day]]'', her first full-length LP in nearly a decade.

==Personal life==
Lewis is married to Martin Harris, who is also her business manager. She resides in [[Boiceville, New York]] and has one son, Archie.<ref name="EW"/>
