Gore was given first shot at recording "[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]" by songwriters [[Carole Bayer]] and [[Toni Wine]] with a melody borrowed from a sonatina by [[Muzio Clementi]],<ref>Clementi, Muzio.

"One by One" was an unreleased track recorded on July 31, 1969, in New York and produced by Paul Leka; it first appeared on the Bear Family five-CD anthology of Gore's Mercury work entitled ''It's My Party'' (1994).<ref name="NYDN">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/lesley-gore-party-singer-dead-68-article-1.2117563|title=Lesley Gore, who sang 'It's My Party,' dead at 68|publisher=[[New York Daily News]].com|access-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="MSN"/>

Gore was one of the featured performers in the ''[[T.A.M.I.

After high school, while continuing to make appearances as a singer, Gore attended [[Sarah Lawrence College]], studying British and American English literature.

Gore signed a contract with [[Mercury Records]] with a five-year term that carried her obligations to the company through the spring of 1968.  Her last big hit had been 12 months prior to this time, but Mercury still saw promise in her as an artist and believed that one of her singles would make it, as they had in the past. They offered a one-year extension on the initial contract, and Gore was formally contracted to Mercury for a sixth year. During this time, "[[La, la, la|He Gives Me Love (La La La)]]", a single release based on a [[Eurovision Song Contest]] winner, rose to number 96 on the Music Business charts, while bubbling under the Hot 100 in ''Billboard''.  Mercury took out a full-page ad in the trades to support the single, but its airplay was spotty, becoming a hit in only a few major markets.<ref>{{cite book|title=Record World|date=July 6, 1968|publisher=Record World|pages=25–28|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Record-World/60s/68/RW-1968-07-06.pdf}}</ref>  She was then paired with the successful soul producers [[Kenny Gamble]], [[Leon Huff]], and [[Thom Bell]] for two singles that took her into the "[[blue eyed soul|soul]]" genre:  "I'll Be Standing By" and "Take Good Care (Of My Heart)".  These songs did not fit the image Mercury had crafted for her, and the singles were not played.  Her contract with Mercury ended after the release of "[[98.6 (song)|98.6]]/Lazy Day" and "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]" failed to make headway on the charts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=September 9, 1968|publisher=Billboard|page=110, review|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/60s/1969/Billboard%201969-09-06.pdf}}</ref>

In 1970, she signed with Crewe Records and was reunited with producer Bob Crewe, who had produced her album ''California Nights''.

===1980–2014: As composer===

Gore co-wrote a song, "My Secret Love", for the 1996 film ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''.  The film includes a subplot about a young singer named Kelly Porter, who is based in part on Gore and is played by [[Bridget Fonda]].
