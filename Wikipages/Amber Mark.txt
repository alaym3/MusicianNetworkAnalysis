==Life and career==
===1993–2015: Early life===
Amber Mark was born on December 29, 1993 on a farm in Tennessee to a [[Jamaica]]n father and a [[Germany|German]] mother whose name was Mia. The family lived in [[Miami]], [[New York City|New York]] and eventually moved to a [[Darjeeling]] monastery in [[India]] so that her mother could learn [[Thangka|thangka painting]]. After spending a few years there, they moved back to her mother's home country.<ref>https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-amber-mark-singer-style</ref>
Mia died on June 3, 2013, at the age of 60. It was she who gave Mark her first guitar, which is when she started to teach herself how to play music. In high school, she joined the school choir and an "after school band program". She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Amber Mark Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s|last=Wilford|first=Carly|date=2017-08-21|website=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>

===2016–present: Musical career===
Mark released her debut single "S P A C E" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album, "3:33am". As Mark explained, "[t]hree has been a really common number in my life. My mother was born in 1953, my brother was born in 1983 and I was born in 1993. Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere. When I was writing the EP in New York ... and out of the zone, I would check the clock and I always remember it being 3:33am."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.herecomesthesong.com/single-post/2017/07/19/Amber-Mark-a-songwriters-desire-for-more-S-P-A-C-E|title=Amber Mark: a songwriter's desire for more S P A C E|last=Fanthorpe|first=Katie|date=July 19, 2017|work=Here Comes The Song|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> The album art features a photo taken by her sister, in which Mark is wearing a watch that reads 3:33.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-amber-mark/|title=Interview: Amber Mark|last=Bedian|first=Knar|date=2017-10-07|website=Sound of Boston - Boston Music Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>

Each song on the record represents one of the six stages of grief.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earmilk.com/2017/05/15/amber-mark-shows-prowess-in-life-and-music-on-debut-333am-ep/|title=Amber Mark shows prowess in life and music on debut '3:33am' EP|last=Evans|first=Steph|date=2017-05-15|website=EARMILK|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> The song "Monsoon" includes samples of her mother's voice, which she explained in an interview with Sound of Boston as "a video recording of me flying back to New York for the summer while we were living in Berlin. I wanted to make a video for my godmother from my mother. Hence why I’m telling her that they don’t speak German and that she needs to speak English. When she says she loves me that is from a more recent recording she made for me while she was in hospice."<ref name=":1" /> Her mother, Mia, also influenced her fashion greatly and Mark elaborates on this influence in her 2017 interview with Vogue as the "3:33am" album was just released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-amber-mark-singer-style|title=Interview: Amber Mark|last=Bobb|first=Brooke|date=2017-05-12|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>

In 2018 she issued the EP "''Conexão''" that included the single "Love Me Right".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Amber Mark {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/amber-mark-mn0003576734/biography|last=|first=|date=|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>
