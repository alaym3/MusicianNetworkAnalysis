==Biography==
The group formed when the members were students at [[Western Kentucky University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/11/tem_nappy_roots_melds.html |title=Cincinnati Enquirer &#124; Cincinnati.com: Cincinnati news, breaking news and sports |website=Enquirer.com |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Nappy Roots' debut independent album ''Country Fried Cess'' was released in 1998, which led to the group being signed by [[Atlantic Records]]. Their first album on Atlantic was 2002's best selling hip-hop album, ''[[Watermelon, Chicken & Gritz]]''. The multi-platinum album featured the hit-singles "Headz Up", "Awnaw", and "Po' Folks". The "Awnaw (Remix)" featuring [[Marcos Curiel|Marcos]] of [[P.O.D.]] appeared on ''[[Madden 2003]]''.

In their home state, [[Paul E. Patton]], the [[governor of Kentucky]], sanctioned September 16 as "Nappy Roots Day".<ref>[http://www.ballerstatus.com/2008/03/21/nappy-roots-the-pursuit-of-nappyness/ Nappy Roots: The Pursuit Of Nappyness]  BallerStatus.com</ref>

Their next and last album with Atlantic Records was ''[[Wooden Leather]]'', released in 2003, featuring the singles "Roun' the Globe", which was featured on ''[[Madden 2004]]'', and "Sick and Tired" (featuring [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]]). This critically acclaimed, major label follow-up album featured production from [[Kanye West]], [[David Banner]] and [[Lil Jon]].  Also in 2003, Nappy Roots were on the [[movie soundtrack|soundtrack]] to ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', with the song "Right Now", which featured [[Marcos Curiel]] of [[P.O.D.]] and was released on [[Windup Records]]. In 2004, three songs by Nappy Roots were included in the movie soundtrack to ''[[The Ladykillers]]'', released on [[Sony Music]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Ladykillers-Various-Artists/dp/B0001IN10W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1327285832&sr=8-1 Amazon.com: The Ladykillers: Various Artists: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Since the release of ''Wooden Leather'' they have gone back to being independent artists, and have started their own label, N.R.E.G. (Nappy Roots Entertainment Group) with distribution through Fontana/[[Universal Music Group]]. On July 31, 2007, they released their first album as independent artists, ''[[Innerstate Music]]'', featuring singles "Good Day" and "Keep It Real". This was actually an internet album, similar to a modern-day [[mixtape]]. It was intended to be a precursor to their 2008 album, ''[[The Humdinger]]'', which was released on August 5, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.6859/title.where-have-the-nappy-roots-been |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505065253/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.6859/title.where-have-the-nappy-roots-been |archive-date=2008-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2007 Nappy Roots was featured on the original version of the [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]] song titled "Fall Down". The song had originally been intended for Tantric's album ''[[Tantric III]]'', but due to the album being shelved, the song went unreleased. However, Tantric did re-record the song for their 2008 album ''[[The End Begins]]''. The version featuring Nappy Roots can only be found on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Tantric- Fall Down (Unreleased)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z-pqfSs_8E|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>

The critically acclaimed album ''[[The Humdinger]]'' features guest appearances from [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], [[Greg Nice]], Greg Street and Slick & Rose, with production from Sol Messiah, James "Groove" Chambers, BIG AL 360, Joe Hop and more.
