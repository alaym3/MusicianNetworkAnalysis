==Career==
Al-Rikabi has since signed to indie record label [[Future Classic]], releasing her debut EP ''XXIX'' in November 2015. The EP's lead single "Heartburn", produced by Ta-ku,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.projectu.tv/wafia-has-signed-to-future-classic-her-ta-ku-produced-debut-heartburn-is-here/|title=Wafia has signed to Future Classic & her Ta-ku produced debut 'Heartburn' is here. - Project U|date=21 October 2015|work=Project U|access-date=11 March 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311071040/https://www.projectu.tv/wafia-has-signed-to-future-classic-her-ta-ku-produced-debut-heartburn-is-here/|archivedate=11 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> received praise from producer [[Pharrell Williams]] being played during his Beats 1 radio show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taking a (Window) Seat Next to Wafia|url=https://grazia.com.au/articles/australian-musician-wafia-interview-2016|work=[[Grazia]]|accessdate=3 September 2016|date=7 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917131502/https://grazia.com.au/articles/australian-musician-wafia-interview-2016|archivedate=17 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In March 2016, she released the single "Window Seat" in collaboration with the [[New Zealand]] producer [[Thomston]]. Later in August 2016, she collaborated again with the Australian producer Ta-ku, releasing the EP ''{{not a typo|(m)edian}}''. The EP features a story about compromise in relationships, which both Wafia and Ta-ku experienced independently in of each other in their lives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ta-ku and Wafia team up for joint EP & tour, share 'Meet Me In The Middle'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4468230.htm|work=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=3 September 2016|date=24 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831085128/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4468230.htm|archivedate=31 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Wafia released a new single, "Bodies", in late 2017. It was written on the day her family members were denied refugee status for entrance into Australia, which influenced the track's lyrics. However, due to her dislike of pseudo-intellectual feeling music, the track was instead upbeat in contrast to the lyrics in an attempt to make the song accessible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.projectu.tv/wafia-bodies-is-purposeful-pop-at-its-most-accessible/|title=Wafia's 'Bodies' is purposeful pop at {{sic|it|'s|nolink=y}} most accessible - Project U|date=1 September 2017|work=Project U|access-date=11 March 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913045215/https://www.projectu.tv/wafia-bodies-is-purposeful-pop-at-its-most-accessible/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Wafia's single "I'm Good" was voted number 14 on [[Triple J]]'s [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2018|Hottest 100 of 2018]].
