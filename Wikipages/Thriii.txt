'''Thriii''' (pronounced "three") is an American [[girl group]] that was formed in 2005. The group consists of sisters [[China Anne McClain]], [[Sierra McClain]], and Lauryn McClain. The group was formed in 2005 as the '''3mcclaingirls'''. All three sisters starred in the film ''[[Daddy's Little Girls]]'' (2007), for which they released the single "Daddy's Girl". They signed with [[Hollywood Records]] in 2011 under the moniker the '''McClain Sisters'''. Their first notable performance was at the 2011 ''[[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade]]''. They released their first song "[[Rise (McClain Sisters song)|Rise]]" in March 2012 for the [[Disneynature]] film [[Chimpanzee (film)|''Chimpanzee'']], and that same month the group was the opening act for [[Big Time Rush (group)|Big Time Rush]] on their [[Better with U Tour]] in [[Houston]]. The next month they performed at the 2012 [[Egg rolling|White House Easter Egg Roll]]. In November of that year, they performed their debut single "[[Go (McClain Sisters song)|Go]]" and released it shortly after performing the song on ''[[A.N.T. Farm]]''.

In December 2013, the group left the record label, and changed their name to '''McClain'''. Later that month they released "He Loves Me". In 2014, McClain performed at the [[2014 Radio Disney Music Awards]]; performed their first headlining concert at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California]]; and toured the United States, performing at numerous state fairs.

Their last single as McClain was "Feelin' Like", which was released in 2016. Thereafter the group went on hiatus from 2016 until June 2020, during which the sisters pursued their acting careers. In June 2020 the group returned with a new name, '''Thriii''', and released their single "My Sanity". Their first high-profile performance under the name was at [[Radio Disney Music Awards|''Radio Disney Presents ARDYs Summer Playlist'']].
