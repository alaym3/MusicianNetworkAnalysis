She released her debut album, ''[[The Masquerade (album)|The Masquerade]]'', in September 2019.

== Early life ==
Maia was born on July 9, 2000,{{r|AllMusic}} in [[Oakland, California]], and grew up near [[Lake Merritt]].{{r|Sidewalk|Wild}} Her mother is Chinese-American, and her father is German and Scottish.{{r|Sidewalk}} While at school, she enjoyed taking art and architecture classes.{{r|Sidewalk}} She became interested in music from a young age. Her brother took violin lessons, and in [[first grade]], Maia joined him. A few years later, she began playing classical cello and trumpet.{{r|YT3}}

In [[fifth grade]], she auditioned for her school rock band.{{r|Thompson}} Expecting to audition for cello, she was asked to sing [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]", and ended up joining as a vocalist,{{r|McIntyre}} where she recalls singing "[[The Middle (Jimmy Eat World song)|The Middle]]" by [[Jimmy Eat World]].{{R|Coscarelli}} In [[sixth grade]], she began playing guitar, learning in part from her father.{{r|YT3}} Maia first coined the name "Mxmtoon" on her [[Instagram]] account where she drew cartoon sketches for her 500 followers, most of whom were strangers.{{R|Coscarelli}} She started her YouTube channel in September of 2013 and began playing the ukulele in [[middle school]].{{r|Leight}} She wrote her first song at age 13.{{r|Bright Lite}}

== Career ==
=== 2017–2018: "Falling for U", ''plum blossom'' ===
mxmtoon began self-releasing songs on YouTube as "Mxmtoon" in 2017.{{r|InTune}} She recorded with [[GarageBand]]{{r|Wheeler}} in her parents' guest bedroom,{{r|Cline|OTW}} and created percussion tracks with [[Found object (music)|found objects]] such as hair straighteners.{{r|Foundations}} After initially attempting to write comedy songs, she began writing in a confessional, emotionally embodied style.{{r|Foundations}}

Her 2017 collaboration with [[lo-fi]] producer Peachy, "Falling for U", reached nearly 40 million streams on [[Spotify]] by June 2019.{{r|Leight}} Maia began secretly releasing music to the public, but was later compelled to tell her friends and family after experiencing online growth.{{r|ATC}} In 2018, Maia released her debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Plum Blossom''; the EP gained more than 100 million streams on [[Spotify]] by August 2019.{{r|Cline|Nilles}}

After high school, Maia took a "gap year" by postponing college to focus on her music.{{r|B}} She was planning to study architecture after graduating from high school, until her music went viral in April 2018.{{r|Wells}} In November 2018, she announced her "Plum Blossom Tour".{{r|Tweet2}} Her first tour, initially scheduled for five US shows{{r|Leight}} with fellow Californian singer-songwriter Khai Dreams in March 2019,{{r|Keirstead}} sold out{{r|Ely}} and was extended to include additional concerts in North America and Europe,{{r|Cline|Frometa|Gehen}} including opening appearances for [[bedroom pop]] YouTuber [[Cavetown (musician)|Cavetown]] in the United Kingdom.{{r|BW1|Tweet3|Maduakolam}} Maia made her first appearance on a billboard in Times Square when Spotify advertised her single "Dream of You" for their [[New Music Fridays|New Music Friday]] playlist.{{r|Cohen|Tweet5}}

=== 2019–present: ''The Masquerade'' and ''dawn & dusk'' ===
{{Main|The Masquerade (album)}}
Prior to the release of ''[[The Masquerade (album)|The Masquerade]]'', [[Spotify]] announced the release of ''21 Days'', a music podcast that followed Maia while she works on the album in New York City.{{r|Eggertsen|Dredge}} [[Liz Gateley]] of Spotify praised Maia's online following as well as her social presence, stating that "She obviously has lots of followers already, but that's not enough. The person had to be the right human too, and we felt she had both."{{r|Eggertsen}} The podcast is an eight-episode [[Diary|audio diary]] that includes interviews with family, friends, and collaborators, including the album's producer [[Cavetown (musician)|Cavetown]].{{R|Eggertsen|Dredge}}

Maia's debut studio album, ''The Masquerade,'' was released on September 17, 2019.{{r|ATC}} The album peaked at 17 on the [[Top Heatseekers|US Heatseekers Chart]]{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} and at 45 on the [[Independent Albums|US Indie Albums Chart]].{{r|Masquerade US Heat|Masquerade US Indie}} "Prom Dress", the lead single, has amassed over a hundred million streams on Spotify and has been used in 100,000 videos on [[TikTok]].{{r|Wells}}<ref>{{Citation|title=Spotify|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/0JCsE9ACqaHWJc3hEaPTaO|language=en|access-date=2021-04-04}}</ref> Maia's other songs have also garnered millions of online streams.{{r|Ward}}

Joshua Bote of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' described the ten-track album as "comforting [[Twee pop|twee-pop]] that wrings out genuine pathos from mxmtoon's internet celebrity".{{r|Bote}} Matt Yuyitung of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' wrote "[Maia] brings her wry sense of humor and diary-entry lyricism to her debut record, recalling the lo-fi relatability of [[Frankie Cosmos]]."<ref name="Yuyitung" />

Maia embarked on "The Masquerade Tour" of North America and United Kingdom in September 2019.{{r|BW2}} She released her first graphic novel, ''The Adventures of Mxmtoon: The Masquerade'', in October 2019. Kirsten Spruch from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, "The novel seamlessly pairs with the album, encapsulating her introverted, teenage tendencies and free-flowing creativity."{{r|Spruch}} Gabe Bergado from ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' described the book as "a captivating, charming visual journey that complements the dreamy album."{{R|Bergado}} Maia released an accompanying animated short film for the graphic novel in November 2019.{{r|Bergado}}

In November 2019, Maia announced via [[Twitter]] that she would be joining American singer-songwriter [[Lauv]] for his 2020 summer tour of Asia supporting his album ''[[How I'm Feeling]]''.{{R|Tweet}}

On November 19, 2019, [[Kobalt Music Group]] announced that they would be signing Mxmtoon to their label under a global publishing deal.{{r|Kobalt1}} This deal will include administration and creative support for current music catalogue and future works.{{r|Pace}} Emily Bines, a senior creative director at Kobalt, said, "Mxmtoon is exactly the type of forward-thinking creative that we dream about working with at Kobalt. Her vision, matched with her team's passion to bring it to fruition is unwavering. We will be hearing from Maia for a long time to come."{{r|Paine}}

Maia released ''The Masquerade (The Edits)'' on November 22, 2019. The EP features [[remix]]es from songs on ''The Masquerade'' from artists like Chloe Lilac, Alexander 23 and [[Chloe Moriondo]].{{r|AM3}} In November 2019, ''[[Dork (magazine)|Dork]]'' put Maia on their Hype List of 2020,{{r|Firth}} alongside artists including [[Girl in Red]], [[Beabadoobee]] and [[Maisie Peters]].{{r|Dork1}}

In December 2019, Maia re-recorded the song "Prom Dress" in [[Simlish]], the fictional language used in ''[[The Sims]]'' games, to help promotion. The Simlish version was added to The Sims 4 on December 12, 2019,{{r|Espiritu}}{{r|EA}} to a positive reaction from Maia on [[Twitter]].{{R|Tweet6}} A week later Maia released the music video for "Unspoken Words", which revolves around her Chinese-American upbringing as well as her relationship with her Chinese grandmother.{{r|Smith2|Dork2}}

Maia released her first single of 2020, "Fever Dream", in January 2020.{{r|Brandle}} "Fever Dream" was followed by Maia's EP ''Dawn'' in April. In an interview with the Forty-Five, Maia said of the EP, "it’s a big progression, thematically. I wanted to make an EP that gracefully said thank you and goodbye to the past chapters of mxmtoon, and my debut album and first EP."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hunt|first=El|date=June 10, 2020|title=mxmtoon: "I dreamed of being a YouTuber. Music felt untouchable"|url=https://thefortyfive.com/interviews/mxmtoon-interview-dawn-ep-2020-quarantine/|access-date=September 26, 2020|website=The Forty-Five}}</ref>

Accompanying album ''Dusk'' was released in October 2020, and was soon amalgamated with ''Dawn'' to form ''Dawn & Dusk''.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=mxmtoon |number=1327384394001223680 |title=released dawn & dusk as a full project so you can listen all the way through (: check it out along with the visualizer !}}</ref>

Maia has been credited with having an "endearingly intimate presence".{{r|Boilen}} The singer-songwriter's{{r|Suskind}} music has been described as "warm [[folk-pop]] tunes with acoustic ornamentations",{{r|Ely}} "one part acoustic-pop a-la [[Kina Grannis]], mixed with sharp lyricism and [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], off-kilter melodics akin to [[Fiona Apple]] or [[PJ Harvey]]",{{r|GG}} that "explore[s] themes such as the trials of love, being a burden to those close to you, and connecting with your family's heritage."{{r|OTW}}{{r|Cline}} Joshua Bote of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' wrote that Maia "might be the songwriter a new generation needs", noting that she is "made for these times" and is "armed with a ukulele, a sardonic charm and social media savvy."{{R|Bote}}

Grant Rindner of [[Nylon (magazine)|''Nylon'']] wrote: "With a commitment to covering topics she rarely hears addressed by other artists, and a keen understanding of how to bond with her audience, she's emerged as a charming and relatable singer-songwriter with a massive platform."{{R|Rindner}} After attending Maia's performance at the [[Gramercy Theatre]], Briana Younger of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, "She sang of routine high-school problems, such as crippling self-doubt and unrequited love, with an emotional sophistication that reminded us that there are some things we never outgrow."{{r|Younger}} Joe Coscarelli of ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' has compared Maia's [[bedroom pop]] style to that of [[Girl in Red]], [[Clairo]] and [[Beabadoobee]], as well as the folk-pop "simplicity" of [[Regina Spektor]] and [[The Moldy Peaches]]. Her manager, Max Gredinger, has presented her with [[Billie Eilish]] and [[Shawn Mendes]] as models for potential super-stardom.{{R|Coscarelli}}

Coscarelli wrote: "Maia, who overflows with earnestness and giggles, has assembled an independent, D.I.Y. mini-empire almost by accident."{{R|Coscarelli}} Bote described Maia as "really, really good at the internet".{{r|Bote}} Maia makes comedy videos on the video-sharing platform [[TikTok]] where she has amassed 2.2 million followers and 88&nbsp;million likes as of September 2020.{{r|TikTok}} To date, she has made appearances on [[Vine (service)|Vine]], [[Tumblr]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Snapchat]], [[Bandcamp]], [[Pinterest]] and [[SoundCloud]] as well as TikTok.{{R|Coscarelli}} Her music has been streamed over 300 million times across all online platforms collectively.{{r|Cohen}}
