==Releases==
Wood began releasing music under the moniker "Will Wood and the Tapeworms" in 2015. Under this name he released two studio albums: ''Everything is a lot'' in 2015 and ''Self-ish'' in 2016, and the live album ''The Real Will Wood'' in 2018, which later served as soundtrack to a mockumentary concert film of that same name in 2020.

In 2019 he started a [[crowdfunding]] campaign for ''The Normal Album'' which raised $27,631 and was released in 2020 under his own name.<ref>{{Cite web|last=PalabasTayo|date=August 19, 2021|title=WILL WOOD LAUNCHES MASSIVE INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN FOR "THE NORMAL ALBUM."|url=https://dentalrecordsmusicnews.com/post/186072512043/will-wood-launches-massive-indiegogo-campaign-for|access-date=August 19, 2021|website=PalabasTayo|language=en-US}}</ref>  

In September 2021, Will Wood released the single “Sex, Drugs, Rock ‘n’ Roll,” a tongue-in-cheek but emotional piano ballad. The single features Wood lamenting but criticizing his struggles with publicity and closes with self-inserted recordings of a crowd booing, and was accompanied by a music video wherein he throws rotten tomatoes at a comedically exaggerated version of himself before breaking the fourth wall to reveal himself behind the camera, laughing at his own work and looking embarrassed.<ref>{{Citation|title="Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n' Roll" - Will Wood [OFFICIAL VIDEO]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTe0abueYqo|language=en|access-date=2021-11-26}}</ref>  

In an interview about the single, Wood explained “I’m not saying this song is just me saying ‘publicity is killing me’ because of course not. I’m saying it’s hard to become a better, healthier person when you’re struggling to stay a person at all... ‘Will Wood’ was wreaking a lot of havoc on real me, and I needed to do some serious re-tooling or real me would end up murdered by that walking coping mechanism.” <ref>{{Cite web|last=September 22|first=2021|last2=Louis|date=2021-09-22|title=WILL WOOD HATES "SEX, DRUGS, ROCK N ROLL" - exclusive interview!|url=http://theafterhoursreview.com/2021/09/22/will-wood-hates-sex-drugs-rock-n-roll-exclusive-interview/|access-date=2021-11-26|website=The After Hours Review|language=en-US}}</ref> 

His next studio album, slated to be titled "In Case I Make It," was croudfunded on [[Indiegogo]] in October 2021. Wood has described the collection of songs as being his most personal yet, saying in an interview,  “I’ve always tried to consistently re-invent myself as an artist, I think. But this time is different, because for lack of a less dramatic phrase… I’ve reinvented myself as a person. I couldn’t be more different than I was even a year or two ago.” <ref>{{Cite web|last=September 22|first=2021|last2=Louis|date=2021-09-22|title=WILL WOOD HATES "SEX, DRUGS, ROCK N ROLL" - exclusive interview!|url=http://theafterhoursreview.com/2021/09/22/will-wood-hates-sex-drugs-rock-n-roll-exclusive-interview/|access-date=2021-11-26|website=The After Hours Review|language=en-US}}</ref>
