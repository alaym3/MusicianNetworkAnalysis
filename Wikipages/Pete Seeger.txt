'''Peter Seeger''' (May 3, 1919&nbsp;– January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer and [[social activist]].

A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, Seeger also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of [[the Weavers]], most notably their recording of [[Lead Belly]]'s "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were [[blacklist]]ed during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of [[protest song|protest music]] in support of [[nuclear disarmament|international disarmament]], [[civil rights]], [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], [[workers rights|workers' rights]], and [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].

A prolific songwriter, his best-known songs include "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (with additional lyrics by [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[If I Had a Hammer|If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)]]" (with [[Lee Hays]] of the Weavers), "[[Kisses Sweeter Than Wine]]" (also with Hays), and "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement. "Flowers" was a hit recording for [[the Kingston Trio]] (1962); [[Marlene Dietrich]], who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and [[Johnny Rivers]] (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] (1962) and [[Trini Lopez]] (1963) while [[the Byrds]] had a number one hit with "Turn! Turn! Turn!" in 1965.

Seeger was one of the folk singers responsible for popularizing the [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] "[[We Shall Overcome]]" (also recorded by [[Joan Baez]] and many other singer-activists), which became the acknowledged anthem of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], soon after folk singer and activist [[Guy Carawan]] introduced it at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in 1960. In the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' episode "[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]", Seeger said it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional "We will overcome" to the more singable "We shall overcome".

==Early years==
Seeger was born on May 3, 1919, at the [[French Hospital (Manhattan)|French Hospital]], Midtown Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/honor-pete-seeger_b_1883818.html | title=Honor Pete Seeger | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=September 14, 2013 | access-date=July 13, 2013 | author=Clapp, E.P.}}</ref> His family, which Seeger called "enormously Christian, in the [[Puritan]], [[Calvinist]] New England tradition,"<ref>[[David King Dunaway]], ''How Can I Keep From Singing'' (New York: [Random House, 1981, 1990], revised edition, Villard Books, 2008), p. 17.</ref> traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a doctor from [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]], Germany, had emigrated to America during the [[American Revolution]] and married into the old New England family of Parsons in the 1780s.<ref>See [[iarchive:charlesseegerlif00pesc/page/5|<!-- quote=Ann M. Pescatello great-grandfather Karl Ludwig Seeger. --> Ann M. Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life in American Music'' (University of Pittsburgh, 1992), pp. 4–5.]]</ref>

Seeger's father, the [[Harvard]]-trained composer and musicologist<ref name=pc1/> [[Charles Seeger|Charles Louis Seeger, Jr.]], was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to American parents. Charles established the first musicology curriculum in the U.S. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1913; helped found the [[American Musicological Society]]; and was a key founder of the academic discipline of [[ethnomusicology]]. Pete's mother, Constance de Clyver Seeger (née Edson), raised in [[Tunisia]] and trained at the [[Paris Conservatory of Music]], was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the [[Juilliard School]].<ref name=d20>Dunaway (2008), p. 20.</ref>

[[File:Professor Charles Louis Seeger, his wife Constance, and their sons, 23 May 1921.jpg|thumb|Peter Seeger (on father's lap) with his father and mother, Charles and Constance Seeger and brothers on a camping trip (May 23, 1921)]]

In 1912, his father, Charles Seeger, was hired to establish the music department at the University of California, Berkeley, but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken [[pacifism]] during [[World War I]].<ref>According to Dunaway, the British-born president of the university "all but fired" Charles Seeger (''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 26).</ref> Charles and Constance moved back east, making Charles's parents' estate in [[Patterson, New York]], just north of New York City, their base of operations. When baby Pete was eighteen months old, they set out with him and his two older brothers in a homemade trailer to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South.<ref>Ann Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life In Music'', 83–85.</ref> Upon their return, Constance taught violin and Charles taught composition at the New York [[Institute of Musical Art]] (later [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]), whose president, family friend [[Frank Damrosch]], was Constance's adoptive "uncle." Charles also taught part-time at the [[New School for Social Research]]. Career and money tensions led to quarrels and reconciliations, but when Charles discovered Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, they separated, and Charles took custody of their three sons.<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32. Frank Damrosch, siding with Constance, fired Charles from Juilliard, see Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 224–25.</ref> Beginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government's [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement program]], the [[Works Projects Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Music Project]] (1938–1940) and the wartime [[Pan American Union]]. After [[World War II]], he taught [[ethnomusicology]] at the University of California, Berkeley, and [[Yale University]].<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 22, 24.</ref><ref name=w4>Winkler (2009), p. 4.</ref>

Charles and Constance divorced when Pete was seven and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, [[Ruth Crawford Seeger|Ruth Crawford]], now considered by many to be one of the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] composers of the 20th century.<ref>See Judith Tick, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ruth_Crawford_Seeger.html?id=xwLTDOR8LUYC' ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (1997).]</ref> Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to [[Carl Sandburg]]'s extremely influential folk song anthology, [[Carl Sandburg#Folk music|the ''American Songbag'']] (1927), and later created significant original settings for eight of Sandburg's poems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peggyseeger.com/ruth-crawford-seeger/ruth-crawford-seeger-biography |title=David Lewis, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger Biography in 600 Words'' on website of her daughter, Peggy Seeger |publisher=Peggyseeger.com |date=February 14, 2005 |access-date=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the [[Dalton School]] in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston Lower School]] in [[the Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peteseegersite.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/john-seeger-dies-at-95/|title=John Seeger Dies at 95|date=January 18, 2010|work=[[WordPress.com]]|access-date=November 5, 2010}}</ref> Pete's uncle, [[Alan Seeger]], a noted American [[war poet]] ("I Have a Rendezvous with Death"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in [[World War I]]. All four of Pete's half-siblings from his father's second marriage—Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny)—became folk singers. [[Peggy Seeger]], a well-known performer in her own right, married British folk singer and activist [[Ewan MacColl]]. [[Mike Seeger]] was a founder of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], one of whose members, [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], married Pete's half-sister Penny, also a talented singer, who died young. Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folk songs for children. In 1935, Pete attended [[Camp Rising Sun]], an international leadership camp held every summer in upstate New York, which influenced his life's work. His final visit occurred in 2012.

==Career==
===Early work===
[[File:Pete Seeger-1979.jpg|thumb|Seeger in 1979]]
At four, Seeger was sent away to [[boarding school]], but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted [[scarlet fever]].<ref>Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006) p. 50 and Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32.</ref> He attended first and second grades in [[Nyack, New York]], where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].<ref>Alec Wilkinson, ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait of Pete Seeger'' (New York: Knopf, 2009), p. 43.</ref> Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the [[ukulele]], becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]], from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend [[Camp Rising Sun (New York)|Camp Rising Sun]], the [[George E. Jonas Foundation]]'s international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string [[banjo]] for the first time at the [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford#The Mountain Dance and Folk Festival|Mountain Dance and Folk Festival]] in western [[North Carolina]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], organized by local [[folkloristics|folklorist]], lecturer, and traditional music performer [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], whom Charles Seeger had hired for [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement]] music projects.<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 48–49.</ref> The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:

<blockquote>watched square-dance teams from [[Bearwallow, North Carolina|Bear Wallow]], Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and [[Soco Gap]]; heard the five-string banjo player [[Samantha Bumgarner]]; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park."<ref name="Judith Tick p. 239">Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 239.</ref></blockquote>

For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a "conversion experience." Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo.<ref name="Judith Tick p. 239"/> The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the [[Greenwich Village]] loft of painter and art teacher [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [[Cindy (folk song)|"Cindy"]] and "[[Old Joe Clark]]" with his students [[Charles Pollock|Charlie]] and [[Jackson Pollock]]; friends from the [[Old-time music|"hillbilly"]] recording industry; and [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] composers [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Henry Cowell]]. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard "[[John Henry (folklore)#Music|John Henry]]" for the first time.<ref>Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 235. According to John Szwed, Jackson Pollock, later famous for his "drip" paintings, played harmonica, having smashed his violin in frustration, see: ''Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 88.</ref>

Seeger enrolled at [[Harvard College]] on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938.<ref>According to Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 51, after failing one of his winter exams and losing his scholarship.</ref> He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the [[Dalton School]], where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York state with the Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling [[puppet theater]] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico."<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 61–63.</ref> One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, ''[[Daily Worker]]'' reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:

{{quote|During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring "suppers" and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night.

"They fed us too well," the girls reported. "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm."

In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers' problems, about [[antisemitism]] and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," the puppeteers report, "the farmers wanted to know what can be done to create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers." They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress.<ref>Emery, Lawrence, "Interesting Summer: Young Puppeteers in Unique Tour of Rural Areas," quoted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20060919131726/http://www.peteseeger.net/DW10021939.htm Pete Seeger website]</ref>}}

That fall, Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting [[Alan Lomax]], a friend of his father's, at the [[Archive of American Folk Song]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial "[[African American music|race]]" and "[[Old-time music|hillbilly]]" music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the [[Organization of American States]]), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53).<ref>The resultant 22-page mimeographed "List of American Folk Music on Commercial Recordings", issued in 1940 and mailed by Lomax out to academic folklore scholars, became the basis of [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith's]] celebrated ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' on [[Folkways Records]]. Seeger also did similar work for Lomax at [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the late 1940s.</ref> Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk-singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and [[Nicholas Ray]]'s weekly [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting]] show ''Back Where I Come From'' (1940–41) alongside [[Josh White]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Woody Guthrie]] (whom he had first met at [[Will Geer]]'s Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for [[migrant workers]] on March 3, 1940). ''Back Where I Come From'' was unique in having a [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] cast.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075941/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851095,00.html Folk Songs in the White House], ''Time'', March 3, 1941</ref> The show was a success, but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During [[World War II|the war]], Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by [[Norman Corwin]].

From 1942 to 1945, Seeger served in the [[United States Army|Army]], as an Entertainment Specialist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=279850|title=Seeger, Pete, Cpl|website=army.togetherweserved.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

[[File:PeteSeeger2.jpg|thumb|300px|Pete Seeger entertaining [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (center), honored guest at a racially integrated Valentine's Day party marking the opening of the United Federal Labor Canteen, [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], in then-segregated Washington, D.C., 1944.<ref>From the ''Washington Post'', February 12, 1944: "The Labor Canteen, sponsored by the United Federal Workers of America, CIO, will be opened at 8 p.m. tomorrow at 1212 18th st. nw. Mrs. Roosevelt is expected to attend at 8:30 p.m."</ref>]]

In 1949, Seeger worked as the vocal instructor for the progressive [[City and Country School]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York.

===Early activism===
In 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] (YCL), then at the height of its influence. In 1942, he became a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) itself, but he left in 1949.<ref>He later commented "Innocently I became a member of the Communist Party, and when they said fight for peace, I did, and when they said fight Hitler, I did. I got out in '49, though. ... I should have left much earlier. It was stupid of me not to. My father had got out in '38, when he read the testimony of the trials in Moscow, and he could tell they were forced confessions. We never talked about it, though, and I didn't examine closely enough what was going on. ... I thought Stalin was the brave secretary Stalin, and had no idea how cruel a leader he was." Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 52; see also ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait'' (2009), p. 116.</ref>

In the spring of 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Seeger performed as a member of the [[Almanac Singers]] along with Millard Lampell, [[Cisco Houston]], [[Woody Guthrie]], Butch Hawes and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of [[Phonograph record#78 rpm disc developments|78s]] on [[Keynote Records|Keynote]] and other labels: ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), ''[[Talking Union]]'', and an album each of sea shanties and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines, such as "It wouldn't be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil," that were sharply critical of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which maintained that the war was "phony" and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the time, as did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the [[History of the Communist Party USA#1935–1939: Popular Front|Popular Front]], which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL's members still smarted from Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s [[arms embargo]] on [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalist Spain]] (which Roosevelt later called a mistake),<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTKvo-cXv3EC&q=Roosevelt+refusal+to+aid+Loyalist+Spain+mistake|first=Robert |last=Dallek

A June 16, 1941, review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which, under its owner, [[Henry Luce]], had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs' ''John Doe'', accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called "the mendacious Moscow tune" that "Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J.P. Morgan war." Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album "in bad taste," though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly, as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], an adviser on domestic propaganda to the United States military. In a review in the June 1941 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', entitled "The Poison in Our System," he pronounced ''Songs for John Doe'' "strictly subversive and illegal," "whether Communist or Nazi financed," and "a matter for the attorney general," observing further that "mere" legal "suppression" would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison,<ref>[http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm "The Poison in Our System" (excerpt from the ''Atlantic Monthly'') by Carl Joachim Friedrich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013}}. Note: Dunaway misses the significance of military propagandist Carl Joachim Friedrich, when he mistakenly refers to him as "Karl Frederick," an error other writers who relied on Dunaway repeated.</ref> the poison being folk music and the ease with which it could be spread.<ref>Friedrich's review concluded: "The three records sell for one dollar and you are asked to 'play them in your home, play them in your union hall, take them back to your people.' Probably some of these songs fall under the criminal provisions of the Selective Service Act, and to that extent it is a matter for the Attorney-General. But you never can handle situations of this kind democratically by mere suppression. Unless civic groups and individuals will make a determined effort to counteract such appeals by equally effective methods, democratic morale will decline." Upon United States entry into the war in 1942, Friedrich became chairman of the Executive Committee of the Council for Democracy, charged with combatting isolationism, and had his [http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm article on the Almanacs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013 }} reprinted as one of several pamphlets which he sent to radio network executives.</ref>

While the U.S. had not officially declared war on the Axis powers in the summer of 1941, the country was energetically producing arms and ammunition for its allies overseas.  Despite the boom in manufacturing this concerted rearming effort brought, African Americans were barred from working in defense plants. Racial tensions rose as Black labor leaders (such as [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]]) and their white allies began organizing protests and marches. To combat this social unrest, President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the Fair Employment Act) on 25 June 1941. The order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union, at which time the Communist Party quickly directed its members to get behind the draft and forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war—angering some leftists. Copies of ''Songs for John Doe'' were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors.<ref>Although the Almanacs were accused – both at the time and in subsequent histories – of reversing their attitudes in response to the Communist Party's new party line, "Seeger has pointed out that virtually all progressives reversed course and supported the war. He insists that no one, Communist Party or otherwise, told the Almanacs to change their songs. (Seeger interview with [Richard A.] Reuss 4/9/68)" quoted in William G. Roy, [http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php "Who Shall Not Be Moved? Folk Music, Community and Race in the American The Communist Party and the Highlander School," ff p. 16]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302214224/http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php |date=March 2, 2009 }}</ref> The Almanac Singers' ''Talking Union'' album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year, the Almanacs issued ''[[Dear Mr. President (Almanac Singers album)|Dear Mr. President]]'', an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, "Dear Mr. President", was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:

{{poemquote|Now, Mr. President,
We haven't always agreed in the past, I know,
But that ain't at all important now.
What is important is what we got to do,
We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do,
Other things can wait.

Now, as I think of our great land ...
I know it ain't perfect, but it will be someday,
Just give us a little time.

This is the reason that I want to fight,
Not 'cause everything's perfect, or everything's right.
No, it's just the opposite: I'm fightin' because
I want a better America, and better laws,
And better homes, and jobs, and schools,
And no more Jim Crow, and no more rules like
"You can't ride on this train 'cause you're a Negro,"
"You can't live here 'cause you're a Jew,"
"You can't work here 'cause you're a union man."

So, Mr. President,
We got this one big job to do
That's lick Mr. Hitler and when we're through,
Let no one else ever take his place
To trample down the human race.
So what I want is you to give me a gun
So we can hurry up and get the job done.}}

Seeger's critics, however, continued to bring up the Almanacs' repudiated ''Songs for John Doe''. In 1942, a year after the ''John Doe'' album's brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York ''World Telegram'' (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich's 1941 article "The Poison in Our System" was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and [[Henry Luce]]'s right-hand man, [[C. D. Jackson]], Vice President of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, had founded "to combat all the Nazi, fascist, communist, pacifist" antiwar groups in the United States).<ref>Blanche Wiessen Cook, ''Eisenhower Declassified'' (Doubleday, 1981), page 122. "The Council was a limited affair," Cook writes, "... that served mostly to highlight Jackson's talents as a propagandist."</ref>

Seeger served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]]. He was trained as an airplane mechanic, but was reassigned to entertain the American troops with music. Later, when people asked him what he did in the war, he always answered: "I strummed my banjo." After returning from service, Seeger and others established [[People's Songs]], conceived as a nationwide organization with branches on both coasts and designed to "create, promote and distribute songs of labor and the American People."<ref>People's Songs Inc. People's Songs Newsletter No 1. February 1946. [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] Resource center collection.</ref> With Pete Seeger as its director, People's Songs worked for the 1948 presidential campaign of Roosevelt's former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran as a third-party candidate on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Despite having attracted enormous crowds nationwide, however, Wallace won only in New York City, and following the election, he was excoriated for accepting the help in his campaign of Communists and fellow travelers, such as Seeger and singer [[Paul Robeson]].<ref>American Masters: "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song – [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] Broadcast 2-27-08.</ref>

===Spanish Civil War songs===
Seeger had been a fervent supporter of the Republican forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1943, with [[Tom Glazer]] and Bess and Baldwin Hawes, he recorded an album of 78s called ''[[Songs of the Lincoln Battalion]]'' on Moe Asch's Stinson label. This included such songs as "[[There's a Valley in Spain called Jarama|There's a Valley in Spain Called Jarama]]" and "[[¡Ay Carmela! (song)|Viva la Quince Brigada]]". In 1960, this collection was re-issued by Moe Asch as one side of a Folkways LP called ''Songs of the Lincoln and International Brigades''. On the other side was a reissue of the legendary ''Six Songs for Democracy'' (originally recorded in Barcelona in 1938 while bombs were falling), performed by [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]] and a chorus of members of the [[Thälmann Battalion]], made up of volunteers from Germany. The songs were "Moorsoldaten" ([[Peat Bog Soldiers (song)|"Peat Bog Soldiers"]], composed by political prisoners of German concentration camps); "[[Freiheit (song)|Die Thaelmann-Kolonne]]", "Hans Beimler", "Das Lied Von Der Einheitsfront" ("Song of the United Front" by [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]), "Der Internationalen Brigaden" ("Song of the International Brigades"), and "Los cuatro generales" ("The Four Generals", known in English as "The Four Insurgent Generals").

===Group recordings===
As a self-described "split tenor" (between a tenor and a countertenor),<ref>Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 47.</ref> Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[the Weavers]]. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with [[Millard Lampell]] and Arkansas singer and activist [[Lee Hays]], was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement,<ref>See Wikipedia entry on the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].</ref> racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], [[Sis Cunningham]], [[Josh White]], and [[Sam Gary]]. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name "Pete Bowers" to avoid compromising his father's government career.

In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, named after the title of an 1892 play by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], about a workers' strike (which contained the lines "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers, at which they sang songs such as "Talking Union", about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and automobile workers.<ref>Ingram, David. "The Jukebox in the Garden: Ecocriticism and American Popular Music Since 1960." ''Humanities Source''. 2010 Vol. 7. Retrieved October 14, 2014.</ref> Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, [[Ronnie Gilbert]], and [[Fred Hellerman]]; later [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], [[Erik Darling]], and [[Bernie Krause]] serially took Seeger's place. In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major [[Chart-topper|hit]]s began with "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]" and an arrangement of [[Lead Belly]]'s signature waltz, "[[Goodnight, Irene]]",<ref name=pc1>{{Pop Chronicles|1}}</ref> which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950<ref>Alec Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer: Pete Seeger and American folk music," in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (April 17, 2006), pp. 44–53.</ref> and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of "Irene" was the Israeli song "[[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena]]".<ref name=pc1/> Other Weavers hits included [[Woody Guthrie discography#1940, RCA Victor Sessions, Dust Bowl Ballads|"Dusty Old Dust" ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" by Woody Guthrie)]], "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter Than Wine]]" (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, "[[Wimoweh]]" (about [[Shaka]]), among others.

The Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953, at the peak of their popularity, when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent [[reunion tour]], which produced a hit version of [[Merle Travis]]'s "[[Sixteen Tons]]", as well as LPs of their concert performances. "[[Kumbaya]]", a [[Gullah]] black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.

In the late 1950s, [[the Kingston Trio]] was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of ''Billboard'' chart hits and, in its turn, spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.

In the documentary film ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]'' (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a [[jingle]] for a [[Tobacco advertising|cigarette commercial]].

===Banjo and 12-string guitar===
[[File:Pete Seeger banjos at the American Banjo Museum.jpg|thumb|Four long-neck banjos inspired by Seeger's.  The instrument on far left was  closely constructed to match Seeger's. [[American Banjo Museum]].]]
In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic ''How to Play the Five-String Banjo'', a book that many [[banjo]] players credit with starting them off on the [[musical instrument|instrument]]. He went on to invent the ''long-neck'' or ''Seeger'' banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region,{{Citation needed|reason=5-string banjo history outside Appalachia as witnesses by Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and New York manufacturers prior to the Great Depression, especially in 1880s-1910s. See [[American Banjo Museum#Classical, 1880s-1910s]]|date=February 2020}} the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in [[David King Dunaway]]'s biography, "by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string," Pete Seeger "gentrified" the more percussive traditional [[Appalachia]]n "frailing" style, "with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head."<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep from Singing'', p. 100.</ref> Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.

From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the [[12-string guitar]], an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with [[Lead Belly]], who had styled himself "the King of the 12-String Guitar." Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28") and [[capo|capo-to-key]] techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of [[Drop D tuning|drop-D (DADGBE) tuning]], tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |title=Acoustic Guitar Central |publisher=Acousticguitar.com |access-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913142102/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |archive-date=September 13, 2012 }}</ref>

===Introduction of the "Steel Pan" to U.S. audiences===
In 1956, then "Peter" Seeger (see film credits) and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], to seek out information on the [[steelpan]], steel drum, or "ping-pong" as it was sometimes called. The two searched out a local panyard director, Isaiah, and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then-new national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago. He was attempting to include the unique flavor of the steelpan in American folk music.

===McCarthy era===
In the 1950s, and indeed consistently throughout his life, Seeger continued his support of civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Wallace campaign), and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. However, with the ever-growing revelations of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s atrocities and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Communism. He left the CPUSA in 1949, but remained friends with some who did not leave it, although he argued with them about it.<ref name="powersong">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_p.html "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song"] – PBS American Masters, February 27, 2008</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_interview/index.html, Pete Seeger Interview] PBS American Masters.</ref>

On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Alone among the many witnesses after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the [[Hollywood Ten]] for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self-incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights: "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this."<ref>Pete Seeger to the House Un-American Activities Committee, August 18, 1955.

He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten one-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12619416914263979951 ''United States v.

In 1960, the [[San Diego]] school board told him that he could not play a scheduled concert at a high school unless he signed an oath pledging that the concert would not be used to promote a communist agenda or an overthrow of the government. Seeger refused, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] obtained an [[injunction]] against the school district, allowing the concert to go on as scheduled. Almost 50 years later, in February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of its predecessors.<ref name=SignOnSD>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Raquel Maria|title=School board offers apology to singer Pete Seeger|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/feb/11/pete-seeger-apology-021109/?zIndex=51324|work=Sign on San Diego|access-date=February 13, 2011}}</ref>

===Folk music revival===
To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger worked gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps, and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for [[Moe Asch]]'s [[Folkways Records]] label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger's anti-war songs, such as "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (co-written with [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]"<ref name=pc33>{{Pop Chronicles |33}}</ref> adapted from the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], and "[[The Bells of Rhymney]]" by the Welsh poet [[Idris Davies]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/caerphilly/pages/bellsofrhymney.shtml |title=BBC News – South East Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger was the first person to make a studio recording of "[[Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream]]" in 1956. Seeger also was closely associated with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and in 1963 helped organize a landmark [[Carnegie Hall]] concert, featuring the youthful [[Freedom Singers]], as a benefit for the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee. This event, and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in August of that same year, brought the civil rights anthem "[[We Shall Overcome]]" to wide audiences.  He sang it on the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, along with 1,000 other marchers.<ref>Whitehead, John. "Pete Seeger: Changing the World One Song at a Time." ''Waxahachie Daily Light''. May 30, 2013. Rutherford Institute. Accessed on October 14, 2014.</ref>
By this time, Seeger was a senior figure in the 1960s folk revival centered in [[Greenwich Village]], as a longtime columnist in ''[[Sing Out!]]'', the successor to the People's Songs ''Bulletin'', and as a founder of the topical [[Broadside Magazine|''Broadside'']] magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase "Woody's children," alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of [[People's Songs]], used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] or Wobblies' ''Little Red Song Book'', compiled by Swedish-born union organizer [[Joe Hill (activist)|Joe Hill]] (1879–1915). (The ''Little Red Song Book'' had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie, who was known to carry it around.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Briley|first=Ronald|date=2006|title="Woody Sez": Woody Guthrie, the "People's Daily World," and Indigenous Radicalism|journal=California History|volume=84|issue=1|page=34|doi=10.2307/25161857|jstor=25161857|issn=0162-2897}}</ref>

Seeger toured Australia in 1963. His single "[[Little Boxes]]", written by Malvina Reynolds, was number one in the nation's Top 40. That tour sparked a folk boom throughout the country at a time when popular music tastes, post–[[Assassination of JFK|Kennedy assassination]], competed between folk, the [[Surf music|surfing craze]], and the British rock boom that gave the world [[the Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], among others. Folk clubs sprang up all over the nation; folk performers were accepted in established venues; Australian performers singing Australian folk songs—many of their own composing—emerged in concerts and festivals, on television, and on recordings; and overseas performers were encouraged to tour Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The long television blacklist of Seeger began to end in the mid-1960s, when he hosted a regionally broadcast educational folk-music television show, ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''. Among his guests were [[Johnny Cash]], [[June Carter]], [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Doc Watson]], [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Hedy West]], [[Donovan]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], [[Richard Fariña]] and [[Mimi Fariña]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]], Mamou Cajun Band, [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]], the Beers Family, [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], Sonia Malkine, and [[Shawn Phillips]]. Thirty-nine<ref name="powersong"/> hour-long programs were recorded at [[WNJU]]'s [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi, with Sholom Rubinstein. The [[Smothers Brothers]] ended Seeger's national blacklisting by broadcasting him singing "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]" on their CBS variety show on February 25, 1968, after his similar performance in September 1967 was censored by CBS.<ref>''Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.</ref>

In November 1976, Seeger wrote and recorded the anti-death penalty song "Delbert Tibbs", about the death-row inmate [[Delbert Tibbs]], who was later [[exonerated]]. Seeger wrote the music and selected the words from poems written by Tibbs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |title=Songwriter – Pete Seeger and Writing For Freedom |publisher=Peteseeger.net |date=July 28, 1976 |access-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912091020/http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |archive-date=September 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan====
Pete Seeger was one of the earliest backers of [[Bob Dylan]]; he was responsible for urging A&R man [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] to produce Dylan's first LP on [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and for inviting him to perform at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], of which Seeger was a board member.<ref>Fellow Newport Board member [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] writes, "Pete Seeger, more than any of the other board members, had a personal connection with Bob Dylan: it was he who [in 1962] had convinced the great Columbia A and R man John Hammond, famous for his work with jazz and blues musicians, to produce Dylan's eponymous first album, ''Bob Dylan''. If anyone was responsible for Bob Dylan's presence on the Newport Stage [in 1965], it was Pete Seeger". See Bruce Jackson, ''The Story Is True: The Art and Meaning of Telling Stories'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2008), p. 148.</ref> There was a widely repeated story that Seeger was so upset over the extremely loud amplified sound that Dylan, backed by members of the [[Paul Butterfield|Butterfield Blues Band]], brought into the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]] that he threatened to disconnect the equipment. There are multiple versions of what went on, some fanciful. What is certain is that tensions had been running high between Dylan's manager [[Albert Grossman]] and Festival board members (who besides Seeger also included [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]], [[Alan Lomax]], festival MC [[Peter Yarrow]], and [[George Wein]]) over the scheduling of performers and other matters. Two days earlier, there had been a scuffle and a brief exchange of blows between Grossman and Alan Lomax, and the board, in an emergency session, had voted to ban Grossman from the grounds, but had backed off when George Wein pointed out that Grossman also managed highly popular draws [[Odetta]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].<ref>[[John Szwed]], ''Alan Lomax, 'The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 354. The Butterfield Blues Band, a new, integrated Chicago-based electric band, was the closer in an afternoon blues workshop entitled "Blues: Origins and Offshoots", hosted by Lomax, that had included African-American blues greats [[Willie Dixon]], [[Son House]], [[Memphis Slim]], and a prison work group from Texas, along with bluegrass pioneer [[Bill Monroe]] and the Bluegrass Boys. Lomax, upset that Butterfield's group had been shoehorned into his workshop, reportedly complained aloud about how long they took to set up their electrical equipment and introduced them with the words, "Now, let's find out if these guys can play at all." This infuriated Grossman (who was angling to manage the new group), and he responded by attacking Lomax physically. [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]] stated, "Alan Lomax, the great folklorist and musicologist, gave us some kind of introduction that I didn't even hear, but Albert found it offensive. And Albert went upside his head. The next thing we knew, right in the middle of our show, Lomax and Grossman were kicking ass on the floor in the middle of thousands of people at the Newport Folk Festival. Tearing each other's clothes off. We had to pull 'em apart. We figured 'Albert, man, now there's a manager!{{'"}} quoted in Jan Mark Wolkin, Bill Keenom, and Carlos Santana's, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues'' (San Francisco: Miller Freeman Books), p. 102. See also Ronald D. Cohen's introduction to "Part III, The Folk Revival (1960s)" in ''Alan Lomax: Selected Writings'', Ronald D. Cohen, ed. (London: Routledege), p. 192.</ref> Seeger has been portrayed as a folk "purist" who was one of the main opponents to Dylan's [[Electric Dylan controversy|"going electric,"]]<ref>Rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] wrote: "Backstage, Peter Seeger and the great ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax attempted to cut the band's power cables with an axe." See Greil Marcus, ''Invisible Republic, the Story of the Basement Tapes'' [1998], republished in paperback as ''The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes'' (New York: Holt, 2001), p. 12. Marcus's apocryphal story was elaborated by [[Maria Muldaur]] and [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''No Direction Home'' (2005)</ref> but when asked in 2001 about how he recalled his "objections" to the electric style, he said:

<blockquote>I couldn't understand the words. I wanted to hear the words. It was a great song, "[[Maggie's Farm]]," and the sound was distorted. I ran over to the guy at the controls and shouted, "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." He hollered back, "This is the way they want it." I said "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, "you didn't boo [[Howlin' Wolf]] yesterday. He was electric!" Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of the second half of the twentieth century, to use my father's old term.<ref>David Kupfer, [http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/406.html Longtime Passing: An interview with Pete Seeger], ''Whole Earth'' magazine, Spring 2001.

===Vietnam War era and beyond===
[[File:Pete Seeger Stern Grove.jpg|thumb|Pete Seeger, Stern Grove, San Francisco, August 6, 1978]]
A longstanding opponent of the arms race and of the Vietnam War, Seeger [[satire|satirically]] attacked then-President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] with his 1966 recording, on the album ''[[Dangerous Songs!?]]'', of [[Len Chandler]]'s children's song "[[Beans in My Ears]]". Beyond Chandler's lyrics, Seeger said that "Mrs. Jay's little son Alby" had "beans in his ears," which, as the lyrics imply,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiBEANEARS.html |title=Beans in My Ears |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |access-date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> ensures that a person does not hear what is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the [[Vietnam War]], the phrase implied that "Alby Jay," a loose pronunciation of Johnson's nickname "LBJ," did not listen to anti-war protests as he too had "beans in his ears."

During 1966, Seeger and [[Malvina Reynolds]] took part in environmental activism. The album ''[[God Bless the Grass]]'' was released in January of that year and became the first album in history wholly dedicated to songs about environmental issues. Their politics were informed by the same ideologies of nationalism, populism, and criticism of big business.<ref>Ingram, David (2008). 'My Dirty Stream : Pete Seeger, American Folk Music, and Environmental Protest', ''Popular Music'' Vol. 31, pp22. Routeledge Taylor & Francis Group. October 14, 2014</ref>

Seeger attracted wider attention starting in 1967 with his song "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]", about a [[Captain (land)|captain]]—referred to in the lyrics as "the big fool"—who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in [[Louisiana]] during World War II. With its lyrics about a platoon being led into danger by an ignorant captain, the song's anti-war message was obvious—the line "the big fool said to push on" is repeated several times.<ref>Gibson, Megan. "Songs of Peace and Protest: 6 Essential Cuts From Pete Seeger." ''Time.com'', January 28, 2014. p.1 Business Source Complete. October 14, 2014.</ref> In the face of arguments with the management of [[CBS]] about whether the song's political weight was in keeping with the usually light-hearted entertainment of the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', the final lines were "Every time I read the paper/those old feelings come on/We are waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on." The lyrics could be interpreted as an allegory of Johnson as the "big fool" and the [[Vietnam War]] as the foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 show,<ref>''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 1, September 10, 1967.</ref> after wide publicity,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |title=How "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy" Finally Got on Network Television in 1968 |publisher=Peteseeger.net |access-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805061813/http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |archive-date=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on the Smothers' Brothers show on February 25, 1968.<ref>''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 24, February 25, 1968.</ref>

At the November 15, 1969,<!-- November is correct; incorrect October date widely quoted on web -pls do not change --> [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium March]] on Washington, DC, Seeger led 500,000 protesters in singing [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" as they rallied across from the White House. Seeger's voice carried over the crowd, interspersing phrases like "Are you listening, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]?" between the [[refrain|chorus]]es of protesters singing, "All we are saying ... is give peace a chance."<ref>See, for example, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/series/pt_09.html this PBS documentary] and this {{YouTube|ZUn-EGsNt58|recording}}.</ref>

Being a supporter of progressive labor unions, Seeger had supported [[Edward Sadlowski|Ed Sadlowski]] in his bid for the presidency of the [[United Steelworkers of America]]. In 1977, Seeger appeared at a fundraiser in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]. In 1978, Seeger joined American folk, blues, and jazz singer [[Barbara Dane]] at a rally in New York for striking coal miners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QAuAgAAQBAJ&q=Pete+Seeger+Barbara+Dane&pg=PA209|title=The Pete Seeger Reader|first1=Ronald D.|last1=Cohen|first2=James|last2=Capaldi|date=December 16, 2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=209|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199336128}}</ref> He also headlined a benefit concert—with bluegrass artist [[Hazel Dickens]]—for the striking coal miners of Stearns, Kentucky, at the Lisner Auditorium in Washington, D.C. on June 8, 1979.<ref name="Dickens">{{Cite book |last=Dickens |first=Hazel |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/809471478 |title=Working girl blues : the life and music of Hazel Dickens |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-252-09097-4 |location=Urbana |oclc=809471478}}</ref>

In 1966, Seeger and his wife Toshi founded the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]], a [[non-profit organization|nonprofit organization]] based in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], that sought to protect the [[Hudson River]] and surrounding wetlands and waterways through advocacy and public education. It constructed a floating ambassador for this environmental mission, the sloop ''Clearwater'', and began an annual music and environmental festival, today known as the [[Great Hudson River Revival]].<ref name=upi.com>{{cite news|first=Gerry|last=Harrington|title=Movement afoot to name bridge after Pete Seeger |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2014/01/31/Movement-afoot-to-name-bridge-after-Pete-Seeger/UPI-15581391204873/ |work=[[United Press International]] |date=2014-01-31 |access-date=2014-02-03}}</ref>

===Reflection on support for Soviet Communism===
In 1982, Seeger performed at a benefit concert for the [[1982 demonstrations in Poland]] against the Polish government. His biographer [[David King Dunaway|David Dunaway]] considers this the first public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form.<ref name="dunawayp103">David King Dunaway (2008), p. 103.</ref> In the late 1980s, Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer that he was really in favor of incremental change and that "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time."<ref name="dunawayp103"/> In his autobiography ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone'' (1993, 1997, reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, "Should I apologize for all this? I think so." He went on to put his thinking in context:

<blockquote>How could [[Hitler]] have been stopped? [[Maxim Litvinov|Litvinov]], the Soviet delegate to the [[League of Nations]] in '36, proposed a worldwide quarantine but got no takers. For more on those times check out pacifist [[Dave Dellinger]]'s book, ''From Yale to Jail&nbsp;... ''<ref>David T. Dellinger, ''From Yale to Jail: The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter'' (New York: Pantheon Books, 1993 {{ISBN|0-679-40591-7}}).</ref> At any rate, today I'll apologize for a number of things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a "hard driver" and not a "supremely cruel misleader." I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the [[Inquisition]], the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. White people in the U.S.A. ought to apologize for [[Indian removal|stealing land from Native Americans]] and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaving blacks]]. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for [[Genghis Khan]]. And supporters of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] could apologize for his support of [[Somoza family|Somoza]], of [[Dixiecrat|Southern White Democrats]], of [[Francoist Spain|Franco Spain]], for putting [[Japanese American internment|Japanese Americans in concentration camps]]. Who should my granddaughter Moraya apologize to? She's part African, part European, part Chinese, part Japanese, part Native American. Let's look ahead.<ref>''Where Have All the Flowers Gone: A Musical Autobiography'', edited by Peter Blood (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania: A Sing Out Publication, 1993, 1997), page 22.</ref><ref name="nyt1" /></blockquote>
[[File:Pete Seeger 1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Seeger in 1999]]

In a 1995 interview, however, he insisted that "I still 
call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."<ref name="The Old Left">{{cite news | title = The Old Left | work = [[The New York Times]] Magazine | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D7123BF931A15752C0A963958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/S/Seeger,%20Pete | date = January 22, 1995 | access-date=May 22, 2010}}</ref>
In later years, as the aging Seeger began to garner awards and recognition for his lifelong activism, he also found himself criticized once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, [[David Boaz]]—[[Voice of America]] and [[NPR]] commentator and president of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]]—wrote an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'', entitled "Stalin's Songbird," in which he excoriated ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as "someone with a longtime habit of following the party line" who had only "eventually" parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the [[Almanac Singers]]' May 1941 ''Songs for John Doe'', contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from ''Dear Mr. President'', issued in 1942, after the United States and the Soviet Union had entered the war.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/14/post33?commentpage=1|title=Stalin's songbird|access-date=March 27, 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London | first=David | last=Boaz | date=April 14, 2006}}</ref><ref>Boaz's article is reprinted in his book, ''The Politics of Freedom'' (Washington, D.C.: The Cato Institute, 2008) pp. 283–84</ref>

In 2007, in response to criticism from historian [[Ronald Radosh|Ron Radosh]], a former [[Trotskyite]] who now writes for the conservative ''[[National Review]],'' Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, "Big Joe Blues":<ref>Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 422.</ref>

<blockquote><poem>I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe.
He ruled with an iron hand.
He put an end to the dreams
Of so many in every land.
He had a chance to make
A brand new start for the human race.
Instead he set it back
Right in the same nasty place.
I got the Big Joe Blues.
Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast.
I got the Big Joe Blues.
Do this job, no questions asked.
I got the Big Joe Blues.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/09/joe-blues-folk-music-seeger Seeger turns on Uncle Joe], NewStatesMan, September 27, 2007.</ref></poem></blockquote>

The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, "I think you're right, I should have asked to see the [[gulag]]s when I was in U.S.S.R. [in 1965]."<ref name="nyt1">Daniel J.

On March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister [[Peggy Seeger|Peggy]], his brothers [[Mike Seeger|Mike]] and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the [[American Folklife Center]] in honor of the [[Seeger family]], held at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C.,<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/Seegersymposium/ "How Can I Keep from Singing?": A Seeger Family Tribute]. 2007 symposium and concert, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress (web presentation includes program, photographs, and webcasts).</ref> where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.

In September 2008, [[Appleseed Recordings]] released ''At 89'', Seeger's first studio album in 12 years. On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', singing "Take It From Dr. King".

On January 18, 2009, Seeger and his grandson [[Tao Rodríguez-Seeger]] joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the crowd in singing the Woody Guthrie song "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" in the finale of Barack Obama's inaugural concert in Washington, D.C.<ref name=Tuscaloosa>Tommy Stevenson, [http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it "'This Land Is Your Land' Like Woody Wrote It"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220194941/http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it |date=February 20, 2014 }}, ''Truthout'', January 19, 2009.

Over the years, he lent his fame to support numerous environmental organizations, including South Jersey's Bayshore Center, the home of New Jersey's tall ship, the oyster schooner ''A.J. Meerwald''. Seeger's benefit concerts helped raise funds for groups so they could continue to educate and spread environmental awareness.<ref>Jennings, Jennifer.

On September 19, 2009, Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, which was particularly notable because the festival does not normally feature folk artists.

==Personal life==
Seeger married [[Toshi Seeger|Toshi Aline Ohta]] in 1943, whom he credited with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible.

Tao, a folk musician in his own right, sings and plays guitar, banjo, and harmonica with [[the Mammals]]. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]''.

When asked by [[Beliefnet]] about his religious or spiritual beliefs, and his definition of God, Seeger replied:

{{Quote|text=Nobody knows for sure. But people undoubtedly get feelings which are not explainable and they feel they're talking to God or they're talking to their parents who are long dead. I feel most spiritual when I'm out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking up at the stars. [I used to say] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God. I've had preachers of the gospel, Presbyterians and Methodists, saying, "Pete, I feel that you are a very spiritual person." And maybe I am. I feel strongly that I'm trying to raise people's spirits to get together. ... I tell people I don't think God is an old white man with a long white beard and no navel; nor do I think God is an old black woman with white hair and no navel. But I think God is literally everything, because I don't believe that something can come out of nothing. And so there's always been something. Always is a long time.|<ref>

==Legacy==
Response and reaction to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President [[Barack Obama]] noted that Seeger had been called "America's tuning fork"<ref>The phrase "America's tuning fork" is usually attributed to poet [[Carl Sandburg]], for example, see Corey Sandler, ''Henry Hudson: Dreams and Obsessions'' (New York: Kensington Books, 2007), p. 203. It is unclear when and where Sandburg, who thought highly of the Weavers, said this. Studs Terkel, who introduced Seeger as "America's tuning fork" at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival (see George Wein, Nate Chinen, ''Myself Among Others: A Life in Music'' [Da Capo Press, 2009], p. 314), later wrote that he had seen the phase in ''[[Down Beat]]'' jazz magazine (see Terkel, ''Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times'' [New York: The New Press], p. 249). The phrase was picked up in a [https://books.google.com/books?id=NEgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=Pete+Seeger+America%27s+tuning+fork&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vgNYU9ekFOTKsQS65IGoDw&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Pete%20Seeger%20America's%20tuning%20fork&f=false photo spread on Seeger] by [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] (October 9, 1964), p. 61 (see also Ronald D. Cohen, ''Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940–70'' [University of Massachusetts Press, 1970], p. 223).</ref> and that he believed in "the power of song" to bring social change, "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger."<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama memorializes Pete Seeger|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/01/28/obama-pete-seeger-bruce-springsteen/4958941/|work=USA Today|access-date=January 28, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref> Folksinger and fellow activist [[Billy Bragg]] wrote that "Pete believed that music could make a difference.
