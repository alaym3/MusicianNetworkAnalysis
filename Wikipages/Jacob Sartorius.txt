'''Rolf Jacob Sartorius''' (born October 2, 2002), better known as '''Jacob Sartorius''', is an American singer and Internet personality, who rose to fame via social media from posting [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] videos on [[Musical.ly]]. In 2016, he released his debut single "[[Sweatshirt (song)|Sweatshirt]]", which reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] charts in the United States and Canada.

== Early life ==
Sartorius was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Shortly after his birth, he was adopted and moved to [[Virginia]] because his birth parents were unable to take care of him. He was raised in [[Reston, Virginia]] by his adoptive parents.<ref name="seventeen adopt 20160824" /> At age seven, he began acting in musicals, where he discovered his love for performing.<ref name="billboard 20161020" />

His [[lip-syncing]] videos on [[Vine (service)|Vine]] became popular and led him to become one of the app's top stars with more than 8 million followers as of August 2016 before its closure in 2017.<ref name="seventeen interview 20160811" /> He believed social media offered him an escape from bullying, stating, "Before Musical.ly, I wasn't the most outgoing. The app helped me goof off. It's like no one is watching besides the camera."<ref name="billboard 20161020" />

== Career ==
Sartorius' debut single "[[Sweatshirt (song)|Sweatshirt]]" was released on May 3, 2016, and peaked at No. 90 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="idolator sweatshirt release" /><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Hussein |first1=Wandera |title=Five Things You Should Know About Singer (and Rumored Millie Bobby Brown Boyfriend) Jacob Sartorius |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8094950/jacob-sartorius-five-things-you-should-know |magazine=Billboard |access-date=June 19, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2016, he undertook the All My Friends Tour, a solo mini-tour where he performed in six cities.<ref name="idolator single 20160913" /><ref name="official tour site 20161014" /> Three months later, he announced The Last Text World Tour, where he would perform in seven countries in 2017 in support of his debut [[extended play]] ''[[The Last Text]]'', which was released on January 20, 2017.<ref name="official site last text release" /> In March 2018, he attended the Los Angeles [[March for Our Lives]] protest and spoke at the event.<ref name="independent 20180326" /> After the tour, he released two more singles, "[[Hit or Miss (Jacob Sartorius song)|Hit or Miss]]" and "All My Friends". With "Hit or Miss" debuting at No. 72 in the United States, it is his highest charting single to date.<ref name="billboard chart 20161229" />

In 2016, Google announced he was the 9th most searched musical artist of the year.<ref name="sup telegram 20161214" /> On November 1, 2018, Sartorius released his EP ''Better With You''.<ref name="billboard better with you release" />

== Controversies ==
In 2016, [[Mashable]] reported that an anonymous user by the name of "aly" on [[Twitter]] said that Sartorius forced her to send nude photos of herself through Facebook direct messages, sharing screenshots of the conversation as evidence.<ref name="auto" /> Representatives for Sartorius denied that the account was Sartorius', pointing to the fact that Sartorius' official Facebook page was created on March 18, almost two months after aly said the messages were sent.<ref name="teen vogue allegations" /><ref name="auto" />
