'''Sneaker Pimps''' are an English [[electronic music]] band, formed in [[Hartlepool]] in 1994.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indian.co.uk/site/artists/sneaker-pimps|title=ONE LITTLE INDIAN {{!}} ARTISTS|website=www.indian.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818101955/http://www.indian.co.uk/site/artists/sneaker-pimps|archive-date=18 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> They are best known for their debut album, ''[[Becoming X]]'' (1996), and its singles "[[6 Underground (song)|6 Underground]]" and "[[Spin Spin Sugar]]".

==History==
Chris Corner and Liam Howe met as teenagers in the 1980s,<ref name="auto1"/> both taking an interest in recording and studio experimentation. They banded together under the name F.R.I.S.K. and produced the ''Soul of Indiscretion'' [[Extended play|EP]], an early example of what became known as [[trip hop]]. The mix of beats and acoustic folk sounds was further explored on two more instrumental EPs: ''F.R.I.S.K.'' and ''World as a Cone''. They were signed to [[Clean Up Records]].<ref name="sneakerpimpsbe">{{cite web|url=http://www.sneakerpimps.be/biography.html|title=Biography|website=Sneakerpimps.be|access-date=2019-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103075155/http://www.sneakerpimps.be/biography.html|archive-date=3 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/25357|title=F.R.I.S.K.|website=Discogs.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> The duo also worked as DJs and producers under the name Line of Flight.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Patterson|first1=Sylvia|title=Sneak Attack|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbtTqjWx8FsC&lpg=PA50|work=Spin|date=April 1997}}</ref>

Released in 1996, ''Becoming X'' sold over one million copies.<ref name="Howe" /> The band toured for two years to support the album, including gigs alongside [[Aphex Twin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sneaker Pimps|url=http://www.pollstar.com/hotstar_article.aspx?ID=13374|website=Pollstar.com|date=1997-10-06|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612140750/http://www.pollstar.com/hotstar_article.aspx?ID=13374|archive-date=12 June 2015}}</ref> A "grueling" tour of the US strained relations within the band,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/dec/15/artsfeatures2|title=Pop review: Sneaker Pimps|last=Lester|first=Paul|date=2000-12-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and Howe left the tour prematurely.<ref name="auto4"/> A remix album, ''[[Becoming Remixed]]'', followed in 1998.

This significant lineup change caused Virgin Records to drop the band.<ref name="auto5"/> Their second album ''[[Splinter (Sneaker Pimps album)|Splinter]]'' was released in the UK on Clean Up Records in 1999, and failed to match the commercial success of ''Becoming X''.<ref name="circle">{{cite news|title=Everything But the Girl|url=http://www.sneakerpimps.it/web_rev.php#and_now|publisher=Campus Circle|date=2002-03-27|volume=12|issue=6}}</ref> New songs were premiered during a 2001 European tour opening for [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]].<ref name="sneakerpimpsbe" /> Their third album ''[[Bloodsport (album)|Bloodsport]]'' was released on [[Tommy Boy Records]] in 2002.<ref name="circle" /> Howe and Corner also gained notice by writing and producing for other artists, including [[Natalie Imbruglia]], and for remixing songs under the name Line of Flight.<ref name="auto2" /> 

In 2002, Joe Wilson and Dave Westlake left Sneaker Pimps.<ref name="auto">[https://www.linkedin.com/in/joewilson22/?originalSubdomain=uk]{{dead link|date=March 2021|bot=Dlmarial}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwestlake/]{{dead link|date=March 2021|bot=Dlmarial}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2003, a fourth Sneaker Pimps album was demoed but shelved.

The tracks were leaked online and were later confirmed to be legitimate new Sneaker Pimps songs. They have never been officially released.<ref name="auto3" /><ref>{{Citation|last=curtis8516|title=Sneaker Pimps - SP5 Demos|date=2017-06-19|url=https://archive.org/details/SneakerPimpsSP5Demos|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

After several years of side projects, Howe hinted in 2015 that Sneaker Pimps may reform.<ref name="twitter.com">[https://twitter.com/SneakerPimpsNow/status/594541947164962816] {{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> Corner confirmed the reunion in 2016,<ref>{{cite tweet|user=IAMX|author=IAMX|number=724329023250173952|date=24 April 2016|title=I just created a new folder .}}</ref> and as of early 2019 they were reportedly working on a new album.<ref name=":0" />

Deluxe box set and two studio albums announced and to be released variously across 2021.<ref name="sneakerpimpslegacy.com">https://www.sneakerpimpslegacy.com</ref>

In May 2021, the band announced a new album entitled ''[[Squaring the Circle (album)|Squaring the Circle]]''.<ref name="pearis"/> The album was produced at Sawtooth Studios in [[Pioneertown, California]] and The Tower Studios in London.<ref name="pearis"/> Main vocals are shared by Corner and "featured artist" [[Simonne Jones]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Squaring The Circle, by Sneaker Pimps|url=https://sneakerpimps.bandcamp.com/album/squaring-the-circle|access-date=2021-09-09|website=Sneaker Pimps}}</ref> Some of the songs are the ones whose demo versions were leaked several years ago (under the changed titles).

==Members==
In the studio, the band regularly swapped instruments. As Corner explained during the recording sessions for ''Bloodsport'', "we tend towards jobs, but generally we can mix and match. If we get bored of one aspect, someone else jumps in the seat. Gone are the days where it’s like 'You’re the drummer, I’m the synth player."<ref name="auto2"/> When playing live, however, their roles were more fixed:

=== Current members ===
*[[Chris Corner]] - vocals, guitar, keyboards
*[[Liam Howe]] - keyboards, synths, programming, guitar, percussion
