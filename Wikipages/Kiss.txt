A '''kiss''' is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of [[love]], [[Passion (emotion)|passion]], [[romance (love)|romance]], [[sexual attraction]], [[sexual activity]], [[sexual arousal]], [[affection]], [[respect]], [[greeting]], [[friendship]], [[peace]], and good luck, among many others. In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or [[sacrament]]. The word came from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:en:cyssan#Old English|cyssan]]'' ("[[wikt:en:to kiss#en|to kiss]]"), in turn from ''[[wikt:en:coss#Old English|coss]] '' ("a kiss").

== History ==
Some [[anthropologist]]s believe{{weasel_word|date=June 2021}} that kissing is [[instinct]]ual and intuitive, having evolved from activities like suckling or [[premastication]], others suggest it evolved from checking the health of a potential mate via inspecting their saliva, and yet others believe that it is a learned behavior.<ref name=demirjian>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7348582 The (Mostly) Blissful History of Kissing], ''NPR'' February 11, 2007</ref>

The earliest reference to kissing-like behavior comes from the [[Vedas]], Sanskrit scriptures that informed [[Hinduism]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150714-why-do-we-kiss|title=Why do humans kiss each other when most animals don't?|first=Melissa|last=Hogenboom|website=www.bbc.com}}</ref> [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], around 3,500 years ago, according to Vaughn Bryant, an anthropologist at Texas A&M University who specializes in the history of the kiss.<ref>[http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine’s-day-story-starters/] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20141204235151/http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine%E2%80%99s-day-story-starters/ |date=2014-12-04 }}</ref>

Kissing is described in the surviving [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptian]] love poetry from the [[New Kingdom]], found on [[Papyrus|papyri]] excavated at [[Deir el-Medina]]:

The earliest reference to kissing in the [[Old Testament]] is in {{bible verse|Genesis|27:26|HE}}, when [[Jacob]] deceives his father to obtain his blessing:
{{quote|And his father [[Isaac]] said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.}}

{{bible verse|Genesis|29:11|HE}} features the first man-woman kiss in the [[Bible]], when Jacob flees from [[Esau]] and goes to the house of his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]:
{{quote|And Jacob kissed [[Rachel]], and lifted up his voice, and wept.}}

Much later, there is the oft-quoted verse from {{bible verse|Song of Songs|1:2|HE}}:
{{quote|May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,<br />for your love is better than wine.<ref>Hess, Richard S. ''Song of Songs'', Baker Academic (2005) p. 48</ref><ref>[http://biblehub.com/songs/1-2.htm "Song of Solomon 1:2], Bible Hub, Biblos</ref>}}

In ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' (370 BC), [[Xenophon]] wrote about the [[Persis|Persian]] custom of kissing in the lips upon departure while narrating the departure of [[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 600 BC) as a boy from his [[Medes|Median]] kinsmen.<ref>Xenophon, ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Xen.%20Cyr.%201.4.28 1.4.27] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206070014/http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Xen.%20Cyr.%201.4.28 |date=2016-02-06 }}</ref> According to [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), when two Persians meet, the greeting formula expresses their equal or inequal status. They do not speak; rather, equals kiss each other on the mouth, and in the case where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii|title=HERODOTUS iii.

During the later Classical period, affectionate mouth-to-mouth kissing was first described in the Hindu epic the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

Anthropologist Vaughn Bryant argues kissing spread from India to Europe after [[Alexander the Great]] conquered parts of Punjab in northern India in 326 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208001512/http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |archive-date=2014-12-08 }}</ref>

The Romans were passionate about kissing and talked about several types of kissing. Kissing the hand or cheek was called an {{lang|la|osculum}}. Kissing on the lips with mouth closed was called a {{lang|la|basium}}, which was used between relatives. A kiss of passion was called a {{lang|la|suavium}}.<ref name="Terry Jones">Jones, Terry "The Ancient World According to Terry Jones (Love and Sex)" (1998)</ref>

Kissing was not always an indication of ''eros'', or love, but also could show respect and rank as it was used in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].

The study of kissing started sometime in the nineteenth century and is called '''philematology''', which has been studied by people including Cesare Lombroso, [[Ernest Crawley]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and modern scholars such as [[Elaine Hatfield]].<ref name=Kirshenbaum>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/14/opinion/kirshenbaum-science-kissing "The science of kissing"], ''CNN'', Feb. 14, 2012</ref><ref name=Furtwangler>[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 "Chemical attraction: The science of kissing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090009/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 |date=2013-08-23 }}, ''Medill Reports'', Feb. 14, 2009</ref>

== Types ==
Kristoffer Nyrop identified a number of types of kisses, including kisses of love, affection, peace, respect, and friendship. He notes, however, that the categories are somewhat contrived and overlapping, and some cultures have more kinds, including the French with twenty and the Germans with thirty.<ref name="Nyrop">Nyrop, Kristoffer. ''The Kiss and its History'', Sands & Co., London (1901) [[iarchive:bub_gb_UQgNAAAAYAAJ|Read full text]]</ref>

=== Expression of affection ===
Kissing another person's lips has become a common expression of affection or warm greeting in many cultures worldwide. Yet in certain cultures, kissing was introduced only through European settlement, before which it was not a routine occurrence. Such cultures include certain indigenous peoples of Australia, the Tahitians, and many tribes in Africa.<ref name=Dyer>Dyer, Tristeleton T.F. "The History of Kissing", ''The American Magazine'', vol. 14 1882, pp. 611–614</ref>

A kiss can also be used to express feelings without an erotic element but can be nonetheless "far deeper and more lasting", writes Nyrop. He adds that such kisses can be expressive of love "in the widest and most comprehensive meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|79}}

Nyrop writes that the most common example is the "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between other members of the same family, which can include those outside the immediate family circle, "everywhere where deep affection unites people."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82}} The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Esau met Jacob after a long separation, he ran towards him, fell on his neck, and kissed him ({{bible verse|Genesis|33:4|HE}}), [[Moses]] greeted his father-in-law and kissed him ({{bible verse|Exodus|18:7|HE}}), and [[Orpah]] kissed her mother-in-law before leaving her ({{bible verse|Ruth|1:14|HE}}). The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], as when [[Odysseus]], on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82–83}}

Affection can be a cause of kissing "in all ages in grave and solemn moments," notes Nyrop, "not only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of profound gratitude. When the [[Apostle Paul]] took leave of the elders of the congregation at [[Ephesus]], "they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him" (Acts 20:37)." Kisses can also be exchanged between total strangers, as when there is a profound sympathy with or the warmest interest in another person.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|85}}

[[Folk poetry]] has been the source of affectionate kisses where they sometimes played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the "redeeming power of the kiss are to be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her." In the reverse situation, in the tale of "[[Beauty and the Beast]]", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|95–96}}

A kiss of affection can also take place after death. In {{bible verse|Genesis|50:1|HE}}, it is written that when Jacob was dead, "Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him." And it is told of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Muhammad]]'s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when the prophet was dead, he went into the latter's tent, uncovered his face, and kissed him. Nyrop writes that "the kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved, and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether world."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|97}}

Kissing on the lips can be a physical expression of affection or love between two people in which the sensations of touch, taste, and smell are involved.<ref name=Brayer /> According to the psychologist Menachem Brayer, although many "mammals, birds, and insects exchange caresses" which appear to be kisses of affection, they are not kisses in the human sense.

Surveys indicate that kissing is the second most common form of [[physical intimacy]] among United States adolescents (after [[holding hands]]), and that about 85% of 15 to 16-year-old adolescents in the US have experienced it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00061-0 |pmid=10706169 |title=Smart teens don't have sex (or kiss much either) |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2000 |last1=Halpern |first1=Carolyn Tucker |last2=Joyner |first2=Kara |last3=Udry |first3=J.Richard |last4=Suchindran |first4=Chirayath }}</ref>

=== Kiss on the lips ===
The kiss on the lips can be performed between two [[friend]]s or family. This move aims to express affection for a friend. Unlike kissing for [[love]], a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The kiss on the lips is a practice that can be found in the time of [[Patriarchs (Bible)]].<ref>William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988</ref> In [[Ancient Greece]], the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank.<ref name=":0">Marine Gasc, racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[kiss of peace]] was recommended by the Catholic Church.<ref>Yannick Carré, ''Le baiser sur la bouche au Moyen Âge : rites, symboles, mentalités, à travers les textes et les images, XIe-XVe siècles'', Le Léopard d'Or, 1992, page 357</ref> The kiss on the lips was also common among knights.<ref name=":0" /> The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.<ref>Eric Anderson, Adi Adams, Ian Rivers, Archives of Sexual Behavior [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47521172_I_Kiss_Them_Because_I_Love_Them_The_Emergence_of_Heterosexual_Men_Kissing_in_British_Institutes_of_Education “I Kiss Them Because I Love Them”: The Emergence of Heterosexual Men Kissing in British Institutes of Education], UK, April 2012, Volume 41. 2, pages 421–430</ref><ref>Journal 7sur7.be, [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/1176526/2010/10/29/Nouvelle-tendance-des-bisous-sur-la-bouche-entre-amis.dhtml Nouvelle tendance: des bisous sur la bouche entre amis!], Belgium, October 29, 2010</ref>

=== Romantic kiss ===
[[File:Kuss.jpg|thumb|left|A romantic kiss]]
In many cultures, it is considered a harmless custom for [[teenagers]] to kiss on a [[dating|date]] or to engage in [[party games|kissing games]] with friends. These games serve as icebreakers at parties and may be some participants' first exposure to sexuality. There are many such games, including [[Truth or Dare?]], [[Seven Minutes in Heaven]] (or the variation "Two Minutes in the Closet"), [[spin the bottle|Spin the Bottle]], [[Post Office (game)|Post Office]], and Wink.
[[File:Two girls kiss in Strathcona Park, during the annual 2018 Edmonton Pride Festival.jpg|thumb|A homosexual couple kissing]]
The psychologist William Cane notes that kissing in [[Western world|Western]] society is often a romantic act and describes a few of its attributes:
{{quotation|It's not hard to tell when two people are in love. Maybe they're trying to hide it from the world, still they cannot conceal their inner excitement. Men will give themselves away by a certain excited trembling in the muscles of the lower jaw upon seeing their beloved. Women will often turn pale immediately of seeing their lover and then get slightly red in the face as their sweetheart draws near. This is the effect of physical closeness upon two people who are in love.<ref name=Cane>Cane, William. ''The Art of Kissing'', Macmillan (1991)</ref>{{Rp|9}}}}Romantic kissing in Western cultures is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature. In the Middle Ages it became a social gesture and was considered a sign of refinement of the upper classes.<ref name=Brayer>Brayer, Menachem M. ''The Jewish Woman in Rabbinic Literature'', KTAV Publishing House (1986)</ref>{{Rp|150–151}} Other cultures have different definitions and uses of kissing, notes Brayer. In [[China]], for example, a similar expression of affection consists of rubbing one's nose against the cheek of another person. In other Eastern cultures kissing is not common. In South East Asian countries the "sniff kiss" is the most common form of affection and Western [[Human mouth|mouth]] to mouth kissing is often reserved for sexual foreplay. In some tribal cultures the "equivalent to 'kiss me' is 'smell me.'"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hopkins |first1=E. Washbun |title=The Sniff-Kiss in Ancient India |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |year=1907 |volume=28 |pages=120–134 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/592764 |publisher=American Oriental Society |doi=10.2307/592764 |jstor=592764 |access-date=25 January 2021}}</ref>

The kiss can be an important expression of love and [[eroticism|erotic]] emotions. In his book ''The Kiss and its History'', Kristoffer Nyrop describes the kiss of love as an "exultant message of the longing of love, love eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the lovers' lips, and 'rises,' as Charles Fuster has said, 'up to the blue sky from the green plains,' like a tender, trembling thank-offering." Nyrop adds that the love kiss, "rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all other earthly joys in sublimity."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|30}} He also compares it to achievements in life: "Thus even the highest work of art, yet, the loftiest reputation, is nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|31}}

The power of a kiss is not minimized when he writes that "we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss ..." Kissing, he implies, can lead one to maturity: "It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers," and can keep one feeling young: "It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth." The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: "In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss," and "man craves for it as his noblest reward."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|37}}

As a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new. Nyrop gives a vivid example in the classic love story of [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. As a reward "Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis—an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock":<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|47}}
{{quotation|Ye gods, what are my feelings. Her lips are softer than the rose's leaf, her mouth is sweet as honey, and her kiss inflicts on me more pain than a bee's sting. I have often kissed my kids, I have often kissed my lambs, but never have I known aught like this. My pulse is beating fast, my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet, nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?}}
Romantic kissing "requires more than simple proximity," notes Cane. It also needs "some degree of intimacy or privacy, ... which is why you'll see lovers stepping to the side of a busy street or sidewalk."<ref name=Cane /> Psychologist [[Wilhelm Reich]] "lashed out at society" for not giving young lovers enough privacy and making it difficult to be alone.<ref name=Cane /> However, Cane describes how many lovers manage to attain romantic privacy despite being in a public setting, as they "lock their minds together" and thereby create an invisible sense of "psychological privacy." He adds, "In this way they can kiss in public even in a crowded plaza and keep it romantic."<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}} Nonetheless, when Cane asked people to describe the most romantic places they ever kissed, "their answers almost always referred to this ends-of-the-earth isolation, ... they mentioned an apple orchard, a beach, out in a field looking at the stars, or at a pond in a secluded area ..."<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}}

== Kiss as ritual ==
[[File:Maestranza-1.jpg|thumb|Kiss on the crucifix in Catholicism]]

Throughout history, a kiss has been a ritual, formal, symbolic or social gesture indicating devotion, respect or greeting. It appears as a ritual or symbol of religious devotion. For example, in the case of kissing a temple floor, or a religious book or icon. Besides devotion, a kiss has also indicated subordination or, nowadays, respect.

In modern times the practice continues, as in the case of a bride and groom kissing at the conclusion of a wedding ceremony or national leaders kissing each other in greeting, and in many other situations.

=== Religion ===
A kiss in a religious context is common. In earlier periods of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]], kissing became a ritual gesture, and is still treated as such in certain customs, as when "kissing... relics, or a bishop's ring."<ref name=Brayer /> In [[Judaism]], the kissing of the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]], a [[Siddur|prayer book]], and a [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] is also common.<ref>Kuraweil, Arthur.''The Torah for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing (2008) p. 218</ref> Crawley notes that it was "very significant of the affectionate element in religion" to give so important a part to the kiss as part of its ritual. In the early Church the baptized were kissed by the celebrant after the ceremony, and its use was even extended as a salute to saints and religious heroes, with Crawley adding, "Thus Joseph kissed Jacob, and his disciples kissed Paul. Joseph kissed his dead father, and the custom was retained in our civilization", as the farewell kiss on dead relatives, although certain sects prohibit this today.<ref name=Crawley>Crawley, Ernest. ''Studies of Savages and Sex'', Kessinger Publishing (revised and reprinted) (2006)</ref>{{Rp|126}}

A distinctive element in the Christian [[liturgy]] was noted by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] in the 2nd century, now referred to as the "[[kiss of peace]]," and once part of the rite in the primitive Mass. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] has stated that this act originated within the ancient Hebrew [[synagogue]], and [[Philo]], the ancient Jewish philosopher called it a "kiss of harmony", where, as Crawley explains, "the Word of God brings hostile things together in concord and the kiss of love."<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}} [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Saint Cyril]] also writes, "this kiss is the sign that our souls are united, and that we banish all remembrance of injury."<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}}

=== Kiss of peace ===
Nyrop notes that the [[kiss of peace]] was used as an expression of deep, spiritual devotion in the [[early Christian Church]]. Christ said, for instance, "Peace be with you, my peace I give you," and the members of Christ's Church gave each other peace symbolically through a kiss. [[St Paul]] repeatedly speaks of the "holy kiss," and, in his [[Epistle]] to the Romans, writes: "Salute one another with an holy kiss" and his first Epistle to the Thessalonians ([[1 Thessalonians]] 5:26), he says: "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|101}}

The kiss of peace was also used in [[secular]] festivities. During the [[Middle Ages]], for example, Nyrop points out that it was the custom to "seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a kiss." Even knights gave each other the kiss of peace before proceeding to the combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs. The holy kiss was also found in the ritual of the Church on solemn occasions, such as baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or obsequies. However, toward the end of the Middle Ages the kiss of peace disappears as the official token of reconciliation.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|109}}

=== Kiss of respect ===
[[File:Re-enactment at the Seashore (5851205620) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man kissing the ground after a long sea voyage (as part of a reenactment of the first landing of English settlers in Virginia in 1607)]]
The kiss of respect is of ancient origin, notes Nyrop. He writes that "from the remotest times we find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful—to the gods, their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors; out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon were greeted with kisses."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|114}}

He notes some examples, as "when the prophet [[Hosea]] laments over the idolatry of the children of [[Israel]], he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them" ({{bible verse|Hosea|13:2|HE}}). In classical times similar homage was often paid to the gods, and people were known to kiss the hands, knees, feet, and the mouths, of their idols. [[Cicero]] writes that the lips and beard of the famous statue of [[Hercules]] at [[Agrigentum]] were worn away by the kisses of devotees.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|115}}

People kissed the cross with the image of Jesus, and such kissing of the cross is always considered a holy act. In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that "as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed." Kissing the cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and the pictures and statues of saints—not only their pictures, "but even their relics are kissed," notes Nyrop. "They make both soul and body whole." There are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their health by kissing relics, he points out.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|121}}

The kiss of respect has also represented a mark of fealty, humility and reverence. Its use in ancient times was widespread, and Nyrop gives examples: "people threw themselves down on the ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally 'licked the dust,' as it is termed."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|124}} "Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe the kiss of respect. The Roman slaves kissed the hands of their masters; pupils and soldiers those of their teachers and captains respectively."<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|124}} People also kissed the earth for joy on returning to their native land after a lengthened absence, as when [[Agamemnon]] returned from the [[Trojan War]].

=== Kiss of friendship ===
The kiss is also commonly used in American and European culture as a salutation between friends or acquaintances. The friendly kiss until recent times usually occurred only between ladies, but today it is also common between men and women, especially if there is a great difference in age. According to Nyrop, up until the 20th century, "it seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of royal personages," although he notes that in former times the "friendly kiss was very common with us between man and man as well as between persons of opposite sexes." In guilds, for example, it was customary for the members to greet each other "with hearty [[handshake]]s and smacking kisses," and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed both their hosts and hostesses.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|142}}

== Cultural significance ==
In approximately 10% of the world population, kissing does not take place, for a variety of reasons, including that they find it dirty or because of superstitious reasons. For example, in parts of [[Sudan]] it is believed that the mouth is the portal to the soul, so they do not want to invite death or have their spirit taken.<ref name=demirjian /> Psychology professor [[Elaine Hatfield]] noted that "kissing was far from universal and even seen as improper by many societies."<ref name=India>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-india-kisses-are-on-rise-even-in-public.html?_r=0 "In India, Kisses Are on Rise, Even in Public"], ''New York Times'', Feb. 13, 2013</ref> Despite kissing being widespread, in some parts of the world it is still taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.

Donald Richie comments that in Japan, as in China, although kissing took place in erotic situations, in public "the kiss was invisible", and the "touching of the lips never became the culturally encoded action it has for so long been in Europe and America." The early [[Edison films|Edison film]], ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Widow Jones&nbsp;– the May Irwin-John Rice Kiss]]'' (1896), created a sensation when it was shown in Tokyo, and people crowded to view the enormity. Likewise, [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] sculpture ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' was not displayed in Japan until after the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Donald Richie, "The Japanese Kiss," in Donald Richie, ed., ''Walkman, Manga, and Society: Essays on Contemporary Japanese Culture'' (Tokyo: Kirihara shoten, 1989), 52–58.</ref> Also, in the 1900s, [[Manchu people|Manchu]] tribes along the [[Amur River]] regarded public kissing with revulsion.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shirokogorov | first=Sergeĭ Mikhaĭlovich | title=Social Organization of the Manchus: A Study of the Manchu Clan Organization | year=1924 | publisher=Royal Asiatic Society| page=i, 1–6, 122 }}</ref> In a similar situation in [[Chinese culture|Chinese tradition]], when Chinese men saw [[Western world|Western]] women kissing men in public, they thought the women were prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&q=chinese+kiss+in+public&pg=PA49 |title=A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

In modern [[Western culture]], kissing on the lips is commonly an expression of [[affection]]<ref name=zambianchronicle-kiss>{{cite news |last=James |first=Larry |url=http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/ |title=The Romantic Kiss |work=The Zambian Chronicle |date=4 March 2008 |access-date=29 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621143336/http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/<!--Bot retrieved archive--> |archive-date=21 June 2008}}</ref> or a warm greeting. When lips are pressed together for an extended period, usually accompanied with an [[hug|embrace]], it is an expression of romantic and sexual desire. The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their [[tongue]] into their mouth, is called [[French kiss]]ing. "[[Making out]]" is often an [[adolescent]]'s first experience of their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and games which involve kissing, such as [[Spin the Bottle]], facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.

In modern [[Eastern culture]], the etiquette vary depending on the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a baby on the cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.

=== Kissing in films ===
The first romantic kiss on screen was in American silent films in 1896, beginning with the film ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]''. The kiss lasted 18 seconds and caused many to rail against decadence in the new medium of silent film. Writer [[Louis Black]] writes that "it was the United States that brought kissing out of the Dark Ages."<ref name=Texas>''Texas Monthly'', Feb. 1980 p. 143</ref> However, it met with severe disapproval by defenders of public morality, especially in New York. One critic proclaimed that "it is absolutely disgusting. Such things call for police interference."<ref name=Texas />

[[File:Rock Hudson - Julie Andrews.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rock Hudson]] and [[Julie Andrews]] kissing in film ''[[Darling Lilli]]'' (1968)]]
Young moviegoers began emulating romantic stars on the screen, such as [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]], the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, traveling up her arm, and then kissing her on the back of her neck. Actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like [[Nazimova]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Vilma Bánky]] and [[Greta Garbo]], became screen idols as a result.

Eventually, the film industry began to adopt the dictates of the [[Production Code]] established in 1934, overseen by [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] and supported by the church{{Which|date=June 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the new code, "Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown."<ref name=Texas /> As a result, kissing scenes were shortened, with scenes cut away, leaving the imagination of the viewer to take over. Under the code, actors kissing had to keep their feet on the ground and had to be either standing or sitting.<ref name=Citron>Citron, Lana. ''A Compendium of Kisses'', Harlequin Publ. (2010) p. 177</ref>

The heyday of romantic kissing on the screen took place in the early sound era, during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWKOctKUVGQ Kissing scenes in the classic movies]</ref>{{rp|watch}} Body language began to be used to supplement romantic scenes, especially with the eyes, a talent that added to Greta Garbo's fame. Author [[Lana Citron]] writes that "men were perceived as the kissers and women the receivers. Should the roles ever be reversed, women were regarded as vamps . . ."<ref name=Citron /> According to Citron, [[Mae West]] and [[Anna May Wong]] were the only Hollywood actresses never to have been kissed on screen.<ref name=Citron /> Among the films rated for having the most romantic kisses are ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.<ref name=Citron />

Sociologist Eva Illouz notes that surveys taken in 1935 showed that "love was the most important theme represented in movies. Similar surveys during the 1930s found the 95% of films had romance as one of their plot lines, what film critics called "the romantic formula."<ref name=Illouz>Illouz, Eva. ''Consuming the Romantic Utopia'', Univ. of Calif. Press (1997) p. 31</ref>

In early Japanese films, kissing and sexual expression were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), but when the film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?" Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions and feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were "sneaky", claiming that "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too."<ref>Kyoko Hirano, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: The Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945–1952'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1992), pp 154–57, 162</ref>

In some Western cultures it is considered [[luck|good luck]] to kiss someone on [[Christmas]] or on [[New Year's Eve]], especially beneath a sprig of [[mistletoe]]. Newlyweds usually kiss at the end of a [[wedding]] ceremony.

Female friends and relations and close acquaintances commonly offer [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]] [[cheek kissing|kisses on the cheek]] as a [[greeting]] or [[wikt:farewell|farewell]].<ref name=nytimes-kiss>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/fashion/thursdaystyles/06kiss.html |title=Better Not Miss the Buss |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 April 2006 |access-date=29 August 2008 |first=Elizabeth |last=Olson}}</ref>
Where cheek kissing is used, in some countries a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an [[air kiss]] is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not.<ref name=UIO-kiss>{{cite web |last=Hahnsson |first=Marie Sophie |url=http://folk.uio.no/mariesha/webmag/cheekKissing.html |title=Cheek Kissing |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |access-date=29 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527101455/http://folk.uio.no/mariesha/webmag/cheekKissing.html |archive-date=27 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After a first [[dating|date]], it is common for the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.

A symbolic kiss is frequent in Western cultures. A kiss can be "blown" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term ''flying kiss'' is used in India to describe a blown kiss. In written correspondence a kiss has been represented by the letter "X" since at least 1763.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oxford English Dictionary – X |publisher=Oxford University press |year=1999 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288416 |access-date=1 February 2007}}</ref> A stage or screen kiss may be performed by actually kissing, or faked by using the thumbs as a barrier for the lips and turning so the audience is unable to fully see the act.

With the [[Andamanese peoples|Andamanese]], kissing was only used as a sign of affection towards children and had no sexual undertones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter9/text9.htm |title=Chapter: 9: A Traditional Society |publisher=Andaman.org |access-date=28 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315204048/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter9/text9.htm |archive-date=15 March 2010 }}</ref>

In traditional Islamic cultures, kissing is not permitted between a man and woman who are not married or closely related by blood or marriage. A [[Cheek kissing|kiss on the cheek]] is a very common form of greeting among members of the same sex in most Islamic countries, much like the south European pattern.

Kissing was a custom during the Biblical period mentioned in the {{bibleverse||Genesis|27:26|HE}}, when [[Isaac]] kissed his son [[Jacob]].<ref name=Tabor>Tabor, Rev. T.H. ''Manford's Magazine'' (1888)</ref>{{Rp|585}} The kiss is used in numerous other contexts in the Bible: the kiss of homage, in [[Esther]] 5:2; of subjection, in 1 [[Samuel]] 10:1; of reconciliation, in 2 Samuel 14:33; of valediction, in [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 1:14; of approbation, in [[Psalms]] 2:12; of humble gratitude, in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:38; of welcome, in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:7; of love and joy, in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:11. There are also spiritual kisses, as in [[Song of Songs]] 1:2; sensual kisses, as in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 7:13; and hypocritical kisses, as in 2 [[Samuel]] 15:5. It was customary to kiss the mouth in biblical times, and also the beard, which is still practiced in Arab culture. Kissing the hand is not biblical, according to Tabor.<ref name=Tabor /> The kiss of peace was an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] custom, and continues to be one of the rites in the [[Eucharist]]ic services of [[Roman Catholic]]s.<ref name=Tabor />

In the Roman Catholic Order of Mass, the bishop or priest celebrant bows and kisses the altar, reverencing it, upon arriving at the altar during the entrance procession before Mass and upon leaving at the recessional at the closing of Mass; if a deacon is assisting, he bows low before the altar but does not kiss it.

Among primitive cultures it was usual to throw kisses to the sun and to the moon, as well as to the images of the gods. Kissing the hand is first heard of among the Persians.<ref name=Tabor /> According to Tabor, the kiss of homage—the character of which is not indicated in the Bible—was probably upon the forehead, and was expressive of high respect.<ref name=Tabor />

* In Ancient Rome and some modern Pagan beliefs, worshipers, when passing the statue or image of a god or goddess, will kiss their hand and wave it towards the deity ([[adoration]]).
* The ''[[holy kiss]]'' or ''kiss of peace'' is a traditional part of most Christian liturgies, though often replaced with an embrace or handshake today in Western cultures.
* In the [[Gospels#Canonical gospels|gospels of Matthew and Mark]] (Luke and John omit this) [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrayed [[Jesus]] with a kiss: an instance of a kiss tainted with betrayal. This is the basis of the term "[[the kiss of Judas]]".
* [[Catholics]] will kiss [[rosary beads]] as a part of [[prayer]], or kiss their hand after making the [[sign of the cross]]. It is also common to kiss the wounds on a crucifix, or any other image of Christ's Passion.
** [[Pope John Paul II]] would kiss the ground on arrival in a new country.
** Visitors to the Pope traditionally kiss his foot.
** Catholics traditionally kiss the ring of a cardinal or bishop.
** Catholics traditionally kiss the hand of a priest.
* [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] Christians often kiss the icons around the church on entering; they will also kiss the cross and/or the priest's hand in certain other customs in the Church, such as confession or receiving a blessing.
* [[Hindus]] sometimes kiss the floor of a [[temple]].
* Local lore in [[Ireland]] suggests that kissing the [[Blarney Stone]] will bring ''[[eloquence|the gift of the gab]]''.
* [[Jews]] will kiss the Western wall of the Holy Temple in [[Jerusalem]], and other religious articles during [[prayer]] such as the [[Torah]], usually by touching their hand, [[Tallit|Tallis]], or [[Siddur]] (prayerbook) to the [[Torah]] and then kissing it. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] prohibits kissing members of the opposite sex, except for spouses and certain close relatives. See [[Negiah]].

Anthropologists have not reached a conclusion as to whether kissing is learned or a behavior from instinct.

=== Health benefits ===
Kissing stimulates the production of hormones responsible for a good mood: oxytocin, which releases the feeling of love and strengthens the bond with the partner, endorphins – hormones responsible for the feeling of happiness –, and dopamine, which stimulates the [[pleasure center]] in the brain.

Research indicates that contraction of [[HIV]] via kissing is extremely unlikely, although there was a documented case in 1997 of an HIV infection by kissing. Both the woman and infected man had [[Gingivitis|gum disease]], so transmission was through the man's blood, not through saliva.<ref>{{cite news |last=Altman |first=Lawrence K. |title=Case of H.I.V.
