'''Trouble''' is an American [[doom metal]] band from [[Aurora, Illinois]], formed in 1979. They are often considered one of the pioneers of doom metal, and have been referred to as one of the genre's "big four" alongside [[Candlemass (band)|Candlemass]], [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]] and [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=explore|id=style/d11956|pure_url=yes}} Doom Metal] [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=80887|title=Petition For Doom 'Big Four' Tour Circulating|website=Metalunderground.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idioteq.com/the-big-4-of-doom-metal-tour-in-the-works/|title="The Big 4 of Doom Metal" tour in the works? » IDIOTEQ.com|first=Karol|last=Kamiński|date=May 11, 2012|website=Idioteq.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://chaospin.com/best-doom-metal-bands-of-all-time/|title=The 10 Best Doom Metal Bands of All-Time|website=chaospin.com|date=May 28, 2021|access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref><ref name="houstonpress">{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/eric-wagner-lead-singer-of-doom-metal-legends-trouble-has-died-from-covid-19-11785165|title=Eric Wagner, Lead Singer Of Doom Metal Legends Trouble, Has Died From Covid-19|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|date=August 24, 2021|access-date=August 24, 2021}}</ref> The band created a distinct style, taking influences of the British heavy metal bands [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Judas Priest]],<ref name="Edling">Leif Edling, Trouble interview, ''Trouble Live In Stockholm'' DVD.</ref> and [[psychedelic rock]] of the 1970s.

Trouble's first two albums, ''[[Psalm 9 (album)|Psalm 9]]'' and ''[[The Skull (album)|The Skull]]'', are cited as landmarks of doom metal. To date, they have released eight studio albums. Although never officially disbanded, they went inactive after original singer [[Eric Wagner]] left in 1997. He rejoined in 2000 and left again eight years later; he was first replaced by Kory Clarke and then by current vocalist Kyle Thomas, who had also filled in for Wagner during his initial absence from Trouble. Wagner died in 2021.<ref name="houstonpress"/>

Core members include Wagner, guitarists Rick Wartell and [[Bruce Franklin (guitarist)|Bruce Franklin]], and drummer [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]]. Early lyrics had a spiritual nature; [[Metal Blade Records]] initially marketed Trouble as "white metal" (in contrast to the rising [[black metal]] movement) in the 1980s.<ref name="Trouble_Interview">{{cite web |url= http://metal-rules.com/interviews/trouble-jan2004.htm |title= Interview with Trouble|access-date=September 6, 2007 |author= Lahtonen, Luxi|website=Metal-rules.com}}</ref>

== Biography ==
=== Formation and Metal Blade years (1979–1988) ===
Trouble was formed in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist [[Bruce Franklin (guitarist)|Bruce Franklin]], vocalist [[Eric Wagner]], bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be confused with lead singer of English band [[The Stone Roses]]), and drummer [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]].<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=456/7}}</ref> Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which led Metal Blade to market the band as "white metal" as opposed to black metal.<ref name="Allmusic"/> "I was brought up [[Catholic church|Catholic]]", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of ''Psalm 9'' re-issue (2006), "but you have to remember, back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not get into that vibe." Wagner has implied that Metal Blade actually came up with the term in the first place, which the band rejected: "I think it was more like Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything [satanic metal] being called black metal, why not call us white metal, which is a bunch of crap."<ref>Popoff, Martin. Interview with Eric Wagner. Liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue 2006. Escapi Music.</ref>

[[File:Trouble - Jalometalli 2008 - 10.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruce Franklin at Jalometalli 2008]]
The band toured throughout the Midwest during the early 1980s. On February 5, 1983, the band recorded ''Trouble Live in Chicago''. Drummer [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]] mailed the cassette to Brian Slagel of Metal Blade Records and the band landed their first record deal. Trouble released their eponymous debut (later referred to as ''[[Psalm 9 (album)|Psalm 9]]'') with Metal Blade Records in 1984.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> ''[[The Skull (album)|The Skull]]'' followed in 1985,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and reflected singer Wagner's struggles with substance abuse, as well as growing turmoil within the group. This led to the replacement of bassist McAllister with Ron Holzner.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Drummer [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]] also departed.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>  Reports suggested that Olson had left the band to become a preacher,<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name="Supershine">{{cite web |url= http://www.battlehelm.com/interviews/Supershine.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214835/http://www.battlehelm.com/interviews/Supershine.html |archive-date= July 7, 2011 |title= Supershine |access-date= November 29, 2007 |author= Siva, Shan}}</ref> but he had actually decided to pursue studies at [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston, where he received his Bachelor of Music degree cum laude in Film Scoring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.battlehelm.com/interviews/retrograve.htm|title=Retro Grave Interview|date=January 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107123347/http://www.battlehelm.com/interviews/retrograve.htm|access-date=July 22, 2021|archive-date=January 7, 2009}}</ref> Dennis Lesh was drafted as his replacement for 1987's ''[[Run to the Light]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In comparison to earlier recordings, the critics thought ''Run to the Light'' was "disappointing".<ref name="Allmusic"/> [[Ted Kirkpatrick]] played drums during the ''Run to the Light'' tour before he went to form his own band, [[Tourniquet (band)|Tourniquet]] in 1989.

=== Rise to popularity and hiatus (1989–1996) ===
A three-year hiatus occurred before the band was snapped up by [[Rick Rubin]]'s Def American Records, for whom they recorded a second self-titled album (''[[Trouble (ST 1990 album)|Trouble]]'') in 1990 with Rubin producing.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> More experimental than previous efforts, the album (featuring new drummer [[Barry Stern]], formerly of [[Zoetrope (band)|Zoetrope]])<ref name="LarkinHR"/> expanded upon the group's tentative psychedelic notions within its traditional use of power chords.

The group embarked on a year-long tour before returning to the studio. In 1992, ''[[Manic Frustration]]'' was released,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> delving into Beatlesque psychedelia and featuring some of Trouble's most aggressive, energetic performances ever. But after the album failed to connect with a wider audience, the band was ultimately dropped by their record company, which was experiencing financial problems.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

The band issued ''[[Plastic Green Head]]'' through the [[Music for Nations]] label in 1995,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> with the return of founding drummer [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]].

[[File:Eric Wagner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eric Wagner]]

=== Reunion and ''Simple Mind Condition'' (1997–2007) ===
Even though Trouble had gone on an extended hiatus after Wagner's departure, rumors of an eventual re-formation persisted. From 1997 to 2000, Wagner was replaced by former [[Exhorder]] singer Kyle Thomas, who played four public gigs with Trouble.

On January 26, 2002, Wagner, Franklin, Wartell, Holzner and Olson performed a short set in Chicago where during their smoking rendition of Black Sabbaths' Children of The Grave with Scott Davidson sitting in on the drums, the P.A. gave out and left the crowd in a stunned uproar. Since that time, the band has played individual gigs throughout the Chicago area and headlined metal festivals in Europe and the U.S. while working on a new album.  A concert in Stockholm, Sweden in 2005 produced the live DVD "Trouble – Live in Stockholm" with members [[Eric Wagner]], Rick Wartell, [[Bruce Franklin (guitarist)|Bruce Franklin]], [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]], and Chuck Robinson.

In February 2004, [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the [[Foo Fighters]] released a tribute album that paid homage to his metal roots.  Entitled [[Probot]], the disc featured various vocalists, including Eric Wagner, who sang on the track "My Tortured Soul".  In the album's liner notes, Grohl wrote that buying ''[[Psalm 9 (album)|Psalm 9]]'' was like buying ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

Holzner left the band soon after, to be replaced by Chuck Robinson, who played on the band's newest studio album, ''[[Simple Mind Condition]]'', which was released in Europe on April 3, 2007, by Escapi Music.  The band toured internationally in support of its release,<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.newtrouble.com/ |title= Trouble.com |access-date= November 29, 2007 |archive-date= August 14, 2003 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20030814091753/http://www.newtrouble.com/ |url-status= dead }}</ref> but were not able to secure a U.S. release date for the album until over two years later.  An unplugged album was later released through the band's website and, more recently, Escapi Music.

=== New singers and ''The Distortion Field'' (2008–present) ===
[[File:Trouble - Jalometalli 2008 - 05.jpg|thumb|upright|Kory Clarke]]
In May 2008, it was announced that [[Eric Wagner]] has left the band and had been replaced by Kory Clarke of [[Warrior Soul]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/warrior-soul-s-kory-clarke-is-the-new-trouble-singer/ |title= Warrior Soul's Kory Clarke is the new Trouble singer |access-date= September 5, 2016 |year= 2008 |website=Blabbermouth.net }}</ref>  [[Jeff Olson (Musician)|Jeff Olson]] also announced his departure from the band in July 2008 to continue with his own band, [[Retro Grave]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/drummer-jeff-oly-olson-quits-trouble/ |title=Drummer Jeff 'Oly' Olson Quits Trouble |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=July 31, 2008 |access-date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> Olson's last show with Trouble was, coincidentally, at a rock club called, "The End" in Memphis, Tenn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RetroGraveMusic.com |title=Retro Grave – Welcome to Retro Grave |website=Retrogravemusic.com |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Olson was replaced by Wet Animal's Mark Lira for the band's upcoming U.S. East Coast tour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/trouble-recruits-wet-animal-drummer-for-upcoming-tour/ |title=TROUBLE Recruits WET ANIMAL Drummer For Upcoming Tour |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=August 7, 2008 |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>

In a September 2008 interview with Rock N Roll Experience, guitarist Rick Wartell mentioned that Trouble had written "eight or nine songs" for their next album, and would begin recording it after touring.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/trouble-recruits-wet-animal-drummer-for-upcoming-tour/ |title=TROUBLE Guitarist On New Singer KORY CLARKE And METALLICA's 'Death Magnetic' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 18, 2008 |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> When asked which direction is the new music going in, Wartell replied, "I know people have said this a million times and I know you've heard this a million times, but it's pretty fucking heavy, let's put it that way! The music end of it that Bruce [Franklin, guitar] and I are writing is getting heavier and heavier...it's getting heavier and then we want Kory to incorporate his style to what we are doing, that's basically all that we really want out of this."

On November 18, 2008, Trouble announced, via their website, that they were in the process of writing songs for an album that would likely be released in the summer of 2009. A live bootleg recording featuring the new line-up was released via the band's website in 2008, then worldwide by Escapi Music about one year later. On March 4, 2009, Trouble revealed on their website that the new album would tentatively be called ''The Dark Riff''. On September 9, 2010, the band announced that they are "getting ready for the studio now. [We] have been making preliminary recordings and working out things in order to bring the best possible Trouble release."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/trouble-preparing-to-enter-studio/ |title=TROUBLE Preparing To Enter Studio |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> Bruce Franklin later said in a 2009 interview that ''The Dark Riff'' would not be the title of the forthcoming album.
[[File:Kyle Thomas, current singer of Trouble performing with Trouble in Lombard, Illinois.jpg|thumb|upright|Kyle Thomas]]

In February 2012, Kory Clarke left Trouble.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/trouble-taps-former-exhorder-singer/ |title=Trouble Taps Former Exhorder Singer |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=February 7, 2012 |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Kyle Thomas, who was with the band from 1997 to 2000, took his place. Also in February 2012, two original members of Trouble — vocalist Eric Wagner and drummer Jeff Olson — joined forces with the band's longtime bassist Ron Holzner in a new heavy rock/doom metal act called [[The Skull (band)|The Skull]]. According to a statement on the band's Facebook page, "The Skull is here to do one thing... rock you with the sounds and spirit of Trouble — past, present, future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-trouble-bassist-on-the-skull-we-want-to-go-out-and-have-fun-and-play-the-old-songs/ |title=Former Trouble Bassist On The Skull: 'We Want To Go Out And Have Fun And Play The Old Songs' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=February 12, 2012 |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref> The Skull is planning a thirty-year celebration tour of Trouble's debut album, Psalm 9 in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-skull-featuring-former-trouble-members-performs-in-hollywood/ |title=The Skull Featuring Former Trouble Members Performs In Hollywood |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

On February 16, 2013, Jeff Olson announced that he would be playing some keyboard intros on the new album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=186353 |title=Original Trouble Drummer Jeff 'Oly' Olson To Play Keyboards On Band's Next Album |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=February 16, 2013 |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref> In May 2013, it was announced that the new album, ''The Distortion Field'', was scheduled to be released July 16 in North America and July 26 in Europe. This is the first release to feature Kyle Thomas, and was produced by [[Bill Metoyer]]. Shortly after its release, Rob Hultz of [[Solace (band)|Solace]] and [[Godspeed (band)|Godspeed]] joined the band as bassist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=190020 |title=Trouble To Release 'The Distortion Field' In July |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 16, 2013 |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

According to Wartell, the band has been working on new material since 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/trouble-working-on-new-material/ |title=Trouble Working On New Material |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=August 4, 2014 |access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> However, as of 2021, a new album has yet to surface.

== Music and image ==
Trouble's music lies with a traditional doom metal style, although their albums since 1990's [[Trouble (Trouble album)|Trouble]] showcase a more stoner-metal oriented style.  Band members have cited influences by the early heavy rock bands of the 1970s such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]], and Black Sabbath,<ref name="Supershine"/> Trouble have also incorporated elements of psychedelic rock to their style. Their use of slow tempos was notable at a time when [[NWOBHM]] and [[thrash metal]] bands were increasingly incorporating fast-picking and speed into their songwriting.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5703|pure_url=yes}} |title= Trouble |access-date= November 29, 2007 |author= Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]  }}</ref> While most slow songs by metal bands border into the area of ballads, all of the tracks on Trouble's second album [[The Skull (album)|The Skull]] are as heavy as they are slow, with a distinctive fuzzy distortion and melodic, integral (rather than superfluous or ostentatious) guitar solos. The band could best be described as combining the riffs and tempos of Black Sabbath with the twin guitar attack of [[Judas Priest]].

Eric Wagner's lyrics deal with different themes, but the early Trouble albums, such as their debut [[Psalm 9 (album)|Psalm 9]], are known for biblical references. Especially because such themes were relatively uncommon in mainstream metal music of the 1980s, Trouble were then often classified as [[Christian metal]]. Other songs deal with social issues; "Bastards Will Pay", for instance, criticises politicians as hypocritical. From ''[[Manic Frustration]]'' onwards, more lyrical references have been made to psychedelia, drugs, and hallucinations;<ref name="Supershine"/> "Hello Strawberry Skies" and "Mr. White" stand out as two examples. Corresponding with the increase in psychedelic lyrical themes, Trouble's overall sound has also had a noticeably stronger psychedelic component.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/manic-frustration-mw0000080017|title=Manic Frustration - Trouble &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Also, unlike other metal acts of the 1980s, Trouble's members dress in ripped jeans, tight T-shirts, wear round sunglasses and have [[Fringe (hair)|fringes]] and outfit accessories more characteristic of the hippie movement such as bandanas and knee patches.<ref>Edling, Leif. Trouble Interview on Live in Stockholm DVD. 2006.</ref>

== Reception ==
Problems with both the [[Metal Blade]] and [[Def American]] labels made it impossible for Trouble to achieve large commercial success.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Even though their music videos were aired on [[MTV]] in both the U.S. and Europe, ''Manic Frustration'' was the only album that sold close to 100,000 copies.<ref name="Lahtonen">{{cite web |url= http://metal-rules.com/interviews/trouble-jan2004.htm |title= Trouble |access-date= November 29, 2007 |author= Lahtonen, Luxi |year= 2002 |website=Metal-Rules.com}}</ref> However, Eduardo Rivadavia of [[AllMusic]] wrote that "their preservation efforts nevertheless rescued metal's original blueprint from disuse, and carved it in granite for subsequent exploration by each new generation of doom bands that followed."<ref name="Allmusic"/> It was said that Trouble took up where [[Black Sabbath]] had left off after their split with vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref name="Schlimm"/> ''Psalm 9'' and ''The Skull'' are often cited as the cornerstones of doom metal<ref>Christe 2002, chapter 20</ref> as well influencing other bands of the uprising metal movement during the mid-1980s. A famous story states that [[James Hetfield]] and [[Kirk Hammett]] of [[Metallica]] entered Trouble's stage after a concert, trying to figure out how their amplifiers were set to produce their unique sound.<ref name="Schlimm">{{cite web |url= http://www.trouble.de/|title= Trouble |access-date= November 29, 2007 |author= Schilmm, Patrick |year= 2002 |website= Trouble.de}}</ref>

The self-titled album gained "magnificent reviews in all the major heavy metal rags"<ref name="Allmusic"/> and the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] ''Manic Frustration'' was a "critically lauded, cult-raved heavy metal masterpiece".<ref name="Allmusic"/> The 1995's ''Plastic Green Head'' received good reviews and "the album's songs also exuded a palpable sense of wary acceptance."<ref name="Allmusic"/> However, Trouble was never thought of as a completely unique group; some critiques dismissed the band as a "poor man's Black Sabbath".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/index.php?id=5698 |title= Trouble – Psalm 9 |access-date= November 29, 2007 |author= Gao |date= May 18, 2006 |website=Noise.fi |language= fi }}</ref> Nevertheless, Trouble's influence on the metal movement is unquestioned,<ref name="Blabbermouth_Psalm_9"/> with groups such as [[Corrosion of Conformity]],<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.invisibleoranges.com/interview-mike-dean/ |title= COC|access-date= August 27, 2021 |author= Invisible Oranges Staff |date= January 23, 2018 |website=invisibleoranges.com}}</ref> [[Down (band)|Down]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=130910 |title= PHA|access-date= January 23, 2018 |author= Cowan, Darren |date= January 18, 2017 |website=www.metalunderground.com/}}</ref>[[Electric Wizard]],<ref name="Kerrang!">{{cite web |url= https://www.kerrang.com/features/trouble-eric-wagner-doom-metal-finest-voices/ |title= Kerrang! |access-date= August 26, 2021 |author= Ruskell, Nick |year= 2021 |website=Kerrang.com}}</ref>[[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]],<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{cite web |url= https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cathedral-frontman-lee-dorrian-pays-tribute-to-troubles-eric-wagner/|title= Lee Dorrian |access-date= August 27, 2021 |year= 2021 |website= blabbermouth.com}}</ref>[[Crowbar (American band)|Crowbar]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=810134885676366&set=a.773724142650774|title=Trouble|publisher=Facebook|date=November 15, 2014 |access-date=August 27, 2021}}</ref>[[Orange Goblin]],<ref name="Kerrang!"/>[[At The Gates]],<ref name="Kerrang!"/>[[Confessor (band)|Confessor]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016003716/http://www.earache.com/WickedWorld/interview/confessor/confessor.html|title=Confessor|publisher=earache |author= Tobin, Dan |date= October 16, 2006 |website=earache.com/}}</ref>[[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2014/05/14/inside-the-shredder-s-studio-11-eric-cutler-of-autopsy/|title= Eric Cutler Interview|publisher=decibel magazine |author= Norton, Justin |date= May 14, 2014 |website=decibelmagazine.com/}}</ref>[[Candlemass (band)|Candlemass]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2019/02/21/five-heavy-albums-that-changed-my-life-with-leif-edling-of-candlemass/|title= Leif Edling Interview|publisher=decibel magazine |author= Pratt, Greg |date= February 21, 2019 |website=decibelmagazine.com/}}</ref> and [[Bolt Thrower]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uglybass.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/jo-bench-bolt-thrower-collected-interview-snippets/|title= Jo Bench Interview|publisher=uglybass |website=uglybass.wordpress.com/}}</ref> citing them as an influence.
