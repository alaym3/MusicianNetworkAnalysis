===Wartime career===
[[File:Vera Lynn Visits a Munitions Factory, UK, 1941 P551.jpg|thumb|right|Lynn sings at a munitions factory in wartime Britain, early 1941.]]
Lynn's wartime contribution began when she would sing to people who were using [[London Underground|London's tube station]] platforms as air raid shelters. She would drive there in her [[Austin 7]] car.<ref name="Vera Guardian">{{cite news |title=She's turning 100, and there's still never been a dame quite like Vera Lynn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/12/vera-lynn-100-forces-sweetheart |access-date=13 May 2020 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Between 1937 and 1940, she also toured with the aristocrat of British dance bands, [[Ambrose (bandleader)|Bert Ambrose]]<ref>''Some Sunny Day'', p. 83</ref> as part of the Ambrose Octet; the group appeared in broadcasts for the BBC and for Radio Luxembourg.

During the [[Phoney War]], the ''[[Daily Express]]'' asked British servicemen to name their favourite musical performers: Vera Lynn came out on top and as a result became known as "the Forces' Sweetheart".<ref name="musicianguide1"/> In July 1940, Lynn made her first appearance as a "fully fledged solo act" in [[Coventry]].<ref name=":0" />

Her continuing popularity was ensured by the success of her radio programme "Sincerely Yours", which began airing in 1941, with messages to British troops serving abroad.<ref name="Dame Vera Lynn obituary"/><ref name="Seidenberg, Sellar, Jones p. 132" /> However, in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] in February 1942 the programme was taken off air for 18 months out of fear that the sentimental nature of her songs would undermine the "virile" nature of British soldiers. Instead, "more traditionally martial classical music" was promoted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Todman |first1=Daniel |title=Britain's War |date=2020 |location=London |isbn=978-0-241-24999-4 |pages=116–7|volume=2}}</ref>

Lynn and her quartet continued to perform songs most requested by the soldiers.

===Recording career===
Vera Lynn made her solo recording debut with the song "The General's Fast Asleep" on 3 October 1935, accompanied by the Rhythm Rascals (a pseudonym for [[Jay Wilbur]]'s orchestra). The 9" [[78 rpm]] single was issued on the Crown Records label,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/periodicals/201009/2101665071.html |title=British Crown Records – IAJRC Journal |website=Faqs.org |access-date=22 February 2011}}</ref> which went on to release a total of 8 singles recorded by Vera Lynn and Charles Smart on organ. Early recordings include "[[I'm in the Mood for Love]]"<ref>{{citation|last=Vera Lynn|title=Vera Lynn_I'm in the Mood for Love|url=http://archive.org/details/VeraLynn_imInTheMoodForLove|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> and "[[Red Sails in the Sunset (song)|Red Sails in the Sunset]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHGyAMn_eu4| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/BHGyAMn_eu4?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHGyAMn_eu4| archive-date=2021-09-24|title=Red Sails in the Sunset|year=1935|via=YouTube|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref>

In 1938, the Decca label took over control of the British Crown label and the UK-based Rex label; they had also issued early singles from Lynn in 1937, including "Harbour Lights". In late September 1939, Vera Lynn first recorded a song that continues to be associated with her: "We'll Meet Again" was originally recorded with Arthur Young on the Novachord.<ref name=Baade8/>

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s the [[Decca Records|Decca]] label issued all of Lynn's records, including several recorded with [[Mantovani]] and His Orchestra in 1942, and with [[Robert Farnon]] from the late 1940s. These were only available as 78 rpm singles, which contained only two songs as an A and a [[B-side]]. In the mid-1950s, Decca issued several [[Extended play|EP]] singles, which comprised between two and four recordings per side, such as ''Vera Lynn's Party Sing Song'' from 1954. Lynn was the first British artist to have a number one in U.S. charts, achieved with "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart", which stayed at the top for nine weeks in 1952. Singles were now issued on two formats: the known 78 rpm 10" shellac discs, and the recently introduced 45 rpm 7" vinyl single. In the late 1950s, Lynn recorded four albums at Decca, the first; ''Vera Lynn Concert'' remains her only live recording ever issued on vinyl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decca records general catalogue 1949 (London GB)|url=https://issuu.com/78rpm.club/docs/decca_records_-_general_catalogue_1|access-date=18 June 2020|via=Issuu|publisher=Decca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vera Lynn with Woolf Phillips & His Orchestra* And The Clubmen – Vera Lynn Concert|url=https://www.discogs.com/Vera-Lynn-with-Woolf-Phillips-His-Orchestra-And-The-Clubmen-Vera-Lynn-Concert/master/476329|access-date=18 June 2020|publisher=discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=EP Discography for Decca Records – Australia|url=http://www.globaldogproductions.info/d/decca-eps-oz.html|access-date=18 June 2020|website=Global Dog Productions}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vera Lynn 78 RPM – Discography – UK – 78 RPM|url=http://www.45worlds.com/78rpm/artist/vera-lynn|access-date=18 June 2020|website=45 Worlds}}</ref><ref name=applemusic/>

In 1960, after more than 20 years at Decca Records, Lynn signed to the US based [[MGM Records]]. In the UK, her recordings were distributed by the [[His Master's Voice]] label, later [[EMI Records]]. Several albums and stand-alone singles were recorded with [[Geoff Love]] & His Orchestra. [[Norman Newell]] also took over as Lynn's producer in this period and remained with her until her 1976 album ''Christmas with Vera Lynn''. Recording at EMI Records up until 1977, Lynn released thirteen albums with material as diverse as traditional [[hymns]], pop and [[Country music|country]] songs, as well as re-recording many of her known songs from the 1940s for the albums ''Hits of the Blitz'' (1962), ''More Hits of the Blitz'' and ''Vera Lynn Remembers – The World at War'' (1974). In the 1980s, two albums of contemporary pop songs were recorded at the [[Pye Records]] label, both including covers of songs previously recorded by artists such as [[ABBA]] and [[Barry Manilow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Southall|first=Brian|title=Abbey Road: The Story of the World's Most Famous Recording Studios|date=2011|publisher=Omnibus|others=Vince, Peter; Rouse, Allan|isbn=978-0-85712-676-4|location=London|oclc=830001182}}</ref><ref name=applemusic>{{cite web|title=Vera Lynn on Apple Music|url=https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vera-lynn/14647552|access-date=18 June 2020|website=Apple Music}}</ref><ref name=BBCObit>{{cite news|date=18 June 2020|title=Obituary: Dame Vera Lynn, a symbol of resilience and hope|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-13118290|access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Barry Manilow Covered Songs and Artists|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/covers/barry-manilow-63d6be13.html|access-date=18 June 2020|website=Setlist}}</ref><ref name=discography/>

In 1982, Lynn released the stand-alone single "[[I Love This Land]]", written by [[André Previn]], to mark the end of the [[Falklands War]].
