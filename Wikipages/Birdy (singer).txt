Birdy did tours of America and Australia in 2013.

Speaking about ''Beautiful Lies'', Birdy later said this album was what she was most proud of. She added:
"The album is about growing up and not accepting change. It's about not really wanting to grow up; it's about lying to yourself. I'd missed a lot of growing up with my family so it's about that. It's also inspired by 'Memories of a Geisha' so it has an Asian feel to it and it's about feeling a much stronger person."<ref name="dailyecho"/>

Birdy undertook extensive touring after the release of ''Beautiful Lies'', including a tour of the United States and an Asian tour from Japan to Singapore. By this time, her band had grown from four to five, with an almost completely new lineup. The band members were: Charlotte Hatherley (guitar), Joel Grainger (violin), Richard Evans (bass), Jay Sikora (drums) and Hazel Mills (keyboards). She has said she found Asia like another planet, "such a different world." The audiences were very reserved and quiet, there would be a huge gap after each song, then they would start clapping; it made her wonder if they liked her. She said they don't really clap that much, then after the show they were going crazy and screaming. She found it "really strange."<ref name="dailyecho">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/music/interviews/14815834.Hampshire__39_s_Birdy_talks_exclusively_to_the_Daily_Echo_ahead_of_Southampton_date/|title=Hampshire's Birdy talks exclusively to the Daily Echo ahead of Southampton date|website=Daily Echo}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, on 22 March 2016, Birdy explained how she had always had ideas but was never confident enough to assert them. With 'Beautiful Lies', she felt that she was a lot stronger and everything felt better. Birdy stated that where she had gone wrong with her second album had been that she had compromised too much, allowing others to influence her too much. In contrast, with 'Beautiful Lies' she had been 'really bossy'. In conclusion, she added that she loves writing for film and would love to do more of it; it was a 'really natural' progression for her work.<ref name=interviewmagazine />

Birdy was featured on the cover of ''Wonderland'' magazine in the Autumn 2016 issue, with an accompanying shoot and interview. Speaking to the magazine, Birdy explained that her mother was a concert pianist and a lot of her family were very musical. Her mother would play classical music and her father would play "poppier records" like [[Tracy Chapman]] and [[The Beatles]]. It was a real mix of genres, she told the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/09/27/antidote-civilisation/|title=The Antidote To Civilisation - Wonderland Magazine|date=27 September 2016}}</ref>

Birdy performed two songs at the BFI Luminous fundraising gala on 3 October 2017. Interviewed at the function, she said she was writing material for her new album, but it was still in the early stages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAEZvz1OhiY|title=Birdy interview on new album and supporting young talent at BFI Luminous fundraising gala|date=3 October 2017|work=The Upcoming|via=Youtube}}</ref>

In December 2017, Variety.com reported that [[Warner/Chappell Music]], the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, had signed Birdy to a global publishing deal. Mike Smith, Warner/Chappell UK managing director, said that Birdy was an incredible talent, there was a lot more to come from her and he looked forward to working with her in the years ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/birdy-signs-publishing-deal-warner-chappell-1202642039/|title=British Singer Birdy Signs Publishing Deal With Warner/Chappell|author=Variety Staff|date=15 December 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.warnerchappell.com/artist-details/90 warnerchappell.com]</ref>

After taking a break from music, Birdy released a new single, "Open Your Heart" on 4 September 2020. This was soon after accompanied with the announcement of a new EP, ''Piano Sketches'', to be released on 6 November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 September 2020|title=Birdy Announces New EP "Piano Sketches", Releases New Song "Open Your Heart"|url=https://www.pmstudio.com/music/music.html?page=20200905-12017|url-status=live|website=pm studio world wide music news}}</ref> It features four tracks, primarily piano based.
