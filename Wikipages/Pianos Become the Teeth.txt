'''Pianos Become the Teeth''' are an American band from [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], formed in 2006. Their early musical style has been inspired by [[post-rock]] and early [[screamo]] acts, and they are a part of a post-hardcore music movement also represented by [[Touché Amoré]], [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]], [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]], and [[Make Do and Mend]]. The group reissued their well-received debut album ''Old Pride'' in 2010 through [[Topshelf Records]].

== History ==
=== Early years and ''Old Pride'' (2006–2010) ===
Pianos Become The Teeth formed in late 2006 in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Their first release, the ''Saltwater'' EP, was released in 2008 through Doomed by Dawn Records.<ref name="exclaim1"/> In early 2009 Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with Ezra Joyce. Their contributed track, "Creatures of Habit," was a darker song similar to the material that was recorded for their follow-up first full-length.<ref name="rmp1"/>

Pianos Become The Teeth released their debut album, ''Old Pride'' in 2009 through Blackjaw Records.<ref name="punknews2"/> They subsequently signed to Topshelf Recordings in October 2009,<ref name="punknews1"/> and reissued their debut album in January 2010 through digital media outlets and on CD.<ref name="punknews2"/> The Topshelf version of ''Old Pride'' saw a much wider release that was met with much acclaim. Andrew Kelham of ''[[Rock Sound]]'' gave the album a nine out of ten, and wrote that "With a why-just-write-a-song-when-you-can-write-an-epic attitude, the eight songs on their second record are distinguished, articulate and immersive as their juddering post-hardcore clashes with moments of [[Explosions in the Sky]] rivalling tenderness and [[Mogwai]]-esque grandeur."<ref name="rocksound1"/> Writing for ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Brian Shultz gave the album four out of five stars and said that the group has, "quietly refined their craft over the last few years into an incredibly cathartic and sporadically chilling mode. Their screamo peers--past ''or'' present--should be more than envious."<ref name="altpress1"/> ''Old Pride'' was released on vinyl in June 2010 as a joint release through Topshelf Records and Mayfly Records.<ref name="punknews3"/> In support of the album, Pianos Become The Teeth toured the US with [[Touché Amoré]] and [[Lemuria (American band)|Lemuria]].<ref name="punknews4"/>

In October 2010, Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with [[the Saddest Landscape]] through Just Say No! Records.<ref name="absolutepunk1"/>

=== ''The Lack Long After'' (2011–2013) ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2014}}
In January 2011, the Pianos Become The Teeth had begun writing a new album, and described the new songs as being "darker and heavier" than previous material, and that they would not become "''Old Pride'' part 2," alluding to new musical direction.<ref name="staircase"/> Recording began on August 1, 2011 at Developing Nations Studio with producer Kevin Bernsten.<ref name="punknews5"/> In October and November, the group supported [[Title Fight]] on their headlining US tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/title_fight_announce_headlining_tour_dates_with_pianos_become_the_teeth_and|title=Title Fight announce headlining tour dates with Pianos Become The Teeth and Single Mothers|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|author=Colwell, Matthew |date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref> Topshelf Records released the LP ''The Lack Long After'', a concept album about vocalist Kyle Durfey's father's death from multiple sclerosis,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/midnight-sun-blog/bs-ae-music-story-0106-20111230-story.html|title=On new album, Pianos Become the Teeth deals with death|last=Sun|first=Wesley Case, The Baltimore|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}</ref> on November 1, 2011, with a supporting tour with Touché Amoré and Seahaven following shortly after.<ref name="altpress2"/>

Pianos Become the Teeth, in 2013, also released a split EP with friends Touché Amoré. Pianos' song "Hiding" was noted for its stylistic change from The Lack Long After which hinted toward their change which became apparent on Keep You released in late 2014.

=== Signing to Epitaph and ''Keep You'' (2014) ===
Pianos Become the Teeth signed with [[Epitaph Records]] in 2014, and released their third studio album, ''Keep You'', on October 28 of that year. The [[Will Yip]]-produced album is noted for its stylistic departure from earlier releases, featuring a less aggressive sound and no screamed vocals from Kyle Durfey.<ref name="noisey1"/><ref name="altpress3"/> The band promoted the album with an online stream of "Repine" in August 2014.<ref name="noisey1"/>

=== ''Wait for Love'' (2018) ===
On November 8, 2017 Pianos Become the Teeth announced that their new album would release on February 16, 2018. They also released the first single and music video off the album, "Charisma".

The band subsequently released music videos for "Bitter Red"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2018/01/10/pianos-become-the-teeth-new-single-bitter-red-wait-for-love-listen|title=Pianos Become The Teeth share 'Bitter Red'|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> and "Love On Repeat"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/pianos-become-the-teeth-complete-video-trilogy-with-love-on-repeat/|title=Pianos Become the Teeth complete video trilogy with "Love On Repeat"|website=BrooklynVegan|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> ahead of the album release. After the album's release, Pianos Become The Teeth announced an August 2018 UK co-headline tour with [[Foxing (band)|Foxing]] to celebrate the release and coincide with their appearance at ArcTanGent festival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/arctangent-festival-2018-first-15-acts-announced-and-so-i-watch-you-from-afar-a8191621.html|title=ArcTanGent announce the first 15 bands for 2018 edition|date=2018-02-02|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Musical style and lyrics ==
Pianos Become The Teeth is a prominent band in "The Wave," a new generation of [[post-hardcore]] bands that share similar ideologies.<ref name="rvamag1"/> Other figures in The Wave include [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]], [[Touché Amoré]], [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]] and [[Make Do and Mend]].<ref name="sept2010 crossfire"/> The bands in this movement perform with "emotionally-centered lyrical content, dual musical emphasis on both melody and distorted intensity."<ref name="rvamag1"/>

Musically, Pianos Become The Teeth write songs influenced by early [[screamo]] acts such as [[Envy (band)|Envy]], [[City of Caterpillar]] and [[Funeral Diner]], and also [[post-rock]] bands like [[This Will Destroy You]].<ref name="latenight1"/> In an interview with Staircase Thoughts, the band described being labeled as screamo as "flattering in some respects," but ultimately didn't want to be pigeonholed as a "screamo band."<ref name="staircase"/>

Vocalist Kyle Durfey writes very personal lyrics that often discuss events in his life, or about dwelling on the future and growing up.<ref name="hearwax1"/> Specifically on their album ''Old Pride'', Durfey wrote about, "how you have this 'young fire' when you're younger and you have to have an 'old pride' to feel right about your life."<ref name="latenight1"/> The track "Cripples Can't Shiver" outlines Durfey's father, and how his struggles with [[multiple sclerosis]] impacted his life.<ref name="latenight1"/> In an interview with Hearwax, Kyle Durfey commented on writing dark lyrics, stating "I feel like most of us and most bands we are into tend to write about darker things. It's hard to write when you're happy. This doesn't mean we aren't happy as people."<ref name="hearwax1"/>
