==Early life==

She chose her stage name due to her love of the colour pink, as a homage to [[Princess Peach]], using the title during her time performing as a [[stripper]]. An abbreviation for porcelain, she began using the suffix PRC on [[TikTok]] because to type out the full word would be too long of a name.<ref>{{cite web

In an interview with ''Echo Magazine'' in May 2020, Peach said: "I've been interested in music for as long as I could talk, really. I've always sang and wrote songs and even have songs written from when I was like 8 years old."<ref name="EMMay20">{{cite web |url=http://readechoonline.com/exclusive-interview-with-peach/ |title=Exclusive: Interview with Peach |work=Echo Magazine |date=11 May 2020 |access-date=22 March 2021}}</ref>

In her early career, Peach acted in music videos, most notably appearing as the love interest in Ambleside's music video for "Wash Away" in 2016. 

Other popular songs include Colourblind and Heavy.

I was a bit down when I was writing one day. My ex, Josh, kept calling me over and over again. He called all of the time, because he was trying to get back with me. I thought I had blocked him though. Since he didn't stop bothering me, I wrote the song about him. It's a true story, but it's meant to be fun and colourful."<ref name="TMNFeb21"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/tiktok-star-peach-prc-releases-debut-single-josh-2889171/ |title=TikTok star Peach PRC releases debut {{sic|nolink=y}} single "Josh" |work=[[NME Australia]] |date=25 February 2021 |access-date=2 April 2021 |author=Brereton, Greta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303192118/https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/tiktok-star-peach-prc-releases-debut-single-josh-2889171/ |archive-date=3 March 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> The song debuted at number 38 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]].<ref name="ARIA"/> On 25 June 2021, PRC released the single "Symptomatic".<ref name="NME-20210625">{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/check-out-tiktok-star-peach-prcs-catchy-new-single-symptomatic-2977761 |title=Check out TikTok star Peach PRC's catchy new single 'Symptomatic' |work=[[NME Australia]] |date=25 June 2021 |access-date=25 June 2021 |author=Brereton, Greta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625020534/https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/check-out-tiktok-star-peach-prcs-catchy-new-single-symptomatic-2977761/ |archive-date=25 June 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> On 22 October 2021, PRC released a surprise single" I've Been Bad, Santa" with a [[B-side]]  "Christmas Kinda Sucks".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doria |first1=Matt |title=Peach PRC gets in the Christmas spirit with buzzy new single â€˜Iâ€™ve Been Bad, Santaâ€™ |url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/peach-prc-gets-in-the-christmas-spirit-with-buzzy-new-single-ive-been-bad-santa-3077546 |website=[[NME Australia]] |access-date=4 November 2021}}</ref> On 5 November 2021, PRC released the single "Heavy".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belling |first1=Alasdair |title=Listen To â€˜Heavyâ€™, The Emotional New Single By Peach PRC |url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/listen-to-heavy-the-emotional-new-single-by-peach-prc/ |website=https://musicfeeds.com.au |publisher=Music Feeds |access-date=6 November 2021}}</ref>
