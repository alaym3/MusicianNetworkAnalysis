'''Peter Joseph Andrew Hammill''' (born 5 November 1948) is an English singer-songwriter. He is a founder member of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Van der Graaf Generator]]. Best known as a [[singer/songwriter]], he also plays guitar and piano and acts as a record producer for his own recordings and occasionally for other artists. In 2012, he was recognised with the Visionary award at the first [[Prog (magazine)|Progressive Music Awards]].<ref name="masters">{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19492677 | title= Genesis honoured at Progressive Music awards | first=Tim | last=Masters | work=[[BBC News]] | date=6 September 2012 | access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Hammill was born in [[Ealing]], west London, and moved with his family to [[Derby]] when he was 12.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick|last=Hasted |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/peter-hammill-heart-attack-music-44837.html |title=Peter Hammill: Heart attack music |work=[[The Independent]] |date=26 June 2004 |access-date=31 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415181029/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/peter-hammill-heart-attack-music-44837.html |archive-date=15 April 2015 |quote=The Jesuits' blandishments were balanced by the equally fierce pull of pop, playing nightly in the clubs of 1960s Derby, where Hammill's family moved when he was 12.}}</ref> He attended [[Beaumont College]] and [[Manchester University]], where he studied [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] in Science.<ref>Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: ''Van der Graaf Generator – The Book'', p. 5.

===Early career===
Hammill's solo career has coexisted with Van der Graaf Generator's activities. The band was offered a contract by [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, that only Hammill signed. When Van der Graaf Generator broke up in 1969 he wanted to record his first solo album. In the summer of 1969 Hammill had a residency at [[Lyceum Theatre, London|The Lyceum]] and played weekly solo concerts there.<ref>Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: ''Van der Graaf Generator – The Book'', p. 37. Phil and Jim publishers, 2005.</ref> Eventually the intended solo album was released under the Van der Graaf Generator banner as their first album (''[[The Aerosol Grey Machine]]'').<ref>Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: ''Van der Graaf Generator – The Book'', pp. 32–44, 58. Phil and Jim publishers, 2005.</ref> Hammill's first real solo album was ''[[Fool's Mate (album)|Fool's Mate]]'' (1971), containing songs from the early (1967/68) Van der Graaf Generator days.

===Van der Graaf Generator and after===
When Van der Graaf Generator broke up again in August 1972, Hammill resumed his solo career. Songs that were intended for Van der Graaf Generator now ended up on his solo albums, notably "Black Room" (on ''[[Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night]]'') and "A Louse Is Not a Home" (on ''[[The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage]]''). For the majority of both his solo songs and the band's songs he is credited as the sole songwriter, and some of his solo albums feature all the members of Van der Graaf Generator. In general, Hammill's solo work is thematically concerned with more personal matters, while the band's songs deal with broader themes.

''[[Nadir's Big Chance]]'' (1975) was a major change from the preceding ''[[In Camera (Peter Hammill album)|In Camera]]''. Whilst ''In Camera'' is characterised by extremely intense and complex songs and even has some [[musique concrète]] on it, ''Nadir's Big Chance'' contains anticipations of [[punk rock]]. In a 1977 radio interview, [[John Lydon]] of the [[Sex Pistols]] played two tracks from the album and expressed his admiration for Hammill in glowing terms: "Peter Hammill's great. A true original. I've just liked him for years. If you listen to him, his solo albums, I'm damn sure [[David Bowie|Bowie]] copied a lot out of that geezer. The credit he deserves, just has not been given to him. I love all his stuff".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/REVIEWS%202/capital77.html#int|title=Fodderstompf - Press Archives - Johnny Rotten Capital Radio, 1977|access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref>

''[[Over (album)|Over]]'' (1977) contains very personal songs about the break-up of a long-term relationship.

Hammill's first solo album after the 1978 break-up of Van der Graaf was ''[[The Future Now]]''. He provided vocals on three tracks for Robert Fripp's solo debut ''[[Exposure (Robert Fripp album)|Exposure]]'', released in June 1979.

With the next solo albums, ''[[PH7 (Peter Hammill album)|pH7]]'' and ''[[A Black Box]]'', the sound became more compact, more new wave. On those albums, Hammill played the drums himself. What followed was the "K group". In later years Hammill would sometimes refer to the band as a "beat group".<ref>Album notes by Peter Hammill for ''The Margin +'', expanded reissue of CD ''The Margin'' (2001). Fie!</ref> The K group consisted of Hammill himself on guitars and piano, with [[John Ellis (guitarist)|John Ellis]] on lead guitar, [[Nic Potter]] on bass, and [[Guy Evans]] on drums and percussion. This group recorded the albums ''[[Enter K]]'' and ''[[Patience (Peter Hammill album)|Patience]]''.

===Live performances===
Live concerts by Peter Hammill are characterised by a degree of unpredictability, in terms of the songs played, the arrangements and the players involved. Hammill generally does not undertake live tours to promote albums. Whenever he plays with a certain predominant line-up, almost always there will also be concerts interspersed with different permutations of musicians, so the word "tour" is not always very applicable.

From September 1981 until September 1985 Hammill played with the K group, playing raw, energetic, new-wave rock. A live recording of a number of these concerts was released as ''[[The Margin (album)|The Margin]]''. In March and April 1983, Hammill with John Ellis was the support act for [[Marillion]] on their UK tour in support of their debut album ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.couchnoise.com/years/1983.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103101313/http://www.couchnoise.com/years/1983.htm |archive-date=3 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morain.de/marillion_setlists_-_1983.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516182418/http://www.morain.de/marillion_setlists_-_1983.html |archive-date=16 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

From February until October 1990 he played with Nic Potter on bass and Stuart Gordon on violin. A live recording of these shows was released as ''[[Room Temperature (album)|Room Temperature]]''. From April 1993 until August 1996 they were joined by [[Manny Elias]] on drums. A live recording of these shows was released as ''There Goes The Daylight''. From October 1994 until August 1996 Hammill played with [[David Jackson (rock musician)|David Jackson]] on flutes and saxophones, Stuart Gordon on violin and Manny Elias on drums (this line-up is sometimes informally referred to as the Peter Hammill Quartet<ref name="8/March 1995">{{cite web|url=http://www.sofasound.com/nlmar95.htm |title=Learning Curves |work=Sofa Sound Newsletter |date=March 1995 |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref>).

From January 1998 until November 2006 Hammill played with just Stuart Gordon on violin. Of these shows the live recording ''Veracious'' was released.

From 1969 on, Hammill has also performed solo concerts, with just guitar and keyboards.

===Fie! Records===
Hammill's early records, like the Van der Graaf Generator albums, were released on [[Charisma Records]]. He parted company with them after ''pH7'' (1979), and then released albums on a number of small labels. ''A Black Box'' came out on S-Type, a label run by Hammill and his manager [[Gail Colson]]. ''Enter K'' and ''Patience'' appeared on Naive, ''[[Skin (1986 album)|Skin]]'' and ''The Margin'' on Foundry and ''[[In A Foreign Town]]'', ''[[Out of Water]]'' and ''Room Temperature'' on [[Enigma Records]]. In 1992 he formed his own label, [[Fie! Records]], on which all his albums since ''[[Fireships (album)|Fireships]]'' have been released. The label's logo is the Greek letter phi (Φ), a pun on PH-I. Ever since the 1970s he has also had his own home recording studio, called Sofa Sound. His website was later named after the studio.

===Later years===
{{Update-section|date=July 2015}}
In 1991, Hammill released the long-awaited opera ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (Hammill opera)|The Fall of the House of Usher]]''. He had written the music and Van der Graaf Generator co-founder [[Judge Smith]] the libretto, and the two of them had been working on it since 1973. In 1999 he released a reworked version, ''The Fall Of The House Of Usher (Deconstructed & Rebuilt)''.

Hammill survived a [[heart attack]] in December 2003,<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick|last=Hasted |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/peter-hammill-heart-attack-music-44837.html |title=Peter Hammill: Heart attack music |work=[[The Independent]] |date=26 June 2004 |access-date=31 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415181029/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/peter-hammill-heart-attack-music-44837.html |archive-date=15 April 2015 |quote=When Peter Hammill collapsed in the street with a sudden heart attack last year, it didn't make the papers.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sofasound.com/nlmar95.htm |title=25/Dec 2003 |work=Sofa Sound Newsletter |date=December 2003 |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref> less than 48 hours<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sofasound.com/nlmar04.htm |title=26/Mar 2004 |work=Sofa Sound Newsletter |date=March 2004 |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref> after having finished the recording of ''[[Incoherence (Peter Hammill album)|Incoherence]]''. He was awarded the Italian 'Tenco Prize' for songwriting at the end of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sofasound.com/nlmar05.htm |title=27/Mar 2005 |work=Sofa Sound Newsletter |date=March 2005 |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2005, Hammill announced the reformation of Van der Graaf Generator. In 2004 they had recorded a new album, ''[[Present (Van der Graaf Generator album)|Present]]'', which was released in April 2005, and from May until November 2005 played a series of well received concerts. Between 2005 and 2007 Hammill oversaw the remastering of almost all of his pre-Fie! releases, and also carried out similar work on his more recent catalogue. The last of the Charisma remasters was released in September 2007.
Hammill's solo career did not end because of the Van der Graaf Generator reunion. He released an album ''[[Singularity (Peter Hammill album)|Singularity]]'' in December 2006.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} It was the first solo album he completed after his heart attack, and for a large part it deals with matters of life and (sudden) death. In 2007 several gigs by Van der Graaf Generator as a trio (minus David Jackson) took place in Britain and Europe; their new album ''[[Trisector]]'' was released in March 2008. In the summer and autumn of 2008, Hammill did a tour of solo dates in the U.S. and Canada which included a performance at the progressive rock festival [[NEARfest]]. He also played his only ever professional "parlour gig" at a private residence in [[Holland, Michigan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In the summer of 2009 Van der Graaf Generator toured the U.S. and Canada, which occasioned Hammill's triumphant return to [[NEARfest]]. ''[[Thin Air (album)|Thin Air]]'' was released on 8 June 2009. This was followed in October 2011 by a live double CD ''Pno, Gtr, Vox'', recorded at performances in Japan and the UK in 2010. An extended 7-CD box set, ''Pno, Gtr, Vox Box'' was released in a limited edition of 2000 in February 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

''[[Consequences (Peter Hammill album)|Consequences]]'', a solo studio album was released in May 2012. Again Hammill played all the instruments. The lyrics deal with conflicted characters in various scenarios. ''[[Other World (album)|Other World]]'', a collaborative album with guitarist [[Gary Lucas]], was released in February 2014. The album features Hammill's vocals, Hammill and Lucas on guitars, and Hammill's sound treatments, and is a mixture of conventional songs with extended avant-garde instrumentals. In 2019 ''In Amazonia'' was released, a collaboration album with progressive rock group Isildurs Bane. Early 2021, Hammill announced the release of his first covers album, later this year. ''[[In Translation (Peter Hammill album)|In Translation]]'' features songs by [[Astor Piazzolla]], [[Leiber and Stoller]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], and [[Gabriel Fauré]] among others.

==Music==
Musically, Hammill's work ranges from short simple [[riff]]-based songs to highly complex lengthy pieces. Mainly because of the diversity of his compositions there is much debate amongst his admirers whether Hammill is to be considered a part of the progressive rock scene. In many interviews, however, Hammill has stated that he does not want to be put in the progressive rock music label, or any music label at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96712715|title=Peter Hammill: Prog Rock's Unsung Hero|date=6 November 2008|work=[[NPR]]|access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sofasound.com/nldec08.htm |title=34/December 2008 |work=Sofa Sound Newsletter |date=December 2008 |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref> Despite this, he has received recognition as a visionary artist from the progressive music world.<ref name="masters"/>

Hammill's output is prolific. Many different styles of music appear in his work, among them artful complexity (for instance ''Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night''), [[avant garde]] electronic experiments (''[[Loops and Reels]]'', ''Unsung''), opera (''The Fall of the House of Usher''), solo keyboard accompaniment (''[[And Close As This]]''), solo guitar accompaniment (''[[Clutch (Peter Hammill album)|Clutch]]''), improvisation (''[[Spur of the Moment (album)|Spur of the Moment]]''), film music (''Sonix''), band recordings (''[[Enter K]]''), and slow, melancholic balladry (''[[None of the Above (Peter Hammill album)|None of the Above]]'').{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Hammill exerted significant influences on [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Over the years he collaborated with musicians and song-writers such as [[Le Orme]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Ayuo]], [[Herbert Grönemeyer]], [[Judge Smith]], [[The Stranglers]], [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], [[Moondog]], [[Premiata Forneria Marconi]], [[Tim Bowness]], [[Jakko Jakszyk]] and [[The Amorphous Androgynous]].

==Voice==
Hammill's voice is a very distinctive element of his music. He sings in an emotional, often even dramatic way. As a former [[Jesuit]] chorister, his delivery is usually [[Received Pronunciation]] British English — notable exceptions are his [[Afrikaner]] accent on "A Motor-bike in Afrika" and his [[Cockney#Cockney speech|Cockney]] accent on "Polaroid" — and ranges in tone from peacefully celestial to screaming rants (which are nevertheless highly controlled). Singing in registers from [[baritone]] to high [[falsetto]], he growls, croons, shrieks and shouts in ways that have drawn comparison with the guitar playing of [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref>Album notes for ''Sometimes God Smiles – The Young Person's Guide To Discipline'', compilation CD (1998). Discipline Global Mobile.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/deadhead/780/int_hammill.html |title=Peter Hammill May 16th, 1999 at Sandweiler, Luxembourg |website=fortunecity.com |date=19 August 1999 |access-date=18 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513173137/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/deadhead/780/int_hammill.html |archive-date=13 May 2008 }}</ref>

==Lyrics==
Hammill's lyrics are another distinctive feature of his work. He has visited a number of recurring themes including love and human relationships, ageing and death, human folly, self-awareness and introspection, politics, and religion. His lyrics often include scientific, literary or historical references. For example, the Norse names mentioned in the song "Viking" on ''Fool's Mate'' (co-written with Judge Smith) are characters in the Icelandic [[Saga of Eric the Red]].

The science fiction themes of Van der Graaf Generator's lyrics are mostly absent in his later work, but there still are many science references, especially to physics (for instance in the song "Patient"). In 1974 Hammill published a book, ''Killers, Angels, Refugees'' (Charisma Books, London), a collection of lyrics, poems and short stories. This was later reissued by Hammill himself (Sofa Sound, Bath) and was followed by a sequel ''Mirrors, Dreams, Miracles'' (1982).

In 2000 Dagmar Klein published ''Shouting down the passage of time: The Spaces & Times of Peter Hammill'', an analysis and interpretation of Hammill's lyrics along the lines of his dealings with "Space", "Time" and "Journeys".<ref>Dagmar Klein: Shouting down the passage of time: The Spaces & Times of Peter Hammill. Libri Books on Demand 2000. {{ISBN|3-8311-0881-1}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Hammill is fluent in Italian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBvmabgsKfw|title=Incontro con PETER HAMMILL|access-date= 3 March 2017}}</ref> He has been married since 1978 to Hilary, who is credited with taking the picture for the cover of ''[[In a Foreign Town]]''. They have three children, Holly, Beatrice and Phoebe. Holly and Beatrice Hammill sing soprano vocals on one track of ''[[Everyone You Hold]]'' and on two tracks of ''None of the Above''. Holly Hammill wrote the song "Eyebrows" (on ''Unsung'') and co-wrote "Personality" (on ''Everyone You Hold'').
