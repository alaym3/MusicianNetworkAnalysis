The '''ocelot''' (''Leopardus pardalis'') is a medium-sized spotted [[Felidae|wild cat]] that reaches {{cvt|40–50|cm|1}} at the shoulders and weighs between {{cvt|8|and|15.5|kg|1}}. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized. It is native to the [[southwestern United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and to the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Trinidad]] and [[Margarita Island|Margarita]]. It prefers areas close to water sources with dense vegetation cover and high prey availability.

Typically active during [[twilight]] and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]]s, [[opossum]]s, and [[lagomorph]]s. Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a [[Litter (zoology)|litter]] of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own [[home range]]s.

The ocelot is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], [[hunting]], and [[traffic]] accidents. Populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the [[Aztec Civilisation|Aztec]] and [[Incan civilization|Incan]] civilizations; it has occasionally been kept as a [[pet]].

== Etymology ==
The name "ocelot" comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{lang|nci|ōcēlōtl}} ({{IPA-nah|oːˈseːloːt͡ɬ|pron}}), which generally refers to the [[jaguar]], rather than the ocelot.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =ocelot, ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=F. |last=Karttunen |year=1983 |author-link=Frances Karttunen |title=An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=176}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Lockhart |author-link=James Lockhart (historian) |year=2001 |title=Nahuatl as Written: Lessons in Older Written Nahuatl, with Copious Examples and Texts |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=228}}</ref> Another possible origin for the name is the Latin {{lang|la|ocellatus}} ("having little eyes" or "marked with eye-like spots"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat.<ref name="Sunquist">{{cite book |last1=Sunquist |first1=M. |last2=Sunquist |first2=F. |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, US |isbn=978-0-226-77999-7 |pages=120–129 |chapter=Ocelot ''Leopardus pardalis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF8nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120}}</ref>

=== Subspecies ===
In 1919, Allen reviewed the specimens described until 1914, placed them into the genus ''Leopardus'' and recognized nine [[subspecies]] as [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]] [[Taxon|taxa]] based on the colors and spot patterns of skins.<ref name=Allen1919 /> In 1941, Pocock reviewed dozens of ocelot skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum and regrouped them to nine different subspecies, also based on their colors and spots.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pocock, R.

*''L. p. pardalis'' has a greyish fur. Its range extends from Texas and Arizona to Costa Rica.
*''L. p. mitis'' has a more yellowish fur and is larger than ''pardalis''. It occurs in South America as far south as northern Argentina.

=== Phylogeny ===
Results of a [[phylogenetic]] study indicate that the ''Leopardus'' lineage [[Genetic divergence|genetically diverged]] from the Felidae around 8 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|mya]]). The ocelot is estimated to have diverged from the [[margay]] (''Leopardus wieldii'') between 2.41 and 1.01 mya. The relationships of the ocelot within the Felidae is considered as follows:<ref name=Johnson2006>{{cite journal |last1= Johnson, W. E. |last2= Eizirik, E. |last3=Pecon-Slattery, J. |last4=Murphy, W.

The largest member of its genus,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Leopardus_pardalis/|title=Leopardus pardalis (ocelot)|first=Jessi|last=Kittel|website=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref> the ocelot is a medium-sized cat with a head-and-body length of between {{cvt|55|and|100|cm|1}} and a {{cvt|30|to|45|cm|1}} long tail. It typically reaches {{cvt|40–50|cm|1}} at the shoulder.<ref name=mammal /> The weight of females ranges between {{cvt|7|and|12|kg}} and of males between {{cvt|7|and|15.5|kg|1}}.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Nowak>{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=R.

The ocelot's fur is extensively marked with solid black markings on a creamy, tawny, yellowish, reddish gray or gray background color. The spots on the head and limbs are small, but markings on the back, cheeks, and flanks are open or closed bands and stripes. A few dark stripes run straight from the back of the neck up to the tip of the tail. Its neck and undersides are white, and the insides of the legs are marked with a few horizontal streaks. Its round ears are marked with a bright white spot.<ref name = Sunquist /> Its fur is short, about {{cvt|0.8|cm|1}} long on the belly, but with about {{cvt|1|cm|1}} long guard hairs on the back.<ref name=mammal /> The body has a notably strong odor.<ref name=caldwell />
Each ocelot has a unique color pattern, which can be used to identify individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Camarena-Ibarrola |first1=A. |last2=Figueroa |first2=K. |last3=Tejeda |first3=H. |last4=Valero |first4=L. |name-list-style=amp |title=Ocelot identification through spots |journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications |date=2019 |volume=78 |issue=18 |pages=26239–26262 |doi=10.1007/s11042-019-07837-1 |s2cid=174803096}}</ref>

The ocelot can be easily confused with the [[margay]] (''Leopardus wiedii'') and the [[oncilla]] (''L. tigrinus''), though the ocelot is noticeably larger and heavier with a shorter tail. Though all three have [[Rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] on their coats, the ocelot typically has a more blotched pattern; the oncilla has dark spots on its underbelly unlike the other two. Other differences lie in the facial markings, appearance of the tail and fur characteristics.<ref name = Sunquist /><ref name="Bowers">{{cite book |last1=Bowers |first1=N. |last2=Bowers |first2=R. |last3=Kaufman |first3=K. |name-list-style=amp |title=Kaufman Field Guide to Mammals of North America |year=2007 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-618-95188-8 |chapter=Ocelot ''Leopardus pardalis'' |page=140 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfRgcZIOizEC&pg=PA140}}</ref> The ocelot is similar in size to a [[bobcat]] (''Lynx rufus''), though larger individuals have occasionally been recorded.<ref name=Moreno2006>{{cite journal  |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=808–816 |year=2006 |title=Competitive release in diets of ocelot (''Leopardus pardalis'') and puma (''Puma concolor'') after jaguar (''Panthera onca'') decline |last1=Moreno |first1=R.

[[File:Pantanal - Jaguatirica.webm|thumb|thumbtime=0:00|Two ocelots, mother and daughter, in a wooded area of the [[Pantanal]] wetlands; at night, they encounter fewer humans on this farm.]]
The ocelot ranges from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina, up to an elevation of {{cvt|3000|m}}.<ref name=iucn /> In the United States, it is found in [[Texas]] and [[Arizona]], and is [[extirpated]] from [[Louisiana]] and [[Arkansas]].<ref>Kitchener, A. 1991. The natural history of the wild cats. Comstock Publishing Associates, Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca. xxi + 280 pp.</ref>
It inhabits tropical forests, [[thorn forest]]s, [[mangrove swamps]] and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=Sunquist /> A 2019 study in the Brazilian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] showed that it prefers habitats with good availability of prey and water, and tends to avoid other predators.

== Ecology and behavior ==
[[File:Ocelot 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ocelots rest on trees during the day]]
The ocelot is usually solitary and active mainly during twilight and at night. [[Radio collar]]ed individuals in the [[Cocha Cashu Biological Station]] in Peru rested during the day and became active earliest in the late afternoon; they moved between 3.2 and 17 hours until dawn and then returned to their dens.<ref name=Emmons>{{cite journal |last1=Emmons|first1=L. H.|title=A field study of ocelots ''Felis pardalis'' in Peru |journal= Revue d'Écologie |year=1988 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=133–157 |url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/55319/LATERREETLAVIE_1988_43_2_133.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref>

During the daytime, it rests on trees, in dens below large trees or other cool, sheltered sites on the ground. It is agile in climbing and leaping, and escapes predators by jumping on trees. It is also an efficient swimmer. It scent-marks its [[territory (animal)|territory]] by spraying urine. The territories of males are {{cvt|3.5–46|km2|1}} large, while those of females cover {{cvt|0.8–15|km2|1}}. Territories of females rarely overlap, whereas the territory of a male includes those of two to three females. Social interaction between sexes is minimal, though a few adults have been observed together even in non-mating periods, and some juveniles interact with their parents.<ref name=Sunquist /> Data from [[camera trap]]ping studies confirm that several ocelot individuals deposit scat in one or several communal sites, called [[Animal latrine|latrines]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Moreno |first1=R. |last2=Giacalone |first2=J. |name-list-style=amp |date=2006 |title=Ecological data obtained from latrine use by ocelots (''Leopardus pardalis'') on Barro Colorado Island, Panamá |journal=Tecnociencia |language=es |volume=8 |pages=7–21 |url=http://up-rid.up.ac.pa/791/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rodgers, T.

=== Hunting and diet ===
[[File:OCELOTE PRIMER PLANO.jpg|thumb|The ocelot is a carnivore and primarily active during twilight and at night]]
Ocelots have been observed to follow [[scent trail]]s to acquire prey. They walk slowly at a speed of about {{cvt|0.3|km/h|1}} searching for prey.<ref name=Emmons /> Alternatively, an ocelot may wait for prey for 30 to 60 minutes at a certain site, and move to another walking at {{cvt|0.8–1.4|km/h|1}} if unsuccessful. An ocelot typically prefers hunting in areas with vegetation cover, avoiding open areas, especially on moonlit nights, so as not to be seen by the prey. As a carnivore, it preys on small terrestrial mammals such as rodents, lagomorphs, [[armadillo]]s, [[opossum]]s, and also fish, insects, reptiles and small birds. It usually feeds on the kill immediately, but removes bird feathers before. It typically preys on animals that weigh less than {{cvt|1|kg}}, but rarely targets large ungulates such as deer and sheep, and [[peccaries]]. An ocelot requires {{cvt|600–800|g}} of food every day to satisfy its energy requirements.<ref name=Sunquist />

===Reproduction and life cycle===
[[File:Ocelo baby 1.jpg|thumb|right|An ocelot kitten]]

Ocelots can mate any time during the year. The peak mating season varies geographically; in Argentina and Paraguay peaks have been observed in autumn, and in Mexico and Texas in autumn and winter. [[Estrus]] lasts four to five days, and recurs every 25 days in a non-pregnant female.<ref name=Nowak /> A study in southern Brazil showed that sperm production in ocelots, margays and oncillas peaks in summer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morais|first1=R.N.|last2=Mucciolo|first2=R.G.|last3=Gomes|first3=M.L.F.|last4=Lacerda |first4=O. |last5=Moraes |first5=W.|last6=Moreira|first6=N.|last7=Graham|first7=L.H.|last8=Swanson |first8=W.F. |last9=Brown |first9=J.L. |title=Seasonal analysis of semen characteristics, serum testosterone and fecal androgens in the ocelot (''Leopardus pardalis''), margay (''L. wiedii'') and tigrina (''L. tigrinus'') |journal=Theriogenology |year=2002 |volume=57 |issue=8|pages=2027–2041|doi=10.1016/S0093-691X(02)00707-0 |pmid=12066863}}</ref> Captive ocelots spend more time together when mating; both scent-mark extensively and eat less during this time.<ref name=mammal /> Breeding ocelots in captivity is often difficult.<ref>{{cite news |title=Zoo celebrates its first ever ocelot birth |url=https://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/biopark/news/zoo-celebrates-its-first-ever-ocelot-birth |access-date=24 December 2019 |work=City of Albuquerque |date=26 November 2019}}</ref>

== Threats ==
[[File:Taxidermy of Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis).jpg|thumb|The ocelot is threatened by hunting for its skins]]
Throughout its range, the ocelot is threatened by [[habitat loss|loss]] and fragmentation of habitat.<ref name=iucn /> In Texas, the fertile land that supports dense cover and constitutes the optimum habitat for the ocelot is being lost to agriculture.

Another threat has been the international pet trade; this typically involves capturing ocelot kittens by killing their mothers; these cats are then sold to tourists. Though it is banned in several countries, pet trade survives; in some areas of Central and South America ocelots are still sold in a few local markets.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Graham, K. |year=2017 |title=International Intent and Domestic Application of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): The Case of the Ocelot (''Leopardus pardalis'') |journal= Journal of International Wildlife Law & Policy |volume=20 |issue=3–4 |pages=253–294 |doi=10.1080/13880292.2017.1403797 |s2cid=89746431 }}</ref>

The ocelot is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] because of its wide distribution in the Americas.

=== In captivity ===
The [[American Zoo and Aquarium Association]] established a [[Species Survival Plan]] for the ocelot populations in Brazil. In 2006, the captive population in North American zoos consisted of 16 ocelots representing six founders and their offspring. Some litters were produced using [[artificial insemination]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Swanson, W.F. |year=2006 |title=Application of assisted reproduction for population management in felids: the potential and reality for conservation of small cats |journal=Theriogenology |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.03.024 |pmid=16650889 |url=http://planet.uwc.ac.za/NISL/Gwen's%20Files/Conservation%20Biology/Chapters/Info%20to%20Use/Chapter7/assistreprodfelidsSwanson.pdf}}</ref>

Ocelots have been associated with humans since the time of the [[Aztec Civilisation|Aztec]] and [[Incan civilization|Incan]] civilizations, who depicted ocelots in their art and mythology. Representations of ocelots appear in every artistic medium, from [[Moche culture|Moche]] ceramics to murals, architectural details, and landscape features. Ocelot bones were made into thin, pointed instruments to pierce ears and limbs for [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]]. Several figurines depicting ocelots and similar felids are known. In her 1904 work ''A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans'', archaeologist [[Zelia Nuttall]] described a statue depicting an ocelot or another felid excavated in Mexico City and its relation to the Aztec deity [[Tezcatlipoca]]. She argued that the sculpture depicted an ocelot, writing,<ref name = nutall>{{cite book |last1=Nuttall |first1=Z. |author1-link = Zelia Nuttall |title=A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans |date=1904 |publisher=[[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=[https://archive.org/details/apenitentialrit00nuttgoog/page/n14 10], 18, 21; 23–26 |url = https://archive.org/details/apenitentialrit00nuttgoog |series = Archaeological and Ethnological Papers of the Peabody Museum |oclc = 2991502}}</ref>

{{Quote|"According to the well-known myth, Tezcatlipoca, when cast down from heaven by [[Quetzalcoatl]], "fell into the water where he transformed himself into an ocelot" and arose to kill certain giants.}}

[[File:Salvador Dali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Salvador Dalí]] with his pet ocelot Babou]]
Moreover, she described a photograph of a seated person to corroborate her claim:<ref name = nutall />
{{Quote|At the back of his head, above his left hand, the head of an ocelot is visible, whose skin hangs behind his back, the tail ending below his knee. Besides this the personage wears leggings made of the spotted ocelot skin and a rattlesnake girdle from which hang two conventionalized hearts. It is interesting to find that in a note written beneath its photograph the late Senor Islas de Bustamante, independently identified the above figure as a representation of "Ocelotl-Tezcatlipoca" or Tlatoca-ocelot, lit. the Lord Ocelot ... and described as wearing "the beard of the mask of Tezcatlipoca".}}

Like many other felids, occasionally ocelots are kept as pets. They might demand a lot of attention from their owners and have a tendency to chew on or suck on objects, such as fabric and the fingers of their owners; this can lead them to accidentally ingest objects such as tennis balls. Agile and playful, pet ocelots can be troublesome to keep due to their habit of leaping around and potentially damaging objects; ocelots may unintentionally injure their owners with bites. Nevertheless, carefully raised ocelots can be highly affectionate.<ref name="pewa">{{cite web |last1=Stinner |first1=M. |title=Care Sheet – Ocelot |url=http://www.phoenixexotics.org/caresheet/ocelot |publisher=Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association |access-date=24 December 2019}}</ref>
Painter [[Salvador Dalí]] kept a pet ocelot named Babou that was seen with him at many places he visited, including a voyage aboard [[SS France (1961)|SS ''France'']]. When one of the diners at a New York restaurant was alarmed by his ocelot, Dali told her that it was a common domestic [[cat]] that he had "painted over in an [[op art]] design".<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Burca |first1=J. |title=Salvador Dalí at Home |date=2018 |publisher=White Lion Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-0-7112-3943-2 |page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gZxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA113}}</ref><ref name = am>{{cite web |last1=Woodward |first1=D. |title=Salvador Dalí's ocelot |url=https://www.anothermag.com/design-living/2472/salvador-dalis-ocelot |website=[[Another Magazine]] |access-date=20 December 2019 |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=11 surreal facts about Salvador Dalí |date=2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/surreal-facts-salvador-dali/ |access-date=20 December 2019 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=McNamee |first1=T. |title=The Man who Changed the Way we Eat: Craig Claiborne and the American Food Renaissance |date=2013 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4516-9844-2 |page=142 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVFEiN4Re7kC&pg=PA142}}</ref> Opera singer [[Lily Pons]] and musician [[Gram Parsons]] are also known to have kept ocelots.<ref name = am /><ref>{{cite news |author=Twomey, B. |year=2015 |title=Met opera's Lily Pons leaves pet at Bronx Zoo |newspaper=[[Bronx Times-Reporter]] p. 48}}</ref>
