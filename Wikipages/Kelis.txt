'''Kelis Rogers''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|iː|s}};<ref>She can be heard singing her name in the song "[[Blindfold Me]]"</ref> born August 21, 1979) is an American singer, songwriter, and chef. At age 14, Kelis was admitted to [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/kelis-17133874|title=Kelis - Biography|website=Biography.com|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> where she learned to play the saxophone and won a spot in the Girls Choir of Harlem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004091/Kelis.html|title=Kelis Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> After she graduated from high school in 1997, Kelis took on a variety of jobs before landing a backup vocal slot on an album track called "Fairytalez", released by the American hip hop group [[Gravediggaz]]. She then began working with music producers, [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]], known as [[The Neptunes]], which ultimately resulted in her being signed to [[Virgin Records]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/kelis|title=Kelis {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=January 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wearemitu.com/entertainment/milkshake-chef-kelis-facts/|title=Here Is A Little Bit About Kelis And Her Life Since Divorcing Nas And Living Her Best Life|last=danielli|date=February 27, 2019|website=Wearemitu.com|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

Kelis released her debut studio album ''[[Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' with [[Virgin Records]] on December 7, 1999. Inspired by jazz and disco music from the 1970s, the album was a critical and international success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/best-songs-from-kelis-kaleidoscope-album/|title=Five Best Songs From Kelis' 'Kaleidoscope' Album|last=Preezy|website=The Boombox|language=en|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> It spawned three singles: "[[Caught Out There]]", "[[Good Stuff (Kelis song)|Good Stuff]]", and "[[Get Along With You]]".

In 2003, Kelis released her third studio album ''[[Tasty (Kelis album)|Tasty]]''. The album produced the singles "[[Milkshake (song)|Milkshake]]", "[[Trick Me]]", "[[Millionaire (Kelis song)|Millionaire]]", and "[[In Public]]". The album earned the singer commercial prominence. ''[[Kelis Was Here]]'' (2006), her fourth album, was the subject of further label disputes, and she took a hiatus from music after its release, during which she trained at [[Le Cordon Bleu]] culinary school. She later signed with [[will.i.am Music Group|will.i.am]] and began recording her fifth album. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Flesh Tone]]'', was released on May 14, 2010. The album spawned four singles, including "[[Acapella (Kelis song)|Acapella]]" and "[[4th of July (Fireworks)]]", which were successful on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart and the [[UK Dance Chart|UK Dance Singles Chart]]. Kelis' [[neo soul]]-inspired sixth studio album ''[[Food (Kelis album)|Food]]'' (2014) became her fourth top-ten album in the UK and her second top-ten entry on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where it charted at number 6. Produced entirely by Kelis and [[Dave Sitek|David Andrew Sitek]], it was praised for its cohesive sound and introspective lyrical content.<ref name="rollingstone">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/food-109715/|title=Food|last1=Weingarten|first1=Christopher R.|date=April 22, 2014|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The album spawned three singles: "[[Jerk Ribs]]", "[[Rumble (Kelis song)|Rumble]]" and "Friday Fish Fry".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/jerk-ribs-ep/id821695087 |title=Jerk Ribs – EP by Kelis |website=[[iTunes Store]] (US) |access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/rumble-ep/id836016714 |title=Rumble – EP by Kelis |website=iTunes Store (Ireland) |access-date=June 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726225052/https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/rumble-ep/id836016714 |archive-date=July 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/friday-fish-fry-ep/id886752279 |title=Friday Fish Fry – EP by Kelis |website=iTunes Store (US) |access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kelis Rogers was born and raised in the [[Frederick Douglass Houses]] on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. Her first name is a [[portmanteau]] of her father's name, Kenneth (1944–2000) and her mother's name, Eveliss. Her father Kenneth was an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[jazz]] musician and  [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[minister of religion|minister]] and was formerly a professor at [[Wesleyan University]].<!-- what years? --><ref name="guardian">{{cite web |last=Pool |first=Hannah |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/01/urbanmusic.questiontime |title=Question time: Kelis |work=The Guardian  |date=February 1, 2007 |access-date=March 5, 2007}}</ref> Her mother Eveliss is a [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]]-[[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] fashion designer who inspired Kelis to pursue her singing career. She has three sisters, Kelis being the third-born of the four girls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/kelis |title=Kelis |publisher=[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]]. [[MTV Networks Europe]] |access-date=February 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904003131/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/kelis |archive-date=September 4, 2011  }}</ref>

As a child, Kelis sang in church [[choir]]s and played violin, piano, and saxophone while attending [[Manhattan Country School]], a private school. At the age of 13, Kelis shaved off all of her hair. In an interview with [[Charlotte Roche]], Kelis says she was kicked out of her parents' house at the age of sixteen for bad behavior, stating that she would sometimes clash with her mother,<ref name="guardian"/> but continued her education at the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts]], where she formed the R&B trio BLU (Black Ladies United). Kelis was also a bartender and a sales associate at a clothing store before graduating high school. Afterwards, a friend introduced Kelis to [[The Neptunes]] ([[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]]); they formed a strong bond, and with their support she landed a record deal with [[Virgin Records]].

==Career==

===1998–2002: ''Kaleidoscope'' and ''Wanderland''===
Kelis began recording her debut album ''[[Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' in mid-1998 and was finished within a year. Produced by [[The Neptunes]] and released by Virgin Records in 1999, the album peaked at number 144 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and reached the top five on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/305667/kelis/chart|title=Kelis|work=billboard.com}}</ref> As of 2006, the album has sold 249,000 copies, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Caulfield | first = Keith | title = Ask Billboard | work = Billboard | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date = November 2, 2006 | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56764/ask-billboard | access-date =June 4, 2008}}</ref> Its lead and most notable single, "[[Caught Out There]]", became a top ten [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] hit and peaked at number 54 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=Billboard/> During this time, Kelis featured on [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s U.S. top 40 single, "[[Got Your Money]]".

The album performed better in Europe, where "Caught out There" was a moderate hit in most European countries except the United Kingdom, where the song saw massive success, peaking at number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A second single, "[[Good Stuff (Kelis song)|Good Stuff]]" (featuring [[Pusha T|Terrar]] of [[Clipse]]), reached number 19; the third, "[[Get Along with You]]", was less successful, reaching number 51.<ref name=officialcharts>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/8721/KELIS/|title=KELIS|work=officialcharts.com}}</ref> The [[British Phonographic Industry]] certified ''Kaleidoscope'' gold for sales of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom,<ref name="bpi-kaleidoscope">{{cite web| title = KELIS, KALEIDOSCOPE, Gold | work = [[British Phonographic Industry]] | date = March 2, 2001 | url = http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=29467 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072654/https://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=29467 | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 3, 2018 | access-date =June 4, 2008}}</ref> where it reached number 43 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

In 2001, Kelis won the [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]] for International Breakthrough Act and the [[NME Awards|''NME'' Award]] for Best R&B/Soul Act before joining [[Moby]] and [[U2]] on their [[Area Festival|Area:One]] and [[Elevation Tour|Elevation]] tours, respectively. Kelis and the Neptunes' output at this time was heralded as foreshadowing an innovation in [[contemporary R&B]], but she later said, "I was never an R&B artist. People coined me one but that's because, especially if you're in the States, if you're black and you sing, then you're R&B".<ref name=":0" /> Her colorful style in both clothing and hair received considerable attention.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Dirshe |first1=Siraad |title=Happy Birthday, Kelis!

Kelis's second album ''[[Wanderland]]'' was released in 2001 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America but did not receive a North American release. According to Kelis, her U.S. record company at the time, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], had laid off those that worked on ''Kaleidoscope''; their replacements did not understand or believe in ''Wanderland''. Eventually Kelis was dropped from Virgin around the time of the album's European release.<ref name=selftitled>{{cite web|url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/2014/04/21/interview-kelis-explains-how-she-spent-17-years-being-consistently-inconsistent|title=INTERVIEW: Kelis On...

In 2002, Kelis recorded "So Be It" for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s [[Fela Kuti]] tribute CD, ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'', from which all proceeds were donated to AIDS awareness charities. The same year she had a top 20 US club hit with a remix of "Young, Fresh 'n' New", produced by [[Timo Maas]], who subsequently featured Kelis on his single, "Help Me".<ref name=Billboard/><ref name=officialcharts/>

===2003–2005: ''Tasty''===
In 2003, Kelis achieved a second top ten hit in the UK as a featured artist on [[Richard X]]'s "[[Finest Dreams]]",<ref name=officialcharts/> a reworking of [[the S.O.S. Band]]'s 1986 single, "The Finest". She found mainstream success in the U.S. later that year with her [[Hot Dance Club Play]] number one, ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top three single "[[Milkshake (song)|Milkshake]]"; this helped to propel her third album ''[[Tasty (Kelis album)|Tasty]]'' to gold status in the U.S., where it peaked at number 27 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and has sold 533,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.<ref name=Billboard/><ref name="riaa"/><ref name="billboard-oct07">{{Cite news|first=Hillary|last=Crosley|title=Report: Kelis Splits With Jive|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047589/report-kelis-splits-with-jive|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=October 29, 2007|access-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref>

Although the Neptunes contributed several tracks to ''Tasty'' &mdash; the album was released by their label [[Star Trak Entertainment]], a joint venture with [[Arista Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/kelis-the-comeback-kid-59233.html|title=Kelis: The comeback kid|work=The Independent}}</ref> &mdash; Kelis began collaborating with other producers such as [[Dallas Austin]], [[André 3000]], [[Rockwilder]], and [[Raphael Saadiq]]. She stated in an interview: "I felt like I had a lot to prove with this album. People had started messing with me along the lines of 'Is she REALLY any good without The Neptunes?' &mdash; which I knew was ridiculous. And so I was like, 'I'll take that challenge'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/249/kelis_talks_milkshake_and_tasty_hits|title=Kelis Talks 'Milkshake' And 'Tasty' Hits|publisher=Bluesandsoul.com|access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref>

The single and album immediately found success in Europe.

The album's second single, the Dallas Austin-produced "[[Trick Me]]", went to the top ten in many European countries during mid-2004; it did not, however, garner success in the U.S. in the absence of promotion by [[Jive Records]], the label Kelis had been transferred to after Arista Records folded at the time of ''Tasty''{{'}}s release.<ref name="mp3-apr06"/> Kelis' success grew in Australia, where ''Tasty'' went gold with over 35,000 copies sold, and where "Milkshake" and "Trick Me" went platinum (selling over 70,000 copies each). Kelis followed the success of the third ''Tasty'' single, "[[Millionaire (Kelis song)|Millionaire]]" (featuring André 3000), with the Rockwilder-produced, sexually suggestive track, "[[In Public]]" (featuring Nas), which reached number 17 on the UK chart.<ref name=officialcharts/> "[[Not in Love (Enrique Iglesias song)|Not in Love]]", Kelis's collaboration with [[Enrique Iglesias]] from his 2003 album ''[[7 (Enrique Iglesias album)|7]]'', was released as a single the following year, reaching the UK top five.<ref name=officialcharts/> Although the single failed to chart on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, it topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Enrique Iglesias|chart=Dance Club Songs}}]</ref>

Also in 2004, Kelis collaborated with [[Björk]] on a remix of the latter's track "[[Oceania (song)|Oceania]]" (from Björk's album ''[[Medúlla]]''), which appeared as a B-side to the Björk album's second single, "[[Who Is It (Björk song)|Who Is It]]". Kelis toured as the opening act for fellow Jive artist [[Britney Spears]]'s [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]]. In 2005 she was featured on the soundtrack to the film, ''[[Just Like Heaven (film)|Just Like Heaven]]'', with a [[cover version]] of [[The Pretenders]]' "[[Brass in Pocket]]" (1979).<ref>{{cite web |title=Just Like Heaven Soundtrack Music - Complete Song List |url=https://www.tunefind.com/movie/just-like-heaven |publisher=Tunefind.com |date=September 16, 2005}}</ref>

===2006–2008: ''Kelis Was Here''===
Kelis contributed a track titled "80's Joint" to [[Step Up (Original Soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of the 2006 dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''.

According to Kelis, she received no support from Jive Records for ''Kelis Was Here'',<ref name=selftitled/> and the label dropped her in late 2007.<ref name="ew-oct07"/> Her manager at the time said that the singer was working with Cee-Lo Green on an [[alternative dance]] album and would be shopping a pop album produced by songwriter [[Guy Chambers]], who co-wrote hits such as [[Robbie Williams]]'s "[[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]".<ref name="ew-oct07"/> Scottish [[electronica]] producer [[Calvin Harris]] was also said to be collaborating with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/entertainment-blog/2007/05/14/kelis-to-work-with-calvin-harris/ |title=Kelis To Work With Calvin Harris? |access-date=November 25, 2007 |work=PR-inside.com |date=May 14, 2007 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20080203193648/http://www.pr-inside.com/entertainment-blog/2007/05/14/kelis-to-work-with-calvin-harris/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = February 3, 2008}}</ref> Kelis later said of this period, "I was like, 'I will never put out another record again, I hate this business, I hate all these people.' I was in this race that I didn't even realise that I was in. I woke up and ten years had passed. That was never my plan". She subsequently took a hiatus from music.<ref name=":0" />

After Kelis left Jive, the label released a fourteen-track greatest hits album entitled ''[[The Hits (Kelis album)|The Hits]]'' in March 2008. The album does not contain any previously unreleased songs; [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s "[[Got Your Money]]", [[N.E.R.D]]'s "Truth or Dare", and [[Richard X]]'s "Finest Dreams" appear on the album alongside every charted Kelis single to that date, with the exception of "Blindfold Me".

===2009–2010: ''Flesh Tone''===
In 2009, Kelis announced that she was finishing her fifth studio album, to be released in 2010 under [[Interscope Records]] via the [[will.i.am Music Group]].

A special edition sleeve was included in the preorder release, with full artwork and lyrics included.<ref name=Billboard/> The second single, "[[4th of July (Fireworks)]]", was accompanied by a video co-directed by Kelis herself (with [[John Rankin Waddell|John "Rankin" Waddell]] and [[Nicole Ehrlich]]) and became a club hit in America and Britain. Subsequent singles, "[[Scream (Kelis song)|Scream]]" and "[[Brave (Kelis song)|Brave]]", made minimal chart impact.

During mid-2010 Kelis embarked on her first U.S. tour, titled [[All Hearts]] with [[Robyn]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Becky Bain |url=http://idolator.com/5523492/kelis-and-robyn-tour-dates-all-hearts |title=Kelis And Robyn Announce Dates For All Hearts Tour &#124; Music News, Reviews, and Gossip on |publisher=Idolator.com |date=June 1, 2010 |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> amid a selection of club, festival, and solo dates that continued through 2011 – these included [[Glastonbury Festival 2010|Glastonbury]], [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill]], Good Vibrations Festival, and [[Lovebox Festival|Lovebox]].
