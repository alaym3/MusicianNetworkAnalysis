'''Iyeoka Okoawo''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|j|oʊ|k|ə}}) (born April 28, 1975) is a [[Nigerian-American]] poet, recording artist, singer, activist, educator and TEDGlobal Fellow.<ref name="ted.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/437 |title=Fellows &#124; Meet the TED Fellows &#124; TEDGlobal 2010 Fellows |publisher=TED |date= |access-date=January 18, 2011}}</ref> Her music includes elements from [[Soul music|soul]], [[R&B]], rock, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[jazz]].

==Early life==
A first-generation Nigerian-American, Iyeoka Okoawo was a practicing pharmacist before launching her musical career.

==Music career==
She began her musical career by founding the group The Rock by Funk Tribe, a collective of musicians that enabled her to interweave her poetry with jazz, blues, funk, and gospel. In 2004, she released her first solo full-length album of poem-songs, called ''Black and Blues'', through Phanai Records. Then she began to tour and appeared on other artists’ albums, including The Press Project's ''Get Right'' album and ''Memoirs of the Tempo'' by Tempo Valley.[http://www.thepressproject.com][http://tempovalley.com/]

In 2008, Iyeoka released her second album of poetry and music fusion, ''Hum The Bass Line'', again on Phanai Records. That same year, Iyeoka made a cover of [[U2]]′s hit song "Desire" for a compilation of U2 covers called ''In The Name Of Love: Africa Celebrates U2''. The album featured Grammy Award-winning/nominated African artists, including [[Angelique Kidjo]], [[Les Nubians]], [[Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars]], [[Vieux Farka Touré]], [[Vusi Mahlasela]] and the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]], with proceeds benefiting the [[Global Fund]].

In 2009, Iyeoka decided to transform her sound and songwriting approach and began working with producer David Franz (in collaboration with her original producer, Francis Phan) to create more traditional song forms. Iyeoka released two EPs that year: ''This Time Around'' and ''Run Into the Rain''. The new music infused more pop, R&B, dance, and hip hop into the mix, creating an “electronic soul” sound.

In November 2010, Iyeoka released her new album, ''Say Yes'', containing nine songs and two poems, through the Underground Sun artist development company. It is the first “Evolving Album(tm)” where purchasers will receive added content for free as the album evolves. Before the album's release, the first song, “The Yellow Brick Road Song”, was featured in an episode of the new hit [[HBO]] series ''[[How To Make It in America]]''.<ref name="howtomakeitinamerica1">{{cite web |url=http://howtomakeitinamerica.com/episode-1-03-%E2%80%93-soundtrack/ |title=Episode 1.03&nbsp;– Soundtrack |publisher=How To Make It in America |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=January 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125130814/http://howtomakeitinamerica.com/episode-1-03-%E2%80%93-soundtrack/ |archive-date=January 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> "The Yellow Brick Road Song" is being used as the theme song for the series "[[Fairly Legal]]" that premiered January 20, 2011, on [[USA Network]].<ref name="fairlylegal">{{cite web |url=http://www.iyeoka.com/2011/01/the-yellow-brick-road-song-is-usa-network-show-fairly-legals-theme-song/ |title=The Yellow Brick Road Song is USA Network show Fairly Legal's theme song! |publisher=Iyeoka.com |date=January 20, 2011 |access-date=January 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713071733/http://www.iyeoka.com/2011/01/the-yellow-brick-road-song-is-usa-network-show-fairly-legals-theme-song/ |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>
