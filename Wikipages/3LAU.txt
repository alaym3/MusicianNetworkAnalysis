==Early life==
Justin David Blau was born in [[Syosset]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States on January 9, 1991.<ref name="ablau"/> Blau grew up around an artistic family, and was soon playing piano, playing guitar and singing. At thirteen, he moved with his family to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he spent the rest of his youth.<ref name="bblau"/> He attended [[The Meadows School]] for high school and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] for college.<ref name="bblau"/>

== Background ==
Much of 3LAU's music incorporates [[electro house]], [[dubstep]], [[deep house]], and [[progressive house]].<ref name="dblau" /> He is known for his melodic take on dance music and live sets that incorporate [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. The emotional purpose of his style of songwriting, Blau says, is to inspire others to overcome their sense of feeling lost. “Every song is somehow about being lost in some way, whether that's in love, in life, in mental health, whatever it may be. Sometimes the lyrics shed light on the brighter parts, but in many ways, I write as a means to try to combat that feeling of being lost and I hope the music can do that for someone else.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insomniac.com/music/artists/3lau/|title=3LAU – Artists|website=www.insomniac.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>

==Music career==

===2011–12: First releases===
In 2011, at the age of 20, he vacationed in Sweden, where he discovered electronic dance music. After returning to college he started producing mashups, "mainly because [he] didn't think anyone was doing a good job."<ref name="cblau"/> He soon began mixing under the professional name 3LAU, and by June of that year was uploading mashups to YouTube.<ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/>

3LAU gained recognition in the [[electronic music]] world in 2011 with his two bootlegs, "Girls Who Save the World" and "All Night Long". He also won a remix competition for his remix of [[Tiesto]]'s "Work Hard, Play Hard".

Before 2012, 3LAU spent his days studying at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and DJing at night. He has had remixes charts in the top 10 on both [[Beatport]] and [[Hype Machine]].<ref name="dblau"/>

===2012–15: Singles, touring===
In 2012, he focused on DJing and launched his 3LAU Your Mind tour. That same year, he released his second bootleg album, ''Dance Floor Filth''.<ref name="dblau"/> In 2012, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' described him as "one of America's fastest-rising DJ-producers."<ref name="bblau"/> In 2012 he released ''Dance Floor Filth 2'', an album featuring his production.<ref name="iblau"/>

In late 2013, he went on a short tour with Carnage called the Night Riot tour.<ref name="eblauboston"/><ref name="hblau"/> Wrote Jonah Ollman of ''Sound of Boston'' about 3LAU's live performances in late 2013, "A nice balance of mashups, electro-house, poppy vocal samples, and a 90's throwback here and there keep the young 20-something crowd going and constantly entertained."<ref name="eblauboston"/>

In the summer of 2015, 3LAU did his first European tour visiting Barcelona, Germany and Ibiza. Later that fall, he went on his first Asian tour which included Bangkok, Jakarta, Tokyo and more.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tour|url = http://www.3lau.com/tour|website = Tour|access-date = January 11, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117071736/http://www.3lau.com/tour|archive-date = January 17, 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>

=== 2016-17: Blume Records ===
In 2016 3LAU launched Blume Records, an independent label with a ground-breaking model that harnesses the power of streaming to raise money for charitable causes. 3LAU stated, "Hopefully we can inspire other people to act and there will be this domino effect."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insomniac.com/music/artists/3lau/|title=3LAU – Artists|website=www.insomniac.com|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>
