'''Foo Fighters''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington, in 1994. The band was founded by former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]]. The group took its name from [[foo fighter]], a nickname coined by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] for [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and other aerial phenomena. Over the course of their career, Foo Fighters have won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] four times.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html "Dave Grohl interview: 'I’m going to fix my leg and then I’m going to come back'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html|date=June 19, 2015}}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015. Retrieved August 5, 2016.</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2021, their first year of eligibility.

Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]]. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.

Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by [[Franz Stahl]] and [[Taylor Hawkins]]; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007.

For Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'' (2011), produced by [[Butch Vig]], Smear returned as a full member. ''[[Sonic Highways]]'' (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|television miniseries]] directed by Grohl. ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'' (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member. In 2021, the band released their tenth album, ''[[Medicine at Midnight]].''

== History ==

=== Background and first demos (1990–1994) ===
[[File:FoosDublin210819-2 (48620472807) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Dave Grohl]] (pictured in 2019) founded Foo Fighters after his band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] disbanded in 1994.]]

In 1990, [[Dave Grohl]] joined the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as drummer. During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs, but was too intimidated to share them with the band; he was "in awe" of the songs written by frontman [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref name="Foobulous">di Perna, Alan. "Absolutely Foobulous!". ''Guitar World''. August 1997.</ref> Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos and covers, issuing an album of demos, ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'', under the pseudonym Late! in 1992.<ref name="Alien parking">Bryant, Tom. "Alien Parking". ''Kerrang! Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref>

Nirvana disbanded after the [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Cobain]] in 1994. Grohl received offers to work with various artists; press rumors indicated he might join [[Pearl Jam]],<ref name="Nirvana (USA).">Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. June 14, 2015.</ref> and he almost accepted a position as drummer in [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Grohl later said: "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life. I thought that I would rather do what no one expected me to do." Grohl instead entered [[Robert Lang Studios]] in October 1994 to record 15 of his own songs.<ref name="Alien parking" /> With the exception of a guitar part on "X-Static", played by [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal.<ref name=AMG>{{cite web| last=Erlewine| first=Stephen Thomas| url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/foo-fighters-mn0000184043/biography| title=Artist Biography [Foo Fighters]| publisher=Allmusic.com| access-date=November 18, 2014| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072401/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/foo-fighters-mn0000184043/biography| archive-date=November 17, 2014| df=mdy-all}}</ref> He completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.<ref name="Alien parking" />

Grohl hoped to stay anonymous and release the recordings in a limited run under the name Foo Fighters, taken from [[foo fighter]], a [[World War II]] term for [[unidentified flying object]]s.<ref name="Alien parking" /> He hoped the name would lead listeners to assume the music was made by several people. He said later: "Had I actually considered this to be a career, I probably would have called it something else, because it's the stupidest fucking band name in the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/foo-fighters-on-their-band-name|title=Foo Fighters On Their Band Name|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904170754/http://www.clashmusic.com/news/foo-fighters-on-their-band-name|archive-date=September 4, 2017}}</ref> The demo tape circulated in the industry, creating interest among record labels.<ref>Strauss, Neil.

=== Formation and debut album (1994–1995) ===
Grohl formed a band to support the album. He spoke to Nirvana bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] about joining the group, but they decided against it; Grohl said it would have felt "really natural" for them to work together, but would have been "weird" for the others and place more pressure on Grohl.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mundy|first=Chris|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/invasion-of-the-foo-fighers-19951005|title=Invasion of the Foo Fighters|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 5, 1995|access-date=November 18, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011937/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/invasion-of-the-foo-fighers-19951005|archive-date=December 20, 2014}} Excerpt only; subscription required for full article.</ref> Instead, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both of the recently disbanded Seattle group [[Sunny Day Real Estate]].

Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref> Grohl licensed the album to [[Capitol Records]], releasing it on his new label, [[Roswell Records]].<ref name="Alien parking" />

Foo Fighters made their live public debut on February 23, 1995, at the Jambalaya Club in [[Arcata, California]], followed by performances at [[Satyricon nightclub|Satyricon]] in Portland on March 3 and the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig for the investigation of the rape and murder of [[The Gits|Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name="Breakout" /> Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, "[[This Is a Call]]", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. "[[I'll Stick Around]]," "[[For All the Cows|For All the Cows,]]" and "[[Big Me]]" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the [[Reading Festival]] in England in August.<ref name="Breakout" />

=== ''The Colour and the Shape'' (1996–1997) ===
[[File:Foo Fighters - Phoenix Festival 1996 (12882631835).jpg|thumb|left|Foo Fighters performing at [[Phoenix Festival]] in 1996]]
After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in [[Woodinville, Washington]], with producer [[Gil Norton]] to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes to Los Angeles, intending to finish his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with the drumming and replaced most of Goldsmith's drum tracks with his own.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> Though Grohl hoped that Goldsmith would still play on the tour, Goldsmith felt betrayed and left the band.<ref>Roberts, Michael.

"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that. But I thought, This is bullshit."</ref>

[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] ''(pictured in 2017)'' joined the band in 1997.]]
In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted [[Alanis Morissette]]'s touring drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] for a recommendation. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered himself.<ref name="Foobulous" /> Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', in May 1997. The album included the singles "[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]", "[[Everlong]]", "[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]", and "[[Walking After You]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Smear left Foo Fighters in 1997, citing exhaustion and burnout, and was replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]].<ref name="Kerrang 1997">Johnson, Lisa. "Classic interview: October 1997". ''Kerrang! Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref> Stahl toured with Foo Fighters for the next few months and appeared on two tracks recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of "Walking After You" for ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'' and [[A320 (song)|A320]] for ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. A [[B-side]] from the "My Hero" single, "Dear Lover," appeared in the horror film ''[[Scream 2]]''. The tour for ''The Colour and the Shape'' album in 1998 included performances at [[Glastonbury Festival]] (on the main stage) and the [[Reading Festival]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=October 24, 1998 |title=Specialist Organisation Makes for Good Festivals |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-UK/Music/Archive-Music-Week-IDX/IDX/1998/Music-Week-1998-10-24-S-OCR-IDX-18.pdf |magazine=[[Music Week]] |page=18 |access-date=August 14, 2021}}</ref>

=== ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' (1998–2001) ===
In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write their third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, "in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't." Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day.<ref name="Burn away">Beebee, Steve. "Burn Away". ''Kerrang! Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref> The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent several months recording the band's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'', in Grohl's home studio. The album spawned several singles, including "[[Learn to Fly]]", the band's first to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles included "[[Stacked Actors]]," "[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]," "[[Next Year]]," and "[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]."{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Before the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a "key man clause" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They left Capitol and signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]], who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.<ref name="Burn away" />

After recording ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists and settled on [[Chris Shiflett]], who performed with [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]] and California punk band [[No Use for a Name]]. Shiflett initially joined as a touring guitarist but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Back and Forth (documentary)|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref>

In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to Tired of You and an outtake called Knucklehead. The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including [[VH1 Rock Honors]] and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].

=== ''One by One'' (2001–2004) ===
[[File:David Grohl.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Grohl performing with Foo Fighters in 2003]]
Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record its [[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|fourth album]]. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio, the album "just didn't sound right" and the band had no confidence it would sell very well. With the album not reaching their expectations amid much infighting, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once that album was finished and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely. Grohl reunited with Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel to play the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], alternating days with Queens of the Stone Age. Hawkins and Grohl talked about resuming work on ''One by One'' and after a very satisfying performance the following day, they agreed to stay together. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save Tired of You) in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], the following month.<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as Million Dollar Demos, has never been released in its entirety although seven tracks were leaked online in 2012 and 2015.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archive-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref>

The album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. Singles from the album included "[[All My Life (Foo Fighters song)|All My Life]]," "[[Times Like These (song)|Times Like These]]," "[[Low (Foo Fighters song)|Low]]," and "[[Have It All (Foo Fighters song)|Have It All]]." The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].

For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] presidential campaign was using "Times Like These" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to [[John Kerry]]'s campaign, saying, "There's no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry's people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense."<ref name=xfm>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|title=X-clusive: Foo Fighters Vs President George W Bush|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=[[XFM]]|access-date=December 21, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828074927/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|archive-date=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

=== ''In Your Honor'' (2005–2006) ===
[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Grohl performing with Foo Fighters in 2006]]
Having spent a year and a half touring behind ''One by One'', Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself but eventually the project involved the entire band.<ref>Greenblatt, Leah.

The album's singles included [[Best of You (Foo Fighters song)|Best of You]], [[DOA (Foo Fighters song)|DOA]], [[Resolve (song)|Resolve]], and [[No Way Back/Cold Day in the Sun]].

During September and October 2005, the band toured with [[Weezer]] on what was billed as the Foozer Tour.<ref>Montgomery, James "[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509264/20050909/weezer.jhtml Weezer, Foos Bring Arena-Rock Spectacle To Foozer (WeeFighters?)

MTV.com, September 2005.</ref> Foo Fighters played a headline performance at the 2005 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Motörhead's [[Lemmy]] joined the band on stage to sing Shake Your Blood from Dave Grohl's ''[[Probot (band)|Probot]]'' album. As a surprise performance, [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] of Queen appeared to play part of We Will Rock You as a lead in to Tie Your Mother Down.

In further support of ''In Your Honor'', the band organized a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. Members who had performed with them in late 2005 appeared, such as [[Pat Smear]], [[Petra Haden]] on violin and backing vocals, [[Drew Hester]] on percussion, and [[Rami Jaffee]] of [[The Wallflowers]] on keyboard and piano. While much of the setlist focused on ''In Your Honor'''s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs, such as Ain't It The Life, Floaty, and See You. The band also performed Marigold, a ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]''-era song that was best known as a [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] B side.

In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, ''[[Skin and Bones (Foo Fighters album)|Skin and Bones]]'', featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stint in Los Angeles.

=== ''Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace'' and ''Greatest Hits'' (2007–2009) ===

For the follow-up to ''In Your Honor'', the band recruited ''The Colour and the Shape'' producer Gil Norton. ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'' was released on September 25, 2007. The album's first single, [[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]], was issued to radio in early August. In mid-to-late 2007 The Pretender topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Modern Rock chart for a record 19 weeks. The second single, [[Long Road to Ruin]], was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator [[Jesse Peretz]] (formerly of [[the Lemonheads]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/search/video/?q=Jessie |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526195747/http://www.mtv.com/search/video/?q=Jessie |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |title=Peretz |publisher=Mtv.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Other singles included [[Let It Die (song)|Let It Die]] and [[Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)]].

In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support of the album. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, including headlining the [[Virgin Mobile Festival]] in [[Baltimore]] on August 9. At the European MTV Music Awards in 2007, Pat Smear confirmed his return to the band.

''Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace'' was nominated for five [[Grammy Awards]] in 2008. Foo Fighters went home with [[Best Rock Album]] and [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] (for The Pretender). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while The Pretender was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.

After Foo Fighters had completed this tour in September 2008, they recorded 13 new songs in studio 606, shortly after announcing a hiatus from touring (which would last until January 2011). These sessions likely lasted from late 2008 – early 2009. While the members of Foo Fighters had initially planned for their new album (composed of songs from this recording session) to have come out in 2009 with almost no touring support, they ultimately decided to shelve most of the songs from these sessions. Three of these songs were later released — Wheels and Word Forward (on their 2009 compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters album)|Greatest Hits]]''); and a newly recorded version of Rope (which ended up making the final cut of Wasting Light).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fooarchive.com/features/kdec10.htm|title=Kerrang's 50 albums you need to hear in 2011|publisher=Fooarchive.com|access-date=April 18, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122153928/http://www.fooarchive.com/features/kdec10.htm|archive-date=January 22, 2014}}</ref>

Grohl acknowledged that [[Kurt Cobain]] was an influence on his songwriting: "Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down." Foo Fighters also used the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana "liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose."<ref name="Foobulous" />

Writing and recording songs for their first album by himself, Grohl intended for the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his drumming, assigning various drum parts to strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, "I could hear the song in my head before it was finished."<ref name="Alien parking" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, the members assisted in song arrangements.<ref name="Foobulous" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as "his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]—a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|access-date=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archive-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

The band members meld melodic and heavy elements. Grohl noted in 1997, "We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural."<ref name="Foobulous" /> Grohl said in 2005, "I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life." Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. "Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK? It Feels Great Every Time!'". ''Kerrang''.
