'''Antoine Christophe Agbepa Mumba''' (13 July 1956),<ref name="Ten">{{cite web|  url=http://bigeye.ug/10-things-didnt-know-koffi-olomide/|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Koffi Olomide!|date=21 April 2014| last=Dan B. Atuhaire|publisher= Bigeye.ug|access-date=3 January 2016| location=Kampala}}</ref> known professionally as '''Koffi Olomidé''', is a Congolese [[Soukous|Soukus]] singer, dancer, producer, and composer. He has had several gold records in his career. He is the founder of the Quartier Latin International orchestra with many notable artists, including [[Fally Ipupa]] and [[Ferré Gola]].

==Background==
Olomide was born on 13 July 1956 in [[Kisangani]], DRC. His mother named him Koffi because he was born on Friday. He grew up in a [[middle-class]] family, without any musical background. During his youth, Olomide improvised by singing popular songs with his own lyrics and altered rhythms until a neighbor taught him how to play the [[guitar]].<ref name="Bio">{{cite web|title=Koffi Olomide Biography| url=http://www.panafricanallstars.com/biography/kofiolomide.asp|publisher=Pan African Allstars (PAA)|date=2002|last=PAA|

==Education==
Often described by fellow students and his teachers alike as "a very bright student," Olomide earned a [[scholarship]] to study in [[Bordeaux, France]] where he obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business economics]]. He is also reported to hold a [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] from the [[University of Paris]].<ref name="Ten"/><ref name="Bio"/><ref name="Music"/>

==Musical career==
Upon his return to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in the 1970s, Koffi joined [[Papa Wemba]]'s band, [[Viva la Musica]], initially as a composer and songwriter, and later as a [[lead vocalist]]. In 1986, he formed his band known as [[Quartier Latin International]], which celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. Since then, he has performed and recorded both with the group and by himself. Over the years, he built up a faithful fan base internationally, particularly in Africa and Europe. Koffi popularized the slower style of [[Soukous]], which he dubbed Tcha Tcho. His music can be quite controversial, taking on current events and topics considered [[taboo]] in some conservative societies. He also participated in the [[salsa music]] project [[Africando]]. For his effort, Effrakata, released in 2001, Koffi received four awards on a single night at the annual [[Kora Awards]] in [[South Africa]] for 2002 and 2003, including the award for Best African Artist, which he won in 1998. More recently, he won the Kora Award for "Best African Artist of The Decade".  This established one of his many aliases, the 'Quadra Kora Man.' <ref name="Music"/>

==His music==
Olomide's album ''Haut de Gamme: Koweït, Rive Gauche'' is listed in [[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/1001albums.htm | title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|first=Steve|
last=Parker|publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=3 January 2016|
date=2005|location=London}}</ref> In March 2003 Olomide released "Affaire D'Etat", a double CD album featuring 18 tracks. Most of his songs have the same tunes, but slightly different lyrics. 

Olomide was part of the [[Papa Wemba]] musical, in the early 1980s. He has trained many young musicians, some of whom have since left his [[Quartier Latin]] band and gone solo. Some of those who have left are Fele Mudogo, Sam Tshintu, Suzuki 4x4, [[Soleil Wanga]], [[Bouro Mpela]], [[Fally Ipupa]], [[Montana Kamenga]], [[Ferre Gola]]. However, Suzuki 4x4 has recently showed up once more in some of Quartier Latin shows, along with new recruits like [[Cindy Le Coeur]], a female singer with very high pitched vocals, recorded in the song ''L'Amour N'existe Pas'' (Love doesn't exist).

Koffi – who mostly refers to himself as "Mopao" – has a new release known as ''La Chicotte a Papa'', having recently excelled in hits like ''Lovemycine'', ''Diabolos'', ''Grand Pretre Mere'' and ''Soupou'', ''Cle Boa'', among others. Koffi's talent could be compared to the once king of African rhumba, [[Franco Luambo Makiadi]], who also saw many artists pass through his expert hands during his days. Today, Olomde is one of Africa's most popular musicians.<ref name="Music"/>

==Allegations==

In 2012, Koffi Olomide allegedly assaulted one of his producer for abuse and no respect of contract and received a suspended three month sentence.<ref name="Out">{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36875676|title=Koffi Olomide case: Kenya deports singer over airport 'kick' |access-date=24 July 2016 |date=23 July 2016 |first=BBC |last=News |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=London}}</ref> 

In July 2016, while on a concert trip to Kenya,<ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/25/africa/koffi-olomide-dancer-kenya/index.html</ref> Olomide was filmed making a kicking move towards one of his dancers. The action was widely condemned and caused the suspension of the concert as the video went viral.
On his return to his home country, he was arrested five days later in Kenya Airport, allegedly for the same unpunished action. He was subsequently jailed for 4 days without judgement and released with no explanation.
However, it was later revealed that the former Congolese president's wife, Mrs Olive Lembe Kabila, was behind the arrest because of her association for women's protection against violence and rape. <ref>Grand Lac Magazine/About 2016</ref>

In, 2018 he was ordered for arrest of a photographer in Zambia <ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47615273</ref>, he left the country before arrest. 

<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47615273</ref>

In 2019, He was found guilty by a french court of statutory rape of one of his former dancers when she was 15 years old <ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47615273</ref>. He was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence in absentia, as he did not attend court in France.
