==Early life and influences==
Barlow was born on 20 January 1971 in [[Frodsham|Frodsham, Cheshire]], the second son of Colin (died 15 October 2009)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://malextra.com/celebrity/Gary+Barlow-29096.html |title=Gary Barlow 'devastated' by Dad's Death |publisher=Malextra.com }}</ref> and Marjorie Barlow (''née'' Cowan).<ref>{{cite web|author=The Detective Agency Limited |url=http://www.garybarlow.com/docs/about/biography.shtml |title=Biography |publisher=Gary Barlow |date=20 January 1971 |access-date=17 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604132346/http://www.garybarlow.com/docs/about/biography.shtml |archive-date=4 June 2013 }}</ref> He attended Weaver Vale Primary School and moved on to [[Frodsham School|Frodsham High School]] in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gary Barlow|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055239/bio|access-date=2021-01-06|website=IMDb}}</ref> In Barlow's autobiography, he relates that his love of music began at an early age, and calls himself "one of those kids that's forever dancing in front of the TV looking at [his] reflection".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garybarlow.com/docs/about/biography.shtml |title=Biography |publisher=Gary Barlow |access-date=17 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604132346/http://www.garybarlow.com/docs/about/biography.shtml |archive-date=4 June 2013 }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by late 1970s and 1980s pop music.<ref name="Mettler2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/music/interview-gary-barlow-on-fly-songs-inspired-by-eddie-the-eagle/|title=Gary Barlow didn't just meet his '80s heroes, he made a retro album with them|last=Mettler|first=Mike|date=17 June 2016|website=[[Digital Trends]]|access-date=6 March 2021}}</ref> Barlow cites watching a performance of "[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]" by [[Depeche Mode]] on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' when he was 10 years old as a main influence, describing it as "mesmerising".

In 1986, when Barlow was 15 years old, he entered a [[BBC]] ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' Christmas song competition with "Let's Pray for Christmas". After reaching the semi-finals, he was invited to London's West Heath Studios to record his song. This inspired him to perform on the northern club circuit, singing cover versions and his own songs. Barlow's first performance was in Wales, at the [[Connah's Quay]] Labour Club in the late 1980s, and he was paid £18 per performance on Saturday evenings.

In 1989, Barlow appointed [[Wigan]] show business agent Barry Woolley to be his manager and recorded a single ("Love Is in the Air") which was never released commercially. Barlow was eventually put in touch with casting agent [[Nigel Martin-Smith]], by renowned celebrity photographer Doc Braham, who took Barlow's first professional head-shots. Nigel was a friend of Doc's, and introduced Barlow to Nigel who was interested in starting a boyband. Martin-Smith decided to use Barlow as the lead-singer after being impressed by his self-written material, including an early demo tape of Barlow's "[[A Million Love Songs]]", concluding that the band would be built around Barlow's vocals and songwriting skills.

==History==
===1989–1996: Take That===
{{Main|Take That}}
Barlow, who wrote the majority of the group's songs, is widely recognised as the lead singer of Take That.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/gary-barlow/id19982 |title=Itunes Music gary Barlow biography |publisher=iTunes Store |date=20 January 1971 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref> After selecting Barlow as the group's lead singer, [[Nigel Martin-Smith]] introduced [[Howard Donald]], [[Jason Orange]], [[Mark Owen]] and finally [[Robbie Williams]] to the fold. The group were signed to [[RCA Records]], and after a number of top-40 hits, eventually secured their first number-one with Barlow's "[[Pray (Take That song)|Pray]]". Previous hits included "[[A Million Love Songs]]", "[[It Only Takes a Minute]]" and "[[Could It Be Magic]]". The debut album ''[[Take That & Party]]'' was released on 17 August 1992 and reached number two in the UK Album Chart. The following year saw the release of their second album, ''[[Everything Changes (Take That album)|Everything Changes]]'' based on Barlow's own material. It went straight in at number one in the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles, as well as "[[Why Can't I Wake Up with You]]" and "[[Love Ain't Here Anymore]]" hitting numbers two and three respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=Search both songs Every Hit |publisher=Everyhit.com |date=16 March 2000 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref>

Barlow received an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song in 1994 for the number-one hit song "[[Pray (Take That song)|Pray]]" included on the album.<ref name="Celebdaq – Back For Good?">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scoopcps/celebdaq/news/news/2006/01/03/28486.shtml |title=Celebdaq – "Back For Good?" |publisher=BBC |access-date=16 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010091952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scoopcps/celebdaq/news/news/2006/01/03/28486.shtml |archive-date=10 October 2011 }}</ref> In 1994, alongside [[Rick Astley]], Barlow did backing vocals for [[Elton John]]'s version of "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]" from ''[[The Lion King]]''. Take That's third album ''[[Nobody Else]]'', again based on Barlow's own material, went straight to number one and was to be their last studio album of the 1990s. The album had three number-one singles, including Barlow's "[[Back for Good (song)|Back for Good]]" which peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/back-for-good-take-that/ |title=Back for Good – Take That &#124; |publisher=Toponehitwonders.com |date=14 April 2010 |access-date=15 August 2011 |archive-date=19 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919021119/http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/back-for-good-take-that/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was brought forward an unprecedented six weeks before its official release such was the demand for the single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/popontrial/decades/index.shtml?d=90s&a=show&t=show&c=show&n=43&q=hide&m=hide |title=Music TV – Pop on trial – 1950s–1990s |publisher=BBC  |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> A ''[[Greatest Hits (Take That album)|Greatest Hits]]'' collection followed again reaching number one. The album featured the band's eighth number-one single "[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)#Take That version|How Deep Is Your Love]]". This was to be the first single released by Take That as a four piece (without Robbie Williams) and it was their last single until they reformed in 2005.

===1996–1998: Solo career and ''Open Road''===

Barlow's solo career was predicted to be very successful, being described as "the next [[George Michael]]". His first two solo singles, "[[Forever Love (Gary Barlow song)|Forever Love]]" (released July 1996) and "[[Love Won't Wait]]" (composed by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Shep Pettibone]]), both leapt to the number one spot in his home country. "Forever Love" was also used as the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Leading Man]]''. His debut album ''[[Open Road (Gary Barlow album)|Open Road]]'' reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and went on to sell 2 million copies worldwide. Barlow's first single to be released in the United States as a solo artist was "[[So Help Me Girl]]", which reached number 44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart and number one on the US ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart. He then achieved another top-ten hit in the UK with "[[Open Road (Gary Barlow song)|Open Road]]" peaking at number seven<ref name="search.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.search.com/reference/Gary_Barlow |title=Reference for Gary Barlow |publisher=Search.com |date=7 July 2005 |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> and number eight in the Netherlands with "[[Open Road (Gary Barlow album)|Are You Ready Now?]]".<ref name="search.com"/>

===1999–2004: ''Twelve Months, Eleven Days,'' and producing career===
After the success of his first solo album, Barlow released his second LP ''[[Twelve Months, Eleven Days]]'' in 1999. Barlow released "[[Stronger (Gary Barlow song)|Stronger]]" as the lead single preceding the album. However, due to an expected backlash against Barlow, it received minimal support and airplay and only peaked at number 16.<ref name="search.com"/> The album's second single, "[[For All That You Want]]", also received minimal radio play and peaked at number 24; however, it nearly reached the top five in Finland.<ref name="search.com"/> ''[[Twelve Months, Eleven Days]]'' received little promotion and peaked at a disappointing number 35, which led to Sony recalling the album's scheduled third single, "[[Lie to Me (Gary Barlow song)|Lie to Me]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Gary-Barlow/biography/ |title=Barlow Autobiography |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |access-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015051209/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Gary-Barlow/biography/ |archive-date=15 October 2012 }}</ref> This decision resulted in Barlow and BMG parting company.<ref name="life.royalalberthall.com"/>

In late 1999, Barlow quit his career as a singer, with his final single remaining unreleased. From 2000 to 2004, he was a producer for other artists, including bandmate Mark Owen's solo projects. In 2005, he resumed his singing career after a six-year hiatus.{{cn|date=March 2020}} 

Barlow has sold million records as a solo artist.<ref name="life.royalalberthall.com"/>

===2005–2011: Take That reunion and ''Shame''===

Barlow returned to the spotlight in a successful TV documentary, ''[[Take That: For the Record]]'' in 2005. Following this success and renewed interest, Take That experienced a career renaissance in 2005 when the post-Williams line-up reformed for a sell-out arena/stadium tour. The band released their comeback single [[Patience (Take That song)|"Patience"]] which went to number one for four weeks while also topping the charts across Europe. Patience was also voted [[the Record of the Year]] in 2006 and won a Brit Award for single of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/events/the-brit-awards/news/39859-who-won-at-the-brits |title=Who won at The BRITS? &#124; MTV UK |publisher=MTV |date=14 February 2007 |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> This was followed with "[[Shine (Take That song)|Shine]]" which became the band's tenth number-one single. Take That's first album of new material in over ten years, ''[[Beautiful World (Take That album)|Beautiful World]]'' was released on 24 November 2006. The album peaked at number one in the UK Album Chart selling over 2.8&nbsp;million copies in the UK alone as of 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jones |first=Alan |url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1046069&c=1 |title=Adele still on top but UK album sales fall to 13-year low |magazine=Music Week |date=24 July 2011 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref> It was re-released as a tour edition with hit single "[[Rule the World (Take That single)|Rule the World]]" in 2007 and peaked again at number one.

In 2008, the band were nominated for four Brit Awards (Best British Group, Best British Album, Best British Single and Best British Live Act). They won Best British Single and Best British Live Act. After great success in 2006, Take That released the single "[[Greatest Day (Take That Song)|Greatest Day]]" which went straight to number one and became their eleventh number-one single in the UK. The week after they released their second album since their reunion in 2006, ''[[The Circus (Take That album)|The Circus]]''. ''[[The Circus (Take That album)|The Circus]]'' album was also a great success for Take That going straight to the top of the UK album chart and selling over 2.2&nbsp;million copies in the country, going multi-platinum within four days of its release.<ref name="bpi.co.uk"/> In June and July 2009, Take That performed a record-breaking tour named ''[[Take That Present: The Circus Live]]'' throughout the United Kingdom and it sold over one million tickets in just five hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/music/take-that-break-ticket-sales-record-2009-stadium-shows-$1247390.htm |title=Take That break ticket sales record for 2009 stadium shows |publisher=Inthenews.co.uk |access-date=16 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618193611/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/music/take-that-break-ticket-sales-record-2009-stadium-shows-%241247390.htm |archive-date=18 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Barlow's first solo release since 1999 was a duet with reconciled Take That bandmate Robbie Williams on a single entitled "[[Shame (Robbie Williams song)|Shame]]". The single was written by both Barlow and Williams after they began to work together in Los Angeles on new material for a new Take That album following Williams' return to the band. On the first day of the song being released to the radio and the media, "Shame" received an unprecedented 694 plays on the radio and 153 plays on TV. The single peaked at number 2 in the UK, selling 224,000 copies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/robbie-williams-official-top-40-biggest-selling-solo-singles-revealed-2291/|title=Robbie Williams' Official Top 40 Biggest Selling Solo Singles revealed|publisher=Officialcharts.com|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref> and being certified as Silver by the BPI, while also charting in 21 countries worldwide.<ref name="bpi.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015932/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=24 September 2009 }}</ref>

It was announced in January 2012 that Barlow and Andrew Lloyd Webber would be working together to write the official [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] single.

In a statement, he said, "I'm really excited about these dates. Playing live is my favourite thing and I haven't played a solo show for over a year now. Last year playing two London shows was brilliant, we all had such a good time, so I thought right let's get out and see the rest of the country!"

The tickets to Barlow's solo concerts sold out "instantly" after going on sale on 19 October, with tickets selling faster than those of [[the Rolling Stones]] for their comeback dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/91577/Gary-Barlow-Takes-On-The-Rolling-Stones-As-Concerts-Sell-Out-Instantly |publisher=Entertainment Wise |date=19 October 2012 |title=Gary Barlow Takes on The Rolling Stones as concerts sell out instantly |access-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319221008/http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/91577/Gary-Barlow-Takes-On-The-Rolling-Stones-As-Concerts-Sell-Out-Instantly |archive-date=19 March 2014 }}</ref> Demand was so high for tickets that Barlow added more dates, which also sold out instantly.

===2017–present: ''A Better Me'', ''Music Played by Humans'' and ''The Dream of Christmas''===
On 12 October 2017, whilst appearing on BBC Radio 2, Barlow announced that he would be embarking on a solo tour again around UK and Ireland to celebrate the release of his new book, ''A Better Me''. The tour was to visit smaller and more intimate venues rather than the huge arenas and stadiums that Barlow was so familiar to playing, be it solo or alongside his Take That bandmates.

On 14 August 2019, Barlow announced that he had been working on a new solo record due for release in Autumn 2020, stating that "[he has] never recorded with an orchestra" and wanted to create "original songs with big contemporary orchestral arrangements."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/take-that/gary-barlow-new-solo-album-orchestral/|title=Gary Barlow announces exciting new solo orchestral album plans for 2020|last=Eames|first=Tom|work=[[Smooth Radio (2014)|Smooth Radio]]|date=15 August 2019|access-date=30 September 2020}}</ref> In July 2020, Barlow confirmed that the album will release in November, adding that "[the album is] very positive and [composed] with a 60-piece orchestra."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/gary-barlow-will-release-his-first-solo-studio-album-in-seven-years-this-november__30154/|title=Gary Barlow will release his first solo studio album in seven years this November|work=[[Official Charts Company]]|last=White|first=Jack|date=7 July 2020|access-date=1 October 2020}}</ref>

A tour to promote the record in 2021 has also been announced with [[Leona Lewis]] as special guest.

Barlow announced in early 2021 that he would release a new solo record by the end of the year, which was revealed on 28 October to be ''[[The Dream of Christmas]]'', his first Christmas album.<ref name="TDOC">{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/nz/album/the-dream-of-christmas-deluxe/1590871215|title=The Dream of Christmas|website=Apple Music|access-date=28 October 2021}}</ref> The project features a collection of both new songs and covers of Christmas classics, including the two singles "Sleigh Ride" and "The Dream of Christmas", both released on 29 October.

===Songwriting, producing and publishing===
After leaving his career as a solo artist Barlow returned to his first love of writing music. He soon signed a song writing publishing deal with Sony and went to the US on a six-month songwriting project, residing in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] with his wife, Dawn and first child, Daniel. Upon his return he set up True North Productions with Eliot Kennedy and Tim Woodcock. In his autobiography ''My Take'' Barlow partly blames his fall as a solo artist on his commitments to being a star in the United States. After his disappointing second album, Barlow remained out of the public eye for half a decade, choosing to continue to write and produce songs for other artists such as [[Shirley Bassey]] and [[Charlotte Church]].

In October 2007, Barlow founded San Remo Live Publishings as an independently run management company to establish and support artists and songwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanremo-live.com/home/about-us/ |title=San Remo Live Publishing official Website.

In 2008, Barlow was heavily involved in providing the score of [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s [[Britannia High]].

Bosses quickly made contact with him and made a donation to the charity, with Barlow turning on the lights and performing a number of his hits during the 45 minute set. Simon Blackburn, Leader of Blackpool Council said: "Gary’s very generous offer on Twitter was extremely flattering and as soon as we saw it we contacted him straight away to take him up on it. Not only has Gary taken time out of his busy schedule to play on Friday, but he has also asked for a donation to charity in place of his performance fee. I am delighted to make that donation to Children in Need." Graham Cain, the Council's Cabinet Member for Tourism and Leisure, said: "Gary has shown his love for Blackpool by tweeting about the town and the Illuminations before and he even turned on the illuminations back in 1999.

He said of the event: "I’m very excited that these incredible artists are giving their time for a special Charity that is close to my heart."<ref>{{cite web|last=McCormack |first=Kirsty |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/432335/Gary-Barlow-reveals-star-studded-line-up-for-BBC-Children-in-Need-Rocks-2013 |title=Gary Barlow reveals star-studded line-up for BBC Children in Need Rocks 2013 |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=7 February 2014}}</ref>

In October 2013, Barlow travelled directly from the X Factor live results shows to [[Afghanistan]] to meet the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] and experience their day-to-day lives in [[Camp Shorabak|Camp Bastion]]. Barlow listened to the soldiers' stories, went for a five-kilometre run with the troops and played a morale-boosting concert for them as a thank you for their work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity/544791/gary-barlow-in-afghanistan-the-story-that-will-move-the-uk.html#85gzatr9R5oP8fUz.99 |title=Gary Barlow in Afghanistan |publisher=Marieclaire.co.uk |date=3 February 2014 |access-date=7 February 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Family===
In 2000, Barlow married Dawn Andrews, who was a dancer on Take That's 1995 [[Nobody Else Tour]]. They have three children: Daniel (born 2000), Emily (born 2002), and Daisy (born 2009).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/features/gary-barlow-children-name-ages/|title=Gary Barlow children: Who are they and how many kids does he have with wife Dawn Andrews?|access-date=16 January 2021 | work=Smooth Radio|date=1 April 2020}}</ref> On 4 August 2012, he revealed that their daughter, Poppy, was [[stillborn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19153652|title=Gary Barlow mourns stillborn baby |access-date=4 August 2012 | work=BBC News|date=6 August 2012}}</ref> He released a short statement reading, "Dawn and I are devastated to announce that we've lost our baby. Our focus now is giving [Poppy] a beautiful funeral and loving our three children with all our hearts. We'd ask at this painful time that our privacy be respected." Despite the loss of his daughter one week previously, Barlow performed at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|London 2012 Olympic Games Closing Ceremony]] singing the hit "[[Rule the World (Take That single)|Rule the World]]", which drew praise internationally for the strength and determination of Barlow to take to the stage so soon after his tragedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/olympics/olympic-news/gary-barlow-leads-amazing-show-from-take-that--a-week-after-losing-daughter-8037278.html|date=13 August 2012|work=London Evening Standard|title=Gary Barlow leads amazing show from Take That – a week after losing daughter|access-date=19 February 2013}}</ref> Owing to the bereavement, it was announced that Barlow would not attend the ''X Factor'' press launch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tellyspy.com/xfactor/confirmed-gary-barlow-to-miss-x-factor-press-launch-tomorrow/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821034629/http://tellyspy.com/xfactor/confirmed-gary-barlow-to-miss-x-factor-press-launch-tomorrow/|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 August 2012|title=CONFIRMED: Gary Barlow to miss X Factor press launch tomorrow &#124; Telly Spy|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=9 February 2021}}</ref>

In his autobiography ''[[My Take]]'', Barlow revealed that he is a supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool FC]], with their anthem "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]" being one of the first songs he learned to play on the piano. He is also a supporter of the [[Warrington Wolves]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. Barlow also mentioned in his autobiography that he was on the [[Edgware Road]] tube train that was one of the targets of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].

In 2009, Barlow named "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]", the 1986 duet between [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Kate Bush]], as the song that had most inspired him. He said, "I don't think you can listen to this song without feeling inspired, it could save anybody. The lyrics are so inspirational. Specifically I was having a very low moment in the 1990s and the song came on the radio. There have only been a very few times when I've had to pull the car over to listen to a song; this was one of them."<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/5761933/Celebrities-name-songs-that-inspire-them.html | title= Celebrities name songs that inspire them | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=7 July 2009}}</ref>

===Politics===
During the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election campaign]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] announced their intention to encourage musical achievement amongst young people in schools with a competition called "School Stars". Barlow appeared at a school staged campaign event to endorse the introduction of the programme by then-Conservative leader [[David Cameron]]. Barlow also sang "Greatest Day" at the event. When asked if he was supporting the Conservatives at the election, Barlow responded: "I would not be here if I was not."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a214792/gary-barlow-backs-david-cameron.html#~oB8Kt8jFKrZwkd |title=Gary Barlow backs David Cameron |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date= 16 April 2010}}</ref>

===Tax avoidance controversy===
In June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That bandmates Howard Donald and Mark Owen (and over 1,100 other people), Barlow had invested £26 million in music industry investment schemes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9344640/Gary-Barlow%27s-OBE-is-no-problem-for-Downing-Street-despite-tax-avoidance-claims.html |title=Gary Barlow's OBE is no problem despite tax avoidance claims, says Downing Street |work=The Telegraph |location=UK |date= 21 June 2012 |first=Christopher |last=Hope}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as [[tax shelter]]s for wealthy people. Barlow was accused of [[tax avoidance]] rather than [[tax evasion]], as the scheme itself was not illegal at the time Barlow invested in it. Barlow's lawyer responded to the claims, stating he "paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises". In May 2014 a judge ruled that the scheme was set up for the purpose of avoiding tax, with the scheme generating losses of £336 million to enable Barlow and others to offset those losses against taxes they were liable to pay from other earnings. In June 2016 Barlow (and Donald and Owen plus their manager Jonathon Wild) announced they would not be appealing a ruling that they are liable to re-pay the tax.<ref name="The Times 13 June 2016 page 9">The Times 13 June 2016 page 9</ref> Barlow has apologised on Twitter "to anyone who was offended by the tax stories".<ref name="The Times 13 June 2016 page 9"/>
In an interview with BBC Radio in 2020, [[Paul Stenning]], who worked for the band in 1995 under their financial advisor Simon Orange, explained the way the band's finances were structured, saying they were "meticulously disseminated".<ref>BBC Radio Lancashire August 15th 2020</ref>
