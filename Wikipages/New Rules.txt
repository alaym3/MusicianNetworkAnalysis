"'''New Rules'''" is a song by English singer [[Dua Lipa]] from her [[Dua Lipa (album)|eponymous debut studio album]] (2017). The song was written by [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Kirkpatrick also handled the production and offered it to Lipa after it was rejected by multiple artists. The song was released through [[Warner Bros. Records]] for [[Music download|digital download]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] on 7{{nbsp}}July 2017 as the album's seventh single. It is an [[electropop]] and [[tropical house]] track with an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] production that includes [[dance-pop]] beats and [[dancehall]] rhythms. The lyrics see Lipa giving herself a set of rules in order to get over a former boyfriend. Lipa stated that it is the breakup song that she wished she had when she was breaking up with someone.

"New Rules" was met with acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with many labelling it a breakup and female empowerment anthem. The song was nominated for [[Brit Award for Song of the Year|British Single of the Year]] at the [[2018 Brit Awards]] and appeared on year-end lists from publications including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. Commercially, the song became Lipa's first number one single on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached that position in five other territories. {{As of|2021|March}} it is the most streamed song by a British female in the UK and it broke the record for the most weeks on the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Additionally, it became Lipa's first top 10 entry on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 6. The song is certified multi-platinum in 13 territories, including a quadruple platinum in the UK and a diamond award in France and Poland.

It features Lipa staying at the hotel room with her friends, who prevent her from getting back together with her former boyfriend. The visual was met with critical acclaim, many of whom commended its themes of female empowerment. It made Lipa the youngest female artist with a video to surpassing one billion views on [[YouTube]].

She added that she applied this approach with "New Rules", whose lyrics were inspired by Ailin's struggles with the temptation of getting back together with a former boyfriend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/116759/music-interview-emily-warren/ |title=Music Interview: Emily Warren |last=Bulayo |first=Ashley |date=16 February 2018 |website=The Young Folks |access-date=23 March 2017 |archive-date=24 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324083838/https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/116759/music-interview-emily-warren/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The song was passed down by a few artists, including one who thought it did not have a notable [[hook (music)|hook]].<ref name = "The Fader">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/03/08/ian-kirkpatrick-interview-new-rules |title=Ian Kirkpatrick on helping create Dua Lipa's 'New Rules' and other weirdo mega-hits |date=8 March 2018 |work=[[The Fader]] |access-date=23 March 2017 |archive-date=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808082359/http://www.thefader.com/2018/03/08/ian-kirkpatrick-interview-new-rules |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{quote|I still take a lot of pride in being able to write my own songs. My story's coming from me. But 'New Rules' is a song that I felt like I had been in the room and written. I'm so close with Emily [Warren] and Caroline [Ailin] and Ian [Kirkpatrick], who had worked on it, that I feel like it was a song they had written with me in mind. I'm proud of it as if I had been in that room. I just feel so closely to it. I guess I don't have that perspective anymore. But like I said, I still love writing everything. And I'm still going to do it. But it's a song that I feel like I can relate to on a personal level, that I also feel that when I do perform it, it becomes mine and I embody it in a different way.<ref name="gqi"/>}}

The music video for "New Rules" was directed by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, "[[Lost in Your Light]]". The singer invited Scholfield for a cup of tea in London in order to discuss her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model [[Naomi Campbell]] holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a "reference point", explaining that, "I loved the idea of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, that sense of humility, that sense of strength." Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that "narrative of togetherness and empowerment" into it.<ref name="The Cut">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/dua-lipa-new-rules-video-interview.html|title=Dua Lipa Takes Us Behind the Scenes of the 'New Rules' Video|author=Dayna Evans|work=[[The Cut (website)|The Cut]]|date=11 July 2017|access-date=14 July 2017|archive-date=9 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709181938/https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/dua-lipa-new-rules-video-interview.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography.<ref name="bbvd" /> More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.<ref name="bbvd" />

The filming took place in June 2017 at The Confidante, a hotel located in Miami Beach that is part of the Unbound Collection brand by [[Hyatt]].<ref name="bbvd" /> Hyatt's vice president of global brands, Sandra Micek, stated that the collaboration between the artist and the hotel made sense to her because "[The Confidante's] inspiration and its name came from the notion of being a trusted friend".<ref name="ad"/> Regarding the shooting, Scholfield commented that the camera was quite near during the dance routines, in order to film more uninterrupted [[single-take|single takes]].<ref name="The Cut"/> During an interview with NPR, Lipa commented that, "What I wanted to convey in this video is the unity and togetherness of women supporting each other, helping each other and looking after each other in a situation."<ref name="npr" /> The visual premiered through Lipa's [[YouTube]] account on 7{{nbsp}}July 2017.<ref name="rs">{{cite web |last=Reed |first=Ryan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-dua-lipa-walk-on-water-strut-around-hotel-in-new-rules-video-w491317 |title=Watch Dua Lipa Walk on Water, Strut Around Hotel in 'New Rules' Video |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-access=limited|date=7 July 2017 |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616231335/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-dua-lipa-walk-on-water-strut-around-hotel-in-new-rules-video-w491317 |url-status=live }}</ref> After this, Hyatt released two behind-the-scenes clips of the shooting.<ref name="ad">{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/this-buzzy-pop-singers-new-video-has-a-notable-costar-hyatts-confidante-hotel/ |title=This Buzzy Pop Singer's New Video Has a Notable Costar: Hyatt's Confidante Hotel |last=Stanley |first=T.L. |date=13 July 2017 |work=[[Adweek]] |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-date=25 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825030922/http://www.adweek.com/creativity/this-buzzy-pop-singers-new-video-has-a-notable-costar-hyatts-confidante-hotel/ |url-status=live }}</ref> <!-- Ryan Reed of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated the music video "follows Lipa throughout Miami's Confidante Hotel, as she toils with the idea of giving her ex a second chance.

===Synopsis===
[[File:Dua Lipa New Rules music video.jpg|right|300px|thumb|alt=A group of women holding each other while wearing bathrobes.|Lipa (far left) and her on-screen friends on the music video for "New Rules". The women are holding each other during the sleepover scene. The clip has been praised for its themes of female empowerment and friendship.]]
The video starts with a shot of the outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and in the context of the track, Lipa is lying on a bed, thinking of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway.<ref name="rs"/> There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other.<ref name="npr" /> They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.

After the song's [[bridge (music)|bridge]], one of the women makes plans of reuniting with her former boyfriend, but is stopped by Lipa, who gives her the advice she received at the beginning of the visual. After this, the group perform a choreography in front of the pool, in which they pull "each other in closer, in an unbreakable ring of limbs". This is Lipa and Scholfield's favorite scene, with the latter stating, "That wrapped up the whole story for me. The viewer is on the outside, but that choreography pulls you into them, and makes you a part of that connection, too."<ref name="The Cut"/> The video ends with the women standing in front of the pool, with the camera turning upside-down and then showing a group of flamingos at the same location.
