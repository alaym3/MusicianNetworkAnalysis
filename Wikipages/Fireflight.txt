'''Fireflight''' is an American [[Christian rock]] band formed in [[Eustis, Florida]] in 1999.<ref name="AllMusicBio">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p710621|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fireflight Biography|year=2008|publisher=Allmusic |access-date=January 31, 2009}}</ref> The band is signed by [[Flicker Records]]. They have played in [[ShoutFest]], [[Revelation Generation]], and have been featured on The Scars Remain tour with [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]], [[Family Force 5]], and [[Decyfer Down]]. While touring, they wrote their third album, ''[[Unbreakable (Fireflight album)|Unbreakable]]'' (2008), and released their first single off the album, "Unbreakable". They performed at [[Winter Jam Tour Spectacular|Winter Jam]] 2010 and released their fourth full-length album ''[[For Those Who Wait]]'' in February. On December 1, 2010, they were nominated for their first Grammy award. In 2012 they came out with their fifth full-length album ''[[Now (Fireflight album)|Now]]''.

==History==
Guitarists Justin Cox and Glenn Drennen had gone to school together. Glenn had the idea to start a band with his wife Wendy (bassist) and Justin. They were then in need of a singer. Glenn and Wendy went to Glenn's younger brother's graduation and heard Dawn Futch (later Dawn Michele) (lead singer) singing during the graduation service; they asked her to be in the group and she agreed to it. The band was looking for a drummer at this point, and through a mutual friend they met Phee Shorb, who agreed to play drums.

The name "Fireflight" was suggested by Dawn Michele shortly before they did a small performance at a church. The name Fireflight has no meaning, as suggested by the band in an interview with Jesus Freak Hideout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Fireflight2007.asp |title=Fireflight Interview, 2007 |date=February 19, 2007 |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |access-date=March 16, 2009}}</ref>

They independently released the album ''Glam-rök'', which was produced by guitarist Justin Cox, in 2002.<ref name="AllMusicBio" /> They followed it up with the five-track [[extended play|EP]] ''On the Subject of Moving Forward'' in 2004 before they were signed to the major record label [[Flicker Records]].<ref name="AllMusicBio" />

After years of touring (it is estimated they play 140 shows every year), they released their major label debut album ''The Healing of Harms'' in 2006 with two No.&nbsp;1 singles "You Decide" and "Waiting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/headlines/11568678/|title=Christian Music, Christ, Community - CCMMagazine.com|work=ccmmagazine.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215062015/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/headlines/11568678/|archive-date=December 15, 2008}}</ref>
The album was a hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;37 on Billboard magazine's Top Christian Albums chart.<ref name="AllMusicBio" /> The song "You Decide," featuring [[Josh Brown (musician)|Josh Brown]] of [[Day of Fire]], was the top request at TVU music television in August 2006. It was the second most played song on Christian Rock radio stations according to the September 1, 2006, ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' magazine airplay chart, No.&nbsp;11 on the R&R Christian Hit Radio charts on October 23, 2006, and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Radio Weekly chart. On Billboard's chart, it peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on the [[Hot Christian Singles]] chart<ref name="AllMusicBio" /> and it finished in the Top 25 of 2006 for the network radio station Air1.

Their second single to rock radio, "Waiting," had reached No.&nbsp;1 R&R and CRW Christian Rock chart, and stayed there for 3 consecutive weeks during the month of February 2007. They concurrently released the songs "It's You," "Star of the Show," and "Attitude" to Christian Hit Radio stations.

During another extensive year of touring, the band was experiencing an emotional roller coaster while writing their album "Unbreakable." Dawn describes on their MySpace how stressful and intense writing the album was:

<blockquote>
"It almost felt like things were out of control," says Dawn. "We'd gone through a difficult year as a band with a lot of emotional ups and downs. We basically lived together in a van while writing the new album, and that put us in a pressure cooker. All the stresses were magnified because you're completely out of your comfort zone, and it really does crank up the intensity of the writing. We poured all of our hope, sorrow, anger, dreams and fears into the music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/fireflight|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Fireflight debuted clips of its single "Unbreakable" in promos for the new ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'' television series. "Unbreakable" is the title song from their album released in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.cmcentral.com/rss/7563.html new Fireflight song "Unbreakable" debuts on NBC tonight]; October 24, 2007; Jesus Freak Hideout, Retrieved November 6, 2007</ref> The single rose to the number one spot on CRW and R&R's Christian Rock charts seven weeks after its release.<ref name=ChristianMusicCentralUnbreakable>[http://jesusfreakhideout.com/news/2007/10/24.NEW%20FIREFLIGHT%20SONG%20UNBREAKABLE%20DEBUTS%20ON%20NBC%20TONIGHT.asp Fireflight Tops Rock Charts for Third Week]; February 20, 2008; [[Christian Music Central]], Retrieved February 27, 2008</ref> The band's third number one rock song was the most added song on [[Christian Hit Radio]] radio stations in February 2008.<ref name=ChristianMusicCentralUnbreakable /> It ended 2008 as the 14th most-played song [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian CHR]] radio according to [[R&R (magazine)|R&R magazine's]] [[Contemporary Christian Music|Christian CHR]] chart.<ref name=RR2008CHR>[http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/08/Christian_CHR_songs.asp 2008 Year End Charts/Top Christian CHR songs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525080129/http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/08/Christian_CHR_songs.asp |date=May 25, 2009 }}, [[R&R (magazine)|R&R magazine]], Retrieved January 15, 2009</ref>

Fireflight's fourth full-length album entitled ''[[For Those Who Wait]]'' was released on February 9, 2010.

"Desperate" was unveiled on February 9, 2010, to coincide with the release of the new album. The album has peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on Billboard Hot Christian Albums, and is their highest charting CD. Desperate was once a No.&nbsp;1 single on christianrock.net and on BDSradio.com's Christian Rock chart, and it peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Christian CHR chart on the same website.
