==Early life and family==
John Towner Williams was born on February 8, 1932, in [[Flushing, Queens]], [[New York City]], to Esther (née Towner) and [[Johnny Williams (drummer)|Johnny Williams]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revistaesfinge.com/?p=569|title=John Williams, el compositor de la aventura|publisher=Revista Esfinge|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> a jazz drummer and percussionist who played with the [[Raymond Scott]] Quintet. Williams said of his lineage: "My father was a [[Maine]] man—we were very close. My mother was from [[Boston]]. My father's parents ran a department store in [[Bangor, Maine]], and my mother's father was a cabinetmaker. [...] People with those roots are not inclined to be lazy."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=David|title=The King of Popcorn|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 25, 1997|page=10s}}</ref>

In 1948, the Williams family moved to [[Los Angeles]] where John attended [[North Hollywood High School]], graduating in 1950. He later attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and studied composition privately with the Italian composer [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]].<ref name="sony classical williams biography">{{cite web|url=http://sonyclassical.com/artists/williams_composer/adbio.html |title=Sony Classical Williams Biography |access-date=October 12, 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012155709/http://sonyclassical.com/artists/williams_composer/adbio.html |archive-date=October 12, 2007}} at www.sonybmgmasterworks.com; retrieved September 29, 2007.

In 1955, following his Air Force service, Williams moved to New York City and entered the [[Juilliard School]], where he studied piano with [[Rosina Lhévinne]].<ref name="sony classical williams biography"/> He was originally set on becoming a concert pianist but after hearing contemporary pianists like John Browning and Van Cliburn perform, switched his focus to composition.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lunden |first1=Jeff |title=John Williams's Inevitable Themes |url=https://www.apr.org/post/john-williams-inevitable-themes |website=Alabama Public Radio |publisher=Alabama Public Radio |access-date=15 July 2021}}</ref> During this time Williams worked as a jazz pianist in the city's many jazz clubs.

==Early career==
After his studies at Juilliard and the [[Eastman School of Music]], Williams returned to Los Angeles, where he began working as an [[orchestrator]] at film studios. Among other composers, Williams worked with [[Franz Waxman]], [[Bernard Herrmann]], and [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], and also with his fellow orchestrators [[Conrad Salinger]] and Bob Franklyn.<ref>''Films & Filming'', vol. 24, 1977, p. 32</ref>

Williams was also a studio pianist and session musician, performing on film scores by composers such as [[Jerry Goldsmith]], [[Elmer Bernstein]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], and [[Henry Mancini]]. With Mancini he recorded the scores of 1959's ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', 1962's [[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|''Days of Wine and Roses'']], and 1963's ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]''. With Elmer Bernstein, he performed on the score of [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions]]' ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]''. Williams plays the piano part of the guitar-piano [[ostinato]] in the famous Mancini ''Peter Gunn'' title theme.<ref>Tribute to John Williams, ca. 1991.</ref><ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/John-Williams.html John Williams Biography] at FilmReference.com.</ref>  On the ''Peter Gunn'' soundtrack, he collaborated with guitarist Bob Bain, bassist Rolly Bundock, and drummer [[Jack Sperling]], many of whom were also featured on the ''[[Mr. Lucky (TV series)|Mr. Lucky]]'' television series. Williams was the pianist for the soundtrack for the adaptation of Leonard Bernstein's musical, the 1961 ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'',<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite web |last1=Grieving |first1=Tim |title=John Williams' early life: How a NoHo kid and UCLA Bruin became the movie music man |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-john-williams-early-life-20180718-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=15 July 2021}}</ref> and the 1960 film, ''[[The Apartment]]''.

Williams during this time period was known as Johnny Williams, and under this name, released several jazz albums, including ''World on a String'' and ''The John Towner Touch''.<ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>

Although skilled in a variety of 20th-century compositional idioms, Williams's most familiar style may be described as a form of [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromanticism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202200618/http://www.wsu.edu/%7Ebrians/hum_303/romanticism.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 2, 1998|title=Romanticism|access-date=August 25, 2006}}</ref> which was inspired by the late 19th century's large-scale orchestral music—in the style of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] or [[Richard Wagner]] and their [[Richard Wagner#Influence on cinema|concept]] of [[leitmotif]]—that inspired his film music predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|title=Star Wars and Wagner's Ring|access-date=August 15, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726141647/http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|archive-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref>

Williams's first film composition was for ''You Are Welcome''—a promotional film for the tourist information office of [[Newfoundland]], created in 1954 when Williams was stationed at [[Pepperrell Air Force Base]].<ref name="auto"/>  Williams's first feature film composition was in 1958 for the [[B movie]] ''[[Daddy-O]]'', and his first screen credit came two years later in ''[[Because They're Young]]''.

Williams also composed music for various television programs in the same time period including the pilot episode of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'',<ref>"Marooned" credits (unaired pilot, October 16, 1962)</ref> ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' (1959–60), the ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965–68), ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' (1966–67), and ''[[Land of the Giants]]'' (the last three created by the prolific TV producer [[Irwin Allen]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iann.net/giants/|title=Deanna Lund Meets John Williams At Lincoln Party|publisher=Irwin Allen News Network|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> He also worked on several episodes of ''[[M Squad]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050035/fullcredits|title=M Squad:Full cast and crew|website=IMDb.com}}</ref><ref>RCA Victor PL-45929</ref>

He soon gained notice in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for his versatility in composing jazz, piano, and symphonic music. Williams received his first Academy Award nomination for his score for 1967's [[Valley of the Dolls (film)|''Valley of the Dolls'']], and was nominated again for his score for 1969's [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'']]. He won his first Academy Award for his score adaptation for the 1971 film [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|''Fiddler on the Roof'']]. In 1972, he composed the score for the [[Robert Altman]]-directed psychological thriller ''[[Images (film)|Images]]'' (recorded in collaboration with noted percussionist [[Stomu Yamashta]]), which earned him another nomination in the category Best Music, Original Dramatic Score at the 1973 [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name="oscars" />

Williams's prominence grew in the early 1970s thanks to his work for now-film producer [[Irwin Allen]]'s disaster films. He wrote the scores for 1972's [[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|''The Poseidon Adventure'']] and 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. He also scored Universal's 1974 film [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] for director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]], completing a "trinity" of scores for the decade's highest-grossing "disaster films", and the 1972 film ''[[The Cowboys]]'', a western starring [[John Wayne]] and directed by [[Mark Rydell]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068421/fullcredits "The Cowboys (1972) – Full Cast and Crew"], imdb.com; retrieved November 30, 2015.</ref>

In 1974, director [[Steven Spielberg]] approached Williams to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''. They teamed up again a year later for Spielberg's second film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Widely considered a classic suspense film, its score's ominous, two-note [[ostinato]] has become synonymous with sharks and approaching danger. The score earned Williams his second Academy Award, his first for an original composition.<ref name="oscars">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliams.org/reference/awards.html|title=Academy Awards and Nominations|publisher=John Williams Web Pages|access-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331123940/http://www.johnwilliams.org/reference/awards.html|archive-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Spielberg and Williams began a long collaboration on their next feature film, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. During the two-year collaboration, they crafted its distinctive five-note figure that functions both in the background music and as the [[recognition signal|communications signal]] of the film's [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. Williams also used a system of musical hand signals in the film that were based on [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] created by [[John Curwen]] and refined by [[Zoltán Kodály]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vikileak.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/encounters-not-close-enough|title=Encounters Not Close Enough|publisher=Vikileaks|date=January 11, 2011|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> In 1975 [[Clint Eastwood]] chose Williams to score his classic climbing film [[The Eiger Sanction]].

During the same period, Spielberg recommended Williams to his friend and fellow director [[George Lucas]], who needed a composer to score his ambitious 1977 [[space opera|space epic]] film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Williams eventually delivered a grand symphonic score in the fashion of [[Richard Strauss]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood composers [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. The [[Star Wars (Main Title)|Star Wars' theme]] is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Force Theme]]" and "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Princess Leia's Theme]]" are well-known examples of [[leitmotif]]. Both the film and its score were immensely successful—it remains the highest grossing non-[[popular music]] recording of all time—and Williams won another [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2013/05/01/star-wars-episode-7-john-williams/|title='Star Wars Episode 7': John Williams Will Probably Score the Sequel, According to J.

In 1980, Williams returned to score ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', introducing "[[The Imperial March]]" as the theme for [[Darth Vader]] and the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in The Empire Strikes Back|Yoda's Theme]]", and "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in The Empire Strikes Back|Han Solo and the Princess]]". The original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy concluded with the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', for which Williams's score provided most notably the "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Emperor's Theme]]", "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Parade of the Ewoks]]", and "[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Luke and Leia]]". Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations.<ref name="oscars" />
[[File:John Williams scoring Raiders.jpg|thumb|left|John Williams conducting the score to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the Avery Fisher Hall]]

Williams scored the 1976 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Family Plot]]''. Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, "Murder can be fun." Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.

Williams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as "Can You Read My Mind", appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as "The Raiders March" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name="oscars" />

In 1985, Williams was commissioned by NBC to compose a [[television news music package]] for various network news spots. The package, which Williams named "[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]", consists of four movements, two of which are still used heavily by NBC today for ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', and ''[[Meet the Press]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kaplan |first1=Peter |title=JOHN WILLIAMS CREATES THEMES FOR NBC NEWS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/10/arts/john-williams-creates-themes-for-nbc-news.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=15 July 2021}}</ref>

The Spielberg–Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies 2005's ''[[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]]'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''. Spielberg has said, "I call it an honorable privilege to regard John Williams as a friend."<ref name="Spielberg_quote_cite">{{cite AV media notes|last=Spielberg|first=Steven|author-link=Steven Spielberg|title=Jurassic Park Audio CD (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD)|publisher=[[MCA Records|MCA]]|chapter=Back cover|year=1993}} "...and I consider it a privilege to call John my Friend."</ref>

1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'' proved to be a challenge for Williams, and after viewing the rough cut with Spielberg, was originally hesitant to score the film, being so overcome with emotion watching the cut. He told Spielberg, "I really think you need a better composer than I am for this film. " Spielberg then replied, "I know, but they’re all dead."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniloff |first1=Caleb |title=Williams surprises Spielberg |url=https://www.bu.edu/articles/2009/williams-surprises-spielberg/ |website=BU Today |publisher=Boston University |access-date=15 July 2021}}</ref> Williams enlisted the help of classical violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] to play the main theme for the film. Williams then garnered his 5th Oscar for Best Original Score.

In 1999, Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was "[[Duel of the Fates]]", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams – Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 "Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsaber battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels. While much of the film failed to meet the expectations generated by its hype, this scene stood out as a dazzling work of fight choreography, and the score was an important part of that."</ref> utilizing harsh [[Sanskrit]] lyrics that broadened the style of music used in the ''Star Wars'' films. It used vocal melodies instead of his usual compositions using brass instruments. Also of note was "Anakin's Theme", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister "Imperial March". For ''Episode II'' Williams composed "Across the Stars", a love theme for [[Padmé Amidala]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] (mirroring the love theme composed for ''The Empire Strikes Back'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-4-of-6-duel-of-the-fates/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 4|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-5-of-6-across-the-stars//|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 5|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The final installment combined many of the themes created for the series' previous films, including "The Emperor's Theme", "The Imperial March", "Across the Stars", "Duel of the Fates", "The Force Theme", "Rebel Fanfare", "Luke's Theme", and "Princess Leia's Theme", as well as new themes for [[General Grievous]] and the film's climax, titled "Battle of the Heroes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-6-of-6-battle-of-the-heroes/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 6|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

In the new millennium Williams scored the first three film adaptations of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, "Hedwig's Theme", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that "their schedules simply did not align", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows – Part 1 junket in London|date=November 12, 2010|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref>

In 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]'', Williams composed a reorchestrated score for the [[Universal Pictures]] logo segueing to music from the movie.

In 2006, ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was directed by [[Bryan Singer]], best known for directing the first two films in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' series]]. Singer did not request Williams to compose a score for the intentionally Donner-esque film, but he employed the skills of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' composer [[John Ottman]] to incorporate Williams's original ''Superman'' theme as well as those for [[Lois Lane]], [[Superman music|Krypton]] and [[Superman music#First appearance in Superman|Smallville]]. In 2011 the "Main Title Theme" and elements of "Can You Read My Mind" were used in the final scene of "Finale", the series finale of the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] television series ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref name="smallville">{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|series-link=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer, [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] & Kelly Souders (writers); [[Greg Beeman]] & [[Kevin Fair]] (directors)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|air-date=May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref> [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], recommended by Williams to the producers, performed a similar role for ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interviewdd2.htm|title=Composer Don Davis, Welcome to Jurassic Park|website=Tracksounds.com|date=June 29, 2001|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

In 2008, Williams returned to the ''Indiana Jones'' series to score the fourth film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. He received a Grammy nomination for his work on the film. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was also the only film score from the ''Indiana Jones'' film series not to be nominated for an Academy Award. Also in 2008 Williams composed music for two documentaries, ''Warner at War''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323555/fullcredits Warner at War (2008) (TV) – Full cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed November 3, 2015.</ref> and ''A Timeless Call'',<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287857/fullcredits A Timeless Call (2008) – cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed December 28, 2015.</ref> the latter directed by Spielberg.

In 2011, after a three-year absence from film scoring, Williams composed the scores for Spielberg's ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''. Both scores received overwhelmingly positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/tintin.html|title=The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (John Williams)|website=Filmtracks.com|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/war_horse.html|title=War Horse (John Williams)|website=Filmtracks.com|date=November 21, 2011|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviecues.com/tintin|title=The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (John Williams)|website=Moviecues.com|date=November 1, 2011|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviecues.com/war-horse|title=War Horse (John Williams)|website=Moviecues.com|date=December 4, 2011|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviemusicuk.us/2011/10/23/the-adventures-of-tintin-the-secret-of-the-unicorn-john-williams|title=The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn&nbsp;– John Williams|website=Moviemusicuk.us|date=October 23, 2011|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-wave.net/?p=1883|title=The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn soundtrack review|date=December 4, 2011|website=Movie-wave.net|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> and earned Academy Award nominations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|title=Winners for the 84th Academy Awards|website=Oscars.org|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> the latter also being nominated for a Golden Globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/blog/2011/12/the-69th-annual-golden-globe-awards-nominations|title=The 69th Annual Golden Globe Awards Nominations &#124; Official Website of the HFPA and the Golden Globe Awards|website=Goldenglobes.org|date=December 15, 2011|access-date=April 30, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507232315/http://www.goldenglobes.org/blog/2011/12/the-69th-annual-golden-globe-awards-nominations/|archive-date=May 7, 2012}}</ref> The Oscar nominations were Williams's 46th and 47th, making him the most nominated musician in Academy Award history (having previously been tied with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s 45 nominations), and the second most nominated overall, behind Walt Disney.

From 1980 to 1993 Williams served as the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]'s Principal Conductor, succeeding [[Arthur Fiedler]]. Williams never met Fiedler in person but spoke with him by telephone. His arrival as the Pops' new leader in the spring of 1980 allowed him to devote part of the Pops' first PBS broadcast of the season to presenting his new compositions for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Knight |first1=Michael |title=John Williams Opens Season With Pops; Meredith and C-3PO Divided Into Thirds Redecorating the Old House |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/04/30/archives/john-williams-opens-season-with-pops-meredith-and-c3po-divided-into.html |access-date=15 July 2021 |agency=New York Times |date=April 30, 1980}}</ref>

==Legacy==
John Williams is regarded as one of the most influential film composers. His work has influenced other film composers, as well as contemporary classical and popular music. The Norwegian classical composer [[Marcus Paus]] argues that Williams's "very satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework" makes him "one of the great composers of any century".<ref name="thelegacyofjohnwilliams">{{cite web |url=https://thelegacyofjohnwilliams.com/2020/06/09/marcus-paus-podcast/ |title= Legacy Conversations: Marcus Paus |date=June 9, 2020|website=The Legacy of John Williams}}</ref><ref name="Green">{{cite magazine |last1=Green |first1=Edward |title=Interview with Composer Marcus Paus |journal= Iconi |date=2020 |url=http://journaliconi.com/index.php/iconi/article/view/89/93|volume=2|issue=3|pages=56–67}}</ref>

Similarly, Williams's film music has clear influences from other classical and film composers, including [[Holst]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Williams vs Gustav Holst or Star Wars Vs The Planets - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IX1jSVmaAs|access-date=July 15, 2020|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold]], and others. But while many have specifically referenced the similarities,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gabler|first=Jay|title=Star Wars music: What were John Williams' classical influences?|url=http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2015/10/20/star-wars-john-williams-influences|access-date=July 15, 2020|website=Classicalmpr.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Barone|first=Joshua|date=September 14, 2017|title=Hear the Music That Inspired 'Star Wars'|language=en-US|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/arts/music/star-wars-soundtrack-classical-music-new-york-philharmonic.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> these are generally attributed to the natural influence of one composer on another.

==Personal life==
In 1956, Williams married [[Barbara Ruick]], an American actress and singer. They had three children: Jennifer (b. 1956), Mark Towner Williams (b. 1958), and [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph]] (b. 1960), the lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theslateonline.com/article/2018/10/joseph-williams-talks-about-music-life-during-totos-40th-trip-around-the-sun|title=Joseph Williams talks about music, life during Toto's 40th trip around the sun|website=The Slate}}</ref> The two remained married until her death in 1974.
