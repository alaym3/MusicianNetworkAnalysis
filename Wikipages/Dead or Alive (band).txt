'''Dead or Alive''' were an English [[Pop music|pop]] band that released seven albums from 1984 to 2000. The band formed in 1980 in [[Liverpool]] and found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the [[UK Top 40]] and three albums on the UK Top 30. They were the first band under the production team of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] to have a number-one single. At the peak of their success, the lineup consisted of [[Pete Burns]] (vocals), Mike Percy (bass), Steve Coy (drums) and Tim Lever (keyboards).

Two of the band's singles reached the U.S. Top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]" <ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/you-spin-me-round-like-a-record-mt0011392511 |title=You Spin Me Round | access-date=27 August 2021}}</ref>(No.&nbsp;11 in August 1985) and "[[Brand New Lover]]" (No.&nbsp;15 in March 1987).

"You Spin Me Round" peaked at number one for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns' appearance on the television reality show ''[[Big Brother (UK)#Celebrity Big Brother|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. It also became the first of two singles to top the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked them as the 96th most successful "dance artist" of all time. As of 2017 Dead or Alive had sold over 30 million albums and 28 million singles worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> The band was discontinued following Pete Burns' death in 2016.

==History==
===Formation and early career of band===
[[File:Nightmares In wax 1980.jpg|thumb|Nightmares in Wax (March 1980)]]
In 1977, Burns formed a band with contemporaries [[Julian Cope]], [[Pete Wylie]], and Phil Hurst, calling themselves The Mystery Girls. They played only one gig (opening for [[Sham 69]] at [[Eric's Club|Eric's]] in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating.<ref name="Greene">Greene, Jo-Ann "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p481612|pure_url=yes}} Nightmares in Wax Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> Burns returned in early 1979 with a new band, Nightmares in Wax (original name: 'Rainbows Over Nagasaki'), featuring a [[Gothic rock|gothic post-punk]] sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid (ex-Crash Course and Glass Torpedoes), bassist Rob Jones, who left soon afterwards to be replaced by Walter Ogden, and drummer Paul Hornby, formerly of 051 and [[Pink Military]], who also exited soon after the band's formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst.<ref name="Greene" /> Nightmares in Wax played their first gig supporting [[Wire (band)|Wire]] at Eric's in July 1979,<ref>Jonathan Buckley, Mark Ellingham, Justin Lewis, and Jill Furmanovsky (1996) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|978-1-85828-201-5}}</ref> and, around the same time, recorded demos which included a cover of the [[Simon Dupree and the Big Sound]] song "Kites", a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric's Records label, their only release, a three-track 7" EP entitled ''Birth of a Nation'', appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, "Black Leather" and "Shangri-La", was released in 1985.<ref>Gimarc, George (2005) ''Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970–1982'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-848-6}}, p.312</ref> The EP featured "Black Leather", which halfway through turned into [[K.C. & the Sunshine Band]]'s "[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]" (a song later revived by Dead or Alive).<ref name="Greene" />

Ogden left the band at the beginning of November 1979 shortly before the recording of demos for the planned Inevitable Records release. Bassist Ambrose Reynolds helped out on both these sessions and those for the EP a month later. Pete Lloyd joined in January 1980 and the band returned to playing live shows early in February. Lloyd and Reid left the band in March 1980, and Hurst followed in April. Burns and Healy were then joined by bassist Sue James, guitarist Adrian Mitchley, and drummer Joe Musker rehearsing for a few months under the name No Self Control, this being dropped in favour of Dead Or Alive shortly before the release of the next single "I'm Falling". The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Burns' eccentric and [[androgynous]] appearance began attracting attention, often leading to comparisons with [[Culture Club]] and its lead singer [[Boy George]].<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=657}}</ref>

Dead or Alive's singles started charting on the [[UK Indie Chart]], beginning with 1982's "The Stranger" reaching No.&nbsp;7 on that chart.<ref name="Lazell">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980–1989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}, p.61</ref> This prompted major label [[Epic Records]] to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single "[[Misty Circles]]", which appeared at No.&nbsp;100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. At this point, the band was a five-piece consisting of Burns, Mike Percy (bass), Tim Lever (keyboards/sax), Steve Coy (drums), and [[Wayne Hussey]] (guitar). Two more singles, "What I Want" and "I'd Do Anything", attracted club play, but mainstream success continued to elude the band.

Dead or Alive's debut album, ''[[Sophisticated Boom Boom]]'', was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, "[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]", a remake of the 1975 hit by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Hussey departed Dead or Alive just before the album's release. The single peaked at No.&nbsp;22 in the UK and the album at No.&nbsp;29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Official Charts Company – Dead Or Alive |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=2013-03-14 |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>

===1980s chart success===
Now a four-piece following the departure of Hussey, in May 1985 the band released its second album ''[[Youthquake (album)|Youthquake]]'' (US No.&nbsp;31, UK No.&nbsp;9), produced by the then-fledgling songwriting/production team of [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]], [[Matt Aitken]], and [[Pete Waterman]] known as [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] (SAW). The single "[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiVXigrjjQ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104001247/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiVXigrjjQ |date=4 November 2007 }}</ref> went to number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=4 |title=Official UK Singles Top 100 – 23 March 2013 &#124; Official UK Top 40 |publisher=Theofficialcharts.com |access-date=2013-03-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310173445/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=4 |archive-date=10 March 2010}}</ref> after having lingered outside the Top 40 for over two months (the song was SAW's first chart-topping single).<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 3: You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) on Apple Podcasts|url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-3-you-spin-me-round-like-a-record/id1565879477?i=1000523581374|access-date=2021-08-06|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en-AU}}</ref> The song also hit No.&nbsp;11 in the US and No.&nbsp;1 in Canada.<ref name=UScharts>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-or-alive-mn0000226556|awards ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316042837/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-or-alive-mn0000226556 |date=16 March 2013 }}</ref> Other album tracks released as singles included "[[Lover Come Back to Me (Dead or Alive song)|Lover Come Back To Me]]", "[[In Too Deep (Dead or Alive song)|In Too Deep]]", and "[[My Heart Goes Bang (Get Me to the Doctor)|My Heart Goes Bang]]". They all reached the UK Top 30.

In late 1986, Dead or Alive released their third album, ''[[Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know (Dead or Alive album)|Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know]]'' (US No.&nbsp;52, UK No.&nbsp;27), also produced by SAW. The lead single "[[Brand New Lover]]" became a modest UK hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No.&nbsp;15 on the US Hot 100, and number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play|''Billboard'' dance chart]].<ref name=UScharts/> Three more singles from the album were released, although none saw any notable US success on the pop charts. All of these singles caused some sort of controversy in the UK. The most successful in the UK was "Something in My House" (UK No.&nbsp;12), tonally Gothic and with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a [[Satan]]ic altar, featuring an inverted cross. A 12" version of the song, the 'Mortevicar Mix', featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and a sampling from the ''[[George A. Romero]]'' American movie trailer from his film ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]) and other '80s horror films. A third single, "Hooked on Love", failed to make the UK Top 40 and had a "Gothic" overtone that had been added in a post-production remix.

After the release of the album, Tim Lever and Mike Percy left the band to form careers as mixers and producers aka 'One World Productions'. The pair owned and operated [[Steelworks Studios]] in [[Sheffield]], UK.<ref>[http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629050935/http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html |date=29 June 2007 }}</ref> As mixers and producers, Lever and Percy experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like [[S Club 7]], [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]], and [[Robbie Williams]]. Lever and Percy have since left the studio. In 1987, Dead or Alive released their greatest hits album ''[[Rip It Up (Dead or Alive album)|Rip It Up]]'', and a concert tour of the same name. In mid 1988, Dead or Alive, now pared down to a duo of Burns and Coy, released the self-produced ''[[Nude (Dead or Alive album)|Nude]]'', which featured the single "[[Turn Around and Count 2 Ten]]". It was followed by "[[Come Home with Me Baby]]". The single was a US club hit, including number one on the US dance charts.<ref name=UScharts/>

===1980s and early 1990s success in Japan===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, at the height of the bubble economy, the disco boom was a huge success in Japan. Burns made numerous appearances on national television, including "Yoru no Hit Studio", and his music was regularly selected by the Maharaja, the largest and most exclusive disco chain at the time. A few cover songs by Japanese singers have been released. 

As a result, Dead or Alive had a great influence on Japanese idol songs and their successors, J-Pop and Visual Kei. Even after the mid-1990s, when the band had passed the peak of their popularity elsewhere, their popularity in Japan was so high that some of their later albums were released only in Japan, and they visited Japan frequently.

===1990s===
1990 saw the release of ''[[Fan the Flame (Part 1)]]''; an album released only in Japan. The album had three singles, "Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)", "Gone Too Long", and "Unhappy Birthday". The band had planned to release ''Fan the Flame (Part 2)'' in 1992, which was similar in style to Part 1, but with the modest sales of Part 1 in UK, Part 2 was never released. It would have featured tracks such as "I Don't Care About Your Heart", as well as a cover of Barry White's "[[It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me]]". Some tracks were later re-recorded for the band's ''[[Nukleopatra]]'' album. It is often confused with the acoustic ''Love, Pete'' album, which was sold in cassette form on the band's 1992 tour (during which tracks from Part 2 were previewed).

For a few years, Dead or Alive were mostly inactive in the recording studio. Burns resurfaced in 1994 as vocalist on a single for the Italian [[techno]] outfit Glam. Burns helped write the single, "Sex Drive", which was a return to the dance floor. Burns and Coy flirted with the idea of recording under the name International Chrysis, named after the late [[International Chrysis|transsexual nightclub performer]], and released a single as such in 1994, a [[cover version]] of [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Rebel Rebel]]".

The year 1995 saw new work from Dead or Alive with new keyboardists Jason Alburey and Dean Bright, joining Burns and Coy for the album ''[[Nukleopatra]]''. The album featured a smattering of previously released material, including "Rebel Rebel", "Sex Drive", and two tracks that originally appeared on ''Fan the Flame (Part 1)'', "Gone Too Long" and "Unhappy Birthday". The album also featured a cover of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "Picture This". Initially released in Japan only, ''Nukleopatra'' was later released in Australia, Singapore, South Africa, France and the United States, and each release sported different cover art, track listings, and song versions. Many releases of ''Nukleopatra'' also included one or more remixes of "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)".

===2000s===
In 2000, Dead or Alive released ''[[Fragile (Dead or Alive album)|Fragile]]'', a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including [[U2]]'s "[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]" and [[Nick Kamen]]'s "I Promised Myself". This would eventually be their seventh and final studio album. A new remix album, ''[[Unbreakable (Dead or Alive album)|Unbreakable]]'', was released in 2001. This was followed by a greatest hits album entitled ''[[Evolution: the Hits]]'', released in 2003 which featured yet another remix of "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"; both of them enjoyed, for the first time since ''Nude'', a UK release, with "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" re-entering the Top 40. Later on in 2003, Alburey and Bright departed the band, leaving Dead or Alive once again a duo of Burns and Coy.

In 2004, Burns enjoyed solo success with the [[Pet Shop Boys]]-produced track "Jack and Jill Party". Although only released through the Pet Shop Boys website, the track reached number 75 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Official Charts Company – Pete Burns |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=2004-06-19 |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>

===2010s===
In September 2010, Burns released a new single, "Never Marry an Icon". Even though Burns stated Dead or Alive had ceased to exist in 2011, Coy later declared the moniker was still active and the band was not over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadoralive.net/newsite/QA_with_Pete.pdf |title=Transcript of Facebook Chat with Pete held on 21 August 2011 |publisher=Deadoralive.net |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>

On 21 December 2012, Burns and Coy (as Dead or Alive) performed at the [[Pete Waterman]] concert, Hit Factory Live<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livenation.co.uk/artist/hit-factory-live-tickets |title=Hit Factory Live Tickets, Tour & Concert Information &#124; Live Nation UK |publisher=Livenation.co.uk |access-date=2013-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211023205/http://www.livenation.co.uk/artist/hit-factory-live-tickets |archive-date=11 February 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> at London's O2 Arena. Other artists on the bill included Jason Donovan, Rick Astley, Steps, Sinitta, Pepsi & Shirlie, Hazell Dean, Princess, Sybil, 2 Unlimited, Lonnie Gordon and Brother Beyond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/hit-factory-live-christmas-cracker-to-take-place-at-londons-02-20121022 |title=Hit Factory Live Christmas Cracker To Take Place at London's 02 &#124; News &#124; Music News |publisher=Noise11 |date=2012-10-22 |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>

Burns died of cardiac arrest on 23 October 2016, at the age of 57, effectively ending the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dead or Alive singer Pete Burns dies|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37755445|website=BBC News|access-date=24 October 2016|date=24 October 2016}}</ref>

On 28 October 2016, a 19-disc box set titled ''Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI'' was released by Edsel Records. The box set featured all records, singles and rarities produced by Dead or Alive from 1983 to 2010, including Pete Burns' solo releases. Coy hinted there may be a second box set in the future to come and previously unreleased Dead or Alive albums as well.

Steve Coy died on 4 May 2018 at the age of 56, after some severe illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://burningtheground.net/2018/05/steve-coy-dead-or-alive-1962-2018/|title=Steve Coy (Dead Or Alive) 1962–2018|date=5 May 2018|website=Burningtheground.net|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>

==Concerts==
The band toured regularly in the UK in the first half of the 1980s. Their first world tour began in 1987, with dates in Europe, the US, and Japan. Film footage was recorded at two shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan]] on 9 October and at Osaka's [[Osaka-jō Hall]] on 11 October 1987, and released on video cassette ([[VHS]]) and [[Laserdisc]] that same year under the title ''Rip It Up Live''.

The concert was eventually issued as bonus material for the first time on DVD as part of the 2003 compilation release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dead-Or-Alive-Evolution-The-Videos/release/352644 |title=Dead Or Alive – Evolution: The Videos (DVD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>

A studio version of ''[[Rip It Up (Dead or Alive album)|Rip It Up]]'' consisting of the original studio and remix versions of Dead or Alive's best known songs was released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], [[Audio cassette|cassette]] and [[compact disc]] that same year.

In 1994, Dead or Alive started performing in local night-clubs. Dead or Alive were featured at Gay Pride in Los Angeles in 1995.

==''Celebrity Big Brother''==
In 2006, Pete Burns took part in the TV show ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in the UK. Burns became known for openly insulting actress [[Traci Bingham]] and performing modern dance with [[Respect Party|Respect]]<!-- Not yet a 'Party' in 2006. --> MP [[George Galloway]]. Following the end of the show (Burns finished in fifth place), "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" (from 1985's ''Youthquake'' album) was re-released.
