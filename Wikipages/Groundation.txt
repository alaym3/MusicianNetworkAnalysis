'''Groundation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[roots reggae]] band with [[jazz]] and [[Dub music|dub]] influences, from [[Sonoma County]] in [[Northern California]].  It is named for [[Rastafari]]an ceremony of [[Grounation Day|Grounation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groundation.com/press/|title=Groundation   » Press|work=groundation.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Formed in the fall of 1998 by Harrison Stafford, Marcus Urani, and Ryan Newman, Groundation began on the campus of [[Sonoma State University]]'s Jazz Program.<ref name="Livi" /> Between 1999 and 2001, Harrison Stafford taught the first course on the History of Reggae Music at the University.<ref name="Livi" /> In 1999, Stafford teamed up with Kris Dilbeck to found Young Tree Records and release Groundation's debut album ''Young Tree''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groundation.com/music|title=Groundation   » Music Player|work=groundation.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> "Groundation" comes from the Rasta term "Grounation".

[[Grounation Day]] is an important Rastafarian holy day celebrated April 21, which commemorates [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie’s]] first visit to [[Jamaica]] in 1966. Grounation Day is second in importance to Coronation Day, which is celebrated November 2, in honor Haile Selassie’s Coronation in 1930.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rastafarianism|url = http://www.religionfacts.com/rastafarianism|website = www.religionfacts.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>

In 2000 they added to the line up David Chachere, a [[San Francisco]]-based jazz trumpeter, and Kelsey Howard, a North Bay trombone player.<ref name="Livi" /> Saxophonist [[Jason Robinson (musician)|Jason Robinson]] was a member of the band for a time, and has since gone on to become the head of the [[jazz]] program at [[UC San Diego]]. Drummer Paul Spina ([[Les Claypool]], [[Will Bernard]]'s Mother Bug) has been with the group since taking over for James Stafford in December 2001; he left the group in summer 2008. Kim Pommell and Kerry Ann Morgan (both graduates of Kingston's Ashe performing arts school) joined in 2006, and are featured lead vocalists on Groundation's 2009 release ''Here I Am''. In 2012, vocalist Jhamiela Smith joined the group, daughter of legendary reggae guitarist [[Earl "Chinna" Smith]], to sing chorus along with Kim Pommell. They are current chorus vocalists for Groundation.

The nine-piece band creates an altogether new reggae sound, featuring swirling, jazz/funk inspired horns, stout Latin and African based poly-rhythmics, and soulful harmony vocals. Their concerts utilize live improvisation, in classic jazz fashion, and are renowned for their high energy, communion-type atmosphere. Having gained international notoriety for their progressive fusion style, Groundation regularly plays at major international festivals like [[Summerjam]].

The band uses analog instruments and recording equipment rather than digital, with Stafford explaining "No digital, we don't work with synthesisers. Just like in the 1970s we stick to that format."<ref name="Livi">Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2012) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Groundation-sticks-to-basics_11610870 Groundation Sticks to Basics]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 5 June 2012, retrieved 2012-06-05</ref>

On the 2018 March 11th on their [https://www.facebook.com/groundationmusic/ Facebook page], Groundation announce his returns after a 3 year hiatus, introducing new members and "The Next Generation".
