About the album's title he said "I named it ''Gumbo'' because the actual dish is a bunch of things mixed in together to make [something] beautiful. I wanted to grow as a songwriter and talk about more things ... about where we are in the world today, the tension, how divided we are as a country. It kind of felt like I was dumping a bunch of subject matter together and I made it in New Orleans so that sounded like gumbo to me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/entertainment/pj-morton-talks-new-album-gumbo-maroon-5-and-more-1.13691499|title=PJ Morton talks new album, Maroon 5 and more}}</ref> As a first step, on March 25, 2016, Morton released ''Bounce & Soul Vol. 1'', a mixtape which includes re-imagined versions of his best songs in [[Bounce music|New Orleans' bounce]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/new-music-pj-morton-bounce-soul-volume-1-mixtape|title=New Music: PJ Morton - Bounce & Soul Volume 1 (Mixtape) - YouKnowIGotSoul.com|date=March 26, 2016}}</ref> On July 1, 2016, Morton released the ''Sticking to My Guns'' EP, featuring the single of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/new-music-pj-morton-sticking-to-my-guns|title=New Music: PJ Morton - Sticking to my Guns - YouKnowIGotSoul.com|date=June 9, 2016}}</ref> The EP, besides including alternative versions of "First Began" and "Sticking to My Guns", also contains "Say So", a song that was later cut from the final tracklist of the album.
