==History==
===Formation and ''New Roots EP'' (2006)===

Iration began in [[Isla Vista]], an unincorporated community connected to [[UC Santa Barbara]], playing reggae covers in college towns such as [[Cal Poly SLO]], [[Chico State]], and [[UC Davis]]. They recorded an [[Extended play|EP]], ''New Roots'', in 2006, and built a reputation for their live performance, according to the ''[[Santa Barbara Independent]]'': "There's something to be said for any band that can capture the undivided attention of a crowd full of drunken Isla Vistans, especially when there are kegs to be tapped and cops to avoid. But roots reggae rockers Iration manage to 'do it' on a regular basis."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2007/sep/27/featured-bands |title=Featured Bands Local Issue 2007 |access-date=2007-09-27 |work=Featured Bands }}</ref>

===''Automatic'' and Touring (2013)===

In early 2013, after extensive U.S. touring Iration announced they had finished recording a new full length album titled ''Automatic'' 
The album was released in July 2013, sold more than 8,000 copies in its first week of release, and topped the ''Billboard'' Reggae Albums Chart.<ref name="Jackson" /> [[Cage The Elephant]] guitarist Lincoln Parish is featured on numerous songs, as well as helping produce the upcoming album.

===Kai's departure and ''Hotting Up'' (2013–2015)===
On April 5, 2013, Iration announced that vocalist Kai Rediske had quit the band, leaving Micah Pueschel as the only vocalist/guitarist left in the group. While Iration's official announcement of this via their own website stated Kai left to "pursue other interests", many fans have speculated that the departure was the result of tension within the group due to having two lead vocalists. People that have knowledge of the group dynamic have also stated that Kai's upcoming marriage, and unwillingness to be a part of extensive future touring as a result also played a factor. 

On April 8, 2013, ThePier.org reported Iration has maintained that the upcoming ''Automatic'' album and all future shows would not be affected by Kai's departure.

The band's fourth album, ''Hotting Up'' was released in August 2015, just as the first three albums had, topped the ''Billboard'' Reggae Albums chart.<ref>Jackson, Kevin (2015) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Iration--hot--on-Billboard_19228139 Iration ‘hot’ on Billboard]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', September 11, 2015. Retrieved September 18, 2015</ref>

===''Double Up'' acoustic album (2016)===
On December 2, 2016, Iration released ''Double Up'', an acoustic album. It featured songs from the band's entire catalog of music. They "stripped them back and gave them an alternate life. We thought about a wave doubling up and the fact that it's another version of the same entity." The album reached #2 on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart.

===Self-titled album (2018)===
Iration recorded a self-titled album, their sixth studio album, which was released on May 18, 2018. The band collaborated with reggae artists: [[J Boog]], [[Slightly Stoopid]] and Tyrone's Jacket, and featured 16 tracks. The album peaked on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Reggae Album chart at No. 2, the Independent Albums chart at No. 14 and made it onto the ''Billboard 200'' at No. 199.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/ music/iration/chart-history/billboard-200</ref>

===''Coastin{{'}}'' (2020)===
On March 9, 2020, the band announced their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Coastin' (album)|Coastin']]'', alongside a promotional tour in the "Coastin' Summer Tour", set to feature roots reggae artist [[Tribal Seeds]].<ref>"[https://www.irationmusic.com/new-blog/coastin-2020 Coastin' 2020: New Album and Summer Tour]", March 9, 2020. Retrieved July 12, 2020</ref> Due to the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, however, they were forced to postpone the tour. The album featured tracks with [[Common Kings]], Eli Mac, Eric Rachmany of [[Rebelution (band)|Rebelution]] and [[Stick Figure]].

On March 13, 2021, Iration announced a [[dub music|dub]] version of ''Coastin{{'}}'' on their [[Facebook]] page. The 7-song EP features dub remixes of ''Coastin{{'}}'' tracks and will be out on [[vinyl record|vinyl]] all digital platforms on May 7, 2021.
