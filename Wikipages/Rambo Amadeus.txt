'''Antonije Pušić''' ({{Cyrl|Антоније Пушић}}; born 14 June 1963), known professionally as '''Rambo Amadeus''' ({{Cyrl|Рамбо Амадеус}}) is a [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] and Serbian singer.<ref>{{cite book|author=Asne Seierstad|title=With Their Backs to the World: Portraits from Serbia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0MoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT194|date=February 5, 2015|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-349-00694-9|page=194|quote=Rambo Amadeus, one of Serbia's most innovative artists}}</ref> A self-titled "musician, poet, and media manipulator", he is a noted artist across the countries of [[former Yugoslavia]].

His songs combine [[satirical]] lyrics on [[human nature]] and silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[hip-hop]] and lately [[drum and bass]], and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is "Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car" ("Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar"), formerly "Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car" ("Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar") (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from [[John Rambo]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

His concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of [[free improvisation]] and satirical humor exploiting all aspects of [[human nature]] in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style with [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].

Rambo Amadeus [[Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|represented Montenegro]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], with the song "[[Euro Neuro]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/rambo-amadeus-to-sing-euro-neuro-for-montenegro|publisher=Eurovision|title=Rambo Amadeus to sing "Euro-Neuro" for Montenegro|date=29 January 2012|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Antonije Pušić was born in [[Kotor]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|SR Montenegro]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] though his family lived in nearby [[Herceg Novi]] where he was raised. His writer and painter mother [[Bosiljka Pušić|Bosiljka]] was born in [[Ćuprija]] and raised in [[Jagodina]], [[Serbia]] before meeting Ilija Pušić from the coastal village of [[Kumbor]] near Herceg Novi and moving there upon marrying him.<ref name="glasj-april-2004">{{cite news|last=Čanak|first=Tatjana|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2004/04/30/srpski/K04042905.shtml|title=Ne volim dane "pod indigom"|agency=[[Glas javnosti]]|date=30 April 2004|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> The couple soon moved to Herceg Novi proper and started a family.<ref name="glasj-april-2004"/> After completing elementary and secondary education in his hometown, Antonije graduated in tourism studies from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. He also completed six grades of elementary music school for piano before dropping out.

Before pursuing music and performing arts as a career choice, Pušić was an accomplished competitive sailor. Between 1972 and 1984, he represented Yugoslavia in numerous international [[regatta]]s. During this period he was champion of Montenegro several times, an 8-time South-[[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] champion, national title winner in the junior category, as well as International [[Đerdap]] Cup winner in 1980. He still occasionally attends and participates in some recreational sailing regattas in the [[Gulf of Kotor]].

He began to sing and compose during first year of high school ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) which soon led to involvement with various local bands in Herceg Novi and [[Titograd]]. One of his first performances saw him play the [[mandolin]] in an orchestra that entertained guests of [[Herceg Novi]]'s Plaza hotel.

In 1985, he moved to [[Belgrade]] in pursuit of higher education. Parallel to his university studies, he also played with various amateur bands and musicians.

==Musical career==

===1970s===
In 1979, Rambo Amadeus started off in a band called "Radioaktivni otpad," which was short lived. He was also in a band called "The Blues Band." He didn't like the content produced, so he rearranged the setup. The band lasted his four high school years. The band played in Herceg Novi, Nikšić and Igalo (5&nbsp;km distance from Herceg Novi).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muzika.hr/rambo-amadeus-volio-bih-zivjeti-u-buducnosti-gdje-su-ljudi-nimalo-majmuni-a-potpuno-ljudi/|publisher=Muzika.hr|title=Rambo Amadeus: "Volio bih živjeti u budućnosti – gdje su ljudi nimalo majmuni, a potpuno ljudi"|first=Tena|last=Dobranović|date=14 June 2014|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

===1980s===
In 1988, he dropped into the music scene out of nowhere with his debut album ''[[O tugo jesenja]].'' His sound was a seemingly coarse blend of folkish [[ululation]]s and opera, further mixed in with humorous lyrics and classic guitar riffs. Since very few people had prior knowledge of him, Rambo was delighted in creating confusion by introducing himself as Nagib Fazlić Nagon, a mine shaft operator who saved up enough money to record an album. He also jokingly referred to his own musical style as [[turbo folk]], long before term would begin to be referred as actually musical style which critics refer to be grave social connotation and become to symbolise the moral and cultural decline throughout the Balkans during the wars of the 1990s.

Producer [[Saša Habić]] gave Rambo the opportunity to sign for the state television's record company [[PGP RTB]] (Rambo later wrote an anecdotal tribute to that event, in the hit song "Balkan Boy"). Habić also played the synthesiser on this album, from which a track named "Vanzemaljac" (Extraterrestrial) continues to be popular to this day. The record's sales weren't particularly high, but Rambo created enough of a buzz to remain active on the scene.

His next album ''[[Hoćemo gusle]]'' was released in 1989 and gave a small taste of Rambo's future musical direction – overt political satire. The track "Amerika i Engleska (biće zemlja proleterska)" was originally supposed to be named "Kataklizma komunizma" (Cataclysm of Communism) but local authorities did not allow it. The album title pokes fun at a bizarre event from the 1989 protests in Montenegro that eventually grew into the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] that swept [[Milo Đukanović]], [[Momir Bulatović]], and [[Svetozar Marović]] into power. Protesters were heard chanting "Hoćemo Ruse" ("We want the Russians"), but when the authorities and state-controlled media criticized them for it, many quickly began backpedaling by claiming they actually chanted "Hoćemo gusle" ("We want [[gusle]]").

Other songs like "Glupi hit" and afore mentioned "Balkan boy" would also become considerable hits and Rambo even received solid critical acclaim for chances he took in "Samit u buregdžinici Laibach". On that track, he created a catchy hybrid by mixing unique sound of [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] with lyrics which is borrowed from poetries of [[Laza Kostić]] and [[Desanka Maksimović]], as well as from folk ''[[kafana]]'' standard "Čaše lomim" mixing with his own humorous lyrics. The album sleeve lists the lyrics of a song that wasn't actually recorded, and explains that "it was dropped at the last moment because there was no room for it," but gives assurances that it would appear on the next album. Since the song in question, named "Pegepe ertebe," was all about taking shots at Rambo's label PGP RTB, but however, it didn't appear on the next or any other album.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Rambo was growing into an established performer. His third album ''[[Psihološko propagandni komplet M-91]]'' came out towards the end of 1991 at a time when breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] was already in full swing. For obvious reasons, the least of which was the album's subtitle – ''Psychological Propaganda Set'', many songs contained heavy lyrics and a dark, militaristic atmosphere. In your face profanity and descriptive cursing was also par for the course, making this the first major music release in former Yugoslavia to take such narrative liberties. Tracks like "Smrt popa Mila Jovovića" (30-year-old poem by Božo Đuranović), "Jemo voli jem" (incorporating samples from Yugoslav aviators' anthem "Hej vojnici vazduhoplovci" as well as [[Šemsa Suljaković]]'s "Izgubila sve sam bitke"), "Inspektor Nagib" and "Zdravo damo" became instant hits.

The discrepancy between what's listed on the cover and what is actually recorded is there again as sleeve announces the track called "KPGS" which would, this time for real, appear on the next live album, but does not list "Halid invalid Hari" and "Prijatelju, prijatelju" which were included and became big hits. Many consider the two tracks to be classic Rambo: observant, opinionated, direct and profane. The latter of the two originally included excerpts from [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Franjo Tuđman]] speeches, but the record company censors took them out.

This album further solidified Rambo's presence on the scene as he started playing bigger arenas like [[Sava Center|Sava centar]]. Due to outspoken and entertaining nature he would often get invited on various TV and radio outlets across the country.

During "Belgrade spring" festival in 1992. he showed civil courage when he interrupted a concert by "Bebi Dol" during live TV broadcast and said to tens of thousands of viewers:

"As we play here bombs are falling on Dubrovnik and Tuzla. We won't entertain the political voters no more. F*** your mothers!" 

He threw the microphone on the floor, left the stage and the show was over.

Trying to take the new situation in stride, he hit the road, becoming one of the first performers from [[FR Yugoslavia]] to regularly start touring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Slovenia]] in the years following those states' declarations of independence.

After live album ''KPGS'' (taped on December 29, 1992 in [[Skopje]]) that included new studio track "Karamba karambita" followed by a greatest hits compilation ''Izabrana dela 1989–1994'', Rambo recorded peculiar new material during July 1995 in Paris with [[Goran Vejvoda]]. Released the following year as ''[[Mikroorganizmi]]'', it featured inaccessible, moody sound garnered with terse, experimental music marking a sizable departure from his usual antics.

He simultaneously released ''[[Muzika za decu]]'', personal musical take on [[Ljubivoje Ršumović]]'s poetry featuring two bonus new tracks – "Sex" and "ABVGD".

Old-school Rambo fans did not have to wait long for a return to earlier style. Towards the end of 1996, on ''[[Titanik]]'' he delivered a new batch of traditional fare like "Šakom u glavu", "Sado-mazo", "Zreo za penziju" and "Otiš'o je svak ko valja" (dedicated to [[Toma Zdravković]] and members of [[Šarlo Akrobata]]). Seasoned musicians like Ognjen Radivojević (who will become famous for working with such musicians like [[Goran Bregović]] and [[Zdravko Čolić]]), Goran Ljuboja, Dragan Markovski and Marija Mihajlović) took part in recording sessions for this album.

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:RamboAmadeus.jpg|thumb|Rambo Amadeus in concert action]] -->Extensive tour followed and it again included Slovenia (live album was recorded over two [[Ljubljana]] concerts in April 1997 and later released as ''[[Koncert u KUD France Prešeren]]''), as well as [[Bosnia-Herzegovina|Bosnia]] where Rambo appeared as a guest at [[Sejo Sexon]]'s [[Zabranjeno pušenje]] gig in [[Sarajevo]]. That appearance in December 1997 was the first post-war visit by a Montenegrin performer to the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].

On June 9, 1998, Rambo played Belgrade's [[Dom Sindikata]] hall in what he announced to be the farewell performance before retirement. Even if many doubted his sincerity, the concert was a memorable one. Soon, Rambo packed his bags and left for the Netherlands, though not before squeezing in two more shows in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. In the Netherlands, he worked a series of menial jobs including construction, before deciding to return to Belgrade after only four months abroad. Back home, not surprisingly, he also returned to music and continued to break down inter-ethnic barriers: on December 10, 1998, he and [[Margita Stefanović]] played a show in [[Pula]] at the local cinema with [[KUD Idijoti]], which was a first opportunity since the war for a Croatian audience to see performers from Serbia and Montenegro.

===2000s===
Throughout the year 2000, Rambo worked on what would eventually become the ''Don't Happy, Be Worry'' album. This album included the song ''Laganese'' in which sampled the [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] journalist [[Åsne Seierstad]] singing the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[Folk song]] ''Eg rodde meg ut på seiegrunnen'' and [[profanity|swearing]]. By this time, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and local pop-cultural references became two more staples of his sound, and this material, too, was heavy on both. Produced by Iztok Turk, it featured tracks like "Čoban je upravo napustio zgradu" (loose cover of [[Neda Ukraden]]'s "Zora je svanula"), "Moj skutere" that borrows from [[Oliver Dragojević]]'s "Moj galebe", and "Izađite molim" with sprinkled in dialogues from [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]]'s 1975 movie ''Variola vera''.

In 2004, Rambo released his third live album ''[[Bolje jedno vruće pivo nego četri ladna]]'', which was followed by the studio album ''[[Oprem dobro]]'' in mid-2005.

He made a song "Dikh tu kava" in collaboration with ethno-jazz fusion band [[Kal (band)|Kal]], and in 2007 he appeared on their album as a featured artist in the song "Komedija" ("Comedy").

In autumn 2007 he performed a performance called "Mixing of alternative rocks", when he "played" on 12 concrete mixers in front of the audience, during The Alternative Rock Festival in [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]], Belgrade.<ref name="ramboamadeus">{{cite web|url=http://ramboamadeus.com/news.php|publisher=Rambo Amadeus|title=RASMC News|date=7 November 2007|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

For the purpose of the New Year's show on [[Radio Television of Vojvodina|RTV]], he appeared in the song "Rakija" followed by Zorule, the traditional folk orchestra.<ref name="ramboamadeus"/> This song was used later as one of the tracks for "[[Vratiće se rode]]" TV serial. In February 2008, Rambo Amadeus performed as a guest star of The RTS Big Band jazz orchestra, for their 60th Anniversary.

''Hipishizik Metafizik'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hipishizik-metafizik-mw0001334563|publisher=All Music|title=Rambo Amadeus - Hipishizik Metafizik|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> is his latest studio album, released for [[PGP RTS]] in July 2008.

===2010s===
Rambo Amadeus was internally selected by the Montenegrin national broadcaster [[RTCG]] to [[Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|represent Montenegro]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=rambo_amadeus_to_represent_montenegro_in_baku|title=Rambo Amadeus to represent Montenegro in Baku!|last=Brey|first=Marco|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|website=eurovision.tv|date=12 December 2011|access-date=12 December 2011}}</ref> His winning song "[[Euro Neuro]]" gained controversy for its video. He ultimately failed to make the Eurovision final.

[[File:Rambo Amadeus Eurovision 2012 Baku Semi-Final.jpg|thumb|right|449px|Rambo's performance at Eurovision was met with some controversies because of satirical nature of the song "Euro Neuro" towards Europe]] In 2013, he released a video for the new single ''O'Ruk on the Road Again'' with Three Winnettous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popboks.com/article/29522|publisher=Pop Boks|title=Video: Rambo Amadeus - O' Ruk on the road again|date=15 May 2013|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, he released the album "Vrh Dna",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muzika.hr/najave/rambo-amadeus-u-sax-u-predstavlja-novi-album-vrh-dna/|publisher=Muzika.hr|title=Rambo Amadeus u Sax!-u predstavlja novi album "Vrh dna"|date=13 November 2015|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> which featured previously unreleased track "Rano Za Početak" from 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://balkanrock.com/autorski-clanci/recenzije/rambo-amadeus-vrh-dna-2015/|publisher=Balkan Rock|title=Rambo Amadeus – Vrh dna (2015)|first=Petar|last=Kostić|date=25 May 2016|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> and he retitled it "Samo Balade" for the album's release.

In 2016, he landed two [[voice actor|voice-work]] roles, as Mighty Eagle in the Croatian-language and Serbian-language version of ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'', and as [[List of Finding Nemo characters|Crush]] in the Serbian-language version ''[[Finding Dory]]''.<ref>[http://fama.com.hr/angry-birds-film-sinkroniziraju-zvijezde/ Angry Birds Film sinkroniziraju zvijezde!

In 2018, he has tried to represent [[Serbia]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] with the song Nema Te, a duet with jazz singer Beti Đorđević. They performed the song in Beovizija 2018. and came 9th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natfinals.50webs.com/10s_20s/Serbia2018.html|publisher=Nat Finals|title=Serbian Finals|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

==Other endeavours==
In addition to a prolific solo recording career, Rambo frequently engaged in different, often bizarre side projects.

*In 1989 in [[Sarajevo]], for a short while, he hosted an erotic quiz show with actress Jasna Beri named ''Turbo-lilihip'', which aired on a local TV station SA3.
*He wrote music for different theatre plays such as ''{{lang|sr|Đetić u parlament}}'', ''{{lang|sr|Oksimoron}}'', as well as ''{{lang|sr|Lažni car Šćepan Mali}}'' for which he was awarded Sterija prize in 1994.
*Rambo also wrote lyrics for commercial folk stars like [[Lepa Brena]] and [[Vesna Zmijanac]], as well as the entire score for 1994 film ''{{lang|sr|Slatko od snova}}'', which was a star vehicle for another [[Folk music|folk]] performer [[Dragana Mirković]].
