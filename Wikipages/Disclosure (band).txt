==Early life==
Born to professional musician parents, their father played in rock bands, including 'No Angry Man' and 'The Look Book' alongside his brother and Guy's godfather, and is now a professional auctioneer,<ref name=GuardDiscGHL/><ref name=SSBiog/> whilst their mother, a [[session musician]], fronted bands, toured on cruises, sang advert jingles, and was one of the first performers to entertain the [[British Army]] after their recapture of the [[Falkland Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lester|first=Paul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/13/disclosure-guy-howard-lawrence-interview |title=Disclosure on disco, Sting and their new romantic parents &#124; Music|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=27 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=SSBiog/> Guy started playing the drums at the age of three, and Howard started playing the bass at the age of eight. Both also learned to play the guitar and the piano and Howard to sing.

They both attended [[Reigate College]]. During this period, the boys studied music and music technology. By the age of 15, Howard listened mainly to funk, soul and maudlin singers, whilst Guy listened predominantly to hip hop, dubstep and was the drummer in an indie-style guitar band with school friends.<ref name=GuardDiscGHL>{{cite news|last=Wolfson|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/18/disclosure-guy-howard-lawrence |title=Disclosure: how the Lawrence brothers are rebooting dance culture &#124; Music|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 May 2013|access-date=27 November 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Whilst Guy was attending Reigate College, he enjoyed studying [[classical music]], especially the likes of Bach and [[Claude Debussy]].<ref name=Billboard1565734/> A teenage interest in the music and production techniques of [[Detroit]]-based rapper and record producer [[J Dilla]],<ref name=SSBiog/> led him through [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] to attending [[dubstep]] gigs as a student; but he enjoyed [[house music]] more as a creation, and began studying it and introducing his brother to it.<ref name=Billboard1565734/> Primarily influenced by artists including [[Joy Orbison]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]], [[Burial (musician)|Burial]] and [[Mount Kimbie]], the brothers were led back in time to [[Chicago house]], [[Detroit techno]], [[UK garage]] and [[2-step garage]].<ref name=Billboard1565734>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/1565734/disclosure-the-new-faces-of-house-music-talk-about-creating-their |title=Disclosure: The New Faces of House Music Talk About Creating Their 'Settle' Album |publisher=Billboard |date= 5 June 2013|access-date=27 November 2015}}</ref>

===2010–2011: Debut===
The brothers started de-constructing and copying the music that Guy had heard at gigs in a room above their father's auction house,<ref name=GuardDiscGHL/> and then making music in the same room in a style they refer to as "electronic house music with a pop structure",<ref name=GuardDiscGHL/> uploading it to [[Myspace]]. This got them an early record deal, and a UK tour, mixing live music gigs with occasional DJ sets, where in [[Manchester]], they played a set before [[Todd Edwards]], and gained after gig all-night conversation.<ref name=GuardDiscGHL/>

The duo's first single, "Offline Dexterity" was released on 29 August 2010. They signed to the new [[PMR Records|PMR]] record label on its formation in January 2011,<ref>{{cite news|last=Wolfson|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/08/pmr-records-fresh-face-of-pop |title=PMR Records: the fresh face of pop &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 8 March 2013|access-date=27 November 2015}}</ref> and released their second single, "Carnival"/"I Love...That You Know" on 13 June 2011. This got them a management deal with Sam Evitt and Jack Street's Method Management whom they are still managed by.<ref name=SSBiog/>

===2012–2014: Commercial success and ''Settle''===
Disclosure picked up their first significant national radio support upon the release of the [[Tenderly / Flow|"Tenderly" / "Flow"]] single in January 2012. The single led to significant interest in the subsequent June 2012 EP, ''[[The Face (EP)|The Face]]'', released on Greco-Roman. The EP included the popular remix of "[[Running (Jessie Ware song)|Running]]" by [[Jessie Ware]] a fellow PMR artist which charted in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], as well as becoming a fixture of the 2012 Festival Circuit and featuring on the annual edition of [[Annie Mac]] presents.

Through collaboration with other artists signed to Method Management,<ref name=SSBiog/> the group had their first UK hit in October 2012 with "[[Latch (song)|Latch]]",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web//http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14188-latch-ft-sam-smith/] {{dead link|date=July 2020}}</ref> co-written with [[Jimmy Napes]] and featuring the vocals from [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], which peaked at number 11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=SSBiog>{{cite book|title=Sam Smith - The Biography|author=Joe Allan|publisher=John Blake Publishing|date=1 October 2015|isbn=978-1784187729}}</ref>

The group maintained their momentum into 2013 – they were voted into the BBC Radio 1xtra 'Hot Ten For 2013' and scored two consecutive top 10 hit singles in "[[White Noise (Disclosure song)|White Noise]]" (number two) (with [[AlunaGeorge]]) and "[[You & Me (Disclosure song)|You & Me]]" (number 10) (with [[Eliza Doolittle (singer)|Eliza Doolittle]]). These three singles were collected on an EP, ''The Singles''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Disclosure Announce Singles EP|url = http://prettymuchamazing.com/news/disclosure-announce-singles-ep|publisher = prettymuchamazing.com|access-date = 4 June 2013|date = 18 April 2013}}</ref> They released their debut studio album, ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'', by [[PMR Records]] on 3 June 2013 and was met with commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], charting in many countries across Europe and Australia, and receiving four stars from ''[[The Guardian]]'' and a 9.1 score on ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last = Battan|first = Carrie|title = Disclosure Announce Debut Album, ''Settle''|url = http://pitchfork.com/news/50358-disclosure-announce-debut-album-settle/|publisher = Pitchfork Media|access-date = 28 April 2013|date = 16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>Paul MacInnes, Harriet Gibsone, Paul Lester and Caspar Llewellyn Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/24/glastonbury-festival-music-bands-headliners Future Glastonbury festival headliners: which bands are making the most noise] The Guardian, 24 June 2013.</ref> They performed twice at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury Festival 2013]] and appeared on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

In 2013, Disclosure embarked on a worldwide tour of more than 40 European, American, and Canadian cities, including high-profile music festivals such as the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[Lollapalooza]] Music Festival in Chicago, and [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]] in Washington State.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://pitchfork.com/news/51016-disclosure-announce-tour/|title = Disclosure Announce Tour|publisher = Pitchfork|date = 4 June 2013|access-date = 4 March 2014|last = Zoladz|first = Lindsay}}</ref> The same year, they established the record label Method Records; its roster includes Friend Within, [[Karen Harding]], Lxury, and Tourist.

===2015–2018: ''Caracal'' and hiatus===

The week of its release, ''Caracal'' earned the group their second consecutive number one album in the UK Albums Chart.

The music videos for official singles from the album published on [[YouTube]] are interconnected and follow a story line, each newly released video furthering the plot. The videos follow a young woman in a sci-fi, dystopian world who is, for some unknown reason, being chased by the police.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://pitchfork.com/news/61080-disclosure-continue-dystopian-video-series-with-jaded/|title = Disclosure Continue Dystopian Video Series With "Jaded"|publisher = pitchfork.com|access-date = 15 September 2015|last = Minsker|first = Evan}}</ref>
