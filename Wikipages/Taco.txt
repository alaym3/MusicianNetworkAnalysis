A '''taco''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|ɑː|k|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|t|æ|k|əʊ}}, {{IPAc-es|lang|'|t|a|k|o}}) is a traditional [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican dish]] consisting of a small hand-sized [[corn tortilla|corn]] or [[Flour tortilla|wheat tortilla]] topped with a [[Stuffing|filling]]. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and [[finger food|eaten by hand]]. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. They are often garnished with various condiments, such as [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[guacamole]], or [[sour cream]], and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and [[Chili pepper|chiles]]. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or [[Mexican street food]], which have spread around the world.

Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as [[burrito]]s, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded; [[taquito]]s, which are rolled and fried; or [[chalupa]]s/[[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]], in which the tortilla is fried before filling.

==Etymology==
The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical.<ref name="smithsonian">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Where-Did-the-Taco-Come-From.html |title=Where Did the Taco Come From? |magazine=Smithsonian Magazine |access-date=2012-05-16}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Tacos|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Latino Culture: From Calaveras to Quinceaneras [3 Volumes]|publisher=Greenwood / ABC-CLIO|id=enc-lat-cult|date=2013|editor-last=Tatum|editor-first=Charles M.|series=Cultures of the American Mosaic|volume=1|pages=495–497}}</ref> ''Taco'' in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a [[maize]] [[tortilla]] folded around food is just one of the meanings connoted by the word, according to the [[Real Academia Española]], publisher of ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Diccionario de la Lengua Española]].''<ref name="DRAE">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=taco|title=Definition: Taco|publisher=Real Academia Española|quote=Tortilla de maíz enrollada con algún alimento dentro, típica de México.|access-date=2008-06-13}}</ref> This meaning of the Spanish word "taco" is a Mexican innovation,<ref name=":1" /> but the word "taco" is used in other contexts to mean "wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood."<ref name="DRAE"/> The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages, including the French word "tache" and the English word "tack."<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Taco|date=1887|encyclopedia=Diccionario general etimológico de la lengua española|url=https://archive.org/details/diccionariogener05echeuoft/page/n3/mode/1up?q=taco|last=de Echegaray|first=Eduardo|publication-place=Madrid|volume=5|page=481|language=Spanish|trans-title=Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language|type=Scanned book|format=}}</ref>

In Spain, the word "taco" can also be used in the context of ''{{ill|tacos de jamón|es}}'':  these are diced pieces of ham, or sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced.<ref>Jesús Ventanas, ''El jamón Ibérico. De la dehesa al paladar.'', Ediciones Mundi-Prensa, 2006, p. 102.</ref> They can be served on their own as [[tapas]] or street food, or can be added to other dishes such as [[salmorejo]], [[omelettes]], [[stews]], [[empanadas]], or ''{{ill|melón con jamón|es}}''.<ref>Julio César, (2011), ''El gran libro de las tapas'', Ed.

According to one etymological theory, the culinary origin of the term "taco" in Mexico can be traced to its employment, among Mexican silver miners, as a term signifying "plug." The miners used explosive charges in plug form, consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.<ref name="smithsonian" />

Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the [[Nahuatl]] word "tlahco", meaning "half" or "in the middle,"<ref name="Karttunen" /> in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.<ref>[http://www.nexos.com.mx/?p=21200 Florilegio Verbal Náhuatl], Nexos, Mar. 12, 2016</ref> Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbia]]n society—for example, the Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla).<ref name="Karttunen">{{cite book   | title = An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl | author= Frances E.

==History==
The taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the [[Valley of Mexico]] traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish {{citation needed|date=August 2021}}. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which [[Hernán Cortés]] arranged for his captains in [[Coyoacán]].<ref name="History">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502160526/http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm|url=http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm |title=History of Mexican Cuisine |access-date=30 January 2015 |publisher=Margaret Parker |archive-date = 2 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="History2">{{cite web |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811132510/http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm | archive-date = 11 August 2007 |url=http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm |title=A Thumbnail History of Mexican Food |access-date= 30 January 2015 |publisher=Jim Conrad}}</ref>

==Traditional variations==
There are many traditional varieties of tacos:
[[File:01 Tacos al Pastor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tacos al pastor]] made with [[adobada]] meat.]]
* '''Tacos [[al pastor]]''' ("shepherd style") or '''tacos de [[adobada]]''' are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with [[adobo]] seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/>
* '''Tacos de asador''' ("spit" or "grill" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: ''[[carne asada]] tacos''; '''''tacos de tripita''''' ("[[tripe]] tacos"), grilled until crisp; and, ''[[chorizo]] asado'' (traditional Spanish-style sausage). Each type is served on two overlapped small [[tortillas]] and sometimes garnished with [[guacamole]], [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], onions, and cilantro (coriander leaf). Also, prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called ''mulita'' ("little mule") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with [[Oaxaca cheese|Oaxaca]] style cheese. ''"Mulita"'' is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico while they are known as [[Gringa]] in the Mexican south and are prepared using [[wheat]] flour tortillas. Tacos may also be served with salsa.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/recipes/puebla/kgtacos1.html |title= Wrap It Up: A Guide to Mexican Street Tacos (Part One of Two) |access-date=2008-07-07 |first=Karen Hursh |last=Graber |publisher=Mexico Connect}}</ref><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/recipes/puebla/kgtacos2.html |title= Wrap It Up: A Guide to Mexican Street Tacos Part II: Nighttime Tacos |access-date=2008-07-07 |first=Karen Hursh |last=Graber |publisher=Mexico Connect}}</ref>
* '''Tacos de [[cabeza]]''' ("head tacos"), in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow. These include: ''[[Cabeza]]'', a serving of the muscles of the head; ''[[Sesos]]'' ("brains"); ''[[Beef tongue|Lengua]]'' ("tongue"); ''Cachete'' ("cheeks"); ''Trompa'' ("lips"); and, ''Ojo'' ("eye"). Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion, and cilantro (coriander leaf) with occasional use of guacamole.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/>
* '''Tacos de camarones''' ("shrimp tacos") also originated in [[Baja California]] in Mexico. Grilled or fried [[shrimp]] are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, [[pico de gallo]], avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/><ref name="Shrimp Tacos">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3447-shrimp-and-nopal-tacos-tacos-de-camaron-y-nopalitos |title=Tacos de camaron y nopalitos |access-date=2009-08-14 |first=Karen Hursh |last=Graber |publisher=Mexico Connect}}</ref>
* '''Tacos de cazo''' (literally "bucket tacos") for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer. Meats for these types of tacos typically include ''[[Tripe|Tripa]]'' ("tripe", usually from a pig instead of a cow, and can also refer to the intestines); ''[[Suadero]]'' (tender beef cuts), ''[[Carnitas]]'' and ''Buche'' (Literally, ''"[[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]"'', as in ''bird's crop''; or the esophagus of any animal.<ref name="Buche">{{cite web |url=http://www.burritoblog.com/2006/04/buche_yummy_pig.html |title=The Burrito Blog&nbsp;— Buche |access-date=2008-07-26 |first=Jonah |last=Feld |year=2006}}</ref>)<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/>

[[File:Tacos de Pescado.jpg|thumb|Two fish tacos in [[Bonita, California]]]]
* '''Tacos de pescado''' ("fish tacos") originated in [[Baja California]] in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, [[pico de gallo]], and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. In the United States, they were first popularized by the [[Rubio's]] fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/>
* '''Tacos dorados''' (fried tacos; literally, "golden tacos") called '''''flauta''s''' ("[[flute]]", because of the shape), or [[taquito]]s, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or ''[[barbacoa]]'', rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. They are sometimes cooked in a [[microwave oven]] or [[broiled]].<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="MexStreetTaco-Types"/>
* '''Tacos sudados''' ("sweaty tacos") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth. The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam ("sweat") which softens them.<ref name="MexStreetTaco-Origin"/><ref name="TacosSudadosRecipe">{{cite web |url=http://cocina-mexico.com/ingles/menu/typical_food/20.html |title=Tacos Sudados (Mexican recipe) |access-date=2008-07-09 |publisher=Mexican Cuisine}}</ref>

As an accompaniment to tacos, many [[taco stand]]s will serve whole or sliced red [[radishes]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally [[cucumber]] slices, or grilled cambray onions.

==Non-traditional variations==
===Hard-shell tacos===
{{Main|Hard-shell taco}}
The hard-shell or crispy taco is a tradition that developed in the United States. The most common type of taco in the US is the hard-shell, U-shaped version, first described in a cookbook in 1949.<ref name="Freedman">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NSkexpQVDgC&q=THE+GOOD+LIFE%3B+NEW+MEXICAN+FOOD+Fabiola+Cabeza+de+Vaca+Gilbert&pg=PA152|title=Human food uses: a cross-cultural, comprehensive annotated bibliography|last=Freedman|first=Robert L.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1981|isbn=0-313-22901-5|location=Westport, CT|page=152|access-date=27 December 2011}}</ref> This type of taco is typically served as a crisp-fried corn tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and sometimes tomato, onion, salsa, sour cream, and avocado or guacamole.<ref name="AmericanTaco">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/magazine/west/la-tm-tacobell12mar19,0,3787670.story|title=Taco Bell Nation|last=Gilb|first=Dagoberto|date=2006-03-19|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2008-07-24}}</ref> Such tacos are sold by restaurants and by fast food chains, while kits are readily available in most supermarkets.

In the mid-1950s, [[Glen Bell]] opened Taco Tia, and began selling a simplified version of the tacos being sold by Mexican restaurants in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], particularly the ''tacos dorados'' being sold at the Mitla Cafe, owned by Lucia and Salvador Rodriguez across the street from another of Bell's restaurants.<ref name=":0" /> Over the next few years, Bell owned and operated a number of restaurants in southern California including four called El Taco.<ref name="company">{{cite web|url=http://www.tacobell.com/company/|title=Company Information|date=August 9, 2011|publisher=Taco Bell|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812223309/http://www.tacobell.com/company|archive-date=August 12, 2011|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> At this time, Los Angeles was [[racially-segregated]], and the tacos sold at Bell's restaurants were many white Americans' first introduction to Mexican food.<ref name=":0" /> Bell sold the El Tacos to his partner and built the first [[Taco Bell]] in [[Downey, California|Downey]] in 1962.

===Soft-shell tacos===
[[File:Tacos at restaurant Chalupa.jpg|thumb|Three soft-shell tacos with beef filling at a restaurant in [[Helsinki]], Finland]]
Traditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco - usually by grilling or steaming. More recently, the term has come to include flour-tortilla-based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, ''soft tacos'' are tacos made with [[wheat]] flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.<ref name="BigOven">{{cite web |url=http://www.bigoven.com/14723-(Homemade-Fresh)-Chorizo-Soft-Tacos-recipe.html |title=Homemade Chorizo Soft Tacos (recipe) |access-date=2008-07-09 |publisher=BigOven.com}}</ref>{{clear}}

===Indian taco===
Indian tacos, or ''[[Navajo]] tacos'', are made using [[frybread]] instead of tortillas.

This kind of taco is not known to have been present before the arrival of Europeans in what is now the [[Southwestern United States]]. [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tradition indicates that frybread came into use in the 1860s when the government forced the tribe to relocate from their homeland in [[Arizona]] in a journey known as the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]]. It was made from ingredients given to them by the government to supplement their diet since the region could not support growing the agricultural commodities that had been previously used.<ref name = smithsonianmag>{{cite web | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/frybread.html | title = Frybread | access-date = 2012-01-20 | last = Miller | first = Jen | work = Smithsonian.com}}</ref>

===Puffy tacos, taco kits, and tacodillas===
Since at least 1978, a variation called the "'''puffy taco'''" has been popular. ''Henry's Puffy Tacos'', opened by Henry Lopez in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of [[masa]] dough<ref name="Saveur Tortilla Recipe">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.saveur.com/food/classic-recipes/corn-tortillas--51762.html |title=Homemade Corn Tortillas (recipe from ''Saveur'') |access-date=2008-11-10 |magazine=Saveur |year=2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829172957/http://www.saveur.com/food/classic-recipes/corn-tortillas--51762.html |archive-date=2008-08-29 }}</ref>) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become "puffy".<ref name=TexasCooking>{{cite web|last=Lankford|first=Randy|title=Henry's Puffy Tacos - San Antonio|url=http://www.texascooking.com/features/sept2005_henrys_tacos.htm|work=TexasCooking.com|publisher=Mesquite Management, Inc.|access-date=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="Saveur Recipe">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.saveur.com/article/food/Puffy-Tacos |title=Puffy Tacos (recipe from ''Saveur'') |access-date=2008-07-26 |magazine=Saveur |year=2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064859/http://www.saveur.com/article/Food/Puffy-Tacos |archive-date=2008-09-07 }}</ref> Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions.
