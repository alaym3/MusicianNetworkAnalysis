Throughout the process, I had this vision of a 'nova' or of a star no bigger than a person launching from earth into outer space and expanding endlessly until its light was all that we could see. That's the feeling I get from these records, infinite light."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mixmag.net/read/rl-grime-readies-his-first-album-in-four-year-nova-news/ |title=Rl Grime Readies His First Album in Four Years 'Nova' |last=Holbrook |first=Cameron |date=June 13, 2018 |website=Mixmag |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180614051745/http://mixmag.net/read/rl-grime-readies-his-first-album-in-four-year-nova-news |archive-date=June 14, 2018 |access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> The album's last single, "Light Me Up", which featured the vocals of [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]] and [[Julia Michaels]], was released on July 25, 2018.<ref name="billboard lightmeup" /> Initially an unused [[Jack Ü]] demo which was shown to Grime by [[Diplo]], Grime decided to build the demo out and have Miguel's and Michaels' vocals recut, since he felt that the album required a "summery vibe" to it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youredm.com/2018/07/25/rl-grime-drops-previous-jack-u-demo-light-me-up-with-julia-michaels-miguel/ |title=Rl Grime Drops Previous Jack Ü Demo "light Me Up" With Julia Michaels & Miguel |last=Meadow |first=Matthew |date=July 25, 2018 |website=Your EDM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725224407/https://www.youredm.com/2018/07/25/rl-grime-drops-previous-jack-u-demo-light-me-up-with-julia-michaels-miguel/ |archive-date=July 25, 2018 |access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref>

Henry announced the founding of his record label Sable Valley in February 2019 stating, 'Since the inception of RL Grime, I’ve had this goal in the back of my mind to start my own label. My Halloween mixes have always been an outlet for me to curate and showcase new music, but the natural next step for me was to start a label. My whole life I’ve been obsessed with the process of searching for and finding what's next, and this is a way for me to use platform to highlight emerging talent that I believe in. "Arcus" is the first release, and it felt like the perfect son to set the tone for what Sable Valley is about". In a following statement Sable Valley announced, ""During your membership here at Sable Valley, we strive to provide you with the technical information, advocacy, and professional opportunities to help advance your overall well-being. As a member, you will be able to exchange research information with other Sable Valley affiliates and participate in programming sessions offered at various conferences held by Sable Valley throughout the year"<ref name="broadwayworld.com"/>
