'''Slum Village''' is  an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[Detroit, Michigan]].

The group was formed by three members, [[rapper]]s Baatin (1974–2009) and T3, plus rapper and [[Record producer|producer]] [[J Dilla]] (1974–2006). J Dilla left in 2001 to pursue a solo career with [[MCA Records]]. [[Elzhi]] joined in his absence, after which Baatin also left due to health complications.
Following J Dilla's death in 2006 and Baatin's death in 2009, T3 remains the sole surviving member of the original lineup. Over its history the group has been through several line-up changes, which once included J Dilla's younger brother [[Illa J]], but now the group currently exists as a duo of T3 and producer Young RJ.<ref name=itunes>{{cite web|title=Slum Village|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/artist/slum-village/id570451|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=vice>{{cite web|first1=Pete|last1=Tosiello|title=It Takes a Village: The Tragedy and Triumph of Detroit's Slum Village|url=https://www.vice.com/read/it-takes-a-village-the-long-evolving-saga-of-detroits-slum-village-456|website=VICE|date=May 2, 2015}}</ref>

From 1996 to 1997 the group recorded their first album ''[[Fan-Tas-Tic (Vol. 1)|Fantastic (Vol. 1)]]'',<ref name=SVbio /> however it was not officially released until 2006, 9 years after original recording.<ref name=genius>{{cite web|title=Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1|url=https://genius.com/albums/Slum-village/Fan-tas-tic-vol-1|website=Genius}}</ref>

Slum Village signed their first record deal in 1998 with the now defunct Barak/[[A&M Records|A&M records]]. Due to internal politics with the label, the group was forced to release their 2000 album ''[[Best Kept Secret (Slum Village album)|Best Kept Secret]]'' under the alias "J-88". ''Best Kept Secret'' featured remixes and leftover material from the heavily boot-legged ''Fantastic, Vol. 1''.<ref name=bogdanov>{{cite book|first1=Vladimir|last1=Bogdanov|title=All Music Guide to Hip-hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-hop|date=2003|publisher=Back Beat Books|isbn=0879307595|page=234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wr1lmklsD8QC&pg=PT228}}</ref> That same year ''[[Fantastic, Vol. 2]]'' was released on GoodVibe Recordings, which featured appearances from [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[D'Angelo]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Pete Rock]], [[Kurupt]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]].<ref name=SVbio />

==J Dilla era==
Fresh out of high school, the group steadily became popular in Detroit's [[Alternative hip hop|underground hip hop]] scene. However, by the mid-1990s [[J Dilla]] was already a well known hip-hop prospect, with a string of singles and remixes to his name, working on projects with [[Janet Jackson]], [[Pharcyde]], [[De La Soul]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] among others. In 1995 he was invited to become a member of a production team known as [[The Ummah]], which produced the fourth and fifth [[A Tribe Called Quest]] studio albums, as well as hits for a number of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and hip hop musicians.<ref name=bogdanov /> In 1998, Slum Village opened for [[A Tribe Called Quest]], on their farewell tour.<ref name=itunes /> In 2001, J Dilla left Slum Village to pursue a solo career.<ref name=SVbio />

==Baatin era==
Titus Glover (March 8, 1974 – July 31, 2009), also known as Baatin, was an American [[rapper]] who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip hop scene in [[Detroit, Michigan]] part of the rap group Slum Village.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian |last=Musich |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/slum-village-mn0000026504/biography |title=Slum Village &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref> Baatin started rapping as a student at Pershing High School in Detroit where he went by the names Scandalous-T, and Eazy-T among others.

In the early 1990s Glover adopted the name Baatin. He claimed the name (which is Arabic for 'hidden') was chosen to reflect a newfound spirituality.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|first1=Valerie J.|last1=Nelson|title=Baatin dies at 35; rapper co-founded progressive hip-hop group Slum Village|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-baatin2-2009aug02-story.html|access-date=25 July 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2, 2009}}</ref>

Baatin remained as an active member of the group until the early 2000s. In 2002, shortly after the release of [[Trinity (Past, Present and Future)|the group's third album]], Baatin began to experience health problems, which interfered with the group's music and touring performances. In regard to his health problems, he said:

{{cquote|The confusion started [[Language|verbally]]. I would be [[angry]] and lash out and go crazy. I was like: Do I got [[demon]]s? I couldn't control it. It was a learning experience. They said I have [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[schizophrenia]] with [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] tendencies. It was bipolar when I was responding to 12 different impulses. I didn't hurt nobody.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Tamara|title=Detroit rapper Baatin spoke about coping with mental illness in 2004|url=http://origin.wzzm13.com/money/story.aspx?storyid=112147|access-date=December 15, 2015|work=WZZM|date=August 5, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}

In an interview he stated:

{{cquote|When we got off the tour with [[Floetry]] and [[India.Arie]], I was dealing with a lot of mental issues... Not enough rest... [[Jet lag]]. I underwent [[physical ailment]]. I came home and said I wasn't gonna do it no more. When I tried to seek some attention, they took it like I was leaving the group. I was in a [[coma]] for a day. When I came out my coma, all my stuff was out of my [[Condominium|condo]]. I lost all my cars, lost everything. And I got a termination letter from the group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}}}

After leaving the group, he began recording as a solo artist.
