'''Beirut''' is an American band that was originally the solo musical project of Zach Condon. Beirut's music combines elements of [[indie rock]] and [[world music]]. The band's first performance was in New York, in May 2006, to support its debut album ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]''.<ref name="pitchfork37080" /><ref name=":0">{{citation|first=Rachel |last=Syme |title=Beirut: The Band|date=August 6, 2006|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/18856/|work=New York Magazine|access-date=December 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103170230/https://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/18856/|archive-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

Condon named the band after [[Beirut|Lebanon's capital]], because of the city's history of conflict and as a place where cultures collide.<ref name=":0" /> Beirut performed in Lebanon for the first time in 2014, at the Byblos International Festival.

=== ''Gulag Orkestar'' ===
Returning from Europe, Condon enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where he studied Portuguese and photography.<ref name="Albuquerque tribune">{{citation|url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/oct/19/zach-condon-returns-home-land-red-and-green/ |title=Zach Condon returns home to the land of red and green |work=Albuquerque Tribune |date=October 19, 2006 |access-date=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412051150/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/oct/19/zach-condon-returns-home-land-red-and-green/ |archive-date=April 12, 2008 }}</ref> Condon recorded most of the material for ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]'' alone in his bedroom, finishing the album in a studio with [[Jeremy Barnes]] ([[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]]) and [[Heather Trost]] ([[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]]), who became early contributors to the band.

Ba Da Bing! records signed Condon on the strength of the recordings. Condon recruited friends to play ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]'''s first live shows in New York in May 2006.

Beirut's first music video was for "[[Elephant Gun (EP)|Elephant Gun]]", directed by Alma Har'el who also directed the band's second video "Postcards from Italy". ''[[Lon Gisland]]'' was the full band's first release in 2007.

=== ''The Flying Club Cup'' ===
Beirut's second album, ''[[The Flying Club Cup]],'' was recorded largely at a makeshift studio in Albuquerque and completed at [[Arcade Fire]]'s studio in [[Quebec]]. The music on the album has a French influence due to Condon's interest in French chanson during its recording.<ref>{{citation|title=Beirut's Zach Condon: young success 'fucked with a lot of things'|date=October 8, 2007|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2007/10/beiruts_zach_condon_young_succ.php|work=All Shook Down: SF weekly|access-date=December 11, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221851/http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2007/10/beiruts_zach_condon_young_succ.php| archive-date= 26 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Condon has cited Francophone singers [[Jacques Brel]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Yves Montand]] as influences.<ref>{{citation|title=Beirut|url=http://www.myspace.com/beruit|work=Myspace|access-date=December 11, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210090707/http://www.myspace.com/beruit| archive-date= 10 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> He also expressed interest in French film and culture, claiming this was his original reason for traveling to Europe.<ref>{{citation|title=Exclusive interview with Beirut|url=http://www.miscellanynews.com/2.1579/exclusive-interview-with-beirut-1.1312698#.UYL9RoKeF1M|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220050001/http://www.miscellanynews.com/2.1579/exclusive-interview-with-beirut-1.1312698#.UYL9RoKeF1M|archive-date=2012-02-20|work=The Miscellany News| date = January 26, 2009|access-date=December 11, 2009}}</ref> The Flying Club Cup was officially released in October 2007.

Reviewers and fellow musicians have noted that, unlike the prior albums which drew heavily on foreign music from Mexico, France, the Balkans, etc., this one has shown Beirut with its own, more pop-oriented sound; saying, "what emerges [on The Rip Tide] is a style that belongs uniquely and distinctly to Beirut, one that has actually been there all along."<ref>[http://www.nialler9.com/10449-beirut-east-harlem-rip-tide/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610041019/http://www.nialler9.com/10449-beirut-east-harlem-rip-tide/|date=June 10, 2011|title=Beirut – 'East Harlem' / The Rip Tide}}</ref> One reviewer noted that "the Euro influences [of Beirut's previous albums] are still there, but the presiding spirit is old-fashioned American pop."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontpsych.com/2011/08/15/less-is-more-a-review-of-the-rip-tide/|title=Less Is More – A Review of Beirut's The Rip Tide|last=Meatto|first=Keith|date=August 15, 2011|publisher=Frontier Psychiatrist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531085605/http://frontpsych.com/2011/08/15/less-is-more-a-review-of-the-rip-tide/|archive-date=May 31, 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=2014-01-14|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This album also differs from Beirut's previous albums in that the music was recorded as a band playing together rather than laying down individual tracks one at a time, though the lyrics were only added by Condon after all the music had been recorded.<ref name="npr.org"/>

===''No No No''===
On June 1, 2015, Beirut announced their fourth album, ''[[No No No (Beirut album)|No No No]]'', released on September 11, 2015.<ref name="consequenceofsound.net2">{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/beirut-announces-new-album-shares-title-track-no-no-no-listen/|title=Beirut announces new album, shares title track No No No|date=June 1, 2015|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=June 1, 2015}}</ref> On the same day, the title track "No No No" was released for streaming. The album was recorded following a period of turmoil in Condon's life, facing a divorce and having been admitted into a hospital in Australia for exhaustion following extensive touring. However, Condon recovered fully thanks to a new relationship and his return to New York. Beirut also announced a tour for the album.<ref name="consequenceofsound.net2"/>

===''Gallipoli''===
On October 22, 2018, Condon announced Beirut's next album, ''[[Gallipoli (Beirut album)|Gallipoli]]'', released on February 1, 2019. The album is named after [[Gallipoli, Apulia|the Italian town]] where Condon wrote the title track.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/beirut-announce-new-album-gallipoli/|title=Beirut Announce New Album Gallipoli|work=Pitchfork|last=Yoo|first=Noah|date=October 20, 2018|access-date=October 21, 2018}}</ref> On January 10, 2019, the music video for Beirut's new song "Landslide" was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCVB5zjwdzE|title=Beirut - Landslide (OFFICIAL VIDEO)|access-date=February 1, 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> 
On February 9, 2019, Beirut appeared on the "Saturday Sessions" segment of CBS This Morning's Saturday program, playing selections from "Gallipoli."

The inspiration for Gallipoli started with an old [[Farfisa organ]] that Condon had shipped to New York from his parent's home in New Mexico. He acquired the organ in High School when a traveling circus left it in the warehouse of his old workplace. The organ had broken keys and functions, but he managed to write most of his first (Gulag Orkestar) and large parts of his second (The Flying Club Cup) records on it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/02/02/690893093/how-beiruts-zach-condon-escapes-to-find-his-focus|title=How Beirut's Zach Condon Escapes To Find His Focus|work=NPR|last= Simon |first= Scott |date=February 2, 2019}}</ref>  Condon started writing the first songs of Gallipoli on this organ sometime in late 2016 at his home in Brooklyn. As songwriting progressed to the studio, Gabe Wax (the producer of No No No) was brought in to help usher in the particular sonic qualities of Gallipoli, which consisted of pushing every instrument and sound to its "near breaking point" (much as he did years ago with the old, broken Farisa organ), by channeling instruments through broken amplifiers, tape machines and PA systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wfuv.org/content/beirut-6|title=BEIRUT|work=FUV|last= DeVivo |first= Darren |date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> Recording commenced in Fall of 2017, after travels through Europe, at Sudestudio in Guagnano, Italy, with the help of studio owner Stefano Manca. Gallipoli was completed with final vocals, mixing and mastering happening at both Condon's apartment and Vox Ton studios in Berlin, Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beirutband.com/|title=GALLIPOLI|last= Condon |first= Zachary |date=August 11, 2018}}</ref>

===''Artifacts''===
On October 20, 2021, Beirut announced their next album, ''Artifacts,'' to be released January 28, 2022, via the release of the single "Fisher Island Sound" on the band's official YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beirut |title=Beirut - Fisher Island Sound (OFFICIAL AUDIO) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EenQuqpVllA&ab_channel=Beirut |website=YouTube |publisher=Beirut |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref> The album will be a compilation of "collected EPs, singles, B-sides and early work,"<ref>{{cite web |title=Beirut - Artifacts |url=https://www.beirutband.com/ |website=Beirut |publisher=Beirut |access-date=21 October 2021}}</ref> including a re-release of the ''[[Lon Gisland]]'' EP.

== Personnel ==
Condon plays a rotary-valve trumpet and the [[ukulele]] as his main instruments. He bought the ukulele as a joke stage prop, but found he liked the sound and was able to play it despite a wrist injury that inhibited him from playing guitar. Condon also plays the piston trumpet, [[euphonium]], mandolin, accordion, various keyboard instruments, and a modified conch shell that appears on ''[[The Flying Club Cup]]''.<ref name="pitchfork37080">{{citation|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37080-interview-beirut |title=Beirut Interview |work=Pitchfork |access-date=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218062923/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37080-interview-beirut |archive-date=December 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Gazette">{{citation|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Montreal+International+Jazz+Festival+Beirut+conversation/1779539/story.html|title=Montreal International Jazz Festival: Beirut in conversation| work=The Gazette| date = July 10, 2009|access-date = December 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Beirut Myspace">{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/beruit|title=Edward Peckham (beruit) on Myspace|website=Myspace.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txzDZitF20M|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref>
