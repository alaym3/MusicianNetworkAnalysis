==Biography==
Emre Aydın was born in [[Isparta]] on 2 February 1981 as the first child of Şaban and Nermin Aydın, who are both pharmacists.<ref name="cnnturk">[http://www.cnnturk.com/2008/kultur.sanat/muzik//11/12/ailesi.emre.aydinla.gurur.duyuyor/500261.0/index.html Ailesi Emre Aydın'la gurur duyuyor]</ref> He has a younger brother named Yiğit. In his early years, the family moved to [[Antalya]]. Emre began playing [[baglama|saz]] at an early age and later opted for guitar.<ref name="cnnturk"/> He graduated from Antalya Anadolu Lisesi (high school) and then studied economics at [[Dokuz Eylül University]] in [[İzmir]], upon his parents' wish.<ref name="kibrisgazetesi">[http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/index.php/cat/9/news/65524/PageName/Magazin "Konservatuara gitmeyi hiç düşünmedim"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815063946/http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/index.php/cat/9/news/65524/PageName/Magazin |date=15 August 2009 }}</ref> In a 2009 interview Emre admitted that he never attended a [[conservatory (school)|musical conservatory]], because he did not want to have his musical experience transformed into school lessons and exam sessions, which he thought would make him lose interest in music.<ref name="kibrisgazetesi"/>

In 2016, the singer married his long time girlfriend, Eda Köksal, who is an interior architect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/emre-aydin-evlendi-1-nikah-3-ayri-dugun-40204506|title=Emre Aydın evlendi… 1 nikah 3 ayrı düğün|newspaper=Hürriyet|access-date=23 May 2017|date=22 August 2016|language=tr}}</ref>

==Career==
===Sing Your Song competition===
In 2002, while at Dokuz Eylül University, Emre saw the advertisement of a musical competition, ''Sing Your Song'', aired by a domestic television channel, [[Show TV]]. The jury included well-known Turkish rock singer [[Koray Candemir]]. With a friend, Onur Ela, they decided to apply with Emre's own song, ''Dönersen'' (If you come back), and out of 1500 applicants, they won the competition.<ref>[http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=160092 Hürriyet: ''6. Cadde'den son model Sabuha'' (The last model from 6. Cadde is "Sabuha")] {{in lang|tr}}</ref><ref name="kibristv">[http://www.kibrisgenctv.com/haber/k20/66/Emre-Aydin-ile-Cok-Ozel.html Emre Aydın ile Çok Özel] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090204005113/http://www.kibrisgenctv.com/haber/k20/66/Emre-Aydin-ile-Cok-Ozel.html |date=4 February 2009 }}</ref> The song was selected by [[Universal Music]] into a selection album and their band, named [[6. Cadde]] was offered a contract with Universal Music Turkey.

===6. Cadde===
{{main|6. Cadde}}
6. Cadde (previously named EQ) was established in [[İzmir]] in 1999, by Emre Aydin and fellow students from the same university and published demo recordings for two songs, ''Rüyamdaki Aptal Kadın'' (Foolish Woman in my Dream) and ''Tesadüfen'' (By Chance) on the internet.<ref>[http://www.anatolianrock.com/6_nd__Cadde/ Anatolian Rock: 6. cadde]</ref> The group went through major transforming during the years, with changing band members, the final set-up with Onur Ela applied for the musical competition ''Sing Your Song'', which they won. This made them possible to record their first professional album, produced by [[Haluk Kurosman]] and published by [[Universal Music]] Turkey in 2003. The recording was done in [[Istanbul]] in a month's time, while all-round production of the album took {{frac|2|1|2}} months. The first single from the album was ''Sabuha'', previously sung by such [[arabesk music|arabesk performers]] as [[Ibrahim Tatlises]]. ''Sabuha'' came to life by one of the tasks the jury of ''Sing Your Song'' assigned to the participants, namely that each band had to cover a song outside of their own musical genre. The song was refurbished by 6. Cadde from a different musical approach, changing its style and arrangements, in less than 15 minutes, as they had forgotten about the task and hurriedly recorded ''Sabuha'' for next day's competition shooting. Later the song was re-recorded for the album.<ref name="kurosman">[http://www.turkrock.com/article343.html Haluk Kurosman interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143058/http://www.turkrock.com/article343.html |date=1 May 2009 }} {{in lang|tr}}</ref> In an interview Kurosman gave away that the ''6. Cadde'' album was the rough mix of studio recordings, previously prepared for radio promotion, because his computer's hard disk became damaged, all the records vanished, and they did not have time to record them all over again.<ref name="kurosman"/> Soon after the first stocks arrived to the shops, Universal Music Turkey closed down, Onur Ela decided to leave the band, and Emre opted for a solo career.

===Solo career===

After [[6. Cadde]] broke up, Emre returned to Izmir, where he went through a difficult phase of his life. He had difficulties at the university, in finding a new rent, and other personal problems that made him write most of the songs of his first solo album, "[[Afili Yalnızlık]]" (''Ostentatious Loneliness''), released by [[Sony BMG]] in 2006,<ref name="istegenc">[http://www.istegenc.com.tr/content/muzik/article.asp?lngArticleID=3695 Mutsuz değil melankoliğim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813042718/http://www.istegenc.com.tr/content/muzik/article.asp?lngArticleID=3695 |date=13 August 2009 }}</ref> after he was signed by former 6. Cadde producer [[Haluk Kurosman]] and talent manager [[Hadi Elazzi]]'s own company, [[GRGDN]]. The album was recorded in the GRGDN studio in the Ulus district of [[Istanbul]]. Emre was assisted by renowned Turkish musicians, bass guitar was played by Cem Bahtiyar of [[maNga (band)|maNga]], drums by İllker Baliç of [[Gripin]], electric guitar by Tuğrul Akyüz of [[Vega (band)|Vega]] and Kurosman himself also contributed as a musician.<ref name="istegenc"/> His first videoclip was shot for the title song, "Afili Yalnızlık", directed by cinematographer [[Yon Thomas]], who has previously worked with, among others, [[Norah Jones]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mvdbase.com/tech.php?first=Yon&last=Thomas |title=Yon Thomas Cinematographer |access-date=2 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814230755/http://www.mvdbase.com/tech.php?first=Yon&last=Thomas |archive-date=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The storyline was also written by Thomas, who excluded the singer from the scenario of a [[narcissistic]] woman, played by Turkish actress [[Şebnem Dönmez]].<ref name="kibristv"/> The story of the first video was extended to the following two videos, shot for "Kim Dokunduysa Sana" (Whoever Touched You) and "Git" (Go), the latter was also directed by Yon Thomas. Three more videos were shot, for "Belki Bir Gün Özlersin" (Maybe One Day You'll Miss), "Bu Kez Anladım" (I Understood It This Time) and "Dayan Yalnızlığım" (Endure, My Loneliness).

Emre's album quickly became a smash hit in Turkey, having won several awards, including ''Blue Jean Magazine's'' awards for Best Song, Best Newcomer, Best Music Video and his producer, [[Haluk Kurosman]] was named Best Producer.<ref name="Blue Jean Magazine 1/2007">[http://www.bluejean.com.tr/dergi/06294/ Blue Jean Magazine 1/2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108020452/http://www.bluejean.com.tr/dergi/06294/ |date=8 January 2007 }}</ref>
Emre also won the prestigious ''Powertürk Music Award'' as ''Best Newcomer'' in 2007 and a year later was awarded for the ''Best song'' and ''Best duet'' at the same gala (see [[Emre Aydın#Awards|Awards section]] for a full list of awards). The album received mostly positive criticism, according to Burhan Ayeri columnist, "Emre Aydın's performance at 2 Renk [a television programme] was extraordinary. With a good manager, he will sweep away [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]]. As [[Özcan Deniz]] said, 'this is the first time we see all songs of an album being top hits'."<ref>"2 Renk'teki Emre Aydın'ın besteleri olağanüstü. İyi bir menajerle, Tarkan'ı silip süpürür. Özcan Deniz'in dediği gibi 'Bir albümdeki tüm parçaların zirve yaptığı çalışma'yı ilk defa yaşıyoruz".
