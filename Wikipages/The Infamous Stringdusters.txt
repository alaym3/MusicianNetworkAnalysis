==Formation==
The creation of the Infamous Stringdusters is first based on the relationships that banjo player Chris Pandolfi, dobro player Andy Hall, and former guitarist [[Chris Eldridge]] formed while in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Hall, Pandolfi and Eldridge were students at [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref name="cincy groove">{{cite web|url=http://www.cincygroove.com/?p=5919|title=Interview with Travis Book|publisher=Cincy Groove}}</ref>  Pandolfi and Eldridge soon followed Andy Hall to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they met Hall's Ronnie Bowman Committee bandmates Jesse Cobb (mandolin) and Jeremy Garrett (fiddle). The group then held an audition for a possible bassist in the fall of 2005, where they found Travis Book. Book had been residing in [[Durango, Colorado]]. Eldridge soon departed in 2007 to join [[Chris Thile]]'s [[Punch Brothers]] and was replaced by guitarist Andy Falco.<ref name="cincy groove" /> In October 2011, Jesse Cobb announced his departure from the group. Cobb cited mental and physical stress as the reason for his leaving days before the release of ''We'll Do It Live''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jesse Cobb departs the 'Dusters|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/31923/jesse-cobb-departs-the-dusters/|publisher=Bluegrass Today}}</ref>

[[Laws_of_Gravity_(album)|''Laws of Gravity'']] have been the most critically acclaimed. At the end of 2011, the Stringdusters were named one of the top-trending bands of the year, just behind the [[Foo Fighters]], [[The Wood Brothers]], and [[B.B. King]].<ref name="jam base 2011 review">{{cite web|title=2011 Year in Review|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/55758/2011-Year-In-Review|publisher=JamBase.com}}</ref>
