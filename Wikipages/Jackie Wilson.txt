'''Jack Leroy Wilson Jr.''' (June 9, 1934 – January 21, 1984) was an American [[Soul music|soul]] and [[rock and roll]] singer and performer. A [[tenor]] with a four-octave range, Wilson was a prominent figure in the transition of [[rhythm and blues]] into soul. Wilson was considered a master showman and one of the most dynamic singers and performers in pop, R&B, and rock and roll history,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/644711/Jackie-Wilson|title=Jackie Wilson (American singer)|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|access-date=December 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5843}}</ref> earning the nickname "Mr. Excitement".

Wilson gained initial fame as a member of the R&B vocal group [[Billy Ward and His Dominoes]]. He went solo in 1957 and scored over 50 chart singles spanning the genres of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], pop, soul, [[doo-wop]] and [[easy listening]], including 16 R&B Top 10 hits, in which six R&B of the repertoire ranked as number ones. On the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' Hot 100, Wilson scored 14 top 20 pop hits, six of which reached the top 10.

Wilson was posthumously inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987.<ref name=":0" /> He is also inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]]. Two of Wilson's recordings were inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999. He was honored with the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]'s Legacy Tribute Award in 2003.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2002/12/prweb51997.htm|title=THE RHYTHM & BLUES FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HONOREES FOR THE 13TH ANNUAL PIONEER AWARDS GALA CELEBRATION SET FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20 IN NEW YORK|website=Prweb.com|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref>  In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked Jackie Wilson No. 69 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]], and number 26 as one of the greatest singers of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316103016/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 16, 2006 |title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early years ===
Jack Leroy Wilson Jr. was born on June 9, 1934, in [[Highland Park, Michigan]], as the third and only surviving child of singer-songwriter Jack Leroy Wilson, Sr. (1903–1983) and Eliza Mae Wilson (1900–1975). Eliza Mae was born on the Billups-Whitfield Place in [[Lowndes County, Mississippi]]. Eliza Mae's parents were Tom and Virginia Ransom. Wilson often visited his family in [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus]] and was greatly influenced by the choir at Billups Chapel. Growing up in the suburban Detroit enclave of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], Wilson joined a gang called the Shakers and often got himself in trouble. Wilson's alcoholic father was frequently absent and usually unemployed. In 1943, his parents separated shortly after Jackie's ninth birthday.

Jackie Wilson began singing as a youth, accompanying his mother, an experienced church choir singer. In his early teens he joined a quartet, the Ever Ready Gospel Singers, who gained popularity in local churches. Wilson was not very religious, but he enjoyed singing in public. The money the quartet earned from performing was often spent on alcohol, and Wilson began drinking at an early age.<ref name="history-of-rock.com">{{cite web|url=http://history-of-rock.com/jackie_wilson.htm |title=Jackie Wilson |website=History-of-rock.com |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>

Wilson dropped out of high school at age 15, having been sentenced to detention in the [[Lansing Correctional Facility|Lansing Corrections]] system for juveniles twice. During his second stint in detention, Wilson learned to [[boxing|box]] and began competing in the Detroit amateur circuit at age 16.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Singer-songwriter Jackie Wilson, whose 1958 best-seller 'Lonely Teardrops' made...|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/01/22/Singer-songwriter-Jackie-Wilson-whose-1958-best-seller-Lonely-Teardrops-made/3213443595600/|date=January 22, 1984|website=UPI|language=en}}</ref> Wilson's record in the [[Golden Gloves]] was 2 and 8.

=== Early career ===
He began working at Lee's Sensation Club as a solo singer,<ref name="Honkers And Shouters 1978">Arnold Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters. The Golden Years of Rhythm And Blues''. New York: Crowell-Collier Press, 1978.</ref> then formed a group called the Falcons that included cousin [[Levi Stubbs]], who later led the [[Four Tops]]. (Two other Wilson cousins, Hubert Johnson and Levi's brother Joe, later became members of [[the Contours]].) The other Falcons joined [[Hank Ballard]] as part of [[the Midnighters]],<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters'', 1978, p. 442.</ref> including Alonzo Tucker and [[Billy Davis (guitarist)|Billy Davis]], who worked with Wilson several years later as a solo artist. Tucker and Wilson collaborated as songwriters on a few songs Wilson recorded, including his 1963 hit "[[Baby Workout]]".

Jackie Wilson was discovered by talent agent [[Johnny Otis]], who recruited him for a group called the Thrillers. That group evolved into [[The Royals (group)|the Royals]] (who later became R&B group, [[the Midnighters]], though Wilson was not part of the group when it changed its name and signed with [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]). Wilson signed on with manager Al Green (not to be confused with R&B singer [[Al Green]], nor Albert "Al" Green of the now defunct [[National Records]]). Green, who also managed [[LaVern Baker]], [[Little Willie John]], [[Johnnie Ray]] and [[Della Reese]], owned two music publishing companies, Pearl Music and Merrimac Music, and Detroit's Flame Show Bar, where Wilson met Baker.

After Wilson recorded his first version of "[[Danny Boy]]" and a few other tracks on [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s record label [[Dee Gee Records]] under the name Sonny Wilson (his nickname), Wilson eventually was hired by Billy Ward in 1953 to join a group Ward formed in 1950 called [[Billy Ward and His Dominoes|the Dominoes]], after Wilson's successful audition to replace the immensely popular [[Clyde McPhatter]], who left the Dominoes and formed [[the Drifters]].<ref name=pc3>{{Pop Chronicles|3|2}}</ref> Wilson almost blew his chance that day, showing up calling himself "The shit" Wilson and bragging about being a better singer than McPhatter.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=PA144|last=Gulla|first=Bob|title=Icons of R&B and Soul: Volume 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9780313340444|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref>

Billy Ward felt a stage name would better fit the Dominoes' image, hence ''Jackie'' Wilson. Before leaving the Dominoes, McPhatter coached Wilson on the sound Billy Ward wanted for his group, influencing Wilson's singing style and stage presence. "I learned a lot from Clyde, that high-pitched choke he used and other things...Clyde McPhatter was my man. Clyde and Billy Ward."<ref name="Honkers And Shouters 1978"/> 1940s blues singer [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] was also a major influence on him, and Wilson grew up listening to [[the Mills Brothers]], [[the Ink Spots]], [[Louis Jordan]] and [[Al Jolson]].

Wilson was the group's lead singer for three years, but the Dominoes lost some of their stride with the departure of McPhatter. They made appearances riding on the strength of the group's earlier hits, until 1956 when the Dominoes recorded Wilson with an unlikely interpretation of the pop hit "St. Therese of the Roses", giving the Dominoes another brief moment in the spotlight. (Their only other post-McPhatter/Wilson successes were "Stardust", released July 15, 1957, and "Deep Purple", released October 7, 1957.<ref>"Billboard Top Forty", {{ISBN|0-8230-8280-6}}, et al.</ref>) In 1957 Jackie Wilson began a solo career, left the Dominoes, collaborated with his cousin Levi, and secured performances at Detroit's Flame Show Bar. Later, Al Green secured a deal with [[Decca Records]], and Wilson was signed to its subsidiary label [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]].

===Solo stardom===
Shortly before Jackie Wilson signed a solo contract with Brunswick, Green suddenly died. Green's business partner [[Nat Tarnopol]] took over as Wilson's manager (and ultimately rose to president of Brunswick). Wilson's first single was released, "[[Reet Petite]]" (from his first album ''He's So Fine''), which became a modest R&B success (many years later, an international smash hit). "Reet Petite" was written by future [[Motown]] Records founder [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy Jr.]] (another former boxer who was a native son of Detroit),<ref name=pc25>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19780/m1/ |title=Show 25 – The Soul Reformation: Phase two, the Motown story. [Part 4]}}</ref> in which he co-wrote "Reet Petite" with partner [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Roquel "Billy" Davis]] (using the pseudonym Tyran Carlo) and Gordy's sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwendolyn]]. The trio composed and produced six additional singles for Wilson, in which were: "To Be Loved", "I'm Wanderin'", "We Have Love", "[[That's Why (I Love You So)]]", "[[I'll Be Satisfied]]" and Wilson's late-1958 signature song, "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", which peaked at No. 7 on the pop charts, ranked No. 1 on the R&B charts in the U.S., and established Wilson as an R&B superstar known for his extraordinary, operatic multi-octave vocal range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19767/m1/ |title=Show 17 – The Soul Reformation: More on the evolution of rhythm and blues.

Due to Wilson's fervor when performing, with his dynamic dance moves, impassioned singing and impeccable dress, he was soon christened "Mr. Excitement", a title Wilson kept for the remainder of his career. Jackie Wilson's stagecraft in his live shows inspired [[James Brown]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Michael Jackson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/opinion/michael-jackson-obituary-062609|title=Michael Jackson: The First Punk, the King at Last  |last=Junod |first=Tom |date=June 29, 2009|website=Esquire|access-date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> and [[Elvis Presley]], as well as a host of other artists that followed. Presley was so impressed with Wilson that he made it a point to meet him, and the two instantly became good friends. In a photo of the two posing together, Presley's caption in the autograph reads "You got you a friend for life". Wilson was sometimes called "The Black Elvis".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=James|title=Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947–1977|publisher=Fireside|date=September 19, 2000|page=160|isbn=0-684-86560-2}}</ref> Reportedly, when asked about this Presley said, "I guess that makes me the white Jackie Wilson." Wilson also said he was influenced by Presley, saying, "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/quotes/aboutelvis.asp|title=Quotes By and About Elvis|website=Elvis.com|access-date=December 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102180030/http://elvis.com/elvisology/quotes/aboutelvis.asp|archive-date=January 2, 2010}}</ref>

Wilson's powerful, electrifying live performances rarely failed to bring audiences to a state of frenzy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loti.com/fifties_music/jackie_wilson.htm|title=Jackie Wilson: Mr. Excitement – A R&B Pioneer and Balladeer|last=Cox|first=Erica|website=Loti.com|access-date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> His live performances consisted of knee-drops,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/resnikmusicgroup/jackie-wilson-all-my-love |title=Jackie Wilson – All My Love by Resnik Music Group &#124; Free Listening on SoundCloud |website=Soundcloud.com |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alchemyandaccident.wordpress.com/tag/jackie-wilson/ |title=Jackie Wilson &#124; Alchemy & Accident |website=Alchemyandaccident.wordpress.com |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> splits, spins, back-flips,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gainformer.com/files/Entertianment%20Folder/jackie%20wilson%20Entertainment%20profile.html |title=Entertainment Profile: Jackie Wilson |website=Gainformer.com |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gnXQSqTx2h0C&q=Jackie+Wilson+back+flips&pg=PT261 |title=African Americans in the Performing Arts – Steven Otfinoski – Google Books |via=Google Books |isbn=9781438128559 |access-date=August 18, 2015|last1=Otfinoski |first1=Steven |year=2010 }}</ref> one-footed across-the-floor slides, removing his tie and jacket and throwing them off the stage, basic boxing steps like advance and retreat shuffling,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |magazine=Jet|title=Jackie Wilson Mourned By 1,500 During Funeral At Baptist Church In Detroit |date=February 13, 1984 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> and one of his favorite routines, getting some of the less attractive women in the audience to come up to the stage and kiss him.

The Golden Years Of Rhythm And Blues. New York: Crowell-Collier Press, 1978, pg. 442.</ref>

Jackie Wilson was a regular on TV, making regular appearances on such shows as  ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Shindig!]]'', ''[[Shivaree (TV series)|Shivaree]]'' and ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]''. His only movie appearance was in the rock and roll film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'', where he performed his 1959 hit song "You Better Know It".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://history-of-rock.com/jackie_wilson.htm|title=Jackie Wilson|website=History-of-rock.com|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

In 1958, Davis and Gordy left Wilson and Brunswick after royalty disputes escalated between them and Nat Tarnopol. Davis soon became a successful staff songwriter and producer for [[Chess Records]], while Gordy borrowed $800 from his family and used money he earned from royalties writing for Wilson to start his own recording studio, [[Hitsville USA]], the foundation of [[Motown Records]] in his native Detroit. Meanwhile, convinced that Wilson could venture out of R&B and [[rock and roll]], Tarnopol had the singer record operatic ballads and easy listening material, pairing him with Decca Records' veteran arranger Dick Jacobs.

Jackie Wilson scored hits as he entered the 1960s with the No. 15 "Doggin' Around", the No. 4 pop ballad "[[Night (Jackie Wilson song)|Night]]", another million-seller,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book

His songwriting alliance with Tucker also turned out other songs, including "No Pity (In The Naked City)" and "I'm So Lonely."<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=300/2}}</ref> Top 10 hits continued with "[[Alone at Last (song)|Alone at Last]]" (No. 8 in 1960) and "My Empty Arms" (No. 9 in 1961).

Also in 1961, Wilson recorded a tribute album to [[Al Jolson]], ''Nowstalgia&nbsp;... You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet'', which included the only album liner notes he ever wrote: "...&nbsp;to the greatest entertainer of this or any other era&nbsp;... I guess I have just about every recording he's ever made, and I rarely missed listening to him on the radio&nbsp;... During the three years I've been making records, I've had the ambition to do an album of songs, which, to me, represent the great Jolson heritage&nbsp;... This is simply my humble tribute to the one man I admire most in this business&nbsp;... to keep the heritage of Jolson alive."<ref>Giddins, Gary. ''Rhythm-a-ning: Jazz Tradition and Innovation'', Da Capo (2000), pgs 148–149</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lkCOor91yo|title=Jackie Wilson's Tribute to Al Jolson|via=YouTube|access-date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> The album was a commercial failure.

Following the success of "Baby Workout", Wilson experienced a lull in his career between 1964 and 1966 as Tarnopol and Brunswick Records released a succession of unsuccessful albums and singles. Despite the lack of sales success, Wilson still made artistic gains as he recorded an album with [[Count Basie]], as well as a series of duets with R & B artist [[LaVern Baker]] and [[Gospel music|gospel singer]] [[Linda Hopkins]].

In 1966, Jackie Wilson scored the first of two big comeback singles with the established [[Chicago soul]] producer [[Carl Davis (record producer)|Carl Davis]] with "Whispers (Gettin' Louder)" and "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher]]", the latter a No. 6 pop hit in 1967 that became one of his final hits.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "[[I Get the Sweetest Feeling]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> despite its modest initial chart success in the US (Billboard Pop No. 34), has since become one of his biggest international chart successes, ranking in Top 10 twice in the UK (in 1972 and 1987), and in the Top 20 of the [[Dutch Top 40]]. "I Get the Sweetest Feeling" spawned numerous cover versions by other artists such as [[Edwin Starr]], [[Will Young]], [[Erma Franklin]] ([[Aretha Franklin]]'s sister) and [[Liz McClarnon]].

A key to Jackie Wilson's musical rebirth was Davis insisting that Wilson no longer record with Brunswick's musicians in New York; instead, he recorded with Detroit musicians normally employed by [[Motown Records]] and also Davis' own Chicago-based session players.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The Detroit musicians, known as [[the Funk Brothers]], participated on Wilson's recordings due to their respect for Davis and Wilson.

By 1975, Wilson and [[the Chi-Lites]] were the only significant artists left on Brunswick's roster. Wilson had continued to record singles that found success on the R&B chart, but found no significant pop chart success. His final hit, "You Got Me Walkin'", written by [[Eugene Record]] of the Chi-Lites, was released in 1972 with the Chi-Lites backing him on vocals and instruments.

==Illness and death==
According to [[Larry Geller]], who visited Wilson backstage in Las Vegas with [[Elvis Presley]], the singer had a habit of taking a handful of salt tablets and drinking large amounts of water before each performance, to create profuse sweating. Wilson told Elvis Presley, "The chicks love it."<ref>quoted by Peter Guralnick, ''Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley'', Little Brown and Company, 1999, pg. 239</ref> 

On September 29, 1975, Wilson was one of the featured acts in [[Dick Clark]]'s Good Ol' Rock and Roll Revue, hosted by the [[Latin Casino]] in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]]. He was in the middle of singing "Lonely Teardrops" when he suffered a massive heart attack.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> On the words "My heart is crying" he collapsed on stage; audience members applauded as they initially thought it was part of the act. Clark sensed something was wrong, then ordered the musicians to stop the music. [[Cornell Gunter]] of [[the Coasters]], who was backstage, noticed Wilson was not breathing. Gunter was able to resuscitate him and Wilson was then rushed to a nearby hospital.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

Medical personnel worked to stabilize Wilson's vital signs, but the lack of oxygen to his brain caused him to slip into a coma. He briefly recovered in early 1976, and was even able to take a few wobbly steps, but slipped back into a [[coma|semi-comatose]] state.<ref name=":4">{{Cite magazine|date=March 4, 1976|title=Jackie Wilson Takes Few "Wobbly Steps"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMADAAAAMBAJ&q=jackie+wilson+jet+1976+womack&pg=PA57|magazine=Jet|pages=57|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref>

Wilson's friend, fellow singer [[Bobby Womack]], planned a benefit at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] to raise funds for Wilson on March 4.<ref name=":4" /> Wilson was deemed conscious but incapacitated in early June 1976, unable to speak but aware of his surroundings. Wilson was a resident of the Medford Leas Retirement Center in [[Medford, New Jersey]], when he was admitted into Memorial Hospital of Burlington County in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]], due to having trouble taking nourishment, according to Wilson's attorney John Mulkerin. Wilson's friend Joyce McRae tried to become his caregiver while he was in a nursing home, but he was placed in the guardianship of his estranged wife Harlean Harris and her lawyer John Mulkerin in 1978.<ref name=":5">{{Cite magazine|date=May 4, 1978|title=Court Names Jackie's Wife As His Guardian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEIDAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+jackie+wilson&pg=PA58|magazine=Jet|pages=58, 60|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref>

They claimed that Jones was an obsessed fan who had threatened to shoot herself, and that Wilson's intervention resulted in his being shot.<ref name=":6" /><ref>Guralnick, P: ''Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke'', Abacus, 2006, p. 355.</ref> Wilson was shot in the stomach; the bullet resulted in the loss of a kidney, and lodged too close to his spine to be operated on.<ref name="history-of-rock.com" /> 

In early 1975, during an interview with author Arnold Shaw, Wilson maintained it actually was a zealous fan he did not know who shot him. "We also had some trouble in 1961. That was when some crazy chick took a shot at me and nearly put me away for good..."<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers and Shouters'', 1978, p. 444.</ref> No charges were brought against Jones.

=== Legal problems ===
In 1960, Wilson was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer when fans tried to climb on stage in New Orleans. He assaulted a policeman who had shoved one of the fans.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

In 1964, Wilson jumped from a second floor window at [[Kiel Auditorium]] in [[St. Louis]] to avoid being arrested after a show. His arrest stemmed from a default of a $2,200 contract judgement in which he failed to appear at The Riviera Club in 1959. He was caught by the police and jailed for a day before he posted a $3,000 bond.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=November 19, 1964|title=Jackie Wilson Posts $3,000 Bond In Default Case|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1MADAAAAMBAJ&q=jackie+wilson+jet+1959&pg=PA58|magazine=Jet|pages=58|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref>

In March 1967, Wilson and his drummer, Jimmy Smith, were arrested in [[South Carolina]] on "morals charges"; the two were entertaining two 24-year-old white women in their motel room.<ref name="books.google.com" />

=== Financial issues ===
In 1961, Wilson declared annual earnings of $263,000, while the average annual salary at that time was just $5,000, but he discovered that, despite being at the peak of success, he was broke. Around this time the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) seized Wilson's Detroit family home. Tarnopol and his accountants were supposed to take care of such matters. Wilson made arrangements with the IRS to make restitution on the unpaid taxes; he also re-purchased the family home at auction.<ref name="history-of-rock.com" /> Nat Tarnopol had taken advantage of Wilson's naïveté, mismanaging his money since becoming his manager. Tarnopol also had power of attorney over Wilson's finances.

Tarnopol and 18 other Brunswick executives were indicted on federal charges of mail fraud and tax evasion stemming from bribery and payola scandals in 1975. Also in the indictment was the charge that Tarnopol owed at least $1&nbsp;million in royalties to Wilson. In 1976 Tarnopol and the others were found guilty; an appeals court overturned their conviction 18 months later. Although the conviction was overturned, judges went into detail, outlining that Tarnopol and Brunswick Records did defraud their artists of royalties, and that they were satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for Wilson to file a lawsuit. However, a trial to sue Tarnopol for royalties never took place, as Wilson lay in a nursing home semi-comatose. Tarnopol never paid Wilson monies he had coming to him, and Wilson died owing money to Brunswick Records and an estimated $300,000 to the IRS.<ref>{{YouTube|id=iC6jQhH0YlQ&list=FL7sgr1KkJVNE_dIzfCRuskQ&index=2|title=Jackie Wilson 20/20 Interview Pt. 1}}</ref>

=== Marriages and children ===
At the age of 17, Wilson married his girlfriend Freda Hood in 1951 while she was pregnant. Together they had four children (Jacqueline Denise, Sandra Kay, Jack Leroy Jr, and Anthony Duane). Hood divorced Wilson in 1965, after 14 years of marriage, as she was frustrated with his notorious womanizing.<ref name="history-of-rock.com" />

In 1967, Wilson married his second wife, model Harlean Harris (1937–2019), at the urging of Nat Tarnopol to repair his image.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Gulla|first=Bob|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&q=Harlean+Harris+jackie&pg=PA140|title=Icons of R & B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists who Revolutionized Rhythm|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34044-4|pages=140|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 10, 1967|title=Meet the Wilsons|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Record-World/60s/67/RW-1967-06-10.pdf|journal=Record World|pages=26}}</ref> They had been dating since at least 1960, and had a son, John Dominick known as Petey, born in 1963.<ref name=":7" /> Wilson and Harris legally separated in 1969.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=March 27, 1969|title=Jackie Wilson and Wife Sign Separation Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DgDAAAAMBAJ&q=John+Dominick+harlean+jackie&pg=PA22|magazine=Jet|pages=22|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> Wilson later lived with Lynn Guidry.

However, Wilson and Harris never officially divorced. Harris became his court-appointed guardian in 1978.<ref name=":5" />

Wilson's 16-year-old son, Jackie Jr, was shot and killed on a neighbor's porch near their Detroit home in 1970. Wilson sank into a period of depression, and for the next couple of years remained mostly a recluse. He turned to drug abuse and continued drinking in an attempt to cope with the loss of his son.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Murder & Grief: Jackie Wilson's 3 Children Died YOUNG, What Went Wrong?|url=https://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/murder-grief-jackie-wilsons-3-children-died-young-what-went-wrong/|date=2015-11-23|website=I Love Old School Music|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> More tragedy hit when two of Wilson's daughters died when young.<ref name="simmondwww.iloveoldschs">{{Cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55652-754-8|page=188}}</ref> His daughter Sandra died in 1977 at the age of 24 of an apparent heart attack.

Wilson also fathered many other children out of wedlock with different women, including singer Bobby Brooks Wilson who performs his father's songs in tribute.

Wilson scored a posthumous hit in Europe when "[[Reet Petite]]" topped the charts in the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1986.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> This success was likely due in part to a new animated video made for the song, featuring a clay model of Wilson, that became popular on the [[BBC Two]] TV network in the latter country.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The following year, Wilson's posthumous charting success in the United Kingdom continued when he hit the [[UK Singles Chart]] again with "[[I Get the Sweetest Feeling]]" (number three), and "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher]]" (number 15).

In his 1994 autobiography ''To Be Loved'' (named for one of the hit tunes he wrote for Wilson) Motown founder [[Berry Gordy]] stated that Wilson was "The greatest singer I've ever heard. The epitome of natural greatness. Unfortunately for some, he set the standard I'd be looking for in singers forever".<ref>''To Be Loved'' by Berry Gordy, 1994, p. 88</ref>

In 1994, Monkee [[Peter Tork]] recorded a bluegrass-rock cover of "Higher and Higher" on his first solo album ''[[Stranger Things Have Happened (Peter Tork album)|Stranger Things Have Happened]]'', having previously self-released a single featuring it in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCutcheon |first1=John |title=Peter Tork & The New Monks |url=http://monkee45s.net/Peter_Tork/PT&NM.html |website=Monkee45s.Net |access-date=20 July 2021}}</ref> The song remained Tork's signature solo number in subsequent Monkees concert tours.

Bobby added "He was the ''real'' Elvis Presley, as far as I'm concerned...and Elvis took a lot from him too."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/say_it_loud |title=Say It Loud! |publisher=VH1 |access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref>
