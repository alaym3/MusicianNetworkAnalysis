'''Richard Wayne Penniman''' (December 5, 1932 – May 9, 2020), better known as '''Little Richard''', was an American musician, singer, and songwriter.  He was an influential figure in [[popular music]] and culture for seven decades. Described as "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|the architect of rock and roll]]", Richard's most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his charismatic showmanship and dynamic music, characterized by frenetic piano playing, pounding back beat and raspy shouted vocals, laid the foundation for [[rock and roll]]. Richard's innovative emotive vocalizations and uptempo rhythmic music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. He influenced numerous singers and musicians across musical genres from [[Rock music|rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; his music helped shape [[rhythm and blues]] for generations.

"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]" (1955), one of Richard's [[signature song]]s, became an instant hit, crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom. His next hit single, "[[Long Tall Sally]]" (1956), hit No. 1 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers]] chart, followed by a rapid succession of fifteen more in less than three years. His performances during this period resulted in [[Racial integration|integration]] between [[White Americans]] and [[African Americans]] in his audience. In 1962, during a five-year period in which Richard abandoned rock and roll music for [[born again Christianity]], concert promoter [[Don Arden]] persuaded him to tour Europe. During this time, [[the Beatles]] opened for Richard on some tour dates. Richard advised the Beatles on how to perform his songs and taught the band's member [[Paul McCartney]] his distinctive [[Vocal music|vocalizations]].

Richard is cited as one of the first [[Crossover music|crossover]] black artists, reaching audiences of all races. His music and concerts broke the color line, drawing blacks and whites together despite attempts to sustain segregation. Many of his contemporaries, including [[Elvis Presley]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Eddie Cochran]], recorded covers of his works. Taken by his music and style, and personally covering four of Richard's songs on his own two breakthrough albums in 1956, Presley told Richard in 1969 that his music was an inspiration to him and that he was "the greatest."

Richard was honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[The Recording Academy|Recording Academy]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]. In 2015, Richard received a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award from the [[National Museum of African American Music]] for his key role in the formation of popular music genres and helping to bring an end to the racial divide on the music charts and in concert in the mid-1950s changing American culture significantly. "Tutti Frutti" was included in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2010, which stated that his "unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music."

==Early life==
Richard Wayne Penniman was born in [[Macon, Georgia]], on December 5, 1932,<ref name="bare">{{Cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=Bob|title=Blues – A Regional Experience|last2=LeBlanc|first2=Eric S.|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2013|isbn=978-0313344237|location=Santa Barbara|page=275}}</ref> the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (née Stewart) and Charles "Bud" Penniman.

A mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors, he began singing in church at a young age.{{sfn|Otfinoski|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|White|2003|p=7}} Possibly as a result of complications at birth, he had a slight [[deformity]] that left one of his legs shorter than the other. This produced an unusual gait, and he was mocked for his allegedly [[effeminate]] appearance.{{sfn|White|2003|p=6}}

His family was very religious and joined various [[A.M.E.]], [[Baptist]], and [[Pentecostal]] churches, with some family members becoming ministers. He enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of their charismatic worship and live music.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16–17}} He later recalled that people in his neighborhood sang gospel songs throughout the day during [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] to keep a positive outlook, because "there was so much poverty, so much prejudice in those days."{{sfn|White|2003|pp=7–9}} He had observed that people sang "to feel their connection with God" and to wash their trials and burdens away.{{sfn|White|2003|p=8}} Gifted with a loud singing voice, he recalled that he was "always changing the key upwards" and that he was once stopped from singing in church for "screaming and hollering" so loud, earning him the nickname "War Hawk."{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}} As a child, he would "beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever" while singing, which annoyed neighbors.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}}

His initial musical influences were gospel performers such as [[Brother Joe May]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], and [[Marion Williams]]. May, a singing evangelist who was known as "the Thunderbolt of the Middle West" because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired Richard to become a preacher.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=15–17}}{{sfn|Ryan|2004|p=77}} He credited the [[Clara Ward Singers]] for one of his distinctive hollers.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1638281/m1/#track/2 |title = Pop Chronicles Interviews #71 - Little Richard|year = 1968}}</ref>  Richard attended Macon's [[Ballard-Hudson High School|Hudson High School]],<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Seibert|first1=David|title=Ballard-Hudson Senior High School|url=https://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bibb/ballard-hudson-senior-high-school|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> where he was a below-average student. He eventually learned to play [[alto saxophone]], joining his school's marching band while in fifth grade.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}} While in high school, he got a part-time job at [[Macon City Auditorium]] for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint Brantley. He sold [[Coca-Cola]] to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Lucky Millinder]], and his favorite singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=17}}

==Music career==
===1947–1955: Beginnings===
In October 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe overheard the fourteen-year-old Richard singing her songs before a performance at the [[Macon City Auditorium]]. She invited him to open her show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/music/sister-rosetta-tharpe-singer-influenced-key-rock-roll-figures/UTzkpIsRNvvenWoaTGamtM/|title=Sister Rosetta Tharpe: Singer influenced key rock 'n' roll figures |last=Ruggieri |first=Melissa |date=March 12, 2018|website=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> After the show, Tharpe paid him, inspiring him to become a professional performer.{{sfn|White|2003|p=17}}{{sfn|Lauterbach|2011|p=152}} Richard stated that he was inspired to play the piano after he heard [[Ike Turner]]'s piano intro on "[[Rocket 88]]."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner|last=Turner|first=Ike|date=1999|publisher=Virgin |others=Cawthorne, Nigel|isbn=1852278501 |location=London|pages=xi|oclc=43321298}}</ref> In 1949, he began performing in Doctor Nubillo's traveling show. Richard was inspired to wear turbans and capes in his career by Nubillo, who also "carried a black stick and exhibited something he called 'the devil's child'—the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head." Nubillo told Richard he was "gonna be famous" but that he would have to "go where the grass is greener."{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21–22}}

Before entering the tenth grade, Richard left his family home and joined Hudson's Medicine Show in 1949, performing [[Louis Jordan]]'s "[[Caldonia]]."{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21–22}} Richard recalled that the song was the first secular R&B song he learned, since his family had strict rules against playing R&B music, which they considered "devil music."{{sfn|White|2003|p=22: "It was the only song I knew that wasn't a church song"}} Other sources also indicate that Little Richard was influenced by Jordan.  In fact, according to one reliable source, the whoop sound on Jordan's record Caldonia "sounds eerily like the vocal tone Little Richard would adopt" in addition to the "Jordan-style pencil-thin moustache".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/Caldonia.pdf|title=Caldonia Louis Jordan (1945) Library of Congress|website=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleveland.com/onstage/2015/01/vintage_photos_rock_hall_induc.html|title=Vintage photos: Rock Hall inductee Louis Jordan is the music master behind 'Five Guys Named Moe'|first1=rea|last1=Simakis|work=The Plain Dealer|date=January 23, 2015}}</ref>

Richard also performed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] during this time, performing under the name "Princess LaVonne."{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22–25}} In 1950, Richard joined his first musical band, Buster Brown's Orchestra, where Brown gave him the name Little Richard.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22–23}} Performing in the [[minstrel show]] circuit, Richard, in and out of drag, performed for various vaudeville acts such as Sugarfoot Sam from Alabam, the Tidy Jolly Steppers, the King Brothers Circus, and Broadway Follies.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=24–25}} Having settled in [[Atlanta]] at this point, Richard began listening to rhythm and blues and frequented Atlanta clubs, including the Harlem Theater and the Royal Peacock where he saw performers such as [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] and [[Billy Wright (musician)|Billy Wright]] onstage. Richard was further influenced by Brown's and Wright's flashy style of showmanship and was even more influenced by Wright's flamboyant persona and showmanship. Inspired by Brown and Wright, he decided to become a rhythm-and-blues singer and after befriending Wright, began to learn how to be an entertainer from him, and began adapting a pompadour hairdo similar to Wright's, as well as styling a [[pencil moustache|pencil mustache]], using Wright's brand of facial pancake makeup and wearing flashier clothes.{{sfn|White|2003|p=25}}

Impressed by his singing voice, Wright put him in contact with Zenas Sears, a local DJ. Sears recorded Richard at his station, backed by Wright's band. The recordings led to a contract that year with [[RCA Victor]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Richard recorded a total of eight sides for RCA Victor, including the blues ballad, "Every Hour," which became his first single and a hit in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} The release of "Every Hour" improved his relationship with his father, who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox.{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Shortly after the release of "Every Hour," Richard was hired to front Perry Welch and His Orchestra and played at clubs and army bases for $100 a week.{{sfn|White|2003|p=29}} Richard left RCA Victor in February 1952 after his records for the label failed to chart; the recordings were marketed with little promotion from RCA Victor, although ads for the records showed up in [[Billboard Magazine]]. After Richard began to find success later in the 1950s, RCA Victor reissued the recordings on the budget [[RCA Camden]] label.  Richard's father, Bud was killed in 1952 after a confrontation outside his club. Richard continued to perform during this time and Clint Brantley agreed to manage Richard's career. Moving to [[Houston]], he formed a band called the Tempo Toppers, performing as part of blues [[package tour]]s in Southern clubs such as Club Tiajuana in [[New Orleans]] and Club Matinee in Houston. Richard signed with [[Don Robey]]'s [[Peacock Records]] in February 1953, recording eight sides, including four with [[Johnny Otis]] and his band that were unreleased at the time.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=36–38}} Like his venture with RCA Victor, none of his Peacock singles charted despite his growing reputation for his high energy antics onstage.<ref name="Britannica">{{Cite web|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|title=Little Richard (American musician)|first=Langdon C.|last=Winner|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/344190/Little-Richard|access-date=March 7, 2013}}</ref> Richard began complaining of monetary issues with Robey, resulting in Richard getting knocked out by Robey during a scuffle. Disillusioned by the record business, Richard returned to Macon in 1954.  Struggling with poverty, he settled for work as a dishwasher for [[Southeastern Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Lines]]. While in Macon, he met [[Esquerita]], whose flamboyant onstage persona and dynamic piano playing would deeply influence Richard's approach to performance.<ref name="esquerita">

[[File:In Person 'Lucille' Little Richard and his Orchestra.jpg|alt=A poster advertising Little Richard and his orchestra|thumb|A poster for a Little Richard show, {{c.}} 1956]]
At the suggestion of [[Lloyd Price]], Richard sent a demo to Price's label, [[Specialty Records]], in February 1955. Months passed before Richard got a call from the label.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=40–41}} Finally, in September of that year, Specialty owner [[Art Rupe]] loaned Richard money to buy out of his Peacock contract and set him to work with producer [[Robert Blackwell|Robert "Bumps" Blackwell]].{{sfn|Nite|1982|p=390}} Upon hearing the demo, Blackwell felt Richard was Specialty's answer to [[Ray Charles]], however, Richard told him he preferred the sound of [[Fats Domino]]. Blackwell sent him to New Orleans where he recorded at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studios, recording there with several of Domino's session musicians, including drummer [[Earl Palmer]] and saxophonist [[Lee Allen (musician)|Lee Allen]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=44–47}} Richard's recordings that day failed to produce much inspiration or interest, 
(although Blackwell saw some promise). Frustrated, Blackwell and Richard went to relax at the Dew Drop Inn nightclub. According to Blackwell, Richard then launched into a risqué [[dirty blues]] he titled "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]." Blackwell said he felt the song had hit potential and hired songwriter [[Dorothy LaBostrie]] to replace some of Richard's sexual lyrics with less controversial ones. He also changed the microphone placement and pushed Richard’s voice forward{{sfn|White|2003|pp=55–56}}<ref name=Allmusic2013b>{{Cite web|website=Allmusic|title=Little Richard|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4765|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> Recorded in three takes in September 1955, "Tutti Frutti" was released as a single that November{{sfn|White|2003|p=264}} and became an instant hit, reaching No. 2 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers]] chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom. It reached No. 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]] in America and No. 29 on the British singles chart, eventually selling a million copies.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name=pc6>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19752/|title=Show 6 – Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The rock revolution gets underway|publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu|date=March 16, 1969|access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

===1956–1962: Initial success and conversion===
{{quote box|width=20%|quote=A lot of songs I sang to crowds first to watch their reaction. That's how I knew they'd hit.|source= —Little Richard{{sfn|Du Noyer|2003|p=14}}}}

Richard's next hit single, "[[Long Tall Sally]]" (1956), hit number one on the R&B chart and number thirteen on the Top 100 while reaching the top ten in Britain. Like "Tutti Frutti," it sold over a million copies. Following his success, Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford "Gene" Burks and [[bandleader|leader]] [[Grady Gaines]], [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Olsie "Baysee" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel "Buster" Douglas.{{sfn|White|2003|p=58}} Richard began performing on package tours across the United States. Art Rupe described the differences between Richard and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that, while "the similarities between Little Richard and Fats Domino for recording purposes were close," Richard would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording and that onstage, where Domino was "plodding, very slow," Richard was "very dynamic, completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist."{{sfn|White|2003|pp=74–75}}

Richard's performances, like most early rock and roll shows, resulted in [[Racial integration|integrated]] audience reaction during an era where public places were divided into "white" and "colored" domains. In these package tours, Richard and other artists such as Fats Domino and [[Chuck Berry]] would enable audiences of both races to enter the building, albeit still segregated (e.g. blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor). As his later Producer [[H.B. Barnum]], explained, Richard's performances enabled audiences to come together to dance.{{sfn|Pegg|2002|p=50: "Although they still had the audiences together in the building, they were ''there'' together. And most times, before the end of the night, they would be all mixed together"}} Despite broadcasts on television from local [[racism|supremacist]] groups such as the North Alabama [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Council]] warning that rock and roll "brings the races together," Richard's popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at "white-only venues," especially in the South where racism was most overt.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=82–83}} Richard's high-energy antics included lifting his leg while playing the piano, climbing on top of his piano, running on and off the stage and throwing his souvenirs to the audience.{{sfn|Bayles|1996|p=133: "He'd be on the stage, he'd be off the stage, he'd be jumping and yelling, screaming, whipping the audience on&nbsp;..."}} He also began using capes and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins. Richard said he began to be more flamboyant onstage so no one would think he was "after the white girls."{{sfn|White|2003|p=70}}

Richard claims that a show at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Theatre (Baltimore)|Royal Theatre]] in June 1956 led to women throwing their [[undergarments]] onstage at him, resulting in other female fans repeating the action, saying it was "the first time" that had happened to any artist.{{sfn|White|2003|p=66}} Richard's show would stop several times that night due to fans being restrained from jumping off the balcony and then rushing to the stage to touch him.{{sfn|White|2003|p=66}} Overall, Richard would produce seven singles in the United States alone in 1956, with five of them also charting in the UK, including "[[Slippin' and Slidin']]," "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]," "[[Ready Teddy]]," "[[The Girl Can't Help It (song)|The Girl Can't Help It]]" and "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]." Immediately after releasing "Tutti Frutti," which was then protocol for the industry, "safer" white recording artists such as [[Pat Boone]] covered the song, sending the song to the top twenty of the charts, several positions higher than Richard's.  His fellow rock and roll peers [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] also recorded his songs later that same year. Befriending [[Alan Freed]],{{sfn|White|2003|pp=83–84}} the disc jockey eventually put him in his "rock and roll" movies such as ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''{{sfn|White|2003|p=80}} and ''[[Mister Rock and Roll (film)|Mister Rock and Roll]]''. Richard was given a larger singing role in the film, ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]''.<ref name="WallStreet">{{Cite news|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703545604575407661245246210|title=Little Richard, The First|author=Myers, Marc|date=October 10, 2010|access-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref> That year, he scored more hit success with songs such as "[[Jenny, Jenny]]" and "[[Keep A-Knockin']]" the latter becoming his first top ten single on the Billboard Top 100. By the time he left Specialty in 1959, Richard had scored a total of nine top 40 pop singles and seventeen top 40 R&B singles.{{sfn|White|2003|p=241}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=264–265}}

Richard performed at the famed  twelfth [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] held at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] in Los Angeles which was produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.]] on September 2, 1956. Also performing that day were [[Dinah Washington]], The Mel Williams Dots, Julie Stevens, [[Chuck Higgins|Chuck Higgins']] Orchestra, [[Bo Rhambo]], Willie Hayden & Five Black Birds, The Premiers, [[Gerald Wilson]] and His 20-Pc.

Shortly after the release of "Tutti Frutti," Richard relocated to [[Los Angeles]]. After achieving success as a recording artist and live performer, Richard moved into a wealthy, formerly predominantly white neighborhood, living close to black celebrities such as boxer [[Joe Louis]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=82}} Richard's first album, ''[[Here's Little Richard]]'', was released by Specialty in March 1957 and peaked at number thirteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart. Similar to most albums released during that era, the album featured six released singles and "filler" tracks.<ref name="entertainment.time.com">{{Cite magazine|last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://entertainment.time.com/2006/11/02/the-all-time-100-albums/slide/heres-little-richard/ |title=Here's Little Richard &#124; All-TIME 100 Albums |magazine=Time |date=January 27, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref> In early 1958, Specialty released his second album, ''[[Little Richard (album)|Little Richard]]'', which didn't chart. In October 1957, Richard embarked on a package tour in Australia with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Eddie Cochran]]. During the middle of the tour, he shocked the public by announcing he was following a life in the [[minister (Christianity)|ministry]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=89–92}} Richard would claim in his autobiography that during a flight from Melbourne to Sydney that his plane was experiencing some difficulty and he claimed to have seen the plane's red hot engines and felt angels were "holding it up."{{sfn|White|2003|p=91}} At the end of his Sydney performance, Richard saw a bright red fireball flying across the sky above him and claimed he was "deeply shaken."{{sfn|White|2003|p=91}} Though it was eventually told to him that it was the launching of the first [[artificial satellite|artificial Earth satellite]] [[Sputnik 1]], Richard took it as a "sign from God" to repent from performing secular music and his wild lifestyle at the time.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=89–92}}

Returning to the States ten days earlier than expected, Richard read news of his original flight having crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] as a further sign to "do as God wanted."{{sfn|White|2003|p=92}} After a "farewell performance" at the [[Apollo Theater]] and a "final" recording session with Specialty later that month, Richard enrolled at [[Oakwood University|Oakwood College]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to study theology.{{sfn|White|2003|p=95}}{{sfn|Miller|1996|p=248}} Despite his claims of spiritual rebirth, Richard admitted his reasons for leaving were more monetary. During his tenure at Specialty, despite earning millions for the label, Richard complained that he did not know the label had cut the percentage of royalties he was to earn for his recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=88–89}} Specialty continued to release Richard recordings, including "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]" and his unique version of "Kansas City," until 1960. Finally ending his contract with the label, Richard agreed to relinquish any [[royalties]] for his material.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=95–97}} In 1958, Richard formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=94–95}} A month after his decision to leave secular music, Richard met Ernestine Harvin, a secretary from [[Washington, D.C.]], and the couple married on July 11, 1959.{{sfn|White|2003|p=97}} Richard ventured into gospel music, first recording for [[End Records]], before signing with [[Mercury Records]] in 1961, where he eventually released ''King of the Gospel Singers'', in 1962, produced by [[Quincy Jones]], who later remarked that Richard's vocals impressed him more than any other vocalist he had worked with.{{sfn|White|2003|p=102: "Richard had such a unique voice and style that no one has ever matched it – even to this day"}} His childhood heroine, [[Mahalia Jackson]], wrote in the liner notes of the album that Richard "sang gospel the way it should be sung."{{sfn|White|2003|p=103: "He sang gospel the way it should be sung.

In 1962, concert promoter [[Don Arden]] persuaded Little Richard to tour Europe after telling him his records were still selling well there. With fellow rock singer [[Sam Cooke]] as an opening act, Richard, who featured a teenage [[Billy Preston]] in his gospel band, figured it was a gospel tour and, after Cooke's delayed arrival forced him to cancel his show on the opening date, performed only gospel material during the show, leading to boos from the audience expecting Richard to sing his rock and roll hits. The following night, Richard viewed Cooke's well-received performance. Bringing back his competitive drive, Richard and Preston warmed up in darkness before launching into "Long Tall Sally," resulting in frenetic, hysterical responses from the audience. A show at [[Mansfield]]'s Granada Theatre ended early after fans rushed the stage.{{sfn|White|2003|p=112}} Hearing of Richard's shows, [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[the Beatles]], asked Don Arden to allow his band to open for Richard on some tour dates, to which he agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom that October.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=12}} The following month they, along with Swedish singer [[Jerry Williams (singer)|Jerry Williams]] and his band The Violents,<ref name="liret">{{Cite news|last1=Steen|first1=Håkan|title=Håkan Steen: Tack så mycket för liret "Jerka"|trans-title=Håkan Steen: Thanks so much for the jive "Jenka"|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/Kvq3L6/hakan-steen-tack-sa-mycket-for-liret-jerka|access-date=March 28, 2018|work=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=March 26, 2018}}</ref> opened for Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} During this time, Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught [[Paul McCartney]] his distinctive [[vocal music|vocalizations]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} Back in the United States, Richard recorded six rock and roll songs with his 1950's band, the Upsetters for [[Little Star Records]], under the name "World Famous Upsetters," hoping this would keep his options open in maintaining his position as a minister.

In the fall of 1963, Richard was called by a concert promoter to rescue a sagging tour featuring [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Richard agreed and helped to save the tour from flopping. At the end of that tour, Richard was given his own television special for [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] titled ''The Little Richard Spectacular''. The special became a ratings hit and after 60,000 fan letters, was rebroadcast twice.{{sfn|White|2003|p=121}} In 1964, now openly re-embracing rock and roll, Richard released "Bama Lama Bama Loo" on Specialty Records. Due to his UK exposure, the song reached the top twenty there but only climbed to number 82 in the U.S.{{sfn|White|2003|p=248}} Later in the year, he signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]], then on its dying legs, to release his "comeback" album, ''[[Little Richard Is Back (And There's a Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On!)|Little Richard Is Back]]''. Due to the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands as well as the rise of soul labels such as [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records]] and the popularity of [[James Brown]], Richard's new releases were not well promoted or well received by radio stations. In November/December 1964, [[Jimi Hendrix]] joined Richard's Upsetters band as a full member.{{sfn|McDermott|2009|p=13}}<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Havers |first2=Richard |last2=Evans |title=The Golden Age of Rock 'N' Roll |publisher=Chartwell Books |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZSeU_rmdxYC&pg=PA126 |page=126 |isbn=978-0785826255}}</ref>

In December 1964, Richard brought Hendrix and childhood friend and piano teacher Eskew Reeder to a New York studio to re-record an album’s worth of his greatest hits. In the Spring of 1965, Richard took Hendrix and Billy Preston to a New York studio where they recorded the [[Don Covay]] soul ballad, "I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)," which became a number 12 R&B hit.<ref>{{harvnb|McDermott|2009|p=12}}: Hendrix recording with Penniman; {{harvnb|Shadwick|2003|pp=56–57}}: "I Don't Know What You Got (But It's Got Me)" recorded in New York City.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Three other songs were recorded during the sessions, "Dance a Go Go" aka "Dancin' All Around the World", "You Better Stop", and "Come See About Me" (possibly an instrumental), but "You Better Stop" was not issued until 1971 and "Come See About Me" has yet to see official release.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=57}}}}

Around this time, Richard and Jimi appeared in a show starring [[Soupy Sales]] at the Brooklyn Paramount, New York. Richard’s flamboyance and drive for dominance reportedly got him thrown off the show.

[[File:Little Richard (1966) (cropped).png|thumb|Little Richard in 1966]]

Hendrix and Richard clashed over the spotlight, as well as Hendrix's tardiness, wardrobe and stage antics. Hendrix also complained over not being properly paid by Richard. In early July 1965, Richard's brother Robert Penniman "fired" Jimi (however, Jimi wrote to his father, Al Hendrix, that he quit Richard as "you can't live on promises when you're on the road, so I had to cut that mess aloose." Hendrix had not been paid "for five-and-a-half weeks" and was owed 1,000 dollars. Hendrix then rejoined [[the Isley Brothers]]' band, the IB Specials.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|pp=56–60}} Richard later signed with [[Modern Records]], releasing a modest charter, "Do You Feel It?" before leaving for [[Okeh Records]] in early 1966. His former Specialty labelmate [[Larry Williams]] produced two albums for Richard on Okeh - the studio release ''[[The Explosive Little Richard]]'', which utilised a [[Motown]]-influenced sound and produced the modest charters "Poor Dog" and "Commandments of Love" and ''[[Little Richard's Greatest Hits: Recorded Live!]]'' which returned him to the album charts.<ref name="HallofFame1986">{{Cite web|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|year=1986|title=Little Richard|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/little-richard/|access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|White|2003|pp=253–255}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=268–269}} Richard was later scathing about this period, declaring Larry Williams "the worst producer in the world."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Dalton |first1=David |date=May 28, 1970 |title=Little Richard: Child of God |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/little-richard-child-of-god-2-177027/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref> In 1967, Richard signed with [[Brunswick Records]] but after clashing with the label over musical direction, he left the label the following year.

[[File:Little Richard (1967).png|thumb|left|upright|Little Richard in 1967]]

Richard felt that producers on his labels worked in not promoting his records during this period. Later, he claimed they kept trying to push him to records similar to Motown and felt he wasn't treated with appropriate respect.<ref>"Religion and Rock and Roll", ''Joel Martin Show'', WBAB 102.3 FM, NY. Guests: [[Harry Hepcat]] and Little Richard, August 16, 1981.</ref> Richard often performed in dingy clubs and lounges with little support from his label. While Richard managed to perform in huge venues overseas such as in England and France, in the U.S. Richard had to perform on the [[Chitlin' Circuit]]. Richard's flamboyant look, while a hit during the 1950s, failed to help his labels to promote him to more conservative black record buyers.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=41}} Richard later claimed that his decision to "[[backslide]]" from his ministry, led religious clergymen to protest his new recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|p=132}} Making matters worse, Richard said, was his insistence on performing in front of integrated audiences at the time of the black liberation movement shortly after the [[Watts riots]] and the formation of the [[Black Panthers]] which caused many black radio disk jockeys in certain areas of the country, including Los Angeles, to choose not to play his music.{{sfn|White|2003|p=133}} Now acting as his manager, Larry Williams convinced Richard to focus on his live shows. By 1968, he had ditched the Upsetters for his new backup band, the Crown Jewels, performing on the Canadian TV show, "Where It's At." Richard was also featured on the [[Monkees]] TV special ''[[33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee]]'' in April 1969. Williams booked Richard shows in [[Las Vegas]] casinos and resorts, leading Richard to adopt a wilder, flamboyant, and androgynous look, inspired by the success of his former backing guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Richard was soon booked at rock festivals such as the [[Atlantic City Pop Festival]] where he stole the show from headliner [[Janis Joplin]]. Richard produced a similar show stealer at the Toronto Pop Festival with [[John Lennon]] as the headliner. These successes brought Little Richard to talk shows such as the ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and the ''[[Dick Cavett Show]]'', making him a major celebrity again.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|pp=41–42}}

Responding to his reputation as a successful concert performer, [[Reprise Records]] signed Richard in 1970 and he released the album, ''[[The Rill Thing]]'', with the philosophical single, "Freedom Blues," becoming his biggest charted single in years. In May 1970, Richard made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Despite the success of "Freedom Blues," none of Richard's other Reprise singles charted with the exception of "Greenwood, Mississippi," a swamp rock original by guitar hero, [[Travis Wammack]], who incidentally played on the track. It charted only briefly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Cash Box pop chart, also on the ''Billboard'' Country charts; made a strong showing on WWRL in New York, before disappearing. Richard became a featured guest instrumentalist and vocalist on recordings by acts such as [[Delaney and Bonnie]], [[Joey Covington]] and [[Joe Walsh]] and was prominently featured on [[Canned Heat]]'s 1972 hit single, "Rockin' with the King." To keep up with his finances and bookings, Richard and three of his brothers formed a management company, Bud Hole Incorporated.
On American TV, Richard announced that he would be in a Rock Hudson motion picture, playing "The Insane Minister". (The appearance has never seen the light of day ). He also mentioned a new project involving Mick Jagger and Joe Cocker, celebrating his 20 years in show business, though it was never realized.{{sfn|White|2003|p=168}} By 1972, Richard had entered the rock and roll revival circuit, and that year, he co-headlined the [[London Rock and Roll Show]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] with his musical peer [[Chuck Berry]] where he'd come on stage and announce himself "the king of rock and roll," fittingly also the title of his 1971 album with Reprise and told the packed audience there to "let it all hang out"; Richard, however, was booed during the show when he climbed on top of his piano and stopped singing; he also seemed to ignore much of the crowd. To make matters worse, he showed up with just five musicians and struggled through low lighting and bad microphones. When the concert film documenting the show came out, his performance was considered generally strong, though his fans noticed a drop in energy and vocal artistry. Two songs he performed did not make the final cut of the film. The following year, he recorded a charting soul ballad, "In the Middle of the Night," released with proceeds donated to victims of [[tornadoes]] that had caused damage in twelve states.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|title=New York Beat|date=July 5, 1973|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|volume=44|number=15|page=62|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref>

Richard did no new recordings in 1974, although two “new” albums were released. In the summer, came a major surprise for fans, "Talkin' 'bout Soul," a collection of released and unreleased Vee Jay recordings, all never before on a domestic LP.  Two were new to the world: the title tune and "You'd Better Stop," both uptempo.

Later that year came a set recorded in one night, early the previous year, called "Right Now!,"  and featuring "roots" material, including a vocal version of an unreleased Reprise instrumental "Mississippi," released in 1972 as "Funky Dish Rag"; his third try at his gospel -rock "In the Name"; and a 6 minute plus rocker, "Hot Nuts," based upon a 1936 song by Li’l Johnson ("Get 'Em From The Peanut Man").

1975 was a big year for Richard, with a world tour, and acclaim over high energy performances throughout England and France. His band was perhaps his best, to date. He cut a top 40 single (US and Canada ), with [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]], “Take It Like a Man”. He worked on new songs with sideman, Seabrun “Candy” Hunter. He told Dee-Jay Wolfman Jack he planned on releasing a new album, with he and Sly Stone . (Never 
materialized ). In 1976, he decided to retire again, physically and mentally exhausted, having experienced family tragedy and the drug culture. He was talked into once again recutting his greatest hits, for Stan Shulman in Nashville. This time, they would not use new arrangements but original arrangements. Richard re-recorded eighteen of his classic rock and roll hits, for [[K-tel|K-Tel Records]], in high tech stereo recreations, with a single featuring the new versions of "Good Golly Miss Molly" and "Rip It Up" reaching the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name="betts">{{Cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952–2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 978-0-00-717931-2| page=457}}</ref> Richard later admitted that he was heavily addicted to drugs and alcohol.
By 1977, worn out from years of drug abuse and wild partying as well as a string of personal tragedies, Richard quit rock and roll again and returned to [[evangelism]], releasing one gospel album, ''[[God's Beautiful City]]'', in 1979.{{sfn|White|2003|p=201}}

Reconciling his roles as evangelist and rock and roll musician for the first time, Richard stated that the genre could be used for good or evil.{{sfn|White|2003|p=221}} After accepting a role in the film ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'', Richard and Billy Preston penned the faith-based rock and roll song "Great Gosh A'Mighty" for its soundtrack.{{sfn|White|2003|p=221}} Richard won critical acclaim for his film role, and the song found success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|American]] and [[Official Charts Company|British]] charts.{{sfn|White|2003|p=221}} The hit led to the release of the album ''[[Lifetime Friend]]'' (1986) on [[Warner Bros.

Richard spent much of the rest of the decade as a guest on television shows and appearing in films, winning new fans with what was referred to as his "unique comedic timing."<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0005153}}</ref> 
In 1988, he surprised fans with a serious tribute to Otis Redding at his Rock and Roll of Fame induction ceremony , singing several Redding songs , including “Fa Fa Fa (sad song)” , “These arms of mine”, and “Dock of the Bay “. He told Otis’ story and explained how his 1956 tune “All Around the World” was Redding’s reference on his 1963 side, “Hey , Hey Baby”.
In 1989, Richard provided rhythmic preaching and background vocals on the extended live version of the [[U2]]–[[B.B. King]] hit "[[When Love Comes to Town]]." That same year, Richard returned to singing his classic hits following a performance of "Lucille" at an [[AIDS]] benefit concert.{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}}

In 1990, Richard contributed a spoken-word rap on [[Living Colour]]'s hit song, "[[Elvis Is Dead]]," from their album ''[[Time's Up (Living Colour album)|Time's Up]]''.{{sfn|Mahon|2004|p=151}}{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=46}} That same year he appeared in a cameo for the music video of [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]]'s "[[Shelter Me (Cinderella song)|Shelter Me]]." In 1991, he was one of the featured performers on the hit single and video "[[Voices That Care]]" that was produced to help boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. The same year, he recorded a version of "[[The Itsy Bitsy Spider]]" for the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation|Pediatric AIDS Foundation]] benefit album ''For Our Children''. The album's success led to a deal with [[Walt Disney Records]], resulting in the release of a hit 1992 children's album, ''[[Shake It All About (album)|Shake It All About]]''.

In 1994, Richard sang the theme song to the award-winning [[PBS Kids]] and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] animated television series ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'' based on [[The Magic School Bus|the book series]] created by [[Joanna Cole (author)|Joanna Cole]] and [[Bruce Degen]] and published by [[Scholastic Corporation]].

In 2000, Richard's life was dramatized for the biographical film ''[[Little Richard (film)|Little Richard]]'', which focused on his early years, including his heyday, his religious conversion and his return to secular music in the early 1960s. Richard was played by [[Leon Robinson]], who earned an [[NAACP Image Award]] nomination for his performance. In 2002, Richard contributed to the [[Johnny Cash]] [[tribute album]], ''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash]]''. In 2004–2005, he released two sets of unreleased and rare cuts, from the Okeh label 1966/67 and the Reprise label 1970/72. Included was the full ''Southern Child'' album, produced and composed mostly by Richard, scheduled for release in 1972, but shelved. In 2006, Little Richard was featured in a popular advertisement for the [[GEICO]] brand.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-2476130.html | work=CBS News | title=The Unlikely Titan of Advertising | date=February 14, 2007}}</ref> A 2005 recording of his duet vocals with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] on a cover of the Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There" was included on Lewis's 2006 album, ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]''.

Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Richard kept up a stringent touring schedule, performing primarily in the United States and Europe. However, [[sciatic nerve]] pain in his left leg and then replacement of the involved hip began affecting the frequency of his performances by 2010. Despite his health problems, Richard continued to perform to receptive audiences and critics.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Around 1956, Richard became involved with Audrey Robinson, a sixteen-year-old college student, originally from [[Savannah, Georgia]].{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=70–74}} Richard and Robinson quickly got acquainted despite Robinson not being a fan of rock and roll music. Richard claimed in his 1984 autobiography that he invited other men to have sexual encounters with her in groups and claimed to have once invited [[Buddy Holly]] to have sex with her; Robinson denied those claims.{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=84–85}} Richard proposed marriage to Robinson but she refused. Robinson later became known under the name Lee Angel and became a stripper and socialite.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=99–101}} Richard reconnected with Robinson in the 1960s, though she left him again after his drug abuse worsened.{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} Robinson was interviewed for Richard's 1985 documentary on ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' and denied Richard's claims as they went back and forth. According to Robinson, Richard would use her to buy food in white-only fast food stores as he could not enter any due to the color of his skin.

Richard met his only wife, Ernestine Harvin, at an evangelical rally in October 1957. They began dating that year and wed on July 12, 1959, in California. According to Harvin, she and Richard initially enjoyed a happy marriage with "normal" sexual relations. When the marriage ended in divorce in 1964, Harvin claimed it was due to her husband's celebrity status, which had made life difficult for her. Richard would claim the marriage fell apart due to his being a neglectful husband and his sexuality.{{sfn|White|2003|p=105}} Both Robinson and Harvin denied Richard's claims that he was gay and Richard believed they did not know it because he was "such a pumper in those days."{{sfn|White|2003|p=105}} During the marriage, Richard and Harvin adopted a one-year-old boy, Danny Jones, from a late church associate.{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} Richard and his son remained close, with Jones often acting as one of his bodyguards.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Christopher|last=Merchant|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/rutherford/2014/08/28/little-richard-murfreesboro-accident/14738937/|title=Little Richard's Cadillac struck in Murfreesboro crash|work=The Tennessean|date=August 28, 2014|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref> Ernestine later married Mcdonald Campbell in Santa Barbara, California, on March 23, 1975.

===Sexuality===
Richard said in 1984 that he played with just girls as a child and was subjected to homosexual jokes and ridicule because of his manner of walk and talk.{{sfn|White|2003|p=9}} His father [[corporal punishment|brutally punished]] him whenever he caught him wearing his mother's makeup and clothing.<ref name=JetFeb2000>{{Cite magazine|title=Life Story of Rock 'n' Roll Legend Little Richard Told in NBC Movie|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=February 2000 |volume=97|number=11|pages=63–65 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63}}</ref> The singer said he had been sexually involved with both sexes as a teenager.{{sfn|White|2003|p=10}} Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home when he was fifteen.{{sfn|White|2003|p=21}} In 1985, on ''The South Bank Show'', Richard explained, "my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was [[gay]]."{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}}

Richard got involved in [[voyeurism]] in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. Richard's activity caught the attention of Macon police in 1955 and he was arrested after a gas station attendant reported sexual activity in a car Richard was occupying with a [[heterosexual]] couple. Cited on a [[sexual misconduct]] charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon.{{sfn|White|2003|p=41}}

In the early 1950s, Richard became acquainted with openly gay musician [[Billy Wright (musician)|Billy Wright]], who helped in establishing Richard's look, advising him to use pancake makeup on his face and wear his hair in a long-haired pompadour style similar to his.{{sfn|White|2003|p=25}} As Richard got used to the makeup, he ordered his band, the Upsetters, to wear the makeup too, to gain entry into predominantly white venues during performances, later stating, "I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too."{{sfn|Collier|1984|p=60}} In 2000, Richard told ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine, "I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to."<ref name=JetFeb2000/> Richard's look, however, still attracted female audiences, who would send him naked photos and their phone numbers.{{sfn| White| 2003|p=70–71}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=36}} Groupies began throwing undergarments at Richard during performances.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Ramsey |first1=David |title=Prayers for Richard |date=December 11, 2015 |work=Oxford American |url=https://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/719-prayers-for-richard |access-date=May 9, 2020 |location=Little Rock AR |quote=Or offer up their own: a Little Richard concert in Baltimore in 1956 is supposedly the first incident of female fans throwing their underwear onstage ("a shower of panties," a bandmate remembered).}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|White|1984|p=66}}. "Charles Connor:... After that it happened lots of places we played. The girls would actually take their panties off and throw them at the bandstand. A shower of panties!"</ref>

During Richard's heyday, his obsession with voyeurism carried on with his girlfriend Audrey Robinson. Richard later wrote that Robinson would have sex with men while she sexually stimulated Richard.{{sfn| White| 2003|p=70-71}} Despite saying he was "[[born again]]" after leaving rock and roll for the church in 1957, Richard left Oakwood College after [[indecent exposure|exposing himself]] to a male student. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Richard withdrew from the college.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=100–101}} In 1962, Richard was arrested for spying on men urinating in toilets at a [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways]] bus station in [[Long Beach, California]].{{sfn|Moser|2007|p=137}} After re-embracing rock and roll in the mid-1960s, he began participating in orgies and continued to be a voyeur.

On May 4, 1982, on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', Richard said, "God gave me the victory. I'm not gay now, but, you know, I was gay all my life. I believe I was one of the first gay people to come out. But God let me know that he made Adam be with Eve, not Steve. So, I gave my heart to Christ."<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Late Night with David Letterman |date=4 May 1982 |network=NBC |season=1}}</ref> In his 1984 book, while demeaning homosexuality as "unnatural" and "contagious," he told Charles White he was "[[omnisexual]]."{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}}

In 1995, Richard told ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' that he always knew he was gay, saying "I've been gay all my life."{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} In 2007, ''Mojo Magazine'' referred to Richard as "[[bisexual]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/tutti-frutti-tops-world-changing-hit-list-310948.html#!|title=Tutti Frutti tops world-changing hit list|date=May 16, 2007|website=Breakingnews.ie|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In October 2017, Richard once again denounced homosexuality in an interview with the Christian Three Angels Broadcasting Network, calling homosexual and [[transgender]] identity "unnatural affection" that goes against "the way God wants you to live."<ref>{{Cite magazine|first=Trudy|last=Ring|url=https://www.advocate.com/people/2017/10/06/little-richard-once-gay-now-antigay-again|title=Little Richard, Once Gay, Is Now Antigay — Again|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=[[Here Media]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=October 6, 2017|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>

===Drug use===
During his initial heyday in the 1950s rock and roll scene, Richard was a [[teetotalism|teetotaler]] abstaining from alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Richard often fined bandmates for drug and alcohol use during this era. By the mid-1960s, however, Richard began drinking heavy amounts of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and smoking [[cigarette]]s and [[marijuana]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dTr_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT183#v=onepage&q&f=false]}} By 1972, he had developed an addiction to [[cocaine]]. He later lamented that period, "They should have called me Lil Cocaine, I was sniffing so much of that stuff!"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=187–189}} By 1975, he had developed addictions to both [[heroin]] and [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], otherwise known as "angel dust." His drug and alcohol use began to affect his professional career and personal life. "I lost my reasoning," he later recalled.{{sfn|Collier|1984|p=60: "I used to have standards in my life and I lost all of that"}}

He said of his cocaine addiction that he did whatever he could to use cocaine.{{sfn|Collier|1984|p=60: "I was one of the biggest cocaine addicts, smoking it, snorting it and whatever cocaine could do, I did"}} Richard admitted that his addictions to cocaine, PCP and heroin were costing him as much as $1,000 a day.{{sfn|White|2003|p=188}} In 1977, longtime friend [[Larry Williams]] once showed up with a gun and threatened to kill him for failing to pay his drug debt. Richard later mentioned that this was the most fearful moment of his life because Williams' own drug addiction made him wildly unpredictable. Richard did, however, also acknowledge that he and Williams were "very close friends" and when reminiscing of the drug-fueled clash, he recalled thinking "I knew he loved me—I hoped he did!"{{sfn|White|2003|p=186}} Within that same year, Richard had several devastating personal experiences, including his brother Tony's death of a heart attack, the accidental shooting of his nephew whom he loved like a son, and the murder of two close personal friends – one a valet at "the heroin man's house."{{sfn|White|2003|p=188}} The combination of these experiences convinced the singer to give up drugs including alcohol, along with rock and roll, and return to the ministry.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Little Richard Forsakes Rock 'n' Roll For Religion |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=August 17, 1979|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19790817&id=ELsqAAAAIBAJ&pg=4701,765387|access-date=January 4, 2013|page=13}}</ref>

===Religion===
Richard's family had deep evangelical ([[Baptist]] and [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME)) Christian roots, including two uncles and a grandfather who were preachers.{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}} He also took part in Macon's [[Pentecostal]] churches, which were his favorites mainly due to their music, charismatic praise, dancing in the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] and [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16–17}} At age ten, influenced by Pentecostalism, he would go around saying he was a [[Faith healing|faith healer]], singing gospel music to people who were feeling sick and touching them. He later recalled that they would often indicate that they felt better after he prayed for them and would sometimes give him money.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16–17}} Richard had aspirations of being a preacher due to the influence of singing evangelist [[Brother Joe May]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}}

After he was [[born again]] in 1957, Richard enrolled at [[Oakwood University|Oakwood College]] in Huntsville, Alabama, a mostly black [[Seventh-day Adventist]] college, to study theology. It was also at this time that he became a [[vegetarian]] which coincided with his return to religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ivu.org/people/music/richard.html#:~:text=About%2050%25%20of%20SDAs%20are%20vegetarian.&text=The%20apparently%20ageless%20(and%20vegetarian,music%20%2D%20and%20himself%20%2D%20undiminished.|title = International Vegetarian Union - Little Richard (1932- )}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jun-29-he-64587-story.html|title=Little Richard|date=June 29, 1998|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2002/08/02/good-golly-legendary-little-richard-is-calling-it-quits/|title=GOOD GOLLY! – LEGENDARY LITTLE RICHARD IS CALLING IT QUITS|date=August 2, 2002|work=New York Post}}</ref> Richard returned to secular music in the early 1960s. He was eventually ordained a minister in 1970 and resumed evangelical activities in 1977. Richard represented Memorial Bibles International and sold their Black Heritage Bible, which highlighted the Book's many black characters. As a preacher, he evangelized in small churches and packed auditoriums of 20,000 or more. His preaching focused on uniting the races and bringing lost souls to repentance through God's love.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=203–214}} In 1984, Richard's mother, Leva Mae, died following a period of illness. Only a few months prior to her death, Richard promised her that he would remain a Christian.{{sfn|White|2003|p=221}}

During the 1980s and 1990s, Richard officiated at celebrity weddings. In 2006, Richard wedded twenty couples who won a contest in one ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/little-richard-weds-20-couples_1017057|title=Little Richard Weds 20 Couples|work=Contactmusic.com|date=December 19, 2006|access-date=February 1, 2013}}</ref> The musician used his experience and knowledge as a minister and elder statesman of rock and roll to preach at funerals of musical friends such as [[Wilson Pickett]] and Ike Turner.{{sfn|Havers|2010|p=127}} At a benefit concert in 2009 to raise funds to help rebuild children's playgrounds destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]], Richard asked guest of honor [[Fats Domino]] to pray with him and others.

The world is getting close to the end. Get close to the Lord."<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> In 2013, Richard elaborated on his spiritual philosophies, stating "God talked to me the other night. He said He's getting ready to come. The world's getting ready to end and He's coming, wrapped in flames of fire with a rainbow around his throne." ''Rolling Stone'' reported his apocalyptic prophesies generated snickers from some audience members as well as cheers of support. Penniman responded to the laughter by stating: "When I talk to you about [Jesus], I'm not playing. I'm almost 81 years old. Without God, I wouldn't be here."<ref name=healthscare/>

===Health problems and death===
In October 1985, Penniman returned to the United States from England, where he had finished recording his album ''[[Lifetime Friend]]'', to film a guest spot on the show, ''[[Miami Vice]]''. Following the taping, he accidentally crashed his sports car into a telephone pole in [[West Hollywood, California]]. He suffered a broken right leg, broken ribs and head and facial injuries.{{sfn|White|2003|p=219}} His recovery from the accident took several months.{{sfn|White|2003|p=219}} His accident prevented him from being able to attend the inaugural [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] ceremony in January 1986 where he was one of several inductees.

On April 28, 2016, Richard's friend, [[Bootsy Collins]], stated on his [[Facebook]] page that, "he is not in the best of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up." Reports subsequently began being published on the internet stating that Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, ''Rolling Stone'' reported that Richard and his lawyer provided a health information update in which Richard stated, "not only is my family not gathering around me because I'm ill, but I'm still singing. I don't perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I'm healthy.'"  His lawyer also reported: "He's 83. I don't know how many 83-year-olds still get up and rock it out every week, but in light of the rumors, I wanted to tell you that he's vivacious and conversant about a ton of different things and he's still very active in a daily routine."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/little-richard-denies-near-death-rumors-im-still-singing-20160503 |title=Little Richard Denies Near-Death Rumors: 'I'm Still Singing' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 3, 2016 |access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref> Even though Richard continued to sing in his eighties, he kept away from the stage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/little-richard-denies-claims-of-poor-health-illness-untrue |title=Little Richard denies claims that he's 'clinging to life'  |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 4, 2016 |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>

| quote = He claims to be "the architect of rock and roll", and history would seem to bear out Little Richard's boast. More than any other performer—save, perhaps, [[Elvis Presley]], Little Richard blew the lid off the Fifties, laying the foundation for rock and roll with his explosive music and charismatic persona. On record, he made spine-tingling rock and roll. His frantically charged piano playing and raspy, shouted vocals on such classics as "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]", "[[Long Tall Sally]]" and "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]" defined the dynamic sound of rock and roll.

Combining elements of boogie, [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[blues]], Richard introduced several of [[rock music]]'s most characteristic musical features, including its loud volume and vocal style emphasizing power, and its distinctive [[Beat (music)|beat]] and innovative visceral [[rhythm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/little-richard|title = Little Richard &#124; Rock & Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> He departed from [[boogie-woogie]]'s [[shuffle rhythm]] and introduced a new distinctive rock beat, where the beat division is even at all [[tempo]]s. He reinforced the new rock rhythm with a two-handed approach, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically popping out in the piano's high [[Register (music)|register]]. His new rhythm, which he introduced with "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]" (1955), became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Campbell|Brody|2007|p=115}} "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]" (1957) foreshadowed the rhythmic feel of 1960s [[classic rock]] in several ways, including its heavy [[bassline]], slower tempo, strong rock beat played by the entire band, and [[verse–chorus form]] similar to blues.{{sfn|Campbell|Brody|2007|p=117}}

Richard's voice was able to generate croons, wails, and screams unprecedented in popular music.<ref name="Britannica" /> He was cited by two of soul music's pioneers, [[Otis Redding]] and [[Sam Cooke]], as contributing to the genre's early development. Redding stated that most of his music was patterned after Richard's, referring to his 1953 recording "Directly From My Heart To You" as the personification of soul, and that he had "done a lot for [him] and [his] soul brothers in the music business."{{sfn|White|2003|p=231}} Cooke said in 1962 that Richard had done "so much for our music."{{sfn|White|2003|p=228}} Cooke had a top 40 hit in 1963 with his cover of Richard's 1956 hit "Send Me Some Loving."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277951/sam-cooke/chart |title=Sam Cooke – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

[[James Brown]] and others credited Richard and his mid-1950s backing band, The Upsetters, with having been the first to put the funk in the rock beat. This innovation sparked the transition from 1950s rock and roll to 1960s funk.<ref name="HallofFame1986" />{{sfn|Palmer|2011|p=139}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/top-10-greatest-little-richard-songs/ |title=Top 10 Greatest Little Richard Songs Of All Time - Vote Now! uDiscover |website=Udiscovermusic.com |date=October 24, 2017 |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Erlewine|Harris|2020|loc=[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/little-richard-20-essential-songs-15792/freedom-blues-1970-207794/ "Freedom Blues" (1970)]|ps=. "His influence is incalculable. The Beatles learned their ecstatic falsetto shouts from him; James Brown said he was "the first to put the funk in rhythm." In his yearbook, Bob Dylan listed that his ambition was "to join Little Richard," and nine-year-old David Bowie bought a saxophone hoping to do that as well."}}

Richard's hits of the mid-1950s, such as "Tutti Frutti," "Long Tall Sally," "Keep A-Knockin'" and "Good Golly, Miss Molly," were generally characterized by playful lyrics with sexually suggestive connotations.<ref name="Britannica" /> [[AllMusic]] writer Richie Unterberger stated that Little Richard "merged the fire of gospel with New Orleans R&B, pounding the piano and wailing with gleeful abandon," and that while "other R&B greats of the early 1950s had been moving in a similar direction, none of them matched the sheer electricity of Richard's vocals. With his high-speed deliveries, ecstatic trills, and the overjoyed force of personality in his singing, he was crucial in upping the voltage from high-powered R&B into the similar, yet different, guise of rock and roll."<ref name=Allmusic2013b/> Due to his innovative music and style, he's often widely acknowledged as the "architect of rock and roll."<ref name="HallofFame1986" />

Emphasizing the folk influences of Richard, English professor W. T. Lhamon Jr. wrote, "His songs were literally good booty. They were the repressed stuff of underground lore. And in Little Richard they found a vehicle prepared to bear their chocked energy, at least for his capsulated moment."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lhamon|first=W.T.|date=1985|title=Little Richard as a Folk Performer|journal=Studies in Popular Culture|volume=8|issue=2|pages=7–17|issn=0888-5753|jstor=23412946}}</ref>

===Society===
In addition to his musical style, Richard was cited as one of the first [[crossover (music)|crossover]] black artists, reaching audiences of all races. His music and concerts broke the color line,<ref name="nmaam1">{{Cite web|url=http://nmaam.org/events/celebration-of-legends/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518151622/http://nmaam.org/events/celebration-of-legends/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 18, 2015|title=My Music Matters: A Celebration of Legends Luncheon|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|date=June 19, 2015|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> drawing blacks and whites together despite attempts to sustain [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. As H.B. Barnum explained in ''Quasar of Rock'', Little Richard "opened the door. He brought the races together."{{sfn|White|2003|p=69}} Barnum described Richard's music as not being "boy-meets-girl-girl-meets-boy things, they were ''fun'' records, all fun. And they had a lot to say sociologically in our country and the world."{{sfn|White|2003|p=70}} Barnum also stated that Richard's "charisma was a whole new thing to the music business," explaining that "he would burst onto the stage from anywhere, and you wouldn't be able to hear anything but the roar of the audience. He might come out and walk on the piano. He might go out into the audience."  Barnum also stated that Richard was innovative in that he would wear colorful capes, blouse shirts, makeup and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins, and that he also brought flickering stage lighting from his show business experience into performance venues where rock and roll artists performed.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=68–70}}  In 2015, the National Museum of African American Music honored Richard for helping to shatter the color line on the music charts changing American culture forever.<ref name="tennessean1"/><ref name="nmaam1"/>
