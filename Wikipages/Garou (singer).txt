'''Pierre Garand''' (born 26 June 1972), known by his stage name '''Garou''' (a diminutive of his last name "Garand"), is a Canadian singer and entertainer from [[Sherbrooke]], [[Québec]].

He is known for his work in the musical [[Notre Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]] (playing [[Quasimodo]] in both the original French and English casts) and the No. 1 hits "[[Belle (Patrick Fiori, Daniel Lavoie and Garou song)|Belle]]", "[[Seul (song)|Seul]]", "[[Sous le vent]]", and "[[La Rivière de notre enfance]]".

==Profile==
Garou was born in Canada into a family of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent. Garou began playing the guitar at the age of three at the encouragement of his father (he also plays piano and trumpet). He went on to serve in the military and started a band in 1992 called the Untouchables. In 1997, he was discovered by [[Luc Plamondon]] while singing American [[blues]] tunes in a Sherbrooke bar. He was drafted by Plamondon to play the role of Quasimodo in his musical [[Notre Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]], which made him a star in France and propelled his career into action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artists.letssingit.com/garou-2gt4t/biography |title=Garou Biography |publisher=Artist |access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> He would play the role of Quasimodo for 3 years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Garou - Soul City|url=https://garouofficiel.com/|access-date=2021-04-14|website=Garou {{!}} Soul City|language=fr-FR}}</ref> 

His first album ''[[Seul (album)|Seul]]'' became the best-selling French album of 2001 and remains one of the best-selling French albums of all time, achieving 2 million sales in Europe and going three times platinum in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat2002.html |title=IFPI Platinum Europe Awards-2002 |publisher=IFPI |access-date=9 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016055449/http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat2002.html |archive-date=16 October 2013  }}</ref>

He continued his string of hits with a ''[[Seul... avec vous|live album]]'' and his sophomore effort ''[[Reviens]]'' in 2003. Sales for his third album ''[[Garou (album)|Garou]]'' remained strong and he released his English crossover ''[[Piece of My Soul]]'' in 2008. The album debuted at No. 2 in Canada and No. 3 in France. Despite this, the album became his first album in France not to reach platinum status although it became his best-selling album in North America in seven years. His next album, ''[[Gentleman cambrioleur]]'' features cover songs in French and English and became his first album to miss the top five in France, where it modestly peaked at No. 35, staying on the charts for 17 weeks. He released ''Version Intégrale'' in 2010 which became another Top 40 hit in France and Canada.

Garou performed the [[Jean-Pierre Ferland]] song "Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin" (A Little Higher, A Little Farther) at the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].<ref name="Canada unveils">{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/canada-unveils-its-landscape-of-dreams_274410qj.html |title=Canada unveils its 'landscape of dreams' to welcome athletes and world at the Opening Ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games |date=12 February 2010 |publisher=VANOC |access-date=14 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213085610/http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/canada-unveils-its-landscape-of-dreams_274410qj.html |archive-date=13 February 2010 }}</ref> He has also performed at the charity event [[Les Enfoirés]] for the past 19 years.
