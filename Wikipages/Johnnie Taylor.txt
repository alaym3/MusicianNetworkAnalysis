'''Johnnie Harrison Taylor''' (May 5, 1934 &ndash; May 31, 2000)<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick|last= Montier |url=http://staxrecords.free.fr/jtaylor.htm |title=Johnnie Taylor|publisher=Staxrecords.free.fr |access-date=2014-04-07}}</ref> was an American recording artist and songwriter who performed a wide variety of genres, from [[blues]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]] to [[pop music|pop]], [[doo-wop]], and [[disco]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[File:Johnnie Taylor (1967).png|thumb|right|Taylor in 1967]]
Johnnie Taylor was born in [[Crawfordsville, Arkansas]], United States.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1164/5}}</ref> He grew up in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], performing in gospel groups as a youngster. As an adult, he had one release, "Somewhere to Lay My Head", on [[Chicago]]'s [[Vee Jay Records]] [[record label|label]] in the 1950s, as part of the gospel group [[The Highway Q.C.'s]], which included a young [[Sam Cooke]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Taylor's singing then was strikingly close to that of Cooke, and he was hired to take Cooke's place in the latter's gospel group, the [[Soul Stirrers]], in 1957.<ref name="Larkin"/>

A few years later, after Cooke had established his independent [[SAR Records]], Taylor signed on as one of the label's first acts and recorded "Rome Wasn't Built In A Day" in 1962.<ref name="Larkin"/> However, SAR Records quickly became defunct after Cooke's death in 1964.

In 1966, Taylor moved to [[Stax Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he was dubbed "The Philosopher of Soul". He recorded with the label's [[house band]], which included [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. His hits included "I Had a Dream", "I've Got to Love Somebody's Baby" (both [[songwriter|written]] by the team of [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]) and most notably "[[Who's Making Love]]",<ref name="Larkin"/> which reached No. 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and No. 1 on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] chart in 1968. "Who's Making Love" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].  In 1970, Taylor married Gerlean Rocket and they remained married until his death in 2000.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref>

During his tenure at Stax, he became an R&B star, with over a dozen chart successes, such as "[[Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone]]", which reached No. 23 on the Hot 100 chart, "Cheaper to Keep Her" ([[Mack Rice]]) and [[record producer]] [[Don Davis (record producer)|Don Davis]]'s penned "I Believe in You (You Believe in Me)", which reached No. 11 on the Hot 100 chart. "I Believe in You (You Believe in Me)" also sold in excess of one million copies, and was awarded gold disc status by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in October 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>  Taylor, along with Isaac Hayes and [[The Staple Singers]], was one of the label's flagship artists, who were credited for keeping the company afloat in the late 1960s and early 1970s after the death of its biggest star, [[Otis Redding]], in an aviation accident. He appeared in the documentary film, ''[[Wattstax]]'', which was released in 1973.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

===Columbia Records===

After Stax folded in 1975, Taylor switched to [[Columbia Records]], where he recorded his biggest success with Don Davis still in charge of production, "[[Disco Lady]]", in 1976.<ref name="Larkin"/> It spent four weeks at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and six weeks at the top of the R&B chart. It peaked at No. 25 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1976.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

| page= 550}}</ref> "Disco Lady" was the first certified [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] single (two million copies sold) by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Taylor recorded several more successful albums and R&B single hits with Davis on Columbia, before Brad Shapiro took over production duties, but sales generally fell away.

===Malaco Records===
After a short stay at a small independent label in Los Angeles, Beverly Glen Records, Taylor signed with [[Malaco Records]]<ref name="Larkin"/> after the company's founder Tommy Couch and producing partner Wolf Stephenson heard him sing at blues singer [[Z. Z. Hill]]'s funeral in spring 1984.

Backed by members of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], as well as in-house veterans such as former [[Stax Records|Stax]] keyboardist [[Carson Whitsett]] and guitarist/bandleader Bernard Jenkins, Malaco gave Taylor the type of recording freedom that Stax had given him in the late 1960s and early 1970s, enabling him to record ten albums for the label in his 16-year stint.

In 1996, Taylor's eighth album for Malaco, ''Good Love!'', reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Blues Albums]] chart (No. 15 R&B), and was the biggest record in Malaco's history. With this success, Malaco recorded a live video of Taylor at the [[Longhorn Ballroom]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], in the summer of 1997. The club portion of the ''Good Love'' video was recorded at 1001 Nightclub in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].

Taylor's final song was "Soul Heaven", in which he dreamed of being at a concert featuring deceased African-American music icons from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Otis Redding]] to Z.Z. Hill to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], among others.

==Radio==
In the 1980s, Johnnie Taylor was a DJ on [[KKDA (AM)|KKDA]], a radio station in the Dallas area, where he had made his home. The station's format was mostly R&B and Soul oldies and their on-the-air personalities were often local R&B, Soul, blues, and jazz musicians. Taylor was billed as "The Wailer, Johnnie Taylor".

==Death==
Taylor died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at Charlton Methodist Hospital in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on May 31, 2000, aged 66.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=637 |title=Johnnie Harrison Taylor (1934-2000) |publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas |access-date=2014-04-07}}</ref> Stax billed Johnnie Taylor as "The Philosopher of Soul". He was also known as "the Blues Wailer". He was buried beside his mother, Ida Mae Taylor, at Forrest Hill Cemetery in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/taylor-johnnie-harrison-1934-2000/|title=Johnnie Harrison Taylor (1934-2000) •|first=Erika|last=Weber|website=Blackpast.org|date=6 August 2018|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref><ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas">{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/johnnie-harrison-taylor-637/|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=Encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref>
