'''Onslaught''' are a British [[thrash metal]] band from [[Bristol]], England, active from 1982 to 1991 and again since 2005. The band initially drew influences from US and British [[hardcore punk]] bands such as [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[The Exploited]], as well as the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], and eventually adopted a straightforward thrash metal sound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Onslaught Family Tree — The Metal|url=https://www.givememetal.com/thrashmetaltrees/onslaught-family-tree|website=givememetal.com|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> They have been recognised as pioneers of the British thrash metal scene, and are often referred to as one of the country's so-called "big four", along with [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]], [[Xentrix]] and [[Acid Reign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-uk-s-best-thrash-bands-according-to-acid-reign-s-h|title=The 10 UK's best thrash bands according to Acid Reign's H|publisher=[[Metal Hammer|loudersound.com]]|date=28 May 2015|access-date=11 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allabouttherock.co.uk/thrash-under-pressure-onslaught/|title=Thrash Under Pressure: Onslaught|website=Allabouttherock.co.uk|date=17 July 2016|access-date=11 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=626|title=The Metal Crypt - Xentrix Interview|website=Metalcrypt.com|date=2 June 2019|access-date=11 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coreandco.fr/chroniques/acid-reign-the-age-of-entitlement-7464.html|title=Acid Reign - The Age of Entitlement - chronique|website=Coreandco.fr|date=25 November 2019|access-date=11 August 2020}}</ref> To date, Onslaught have released seven studio albums, one compilation, four singles and two live recordings: a live album and a live DVD.

==History==
===Origins and ''Power from Hell'' (1982–1985)===
Onslaught were formed in 1982 in Bristol, England, by guitarist Nige Rockett and drummer Steve Grice.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=332}}</ref> The two musicians were working to forge an ultra-aggressive, speed metal sound that was becoming more popular in the days of early [[Slayer]] and [[Metallica]]. In 1985, the duo were joined by bass player Jase Stallard and vocalist Paul Mahoney.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The quartet quickly worked up enough material for a record and later that year, the debut album, ''Power from Hell'', was recorded and released on the British [[independent record label]], Cor.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

The band started to write more [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]–oriented songs, rather than their original [[punk rock|punk]] sound. This was mainly influenced by the early releases of [[thrash metal]] bands, albeit with a darker sound.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band signed to Children of the Revolution Records, and released their album, ''[[Power from Hell (Onslaught album)|Power from Hell]]'', in 1985<ref>Huey, Steve: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/power-from-hell-mw0000669244 ''Power from Hell – Onslaught''], AllMusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> as a result. As with other metal bands of the time, the lyrics were often [[Satanism|Satanic]], and the cover showed a [[demon]] emerging from a [[pentagram]].

===''The Force'', ''In Search of Sanity'' and breakup (1985–1991)===
Jase Stallard (who had joined Onslaught in 1984) retained his place in the band, but took over bass duties from a hired bassist, who in turn assumed the role of rhythm guitarist, giving the band a second guitarist.<ref name=Onslaught>Anderson, Jason: [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=onslaught-mn0000888979|pure_url=yes}} ''Onslaught''], [[AllMusic]], accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> During the first months of 1986, the new line-up was ready to record their second album, ''[[The Force (Onslaught album)|The Force]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> in a recording studio in London. The album was released early that year through the label [[Under One Flag]],<ref name=Onslaught/> and Onslaught toured for about two-and-a-half years in support of it, playing with bands such as [[Motörhead]], [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Girlschool]], [[Kreator]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Agent Steel]], the [[Crumbsuckers]], [[Angel Dust (German band)|Angel Dust]], [[Exumer]], [[Messiah (Swiss band)|Messiah]], [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]] and a then-still unknown [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]].<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=Onslaught Tour Dates|url=http://metallipromo.com/onslaught.html|website=Metallipromo.com|date=21 November 2018}}</ref> The album was much more successful than ''Power from Hell'', and is considered a classic by many critics and fanzines.{{Which|date=July 2021}} Chris Dahlkvist left the band later in 1986 and was replaced by James Hinder.<ref name=Onslaught/>

In 1987, Jase Stallard's guitar playing came into question, so Rockett dismissed him and replaced him with Rob Trotman.<ref name=Onslaught/> Using this line-up, they set out to write material for a third studio album. Having drawn the attention of [[London Records]], the label signed the band.<ref name=Onslaught/> In mid-1988, the band began to start recording their third album, ''[[In Search of Sanity]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Upon hearing the album, the record label felt that a more versatile vocalist was needed, to do the music more justice. Although the band felt that Sy Keeler's vocals on the demo recording had the right sound, the production had a more polished sound – hence the need for a more polished vocalist. [[Steve Grimmett]], formerly of [[New wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]] act [[Grim Reaper (band)|Grim Reaper]], was drafted in to replace the departing Sy Keeler.<ref>Rivadavia, Eduardo: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-search-of-sanity-mw0000653778 ''In Search of Sanity – Onslaught''], AllMusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> Owing to this development, the release of the album was delayed until mid 1989. Following the success of ''The Force'', and with an accomplished new singer, there was much pre-release publicity. ''In Search of Sanity'' had a much different sound than Onslaught's previous releases; while it is technically a thrash metal album, it saw them shift towards a [[progressive metal|progressive]]/[[power metal]] sound,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.withguitars.com/onslaught-search-sanity-2cd-via-dissonance/|title=Onslaught – In Search Of Sanity (2CD via Dissonance)|website=Withguitars.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nolifetilmetal.com/onslaught.html|title=No Life 'til Metal - CD Gallery - Onslaught|website=Nolifetilmetal.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref> and included the band's longest track to date "Welcome to Dying". Many hardcore thrash metal fans were disappointed with these changes, and this partially contributed to the band's demise.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Despite the mixed critical reaction,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> ''In Search of Sanity'' is Onslaught's only album to enter the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaking at No. 46,<ref name="Official">{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/25409/onslaught/|title=ONSLAUGHT &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company}}</ref> while the cover version of [[AC/DC]]'s "[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]" was the band's only single to appear in the [[UK Singles chart]], peaking at No. 50.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In early 1990, Steve Grimmett decided to leave the band due to personal reasons, and was replaced by Tony O'Hora.<ref name=Onslaught/> The band then set out to write and then record a fourth album. London Records decided not to renew their contract with Onslaught, leaving the band without a record deal.<ref name=Onslaught/> [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] offered them £50,000 but Rockett declined to sign for an indie label, and they decided to disband in early 1991.<ref name=Onslaught/> Tony O'Hora later sung for [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]] and later became the lead singer of the [[The Sweet|Sweet]].

===Reunion and more albums (2005–2018)===
In 2005, the band was reformed<ref>Henderson, Alex: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/killing-peace-mw0000556987 ''Killing Peace – Onslaught''], AllMusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> by Steve Grice and was joined by Sy Keeler, Nige Rockett, and James Hinder. They were joined by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] guitarist, Alan Jordan. Writing for the band's fourth album, ''[[Killing Peace]]'', began in 2005, and the album was released in early 2007. Bassist James Hinder left the band in 2006, before the release of ''Killing Peace'', and was replaced by Jeff Williams. This line-up recorded a live DVD in Club Stodola, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], which was released in 2007 by Metal Mind Productions under the title ''Live Polish Assault''.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

In 2008, Jordan left the band and was replaced by guitarist Andy Rosser-Davies. In November of that year, the band recorded their live performance at the Damnation Festival in Leeds resulting in a live album (Dual Disc CD / DVD), ''Live Damnation''; mixed by Andy Sneap, it was released in August 2009 by [[Candlelight Records]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-damnation-mw0001496503/releases ''Live Damnation – Onslaught : Releases''], Allmusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> In June 2010, the band signed to the German metal label [[AFM Records]] to record their fifth studio album, ''[[Sounds of Violence]]'', released in January 2011.<ref>Rivadavia, Eduardo: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/sounds-of-violence-mw0002096738 ''Sounds of Violence – Onslaught''], AllMusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.</ref> On 25 March 2011, Steve Grice decided to leave the band on the eve of a major European tour. Michael Hourihan ([[Extreme Noise Terror]] / [[Desecration (band)|Desecration]]) replaced him for the tour and in November 2011 became a full member of the band. Onslaught recorded their sixth studio album, ''[[VI (Onslaught album)|VI]]'', from April to May and released it on 20 September 2013.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

Former [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] singer [[Neil Turbin]] joined the band for their Thrash Invasion tour of US and Canada, Brazil and Chile, North and South America in 2014 as Sy Keeler was unable to take part due to family problems.<ref>[http://www.teamrock.com/news/2014-11-27/onslaught-in-angry-split-with-neil-turbin-on-tour ''Team Rock''], Team Rock, accessed on 26/11/2014</ref> He left the tour for the last week of shows after performing at The Music Hall, [[Anaheim, California]], on 24 November 2014, only two days before the tour ended.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

The band played the 10th edition of [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in June 2015.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

On 14 September 2015, Onslaught announced that they had recruited Iain GT Davies as a full-time replacement for Andy Rosser Davies. However, the band stated that Andy Rosser Davies was going to contribute to the songwriting of their next album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Onslaught Recruits Guitarist Iain GT Davies |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-recruits-guitarist-iain-gt-davies/ |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2015-09-14 |access-date=2015-09-14}}</ref>

On 27 March 2018, guitarist Iain GT Davies and drummer Mic Hourihan parted ways with Onslaught, to focus on other bands and projects. Rockett said that their replacements had already been chosen, but had not yet been revealed. He then said that the band would perform a new song from their then-upcoming seventh album at [[Bloodstock Open Air]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-parts-ways-with-guitarist-drummer/|title=ONSLAUGHT Parts Ways With Guitarist, Drummer|date=27 March 2018|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> On 16 July 2018, it was announced that guitarist Wayne Dorman and Drummer James Perry had joined the band.

===''Generation Antichrist'', split with Sy Keeler and next album (2018–present)===
On 18 November 2018, Onslaught posted a teaser video on Facebook, confirming that they were recording their seventh studio album at Grindstone Studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-begins-recording-new-album/|title=ONSLAUGHT Begins Recording New Album|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=21 November 2018|access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref> The band released the video for their first song in six years "A Perfect Day to Die" in March 2019, which is "a nod to [their] sadly departed friends from [[Motörhead]] who were a major influence for Onslaught over the years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-premiere-onslaughts-a-perfect-day-to-die/|title=Video Premiere: ONSLAUGHT's 'A Perfect Day To Die'|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=8 March 2019|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>

On 29 April 2020, Onslaught announced that vocalist Sy Keeler had once again parted ways with the band, citing his reason as, "Due to the nature of the modern-day music industry, some things simply aren't sustainable year after year and Sy has now taken a different full-time career path."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vocalist-sy-keeler-exits-onslaught/|title=Vocalist SY KEELER Exits ONSLAUGHT|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=29 April 2020|access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref> A few days later, it was announced that Keeler was replaced by Dave Garnett, who had previously performed in Onslaught by filling in for him the House of Metal festival in [[Umeå|Umeå, Sweden]] that past February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-announces-new-vocalist/|title=ONSLAUGHT Announces New Vocalist|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=4 May 2020|access-date=4 May 2020}}</ref>

On 12 May 2020, Onslaught announced that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Generation Antichrist]]'', would be released on 7 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-to-release-generation-antichrist-album-in-august/|title=ONSLAUGHT To Release 'Generation Antichrist' Album In August|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=12 May 2020|date=12 May 2020}}</ref>

In March 2021, about seven months after the release of ''Generation Antichrist'', Rockett announced that Onslaught have been working on their eighth studio album, which is currently in pre-production and planned for release in 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=41449|title=Onslaught - To Release Next Studio Album In 2022|website=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=March 24, 2021|date=March 24, 2021}}</ref>
