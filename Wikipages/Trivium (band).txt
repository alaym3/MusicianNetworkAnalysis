==History==
===Formation and ''Ember to Inferno'' (1999–2004)===
The band formed in 1999. At his eighth-grade talent show, [[Matt Heafy]] performed a cover version of "[[No Leaf Clover]]" by [[Metallica]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Hellraisers: A Complete Visual History of Heavy Metal Mayhem |chapter=Foreword |author=Matt Heafy |publisher=Race Point |editor=Axl Rosenberg, Christopher Krovatin |date=October 24, 2017 |isbn=9781631064302 |page=7}}</ref> Singer Brad Lewter noticed Heafy and later asked him to try out for his band as lead guitarist. The pair went over to drummer [[Travis Smith (musician)|Travis Smith]]'s house where they played a rendition of Metallica's "[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]". Impressed with Heafy's performance, they accepted him into the band known as "Trivium", which is a Latin three-way intersection they used to explain their music as combining [[metalcore]], [[melodic death metal]] and [[thrash metal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/370 |title=Trivium |website=Lords of Metal|first=Marcel|last=Zuurmond |access-date=March 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221041/http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/370|archive-date=October 21, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lewter played a number of local gigs with the band before departing about a year later. In mid-2001 Trivium parted ways with its bassist. Trivium asked Richie Brown from local black metal band [[Mindscar]] to fill in on bass duties until a full-time member could be brought in. A string of successful shows followed and then a search was conducted for a permanent bassist.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2005, Trivium played the first Saturday set on the main stage at [[Download Festival]] in [[Castle Donington]], England, credited by Matt Heafy as the gig that really launched Trivium on the world stage. Singles and music videos were released for "[[Like Light to the Flies]]", "[[Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr]]", "[[A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation]]", and "[[Dying in Your Arms]]". The videos for these songs gained rotation on [[Scuzz|Scuzz TV]] and [[MTV2]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]] and "Pull Harder on The Strings of Your Martyr" has become one of the band's most well known songs and is the song that they usually close their sets with.<ref name="Roadrunner Records">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Trivium/ |title=Roadrunner Records artists&nbsp;– Trivium |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref> In support of the album, Trivium played on numerous tours with well-known artists.

Travis Smith unofficially left the band on the second leg of the "Into the Mouth of Hell We Tour" tour.

===''In Waves'' (2010–2012)===
In an interview with ''Guitar World'', it was stated that for their fifth studio album, Trivium will move forward by looking back. The group will forgo the complex epic compositions, tricked-out leads and seven-string guitars that characterized its past two albums. Trivium will take an approach similar to that of its second album ''Ascendancy'' (2005) by using uncluttered riffs, Drop C# tuning, and more straightforward solos. "When we did ''Ascendancy'', we were writing specifically for the songs, not to show how well we could play," says frontman and guitarist Matt Heafy. "That wasn't exactly the case with our next two records."<ref name="guitarworld.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/trivium039s_pursuit |title=Trivium: In the Studio – Guitar World |website=Guitarworld.com |date=January 18, 2011 |access-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210355/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/trivium039s_pursuit |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In the bonus content for the November 2011 issue of Guitar World, Matt Heafy talked about why the band decided to record this album in Drop D♭ as opposed to Drop D. "For the whole record of 'In Waves' we're in Drop D♭, so it's kind of like (Ascendency), just a half step lower, and everything that we do from all of the albums is half a step flat. It's mainly for the vocals. (It's) not that I can't sing higher, it's just easier with the amount of shows we do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/trivium-waves-video-lessons?page=0,1|title=Trivium: 'In Waves' Video Lessons|website=GuitarWorld.com|date=September 21, 2011|access-date=January 11, 2012}}</ref>

Trivium's music mixes "soaring" and "crushing" [[riffs]], dual guitar harmonies, [[double bass drum]] patterns and occasional [[blast beat]]s and breakdowns that one can expect from the [[metalcore]] genre. Vocally Trivium combines both [[singing]] along with heavy [[screaming (music)|screaming]] and [[death growl|growls]]. Trivium is one of the notable [[New wave of American heavy metal]] acts.<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{cite news |title='New Wave Of American Heavy Metal' Book Documents Over 600 Bands |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44955 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=April 27, 2008}}</ref>

Their style has evolved over the years: from their earliest work on ''[[Ember to Inferno]]'' right through to ''[[In Waves]]'', there is a clear thrash influence from [[Metallica]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], as well as a melodic death metal influence from early [[In Flames]].<ref name="MetalHammer">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/albums-of-the-decade-trivium-ascendancy/|title=Ascendancy Named as album of the decade|date=July 15, 2009|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|access-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412235749/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/albums-of-the-decade-trivium-ascendancy/|archive-date=April 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Upon the release of their second album ''[[Ascendancy (album)|Ascendancy]]'',<ref name="Ascendancy Received Gold Status">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/release/The+Crusade|title=Ascendancy Received Gold Status|date=July 15, 2005|website=RoadrunnerRecords.co.uk|access-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701034150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/release/The+Crusade|archive-date=July 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Trivium were identified as [[melodic metalcore]] with strong elements of thrash metal, with the third track on the album "[[Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr]]" becoming a permanent fixture in the band's set lists and the rest of the album selling itself to gold status.<ref name="Ascendancy Received Gold Status" /> ''Ascendancy'' was even featured as one of [[Metal Hammer|Metal Hammer's]] Albums of the Decade.<ref name="MetalHammer" /> Later releases have marked changes in the band. ''[[The Crusade (album)|The Crusade]]'' was seen as a major shift in musical direction due to the change in vocal style, namely the absence of screaming, and some of the melodies featured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/release/The+Crusade|title=Crusade Changes Direction|date=July 15, 2005|website=RoadrunnerRecords.co.uk|access-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701034150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/release/The+Crusade|archive-date=July 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''The Crusade'' is a much more thrash-oriented album and lyrical content was also different in direction, citing current affairs, such as famous killings. In Autumn 2008, Trivium released ''Shogun'', which has a heavy Japanese influence on its title track as well as the first single release "Kirisute Gomen", which translates to "[[Kiri sute gomen|authorization to cut and leave]]". Acknowledging Matt Heafy's Japanese heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2008/08/album-trivium-shogun/|title=Thrashhits Review on Shogun|date=July 15, 2009|publisher=Thrash Hits|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> the album also was described more favorably as more their own style, as previous references to Trivium sounding like Metallica had been made on the back of ''The Crusade''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/trivium/the-crusade.htm|title=The Crusade Review (Hetfield Reference)|date=July 15, 2009|magazine=Stylus Magazine|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> ''The Crusade'' made sparing use of [[seven-string guitar]]s, which were featured heavily on ''Shogun''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Trivium - The Crusade (album review 9) {{!}} Sputnikmusic|url = https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9696/Trivium-The-Crusade/|website = www.sputnikmusic.com|access-date = 2015-09-26}}</ref> Seven-string guitars once again returned on ''[[Silence in the Snow]]'', ''[[The Sin and the Sentence]]'' and ''[[What the Dead Men Say (album)|What the Dead Men Say]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trivium.org/spotifystories|title=The Story And Sound Behind Silence In The Snow|website=Trivium.org|access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref>

On ''In Waves'', the band featured a sound closer to ''Ascendancy'' than ''The Crusade'' and ''Shogun''. The guitar tuning instead of being in drop D, they went half a step lower to drop C#. The album has several songs, such as 'Built to Fall' or 'Dusk Dismantled', featuring solely clean vocals or screamed vocals from Matt Heafy.

===Influences===
Trivium, and notably Matt Heafy, has stated that in general they are influenced by musical groups such as [[Opeth]], [[Nevermore]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[In Flames]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Guns N' Roses]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinitloud.com/?p=112 |title=Trivium |website=Spinitloud.com |access-date=2014-03-04}}</ref> [[Metallica]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Megadeth]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Slayer]], [[Pantera]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=520 |title=Trivium - "The Crusade" CD Review - in Metal Reviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=2014-03-04}}</ref> [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Martyr (band)|Martyr]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/triviums-matt-heafy-my-top-ten-essential-metal-albums/ |title=Blog Archive » Trivium's Matt Heafy: My Top Ten Essential Metal Albums |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinside.de/interview/trivium|title=Trivium - metalinside|website=Metalinside.de|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Roadrunner Records]], Heafy stated he was influenced by a whole range of music genres. Through each stage in his life, he's listened to all different types of music. As a child, he listened to [[pop punk]] and [[ska punk]] bands like [[Blink-182]], and [[Reel Big Fish]]. Heafy also lists bands like Pantera, Slayer, [[Cryptopsy]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[Dark Tranquillity]], [[Mercenary (band)|Mercenary]], [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]], [[Armored Saint]], [[Darkthrone]], [[3 Inches of Blood]], [[Krisiun]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Dark Funeral]], [[Anorexia Nervosa (band)|Anorexia Nervosa]], [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[Hatebreed]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[AC/DC (band)|AC/DC]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Further Seems Forever]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Beatles]], and more.<ref>{{cite web|last=Records |first=Roadrunner |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/gear-nerd-trivium-s-matt-heafy-part-1 |title=Gear Nerd:Trivium's Matt Heafy Part 1 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=2011-07-12 |access-date=2014-03-04}}</ref>

Matt Heafy asserted that "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2008/07/the_making_of_maiden_heaven.html |title=The making of Maiden Heaven |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |date=2008-07-16 |access-date=2015-09-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501010936/http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2008/07/the_making_of_maiden_heaven.html |archive-date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>

===Lyrical themes===
The band's lead singer, [[Matt Heafy]], has also been the primary lyricist since his early days as a member. He is known for his poetic style of lyrics and the usage of archaic words. Growing up, Heafy experienced [[anxiety]], teenage [[angst]], and occasional thoughts of [[suicide]]; several songs from the album ''Ascendancy'', such as "Rain", "Suffocating Sight", and "Departure", deal with these issues. Although not a victim himself, he also wrote the song "A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation" on the topic of [[domestic violence]] and [[child abuse]], inspired by the stories of some of his peers.

Lyrical themes on the album ''The Crusade'' includes famous killings. "Entrance of the Conflagration" is about [[Andrea Yates]]'s murder of her five children, "Unrepentant" is about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his three daughters and stepdaughter, "Contempt Breeds Contamination" is about the death of [[Amadou Diallo]], and "And Sadness Will Sear" is based upon the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]].

Many of the songs on ''Shogun'' draw lyrical inspiration from [[Greek mythology]]. "[[Into the Mouth of Hell We March]]" and "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis" detail the story of [[Odysseus]] choosing whether to face the giant whirlpool [[Charybdis]] or the six-headed monster [[Scylla]]. "He Who Spawned the Furies" is about the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus|Cronos]] devouring his children and castrating his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], creating [[Aphrodite]] and the [[Erinyes|Erinýes]] (the Furies). "Of Prometheus and the Crucifix" references the daily torment of [[Prometheus]] and alludes to [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. "Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven" is written from the perspective of the [[nymph]] [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], detailing her rape and impregnation by [[Zeus]] and her transformations into a bear and into [[Ursa Major]]. Mythological lyrics returned on ''[[In the Court of the Dragon]]''. Inspired by fantasy literature, the band made up its own mythology on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://knotfest.com/culture/matt-heafy-talks-overcoming-negativity-and-the-new-trivium-album-in-the-court-of-the-dragon/|title=Matt Heafy Talks Overcoming Negativity and the New Trivium Album 'In the Court of the Dragon'|work=[[Knotfest]]|last=Delgadillo|first=Nicolás|date=September 9, 2021|accessdate=October 10, 2021}}</ref> Lyrical content on ''[[The Sin and the Sentence]]'' and ''[[What the Dead Men Say (album)|What the Dead Men Say]]'' were inspired by modern aspects of life, such as [[social media]] and [[artificial intelligence]] as well as general themes such as [[war]], [[history]] and [[religion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2017-10-19/triviums-track-by-track-guide-to-the-sin-and-the-sentence|title=Trivium's track-by-track guide to The Sin And The Sentence|date=October 19, 2017|website=Teamrock.com|access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref>
