==History==

===Early years (1997–2002)===
The band was formerly called Saracuse. They started recording at Bedrock Studios in Leicester where Chris Edwards worked as an engineer. The original band members came from [[Countesthorpe]] and [[Blaby]], and the band formed while Pizzorno, Meighan and Edwards were attending [[Countesthorpe Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/04/kasabian-austria-album-festival-interview|title=Kasabian: from Leicester squares to rock heavyweights|first=Tom|last=Lamont|work=[[The Observer]]|date=4 September 2011|access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="LM20081017">"Kasabian on tour with Oasis".

''[[Leicester Mercury]]''. 2005</ref> The first demo [[Extended play|EP]] was produced by Scott Gilbert and handed to the band on 24 December 1998. Three songs were recorded live: "Whats Going On", "Life of Luxury" and "Shine On". Their first public appearance was at the Vipers Rugby Club to celebrate Edwards' 18th birthday with family and friends.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2017/08/04/kasabian-for-crying-out-loud-interview-cover-feature-2017|title=Kasabian: Forever having the last laugh|last=Wright|first=Lisa|date=4 August 2017|website=DIY|access-date=13 August 2017}}</ref> The band was signed to BMG by London DJ and producer Sam Young and changed their name to Kasabian, after [[Linda Kasabian]], a member of the [[Charles Manson]] cult who later went on to testify against Manson at his trial. In an interview with ''[[Ukula]]'', bassist Chris Edwards explained how former guitarist Chris Karloff picked the name. Reading up on Charles Manson, the Kasabian name stuck with Karloff. "He just thought the word was cool... so it was decided", says Edwards.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=2&ObjectID=1465&CityID=3| title=Ukula Music :: speaking with Kasabian on their first trip to America|work=[[Ukula]]|first=Graeme|last=Maclean| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310145534/http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=2&ObjectID=1465&CityID=3| archive-date=10 March 2007| access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> [[wikt:Kasabian|Kasabian]] is a common [[Armenian people|Armenian]] surname, from the dialectal Armenian [[wikt:ղասաբ|ղասաբ]] ''ġasab'' taken from [[Arabic]] ({{lang-ar|قصّاب|ḳaṣṣāb|links=no}})<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kasap&x=0&y=0 |author=Sevan Nişanyan |title=kasap |website=Nişanyan Sözlük |access-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919062044/https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kasap&x=0&y=0 |archive-date=19 September 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> "butcher" and the patronymic ending յան ''-yan''. Sam Young had been working at Concept Music, a small independent label, when the band's manager left the Saracuse demo on his desk. Concept wanted to sign the band and a two single deal was offered. However, Young did not take over managerial duties and did not solely get them signed instantly to BMG. EMI were interested in the band as well.

===''Kasabian'' (2003–05)===
{{main article|Kasabian (album)}}
Their [[Kasabian (album)|eponymous debut album]] was released in the UK on 13 September 2004, receiving good sales and generally positive reviews. During the recording, the band lived in a farmhouse near [[Rutland Water]] to avoid being disturbed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Kasabian featured at [[Glastonbury Festival line-ups#2005|Glastonbury Festival 2005]] on the "Other Stage".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/archive/2005/ |title=Glastonbury Archive - 2005 |publisher=BBC |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Despite having two prior single releases with debut single "[[Processed Beats]]" and lead single "[[Reason Is Treason]]", it was their third single release "[[Club Foot (song)|Club Foot]]" that gave Kasabian success in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song, which was written in the early years of Kasabian, went on to enjoy both critical and commercial success, and being performed at nearly every Kasabian live performance since its release.

During this period, various drummers played with Kasabian, including current keyboard player [[Ben Kealey]], DJ Dan Ralph Martin, Martin Hall-Adams, brothers Mitch and Ryan Glovers and some others. While recording in Bristol, the band met [[Ian Matthews (drummer)|Ian Matthews]], who plays on "[[Processed Beats]]", "Butcher Blues", "Beneficial Herbs" and possibly some other songs on the debut album and [[B-side]]s.

{{main article|Empire (Kasabian album)}}
During the recording of Kasabian's second album, ''[[Empire (Kasabian album)|Empire]]'', Christopher Karloff, one of the band's chief songwriters, had "artistic and creative differences" and was asked to leave the band, according to the band's website,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kasabian Announce the Departure of Chris Karloff|url=http://www.kasabian.co.uk/news/236/-/24/|date=17 July 2006|access-date=17 July 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303113133/http://www.kasabian.co.uk/news/236/-/24/ |archive-date = 3 March 2007}}</ref> although there is evidence to suggest that he left due to personal circumstances.
