=== Formation ===
[[Nicolas Godin]] studied architecture at the [[École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Versailles]], and [[Jean-Benoît Dunckel]] studied mathematics, before forming a band in 1995.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/air-twenty-years-review-fantastique-absolument-r%C3%AAveur-oui-1.2676799 "Air: Twenty Years review – Fantastique?

The former two subsequently contributed to remixes of tracks recorded by Air.

Initially Godin worked alone, recording a demo with members of Funkadelic as his backing band before releasing his first entirely solo effort, "Modular Mix", which featured production by [[Étienne de Crécy]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Lesieur, Jennifer: "AIR de A à Z".

=== Career ===
After making several remixes for other acts in the first half of the 1990s, Air recorded its first EP, ''[[Premiers Symptômes]]'', in 1995. The band released its first album, ''[[Moon Safari]]'', in 1998.<ref name="Inc.1998">{{cite journal|author=Chris Nickson|title=Space is the Place &#124; CMJ New Music Monthly|journal=CMJ New Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16|date=March 1998|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=16–|issn=1074-6978}}</ref> Its first single, "Sexy Boy", was heavily played on alternative radio stations. The album received universal acclaim and became an international success. In 2000, Air composed the score ''[[The Virgin Suicides (score)|The Virgin Suicides]]'' to [[Sofia Coppola]]'s debut film [[The Virgin Suicides (film)|of the same name]]; in 2012, Air wrote its second score to [[Georges Méliès]]' ''[[Le voyage dans la lune (album)|Le Voyage Dans La Lune]]''. In the 2000s, Dunckel and Godin released four studio albums, including ''[[10 000&nbsp;Hz Legend]]'' (2001), ''[[Talkie Walkie]]'' (2004), ''[[Pocket Symphony]]'' (2007), and ''[[Love 2]]'' (2009).

=== Other works ===
Air has often collaborated with Coppola. Air drummer and former [[Redd Kross]] member [[Brian Reitzell]] put together the [[Lost in Translation (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to 2003's ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'', including one original contribution by Air titled "Alone in Kyoto". The [[Marie Antoinette (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for Coppola's October 2006 film ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' featured a track by Air ("Il Secondo Giorno"). Air wrote and played the music of the album ''[[5:55]]'' by [[England|Anglo]]-French actress and singer [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], which was released in August 2006. Air has recorded a DJ mix album, ''[[Late Night Tales: Air]]'', for [[Azuli Records]]' ''[[Late Night Tales]]'' series. The release was initially scheduled for October 2005, but was delayed several times. It finally was released, complete with a new sleeve design, in September 2006. ''[[Darkel]]'', a solo album by Dunckel, was released that same year.

''[[City Reading (Tre Storie Western)]]'' (2003) started as an idea for a collaboration with contemporary Italian writer [[Alessandro Baricco]], known for his unusual characterizations and lyrical, poetic style. Baricco contacted Air in summer 2002 with the idea to marry narration of texts from his book ''City'' with live original musical accompaniment. The performance premiered live in November 2002 at Rome's [[Teatro Valle]] and was deemed such a success that both parties resolved to make a full studio recording.

=== Influences and musical style ===

Air uses many of its studio instruments (like [[Moog synthesizer]]s, the [[Korg MS-20]], [[Wurlitzer]] and [[Vocoder]]) on stage, where their ability to improvise is more clearly highlighted. The band performs the well-known tracks from the albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often collaborates (both in the studio and live) with artists like [[Beth Hirsch]] (''Moon Safari''), [[Françoise Hardy]] ("Jeanne"), [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]] ("Cosmic Bird"), Gordon Tracks ("Playground Love" and "Easy Going Woman" – Gordon Tracks is a pseudonym of the French singer [[Thomas Mars]] from [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]]), [[Beck]] (''10 000&nbsp;Hz Legend'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141119003809/http://m.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-11-19 |title=Air: 10,000&nbsp;Hz Legend &#124; Album Reviews &#124; Pitchfork |publisher=M.pitchfork.com |date=2001-05-28 |access-date=2015-07-04 }}</ref> and [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] ("Close Your Eyes" from Jarre's ''[[Electronica 1: The Time Machine]]'').
