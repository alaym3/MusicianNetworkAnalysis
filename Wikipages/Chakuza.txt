'''Peter Pangerl''' (born 22 February 1981), better known as '''Chakuza''', is an Austrian [[Rapping|rapper]].

== Career ==
After finishing an apprenticeship to become [[Cook (profession)|chef]], he teamed up with DJ Stickle and MC&nbsp;J and formed the hip hop group ''Verbale Systematik''. When MC&nbsp;J left the group in 2002, they changed their name to ''Beatlefield'' and became a [[Hip hop production|production duo]].

In 2005, the two of them approached [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]] and handed him a demo tape of theirs, which consisted of numerous beats and one song. At about the same time Austrian police had taken Bushido in because of [[battery (crime)|battery]] allegations, and during the trial the rapper was not allowed to leave Austria. This resulted in Bushido temporarily living at Chakuza's place and further in the signing of Chakuza and DJ Stickle to Bushido's label [[ersguterjunge]].<ref>[http://www.laut.de/Chakuza Biography] at laut.de (in German)</ref>

In November 2012, it was announced that Chakuza had been signed to [[Four Music]]. His fourth solo album ''Magnolia'' was released in March 2013 and featured a more non-electronic, songwriter attitude than the previous ones.<ref>[http://www.fourmusic.com/kuenstler/chakuza/ Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220044825/http://www.fourmusic.com/kuenstler/chakuza/ |date=20 December 2013 }} at fourmusic.com (in German)</ref>
