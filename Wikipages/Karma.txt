==Definition==
The term ''karma'' ({{lang-sa|कर्म|}}; {{lang-pi|kamma|italic=yes}}) refers to both the executed 'deed, work, action, act' and the 'object, intent'.<ref name="halbfass2000" />

[[Wilhelm Halbfass]] (2000) explains karma (''karman'') by contrasting it with the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Kriyā|kriya]]'':<ref name="halbfass2000" /> whereas ''kriya'' is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, ''karma'' is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars<ref>[[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]] (2010), Hindus: Their religious beliefs and practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pp 261–262</ref> as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.<ref name="halbfass2000" />

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of karma arises because of the diversity of views among the [[Schools of hinduism|schools of Hinduism]]; some, for example, consider [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]] and [[Reincarnation in Hinduism|rebirth]] linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth to be essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.<ref name="wkasrb">see:

* Sharma, A. (1996), On the distinction between Karma and Rebirth in Hinduism, Asian Philosophy, 6(1), pp 29–35;

Thus, karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings.<ref>[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0-02-865704-2}}, see article on Karma</ref> It is a concept whose meaning, importance, and scope varies between the various traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. [[Wendy Doniger|Wendy O'Flaherty]] claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] stance.<ref name="wdointro" />

=== Principle of karma ===
''Karma'' also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the ''principle of karma'', and sometimes the ''karma theory'' or the ''law of karma''.<ref name="karlpotter">Karl Potter (1964), The Naturalistic Principle of Karma, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Apr. 1964), pp. 39–49</ref>

In the context of theory, ''karma'' is complex and difficult to define.<ref name="wdointro">Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, pp xi–xxv (Introduction)</ref> Different schools of [[Indology]] derive different definitions for the concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be [[Ethics|ethical]] or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, i.e., good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth.<ref name="wdointro" /><ref>Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, pp 3–37</ref> Other Indologists include in the definition that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives.<ref name="wdointro" /><ref>Karl Potter (1980), in Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions (O'Flaherty, Editor), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, pp 241–267</ref> The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.<ref>See:

==== Causality ====
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Karma as action and reaction: if we show goodness, we will reap goodness.]]A common theme to theories of karma is its [[principle of causality]].<ref name="karlpotter" /> This relationship between karma and causality is a central motif in all schools of [[Karma in Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Karma in Jainism|Jain]] thought.<ref name="brucer">Bruce R. Reichenbach, The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct. 1988), pp. 399–410</ref> One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' of Hinduism. For example, at 4.4.5–6, it states:

{{Quote|
1=<poem>
Now as a man is like this or like that,
according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;

And here they say that a person consists of desires,
and as is his desire, so is his will;
and as is his will, so is his deed;
and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
</poem>
|2=[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|3=7th century BCE<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/6MPYs0AkA?url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/quotes/brihadaranyaka-upanishad-4-4-5-6 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5–6] Berkley Center for Religion Peace & World Affairs, Georgetown University (2012)</ref><ref name=jbbu>The words "deed", "acts" above are rendered from karma; see [https://archive.today/20140107061016/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/jrblack/web/SKT/DL/upanishads.html Brihadaranyaka] James Black, Original Sanskrit & Muller Oxford English Translations, University of Wisconsin, United States (2011)</ref>
}}

The theory of karma as causation holds that: (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.<ref>Anguttara-Nikaya 3.4.33, Translator: Henry Warren (1962), Buddhism in Translations, Atheneum Publications, New York, pp 216–217</ref>

Another causality characteristic, shared by karmic theories, is that ''like deeds'' lead to ''like effects''. Thus, good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral, or emotional—that is, one's karma affects both one's happiness and unhappiness.<ref name="brucer" /> The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.<ref name="jmpj">see:
*James McDermott, Karma and Rebirth in Early Buddhism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, pp 165–192
*Padmanabh Jaini, Karma and the problem of rebirth in Jainism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, pp 217–239

The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: ''[[phala]]'' and ''[[Samskara (Indian philosophy)|samskara]]''. A ''phala'' ({{Literal translation|fruit' or 'result}}) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, a ''samskara'' ({{Lang-sa|संस्कार}}) is an invisible effect, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in their current and future lives. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of ''samskaras''.<ref name="brucer" /><ref>Damien Keown (1996), Karma, character, and consequentialism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, pp 329–350.</ref>

Karl Potter (1964) and [[Harold Coward]] (1983) suggest that karmic principle can also be understood as a principle of psychology and habit.<ref name="karlpotter" /><ref>Karl Potter's suggestion is supported by the Bhagavad-Gita, which links good bondage and bad bondage to good habits and bad habits respectively. It also lists various types of habits – such as good (sattva), passion (rajas) and indifferent (tamas) – while explaining karma. See the cited Potter reference; elsewhere, in Yoga Sutras, the role of karma to creating habits is explained with ''Vāsanās'' – see Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York, {{ISBN|0-7914-3816-3}}, Chapter 3, particularly pp 102–105</ref> Karma seeds habits (''[[vāsanā]]''), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds [[Self-perception theory|self perception]], and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort.<ref name="karlpotter" /><ref>Ian Whicher (1998), The final stages of purification in classical yoga, Asian Philosophy, 8(2), pp 85–102</ref> Thus, psyche and habit, according to Potter and Coward, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature.<ref name="karlpotter" /><ref>[[Harold Coward]] (1983), "Psychology and Karma", ''Philosophy East and West'' 33 (Jan): 49–60.</ref> The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person's 'character', as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.<ref name="jamesloch" />

====Ethicization====
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence,<ref name="jbowker" /> which will come to fruition in either this life or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself '[[Reward system|reward and punishment]]', but the law that produces consequence.<ref>Francis X. Clooney, Evil, Divine Omnipotence, and Human Freedom: Vedānta's Theology of Karma, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Oct. 1989), pp. 530–548</ref> [[Wilhelm Halbfass]] (1998) notes that good karma is considered as ''[[dharma]]'' and leads to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ('merit'), while bad karma is considered ''[[adharma]]'' and leads to ''[[Pāpa|pāp]]'' ('demerit, sin').<ref>Wilhelm Halbfass (1998), Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, London, see article on Karma and Rebirth (Indian Conceptions)</ref>

Reichenbach (1988) suggests that the theories of karma are an [[ethical theory]].<ref name="brucer" /> This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit, and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure [[causal relation]]; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless.<ref name="brucer" /> A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.<ref>see:

*Krishan, Y. (1988), The Vedic origins of the doctrine of karma, South Asian Studies, 4(1), pp 51–55</ref>

====Rebirth====
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of [[reincarnation]] or the cycle of rebirths (''[[saṃsāra]]'').<ref name="jbowker" />{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126–128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272–273, 652–654}} Rebirth is a fundamental concept of [[Reincarnation in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Buddhism]], Jainism and Sikhism.<ref name="jamesloch">James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351–352</ref> Rebirth, or ''saṃsāra'', is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is, a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition, or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.<ref>James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 589</ref> In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas.<ref name="jbowker" /><ref>[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Karma</ref> This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching ''[[moksa]]''. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.

The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.<ref name="wkasrb" /> Hiriyanna (1949) suggests rebirth to be a necessary corollary of karma;<ref>M. Hiriyana (1949), Essentials of Indian Philosophy, George Allen Unwin, London, pp 47</ref> Yamunacharya (1966) asserts that karma is a fact, while reincarnation is a hypothesis;<ref>M Yamunacharya (1966), Karma and Rebirth, Indian Philo. Annual, 1, pp 66</ref> and Creel (1986) suggests that karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept.<ref>Austin Creel (1986), in Editor: Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-990-2}}, Chapter 1</ref>

The theory of 'karma and rebirth' raises numerous questions—such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as [[Charvaka]]s (or Lokayata) abandoned the theory of 'karma and rebirth' altogether.<ref name="halbfass2000" /><ref>see:

==In Hinduism==
{{Main|Karma in Hinduism}}
The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest ''[[Upanishads]]'' began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include ''[[Panchagni Vidya|pancagni vidya]]'' (the five fire doctrine), ''pitryana'' (the cyclic path of fathers) and ''devayana'' (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods).<ref>Colebrooke, H.

Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency.<ref>Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, see Karma</ref> Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Professor [[Wilhelm Halbfass]],<ref name="halbfass2000" />
* The [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism considers karma and rebirth as central, with some Nyaya scholars such as [[Udayana]] suggesting that the Karma doctrine implies that God exists.<ref>Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209–10</ref>
* The [[Vaisheshika|Vaisesika]] school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
* The [[Samkhya]] school considers karma to be of secondary importance (second to [[Prakṛti|''prakrti'']]).
* The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards ''[[samsara]]'' and ''[[moksa]]''.<ref>Wilhelm Halbfass, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, Chapter 11</ref>
* The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one's behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.<ref name="wmahony" />
* The [[Vedanta]] school acknowledges the karma-rebirth doctrine, but concludes it is a theory that is not derived from reality and cannot be proven, considers it invalid for its failure to explain evil / inequality / other observable facts about society, treats it as a [[convenient fiction]] to solve practical problems in Upanishadic times, and declares it irrelevant.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2019|reason=Statement is confusing. The first part of the statement says that the school acknowledges the theory, which appears to imply that the school accepts the theory at least partly, but the statement goes on to say that the school considers the theory invalid. Should the statement say instead that the school rejects the theory largely? Please clarify}}{{Single Source-inline|date=December 2019}}
*In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, actions in current life have moral consequences and liberation is possible within one's life as ''[[Jivanmukta|jivanmukti]]'' (self-realized person).

The above schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as that of non-dualism and dualism under Vedanta. Furthermore, there are other schools of Indian philosophy such as [[Charvaka]] (or Lokayata; the [[Materialism|materialists]]) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this non-Vedic school, the properties of things come from the nature of things. [[Causality]] emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.<ref>Eli Franco (1981), [http://www.sudoc.fr/041081900 Lokayata La Philosophie Dite Materialiste de l'Inde Classique], Nanterre-Paris, France</ref><ref>Franco, Eli (1998), Nyaya-Vaisesika, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London</ref>

The results of kamma ("kamma" is the Pali spelling for the word "karma") experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one's state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47–48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=42}} There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47–48}} The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=131}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47–48}} ''Karmaphala'' is not a "judgement" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos.

We do not believe in a creator but in the causes and conditions that create certain circumstances that then come to fruition. This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations.

According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]],

<blockquote>This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''shrardha'' (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Collected papers on Jaina studies | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | editor=Jaini, Padmanabh | year=2000 | edition=1st | location=Delhi | pages=137}}</ref></blockquote>

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=107}} Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=107–115}} Karma is thus an [[efficient cause]] (''[[nimitta]]'') in Jain philosophy, but not the [[Material Cause|material cause]] (''[[Upādāna|upadana]]''). The soul is believed to be the material cause.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=117–118}}

The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:

* Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous '[[Divine entity]]' in Jainism)
* Jainism advocates that a soul attracts ''karmic'' matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a ''karma-bandha'' or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing [[Ratnatraya]] (The Three Jewels): ''samyak darśana'' ('Right Faith'), ''samyak jnāna'' ('Right Knowledge') and ''samyak charitra'' ('Right Conduct').
* In Jain theology, a soul is released of worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the ''karma-bandha''.<ref name="FN2M">{{cite encyclopedia | title=From Nigoda to Moksa: The Story of Marudevi | encyclopedia=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini | publisher=Asian Humanities Press (an imprint of Jain Publishing Company) | author=Jaini, Padmanabh S. | editor=Qvarnström, Olle | year=2003 | volume=I | location=Fremont CA | pages=1–28}}</ref> In Jainism, ''nirvana'' and ''moksha'' are used interchangeably. ''Nirvana'' represents annihilation of all karmas by an individual soul and ''moksha'' represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage). In the presence of a ''[[Tirthankara]]'', a soul can attain ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' ('omniscience') and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.<ref name="FN2M" />
* The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Even the ''Tirthankaras'' themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state.
* Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.<ref>Sancheti Asoo Lal, Bhandari Manak Mal, ''First Steps to Jainism (Part Two): Doctrine of Karma, Doctrine of Anekant and Other Articles with Appendices'', Catalogued by [[Library of Congress|Library of U.S. Congress]], Washington, Card No. 90-232383</ref>

===Eight Karmas===
There are eight types of Karma which attach a soul to Samsar (the cycle of birth and death):<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDPjCwAAQBAJ&q=eight+karmas+in+jainism&pg=PT109 |title=The Soul of Jainism: Philosophy and Teachings of Jain Religion|isbn=9788128813436|last1=Shiv Sharma|first1=Dr|date=30 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC&q=eight+karmas+in+jainism|title = Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|isbn = 9788120816916|last1 = Jaini|first1 = Padmanabh S.|year = 2000}}</ref>

# '''''Gyanavarniya''''' (knowledge-obstructing): like a veil prevents a face and its features from being seen, this karma prevents the soul from knowing an object along with details about that object. This karma obstructs the soul from realizing its essential quality of knowledge. In its absence, a soul is omniscient. There are five sub-types of ''gyanavarniya'' karma which prevents the five types of knowledge: ''mati gyan'' (sensory knowledge), ''shrut gyan'' (articulate knowledge), ''avadhi gyan'' ([[clairvoyance]]), ''mana paryay gyan'' ([[telepathy]]) and ''keval gyan'' ([[omniscience]]).
# '''''Darshanavarniya''''' (perception-obstructing): like a gatekeeper prevents the sight of the king, this karma prevents an object from being perceived, hiding it. This karma obstructs the soul from realizing its essential quality of perception. In its absence, a soul completely perceives all substances in the universe. There are nine sub-types of this karma. Four of these prevent the four types of perception; visual perception, non-visual perception, clairvoyant perception and omniscient perception. The other five sub-types of darshanavarniya karma bondage induce five kinds of sleep causing reduction in consciousness: light sleep, deep sleep, drowsiness, heavy drowsiness, and sleep-walking.
# '''''Vedaniya''''' (sensation-producing): like licking honey from a sword gives a sweet taste but cuts the tongue, this karma makes a soul experience pleasure and pain. The soul's bliss is continuously disturbed by experiences of external sensual pleasure and pain. In the absence of the vedaniya karma, the soul experiences undisturbed bliss. There are two sub-types of this karma; pleasure-producing and pain-producing.
# '''''Mohniya''''' (deluding): like a bee becomes infatuated with the smell of a flower and is attracted to it, this karma attracts the soul to the objects that it considers favorable while repelling it from objects it considers unfavorable. It creates a delusion in the soul that external objects can affect it. This karma obstructs the soul's essential quality of happiness and prevents the soul from finding pure happiness in itself.
# '''''Ayu''''' (lifespan-determining): like a prisoner remains trapped by iron chains (around his legs, hands, etc.) this karma keeps a soul trapped in a particular life (or birth).
# '''''Naam''''' (body-producing): like a painter creates various pictures and gives them various names, this karma gives souls various types of bodies (that are classified based on various attributes). It is the ''naamkarma'' which determines the body of living organism into which the soul must enter.
# '''''Gotra''''' ([[Gotra|status-determining]]): like a potter makes short and tall pots, this karma bestows a low or high (societal) status on the body of soul. It creates social inequalities and in its absence, all souls are equal. There are two sub-types of gotra karma: high status and low status.
# '''''Antaray''''' (power-obstructing): like a treasurer obstructs a king from spending his wealth, this karma prevents the soul from using its innate power for acts of charity, profit, enjoyment, repeated enjoyment and will-power. It obstructs and prevents the soul's essential quality of infinite power from manifesting. In its absence, a soul has infinite power.

==Reception in other traditions==
===Sikhism===
{{Sikhism sidebar}}
In [[Sikhism]], all living beings are described as being under the influence of the three qualities of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of ''maya's'' nature, ''[[jiva]]s'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called ''karma'', wherein the underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the law of karma in [[Gurbani]] ([[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]). Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm |title=Gurbani.org |access-date=5 October 2008 |archive-date=29 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129135407/http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Falun Gong===
David Ownby, a scholar of Chinese history at the University of Montreal,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kahn|first=Joseph|date=22 August 2008|title=Book Review {{!}} 'Falun Gong and the Future of China,' by David Ownby|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/books/review/Kahn-t.html|access-date=14 March 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> asserts that [[Falun Gong]] differs from Buddhism in its definition of the term "karma" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', or 'virtue', is reserved for what might otherwise be termed 'good karma' in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering – what Buddhism might refer to as 'bad karma'. According to [[Li Hongzhi]], the founder of Falun Gong: "A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma."<ref name="Ownbyfuture">David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press</ref>

Falun Gong teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as ''[[Saṃsāra|samsara]]'',<ref name="TRAN">Transcending the Five Elements and Three Realms, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html Zhuan Falun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609043918/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html|date=9 June 2011}}, accessed 31 December 2007</ref> due to the accumulation of karma.<ref name="kar">Transformation of Karma, Zhuan Falun Lecture 4, accessed 01/01/08</ref> This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one's continued rebirth and suffering.<ref name="kar" /> Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.<ref name="kar" />

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of "one reaps what one sows". Others say [[Matthew 5:44]] means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a "system of transmigration", although, "in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived." Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them.<ref name="Ownbyfuture" /><!-- Ownby 2008 p.110 --> In the same vein of Li's ''[[monism]]'', matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.<ref name="Ownbyfuture" />

According to Li, <blockquote>Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings.<ref name="ZFLII">Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm Zhuan Falun, Volume II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023901/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm|date=21 August 2011}}, published 1996, translated June 2008, accessed 21 June 2008</ref></blockquote>He says that, in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a "setting of delusion," and return. "That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed."<ref name="ZFLII" />

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent "opposition to practitioners' taking [[medication|medicine]] when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the [[illness]] through cultivation." [[Benjamin Penny]] shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that "karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people," Penny asks: "if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?"<ref name="Fellow">[[Benjamin Penny]], Canberra, 2001, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present and Future of Falun Gong, A lecture by Harold White Fellow, Benjamin Penny, at the National Library of Australia], accessed 31 December 2007</ref> Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that "What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking." Li also states that "An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick."<ref>Lectures in United States, 1997, Li Hongzhi</ref> Danny Schechter (2001) quotes a Falun Gong student who says "It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not."<ref name="schechter">Danny Schechter, ''Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?'', Akashic books: New York, 2001, pp. 47–50.</ref>

===Taoism===
{{Taoism}}
Karma is an important concept in [[Taoism]]. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.<ref name="evawong" />

The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages.<ref name="lkohn">Livia Kohn (1998), [http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf Steal holy food and come back as a Viper – Conceptions of Karma and Rebirth in Medieval Daoism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109063052/http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf |date=9 January 2014 }}, Early Medieval China, 4, pp 1–48</ref> In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (''ming''). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.<ref name="lkohn" /><ref>Erik Zurcher (1980), Buddhist influence on early Taoism, T'oung Pao, Vol. 66, pp 84–147</ref>

===Shinto===
Interpreted as ''musubi'', a view of karma is recognized in [[Shinto]] as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aidan Rankin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8UWWZPxw4C&pg=PA133|title=Shinto: A Celebration of Life|date=3 February 2011|isbn=978-1-84694-438-3|pages=133}}</ref>

==Discussion==
===Free will and destiny===

One of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the [[moral agency]] problem;<ref name=wrkaufman>Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15–32</ref> the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.<ref>[Moral responsibility] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University (2009); Quote – "Can a person be morally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explained solely by reference to physical states of the universe and the laws governing changes in those physical states, or solely by reference to the existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinely ordained path?"</ref>

The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts:<ref name=wrkaufman/>

# A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma:  he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his "wicked" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma?
# Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate?
# Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education—because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?<ref>Herman, Arthur (1976), The Problem of Evil in Indian Thought, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas</ref>

The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]], that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will.<ref>Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Macmillan Reference, see Karma</ref> Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold:

# The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent – good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried.
# Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others.
# Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (cf. [[moral evil]] versus [[natural evil]]).<ref>Reichenbach, Bruce (1990), The Law of Karma, University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|978-0-333-53559-2}}</ref><ref name="mdeb" />

Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (''[[cetanā]]'') and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.<ref name="wrkaufman" /><ref name="mdeb">Matthew Dasti and Edwin Bryant (2013), Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992275-8}}</ref>

===Psychological indeterminacy===
Another issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere (1968).<ref name=goerl>G. Obeyesekere (1968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, Practical religion, Editor: E.R. Leach, Cambridge University Press</ref> That is, if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong, such as sickness or failure at work, the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.<ref name=goerl/>

This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.<ref name=mdeb/>

===Transferability===
Some schools of Asian religions, particularly popular [[Buddhism]], allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial.<ref>Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-990-2}}</ref><ref>see:
* Charles Keyes (1983), Merit-Transference in the Kammic Theory of Popular Theravada Buddhism, In Karma, Editors: Charles Keyes and [[Valentine Daniel]], Berkeley, University of California Press;
* F.L. Woodward (1914), The Buddhist Doctrine of Reversible Merit, The Buddhist Review, Vol. 6, pp 38–50</ref> Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with [[substitutionary atonement]] and vicarious punishment. It defeats the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.

In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others.<ref>Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-990-2}}, pp 226, see Footnote 74</ref> Other schools in Hinduism, such as the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantic]] philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.<ref name=wdointro/><ref>Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-03923-0}}, Chapter 1</ref>

===The problem of evil===
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the [[problem of evil]] and related problem of [[theodicy]]. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs:<ref>R Green (2005), Theodicy, in The Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition (Editor: Lindsay Jones), Volume 12, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0-02-865733-2}}</ref>

# There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate ([[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]); and
# That one God knows absolutely everything ([[Omniscience|omniscient]]) and is all powerful ([[Omnipotence|omnipotent]]).

The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, "why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?" Sociologist [[Max Weber]] extended the problem of evil [[Sociology of Religion (book)|to Eastern traditions]].<ref>Max Weber (Translated by Fischoff, 1993), The Sociology of Religion, Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-4205-2}}, pp. 129–153</ref>

The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in ''[[Uttara Mīmāṃsā]]'' Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;<ref>Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}}, pp. 454–455</ref><ref>Francis Clooney (1989), "Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta's theology of Karma", ''Journal of Religion'', Vol. 69, pp 530–548</ref> the 8th century arguments by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Sankara]] in [[Brahma Sutras|''Brahma Sutra'']] ''[[Bhashya|bhasya]]'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;<ref name="bilimoria">P.

Other scholars<ref>Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ''Man'', Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–364</ref> suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some<ref>The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator</ref> theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato's [[Demiurge]].<ref name="bilimoria2013">P. Bilimoria (2013), Toward an Indian Theodicy, in The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil (Editors: McBrayer and Howard-Snyder), 1st Edition, John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|978-0-470-67184-9}}, Chapter 19</ref> Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions.<ref>G. Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-05525-3}}</ref> Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.<ref>B.

Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0-534-50549-3}}, pp. 248–255</ref> Some scholars, particularly of the [[Nyaya|Nyaya school]] of Hinduism and Sankara in ''Brahma Sutra bhasya'', have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person's environment given that person's karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil.<ref>Bruce R. Reichenbach (1989), Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 135–149</ref> Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.<ref>Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0753-7}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book</ref>

Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals.<ref>P. Singh, Sikh perspectives on health and suffering: A focus on Sikh theodicy, in Religion, Health and Suffering (Editors: John Hinnells and Roy Porter), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-7103-0611-1}}, pp. 111–132</ref> In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with [[dharma]] and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma.<ref name=bilimoria2013/> In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.<ref name=bilimoria/>

Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life.<ref>Whitley Kaufman (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East & West, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 15–32</ref> Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.<ref>Chadha and Trakakis (2007), Karma and the Problem of Evil: A Response to Kaufman, Philosophy East & West, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp. 533–556</ref>

===Judaism===
There is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew ''midah k'neged midah'', which literally translates to 'value against value', but carries the same connotation as the English phrase 'measure for measure'. The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather, in matters of ethics, i.e. how one's actions affects the world will eventually come back to that person in ways one might not necessarily expect. [[David Wolpe]] compared ''midah k'neged midah'' to karma.<ref>Wolpe, David.  [https://www.sinaitemple.org/worship/sermons/toldot-training-hands-esau-voice-jacob/ "Drash."] Sinai Temple.

Popular methods for negating [[cognitive dissonance]] include [[meditation]], [[metacognition]], [[counselling]], [[psychoanalysis]], etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/what-is-karma-223607|title = What is Karma? |date   = September 3, 2013|access-date = 2020-05-23| website = www.speakingtree.in| language = en}}</ref> Permanent neuronal changes within the [[amygdala]] and left [[prefrontal cortex]] of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically.<ref>Davidson, Richard J., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jessica Schumacher, Melissa Rosenkranz, Daniel Muller, Saki F.

=== Theosophy, Spiritism, New Age ===
The idea of karma was popularized in the [[Western world]] through the work of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] ''law of return'' or ''[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|Threefold Law]],'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'

Theosophist [[I. K. Taimni]] wrote, "Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions."<ref>I.K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 17</ref> [[Theosophy]] also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.<ref>E.L. Gardner ''Reincarnation: Some Testimony From Nature'' 1947</ref>
