'''Oliver''' "'''Tuku'''" '''Mtukudzi''' (22 September 1952 – 23 January 2019) was a [[Zimbabwean]] musician, businessman, philanthropist, [[Human rights activists|human rights activist]] and [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for Southern Africa Region.

==Career ==
[[File:Tuku.JPG|thumb|Oliver Mtukudzi and the Black Spirits]]
Mtukudzi grew up in [[Highfield, Harare|Highfield]], a poor neighborhood in [[Harare|Salisbury]] (modern-day Harare) in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. He began performing in 1977 when he joined the Wagon Wheels, a band that also featured [[Thomas Mapfumo]] and fellow guitarist [[James Chimombe]]. They were given the rare opportunity by [[Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo]], an [[African nationalist]] and music promotor, who provided money and resources to the group. He allowed them to perform at Club Mutanga (Pungwe) which, at the time, was the only [[night club]] available for blacks under Rhodesia's policy of segregation. Their single ''Dzandimomotera'' went gold and Tuku's first album followed, which was also a major success. Mtukudzi was also a contributor to Mahube, Southern Africa's "supergroup".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.embargo.ca/zim/artists/bios/omtuku/index.htm |title=Oliver Mtukudzi and the Black Spirits, Zimbabwe Music Guide. |access-date=3 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828031842/http://www.embargo.ca/zim/artists/bios/omtuku/index.htm |archive-date=28 August 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

With his husky voice, Mtukudzi became the most recognised voice to emerge from Zimbabwe and onto the international scene and he earned a devoted following across Africa and beyond. A member of Zimbabwe's [[Shona people|KoreKore group]], with Nzou Samanyanga as his totem, he sang in the nation's dominant [[Shona language]] along with [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] and English. He also incorporated elements of different musical traditions, giving his music a distinctive style, known to fans as ''Tuku Music''.  

Mtukudzi had a number of tours around the world. He was on several tours in the UK, US and Canada to perform for large audiences. In 2017 Mtukudzi entertained guests at the wedding of Zimbabwean businessman [[Wicknell Chivayo]].<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://www.herald.co.zw/tuku-serenades-chivayos-marriage-ceremony-guests/|title=Tuku serenades Chivayo's marriage ceremony guests|accessdate=10 January 2017 |work=The Herald}}</ref>

== Social commentary ==
Prior to the independence of [[Zimbabwe]], Mtukudzi's music depicted the struggles under [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesian]] white minority rule.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47021184|title=Mtukudzi buried in his home village|date=27 January 2019|access-date=29 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In subsequent years following [[Rhodesian Bush War|Zimbabwean independence]], his music has advocated for tolerance and peace and has frequently portrayed the struggles of women and children.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oliver Mtukudzi and his 'talking guitar' was our gift from Zimbabwe to the world |url=https://qz.com/africa/1534462/oliver-mtukudzi-was-our-gift-from-zimbabwe-to-the-world/ |website=Quartz Africa }}</ref>
