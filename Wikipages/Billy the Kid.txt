'''Billy the Kid''' (born '''Henry McCarty'''; September 17 or November 23, 1859{{snd}}July 14, 1881), also known by the [[pseudonym]] '''William H. Bonney''', was an [[outlaw]] and [[gunfighter]] of the [[American Old West]], who killed eight men before he was shot and killed at the age of 21.{{sfn|Rasch|1995|pp=23–35}}{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=244–45}} He also fought in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Lincoln County War]], during which he allegedly committed three murders.

McCarty was orphaned at the age of 15. His first arrest was for stealing food, at the age of 16, in late 1875. Ten days later, he robbed a Chinese laundry and was again arrested, but escaped shortly afterwards. He fled from [[New Mexico Territory]] into neighboring [[Arizona Territory]], making himself both an outlaw and a federal fugitive. In 1877, McCarty began to call himself "William H. Bonney".{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=144}} Two versions of a [[wanted poster]] dated September 23,&nbsp;1875, refer to him as "Wm. Wright, better known as Billy the Kid".{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

After killing a blacksmith during an altercation in August 1877, McCarty became a wanted man in Arizona and returned to New Mexico, where he joined a group of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustlers]]. He became well known in the region when he joined the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] and took part in the [[Lincoln County War]] of 1878. McCarty and two other Regulators were later charged with killing three men, including Lincoln County Sheriff [[William J. Brady]] and one of his deputies.

McCarty's notoriety grew in December 1880 when the ''Las Vegas Gazette'', in [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]], and ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]'', in New York City, carried stories about his crimes.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=145–46}} Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] captured McCarty later that month. In April 1881, McCarty was tried for and convicted of Brady's murder, and was sentenced to hang in May of that year. He escaped from jail on April 28, killing two sheriff's deputies in the process and evading capture for more than two months. Garrett shot and killed McCarty, by then age 21, in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]] on July 14, 1881. During the following decades, legends grew that McCarty had survived, and a number of men claimed to be him.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 30, 2017 |title=The Old Man Who Claimed to Be Billy the Kid |language=en |work=Atlas Obscura |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/billy-the-kid-survived-hico-texas |url-status=live |access-date=July 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134218/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/billy-the-kid-survived-hico-texas |archive-date=July 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Billy the Kid remains one of the most notorious figures from the era, whose life and likeness have been [[List of works about Billy the Kid|frequently dramatized]] in [[Western genre|Western]] popular culture.

==Early life==
Henry McCarty was born to parents of [[Irish Catholic]] ancestry,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-07-15 |title=Life and death of Billy the Kid |url=https://clarechampion.ie/life-and-death-of-billy-the-kid/ |access-date=2020-11-13 |website=The Clare Champion |language=en-GB |archive-date=February 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226090313/https://clarechampion.ie/life-and-death-of-billy-the-kid/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Catherine ({{nee|Devine}}) and Patrick McCarty, in [[New York City]]. While his birth year has been confirmed as 1859, the exact date of his birth has been disputed as either September 17 or November 23 of that year. A letter from an official of [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church (Manhattan)|Saint Peter's Church]] in [[Manhattan]] states it is in possession of records showing McCarty was baptized there on September 28, 1859.{{efn|Letter from Rev. James B.

Following the death of her husband Patrick, Catherine McCarty and her sons moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where she met William Henry Harrison Antrim. The McCarty family moved with Antrim to [[Wichita, Kansas]], in 1870.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=15}} After moving again a few years later, Catherine married Antrim on March 1, 1873, at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory]]; McCarty and his brother Joseph were witnesses to the ceremony.{{sfn|Nolan|1998|pp=17–19}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|p=7}} Shortly afterward, the family moved from Santa Fe to [[Silver City, New Mexico]], and Joseph McCarty began using the name Joseph Antrim.{{sfn|Nolan|1998|pp=15, 29}} Shortly before McCarty's mother, Catherine, died of [[tuberculosis]], then called "consumption", on September 16, 1874,{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|p=8}} William Antrim abandoned the McCarty boys, leaving them orphans.

McCarty was 15 years old when his mother died. Sarah Brown, the owner of a [[boarding house]], gave him room and board in exchange for work.

[[File:Rancher Henry C Hooker retouched cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Henry Hooker]], one-time employer of Billy the Kid, at his [[Sierra Bonita Ranch]] in southeast Arizona]]
After leaving Antrim, McCarty traveled to southeastern [[Arizona Territory]], where he worked as a ranch hand and gambled his wages in nearby gaming houses.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=103}} In 1876, he was hired as a ranch hand by well-known rancher [[Henry Hooker]].<ref name="nmdotorg">{{Cite web |title=Billy the Kid |url=http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126043335/http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |access-date=January 6, 2016 |publisher=State of New Mexico |df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=10–11}} During this time, McCarty became acquainted with John R.

On August 17, 1877, McCarty was at a saloon in the village of [[Bonita, Arizona|Bonita]] when he got into an argument with Francis P. "Windy" Cahill, a blacksmith who reportedly had bullied McCarty and on more than one occasion called him a "[[pimp]]". McCarty in turn called Cahill a "[[Bitch (slang)#Son of a bitch|son of a bitch]]", whereupon Cahill threw McCarty to the floor and the two struggled for McCarty's revolver.

McCarty stole a horse and fled Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory,{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=119}} but [[Apache]]s took the horse from him, leaving him to walk many miles to the nearest settlement.

After returning to New Mexico, McCarty worked as a cowboy for English businessman and rancher [[John Henry Tunstall]] (1853–1878), near the Rio Felix, a tributary of the [[Rio Grande]], in Lincoln County. Tunstall and his business partner and lawyer [[Alexander McSween]] were opponents of an alliance formed by [[Irish-American]] businessmen [[Lawrence Murphy]], [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|James Dolan]], and John Riley. The three men had wielded an economic and political hold over Lincoln County since the early 1870s, due in part to their ownership of a beef contract with nearby [[Fort Stanton]] and a well-patronized dry goods store in the town of [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]].

By February 1878, McSween owed $8,000 to Dolan, who obtained a court order and asked Lincoln County Sheriff [[William J. Brady]] to [[Attachment (law)|attach]] nearly $40,000 worth of Tunstall's property and livestock. Tunstall put Bonney in charge of nine prime horses and told him to relocate them to his ranch for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brady assembled a large posse to seize Tunstall's cattle.{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|pp=188–90}}<ref name=tunstallfamily />

On February 18, 1878, Tunstall learned of the posse's presence on his land and rode out to intervene. During the encounter, one member of the posse shot Tunstall in the chest, knocking him off his horse. Another posse member took Tunstall's gun and killed him with a shot to the back of his head.<ref name="tunstallfamily">{{Cite magazine |last=Boardman |first=Mark |date=September 25, 2010 |title=The Tunstalls Return – John Tunstall's kin traveled from England to fathom death in Lincoln. |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-tunstalls-return/ |url-status=live |magazine=True West Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216031421/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-tunstalls-return/ |archive-date=February 16, 2016 |access-date=February 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=46}} Tunstall's murder ignited the conflict between the two factions that became known as the [[Lincoln County War]].<ref name=tunstallfamily />{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|pp=23–55}}

After Tunstall was killed, McCarty and [[Richard M.

Wilson.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=48–49}} On February 20, 1878, while attempting to arrest Brady, the sheriff and his deputies found and arrested McCarty and two other men riding with him.<ref name="TWfebarrest">{{Cite magazine |last=Bell |first=Bob Boze |date=April 1, 2004 |title=I Shot the Sheriff (and I Killed a Deputy, Too) – Billy Kid and the Regulators vs Sheriff Brady and His Deputies |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/i-shot-the-sheriff-and-i-killed-a-deputy-too/ |url-status=live |magazine=True West Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216031605/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/i-shot-the-sheriff-and-i-killed-a-deputy-too/ |archive-date=February 16, 2016 |access-date=February 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Deputy [[United States Marshal Service|U.S. Marshal]] [[Robert Widenmann]], a friend of McCarty, and a detachment of soldiers captured Sheriff Brady's jail guards, put them behind bars, and released Bonney and Brewer.<ref name="TWtunstallambush">{{Cite magazine |last=Bell |first=Bob Boze |date=September 11, 2015 |title=Tunstall Ambushed – Regulators vs Dolan's Henchmen |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/tunstall-ambushed/ |url-status=live |magazine=True West Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216032547/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/tunstall-ambushed/ |archive-date=February 16, 2016 |access-date=February 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

McCarty then joined the [[Lincoln County Regulators]]; on March 9 they captured Frank Baker and William Morton, both of whom were accused of killing Tunstall. Baker and Morton were killed while allegedly trying to escape.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=56–60}}

==== Battle of Lincoln (1878) ====
{{Main|Battle of Lincoln (1878)}}
On the night of Sunday, July 14, McSween and the Regulators—now a group of fifty or sixty men—went to Lincoln and stationed themselves in the town among several buildings.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1994|p=173}} At the McSween residence were McCarty, Florencio Chavez, [[Jose Chavez y Chavez]], Jim French, Harvey Morris, [[Tom O'Folliard]], and [[Yginio Salazar]], among others. Another group led by Marin Chavez and [[Doc Scurlock]] positioned themselves on the roof of a saloon. [[Henry Newton Brown]], Dick Smith, and [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]] defended a nearby adobe bunkhouse.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=312–13}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|p=87}}

On Tuesday, July 16, newly appointed sheriff [[George Peppin]] sent sharpshooters to kill the McSween defenders at the saloon. Peppin's men retreated when one of the snipers, Charles Crawford, was killed by Fernando Herrera. Peppin then sent a request for assistance to Colonel [[Nathan Dudley]], commandant of nearby [[Fort Stanton]]. In a reply to Peppin, Dudley refused to intervene but later arrived in Lincoln with troops, turning the battle in favor of the Murphy-Dolan faction.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|p=513}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=New Mexico Office of the State Historian {{!}} people |url=http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629050035/http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |archive-date=June 29, 2017 |access-date=July 19, 2017 |website=newmexicohistory.org |language=en}}</ref>

A shooting war broke out on Friday, July 19. McSween's supporters gathered inside his house; when Buck Powell and Deputy Sheriff Jack Long set fire to the building, the occupants began shooting. McCarty and the other men fled the building when all rooms but one were burning. During the confusion, Alexander McSween was shot and killed by Robert W. Beckwith, who was then shot and killed by McCarty.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=322–31}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=96–111}}

McCarty and three other survivors of the [[Battle of Lincoln (1878)|Battle of Lincoln]] were near the Mescalero Indian Agency when the agency bookkeeper, Morris Bernstein, was murdered on August 5, 1878. All four were indicted for the murder, despite conflicting evidence that Bernstein had been killed by Constable Atanacio Martinez. All of the indictments, except McCarty's, were later quashed.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=104–05, 107, 110}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|pp=339–40, 342, 445, 514}}

[[File:Gov Lew Wallace in 1893 cropped lightened.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|New Mexico Territorial Governor [[Lew Wallace]] in 1893]]
On October 5, 1878, [[United States Marshal Service|U.S. Marshal]] John Sherman informed newly appointed Territorial Governor and former Union Army general [[Lew Wallace]] that he held warrants for several men, including "William H. Antrim, alias Kid, alias Bonny{{sic}}" but was unable to execute them "owing to the disturbed condition of affairs in that county, resulting from the acts of a desperate class of men."{{sfn|Utley|1987|p=120}} Wallace issued an amnesty proclamation on November 13, 1878, which pardoned anyone involved in the Lincoln County War since Tunstall's murder. It specifically excluded persons who had been convicted of or indicted for a crime, and therefore excluded McCarty.{{sfn|Nolan|2009a|pp=315, 515}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=122–23, 126–28, 141, 150, 154, 156–158}}

On February 18, 1879, McCarty and friend [[Tom O'Folliard]] were in Lincoln and watched as attorney Huston Chapman was shot and his corpse set on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the pair were innocent bystanders forced at gunpoint by [[Jesse Evans]] to witness the murder.{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=132–136, 139, 141, 143–144}}{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=375–76, 378, 516–17}} McCarty wrote to Governor Wallace on March 13, 1879, with an offer to provide information on the Chapman murder in exchange for amnesty. On March 15, Governor Wallace replied, agreeing to a secret meeting to discuss the situation. McCarty met with Wallace in Lincoln on March 17, 1879. During the meeting and in subsequent correspondence, Wallace promised McCarty protection from his enemies and clemency if he would offer his testimony to a [[grand jury]].{{efn|For years Wallace denied that he had agreed to the bargain with McCarty; however, in a newspaper article published in 1902, Wallace changed his story and said he had promised McCarty a pardon in change for the testimony.{{sfn|Cooper|2017|pages=556–61}} }}

On March 20, Wallace wrote to McCarty, "to remove all suspicion of understanding, I think it better to put the arresting party in charge of Sheriff Kimbrell [sic] who shall be instructed to see that no violence is used."{{efn|Letter from Governor Wallace to W.H. Bonney, March 20, 1879.{{sfn| Cooper |2017|pages=563–65}} }} McCarty responded on the same day, agreeing to testify and confirming Wallace's proposal for his arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety.{{sfn|Cooper|2017|p=565}}{{sfn|Boomhower|2005|p=103}} On March 21, McCarty let himself be captured by a posse led by Sheriff George Kimball of Lincoln County.

He walked up to Grant, told him he admired his revolver, and asked to examine it. Grant handed it over. Before returning the pistol, which he noticed contained only three cartridges, McCarty positioned the cylinder so the next hammer fall would land on an empty chamber. Grant suddenly pointed his pistol at McCarty's face and pulled the trigger. When it failed to fire, McCarty drew his own weapon and shot Grant in the head.

In 1880, McCarty formed a friendship with a rancher named Jim Greathouse, who later introduced him to [[Dave Rudabaugh]]. On November 29, 1880, McCarty, Rudabaugh, and [[Billy Wilson (outlaw)|Billy Wilson]] ran from a posse led by sheriff's deputy James Carlysle. Cornered at Greathouse's ranch, McCarty told the posse they were holding Greathouse as a hostage. Carlysle offered to exchange places with Greathouse, and McCarty accepted the offer. Carlysle later attempted to escape by jumping through a window but he was shot three times and killed.<ref name="ODMP2007">{{Cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Deputy Sheriff James Carlysle |url=https://www.odmp.org/officer/2797-deputy-sheriff-james-carlysle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925131942/http://www.odmp.org/officer/2797-deputy-sheriff-james-carlysle |archive-date=25 September 2020 |access-date=19 November 2020 |website=The Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)}}</ref> The shootout ended in a standoff; the posse withdrew and McCarty, Rudabaugh, and Wilson rode away.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=143–46, 179, 204}}{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=398–401}}

A few weeks after the Greathouse incident, McCarty, Rudabaugh, Wilson, O'Folliard, [[Charlie Bowdre]], and [[Tom Pickett (outlaw)|Tom Pickett]] rode into Fort Sumner. Unbeknownst to McCarty and his companions, a posse led by [[Pat Garrett]] was waiting for them.

On December 13, 1880, Governor Wallace posted a $500 bounty for McCarty's capture.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=147}} Pat Garrett continued his search for McCarty; on December 23, following the siege in which Bowdre was killed, Garrett and his posse captured McCarty along with Pickett, Rudabaugh, and Wilson at Stinking Springs. The prisoners, including McCarty, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers.

The following day, an armed mob gathered at the train depot before the prisoners, who were already on board the train with Garrett, departed for Santa Fe.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=240}} Deputy Sheriff Romero, backed by the angry group of men, demanded custody of Dave Rudabaugh, who during an unsuccessful escape attempt on April 5, 1880 shot and killed deputy Antonio Lino Valdez in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Deputy Sheriff Antonio Lino Valdez profile |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/13549-deputy-sheriff-antonio-lino-valdez |access-date=30 December 2019 |website=[[The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc]] |archive-date=November 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127004003/http://www.odmp.org/officer/13549-deputy-sheriff-antonio-lino-valdez |url-status=live }}</ref> Garrett refused to surrender the prisoner, and a tense confrontation ensued until he agreed to let the sheriff and two other men accompany the party to Santa Fe, where they would petition the governor to release Rudabaugh to them.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=126–27}} In a later interview with a reporter, McCarty said he was unafraid during the incident, saying, "if I only had my Winchester I'd lick the whole crowd."{{sfn|Metz|1974|pp=76–85}}{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=157–66}} The ''Las Vegas Gazette'' ran a story from a jailhouse interview following McCarty's capture; when the reporter said Bonney appeared relaxed, he replied, "What's the use of looking on the gloomy side of everything?

Following his sentencing, McCarty was moved to Lincoln, where he was held under guard on the top floor of the town courthouse. On the evening of April 28, 1881, while Garrett was in [[White Oaks, New Mexico|White Oaks]] collecting taxes, Deputy [[Bob Olinger]] took five other prisoners across the street for a meal, leaving James Bell,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.odmp.org/officer/1713-deputy-sheriff-james-w-bell|title=Deputy Sheriff James W.

McCarty asked to be taken outside to use the [[outhouse]] behind the courthouse; on their return to the jail, McCarty—who was walking ahead of Bell up the stairs to his cell—hid around a blind corner, slipped out of his handcuffs, and beat Bell with the loose end of the cuffs. During the ensuing scuffle, McCarty grabbed Bell's revolver and fatally shot him in the back as Bell tried to get away.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=181}}

McCarty, with his legs still shackled, broke into Garrett's office and took a loaded shotgun left behind by Olinger. McCarty waited at the upstairs window for Olinger to respond to the gunshot that killed Bell and called out to him, "Look up, old boy, and see what you get."

Accounts vary as to the course of events. According to the canonical version, as he entered the room, McCarty failed to recognize Garrett due to the poor lighting.

===Dedrick ferrotype===
[[File:Billy the Kid Ferrotype.jpg|thumb|Unretouched original [[ferrotype]] of McCarty, {{circa|1880}}]]
One of the few remaining artifacts of McCarty's life is a {{convert|2|x|3|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[tintype|ferrotype]] photograph of McCarty by an unknown portrait photographer in late 1879 or early 1880. The image shows McCarty wearing a vest over a sweater, a slouch cowboy hat, and a bandana, while holding an [[1873 Winchester]] rifle with its butt resting on the floor. For years, this was the only photograph scholars and historians agreed showed McCarty.<ref name="TWbounty" /> The ferrotype survived because McCarty's friend Dan Dedrick kept it after the outlaw's death. It was passed down through Dedrick's family, and was copied several times, appearing in numerous publications during the 20th century. In June 2011, the original plate was bought at auction for $2.3&nbsp;million by businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|William Koch]].<ref>{{cite news |last1 = Tripp |first1 = Leslie |title = Billy the Kid photograph fetches $2.3 million at auction |url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/26/colorado.billy.the.kid.photo/index.html |publisher = CNN |access-date = July 4, 2015 |date = June 26, 2011 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706031600/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/26/colorado.billy.the.kid.photo/index.html |archive-date = July 6, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="BBCphoto">{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13919013 |title = Billy the Kid portrait fetches $2.3m at Denver auction |publisher = BBC News US & Canada |date = June 26, 2011 |access-date = January 26, 2016 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160229211130/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13919013 |archive-date = February 29, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===Croquet tintype===
[[File:Photo of Billy the Kid (left).JPG|thumb|left|Detail from photograph purporting to show McCarty (left) playing croquet in 1878]]
A {{convert|4|x|6|in|mm|adj=on}} ferrotype purchased at a memorabilia shop in [[Fresno, California]] in 2010 has been claimed to show McCarty and members of the Regulators playing croquet. If authentic, it is the only known photo of Billy the Kid and the Regulators together and the only image to feature their wives and female companions.

Kent Gibson, a forensic video and still image expert, offered the services of his facial recognition software, and stated that McCarty is indeed one of the individuals in the image.<ref name="Constable">{{cite news |first = Anne |last = Constable |title = Billy the Kid: A fan of croquet? |newspaper = [[Santa Fe New Mexican]] |date = August 24, 2015 |url = http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/billy-the-kid-a-fan-of-croquet/article_5a5d7d2c-09e1-58b3-9f2b-dcad9004b1c1.html |access-date = September 23, 2015 |archive-date = May 8, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200508201010/https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/billy-the-kid-a-fan-of-croquet/article_5a5d7d2c-09e1-58b3-9f2b-dcad9004b1c1.html |url-status = live }}</ref>

In August 2015, [[Lincoln State Monument]] officials and the [[New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs]] said that despite the new research, they could not confirm that the image showed McCarty or others from the Lincoln County War era, according to Monument manager Gary Cozzens. A photograph curator at the [[Palace of the Governors]] archives, Daniel Kosharek, said the image is "problematic on a lot of fronts," including the small size of the figures and the lack of resemblance of the background landscape to Lincoln County or the state in general.<ref name="Constable" /> Editors from the ''[[True West Magazine]]'' staff said, "no one in our office thinks this photo is of the Kid [and the Regulators]."<ref name=truewestmag2>{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-experts-weigh-in-on-the-croquet-photo/ |title = Billy the Kid Experts Weigh in on the Croquet Photo |date = October 14, 2015 |access-date = February 3, 2016 |work = [[True West Magazine]] |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301175846/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-experts-weigh-in-on-the-croquet-photo |archive-date = March 1, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

==Posthumous pardon request==
In 2010, New Mexico Governor [[Bill Richardson]] turned down a request for a posthumous pardon of McCarty for the murder of Sheriff William Brady. The pardon considered was to fulfill Governor Lew Wallace's 1879 promise to Bonney. Richardson's decision, citing "historical ambiguity," was announced on December 31, 2010, his last day in office.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/31/new.mexico.billy/index.html |title = No pardon for Billy the Kid |publisher = CNN |access-date = December 31, 2010 |date = December 31, 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024425/http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/31/new.mexico.billy/index.html |archive-date = November 9, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = An Outlaw by Any Name: Billy the Kid |url = https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/billy-the-kid |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = July 14, 2016 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129080342/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/billy-the-kid |archive-date = January 29, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

==Grave markers==
[[File:Billy the Kid Headstone.jpg|thumb|The "PALs" gravemarker for Tom O'Folliard, William H. Bonney, alias Billy the Kid, and Charlie Bowdre, at [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico]]]]
In 1931, Charles{{nbsp}}W.{{nbsp}}Foor, an unofficial tour guide at Fort Sumner Cemetery, campaigned to raise funds for a permanent marker for the graves of McCarty, O'Folliard, and Bowdre. As a result of his efforts, a stone memorial marked with the names of the three men and their death dates beneath the word "Pals" was erected in the center of the burial area.{{sfn|Simmons|2006|pp=161–63}}

[[File:Billy-The-Kid-Individual-Tombstone.jpg|thumb|Grave marker for Billy The Kid, also at Fort Sumner, New Mexico]]
In 1940, stone cutter James N. Warner of [[Salida, Colorado]], made and donated to the cemetery a new marker for Bonney's grave.{{sfn|Simmons|2006|pp=164–65}} It was stolen on February 8, 1981, but recovered days later in [[Huntington Beach, California]].
