At fifteen, she moved to Sydney with her family<ref name="mtv.it"/> and studied ballet, [[Tap dance|tap]] and [[Scottish highland dancing|Highland dancing]], hoping to make a career of it.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Imbruglia appeared in Australian television commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and the Australian snack [[Twisties]]. She left school at the age of sixteen, to pursue acting. She secured a role as [[Beth Brennan]] on the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'' where she shared a house with Ben Mitchell who played the part of Cameron Hudson.<ref>[http://perfectblend.net/features/interview-mitchell.htm Perfect Blend], 6 December 2008.

=== 1997–2000: ''Left of the Middle'' and international breakthrough ===
Imbruglia's first international single, "[[Torn (Natalie Imbruglia song)|Torn]]", was a cover of an [[Ednaswap]] song.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76854/imbruglia-begins-post-torn-career.html |title=Imburglia Begins Post - "Torn" Career |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=8 February 2002 |access-date=16 April 2017}}{{dead link |date=July 2019}}</ref> It reached #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in November 1997,<ref>Roberts, David. Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums.

It sold more than one million copies in the United Kingdom alone. As of 2011, "Torn" was the most played song on Australian radio since 1990, played 300,500 times since 1997, an average of 75 a day, based on data compiled by the Australian Performing Rights Association (APRA).<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/airwaves-torn-up-by-imbruglia/story-e6frfkp9-1225707159167 |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] |location=Sydney | title=Airwaves torn up by Imbruglia |author= | date=3 May 2009  | access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref>

It was released as a radio single in the US, but not on CD. The single was on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 Airplay chart for 14 weeks. At the time, singles not released commercially could not be on the overall Hot 100 chart (combined sales and airplay). By the time the policy changed, "Torn" was heading down the charts, so its peak on the Hot 100 ended at 42. The single also topped the Top 40 Mainstream/CHR Pop and Adult Top 40 charts.

In October 1997, it broke the airplay record in the UK (more than 2000 plays) for six weeks. It was No. 1 for 14 weeks in the UK radio chart, equalled only by [[Simply Red]]'s "Fairground". [[Rick Dees]], in his Top 40 Chart show, named "Torn" as the 'number one radio single of 1990s' in the 2000 Millennium Countdown show broadcast from KIIS-FM on New Year's Eve.

Imbruglia appeared with [[David Armand]] midway through his 'interpretative dance' to sing ''Torn'' at Amnesty International's [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)]].

Imbruglia's debut album ''[[Left of the Middle]]'' was released on 24 November 1997. It sold 350,000 in the UK three weeks after release and was certified platinum. It has sold 7&nbsp;million copies and is the highest selling debut album by a pop/rock/alternative female artist, more than [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Fiona Apple]] and [[Meredith Brooks]] combined in its first week according to Billboard.<ref name="Billboard10">{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&q=Natalie+Imbruglia+units&pg=PA66 |title=Minogue wins battle of Aussie divas |first=Peter |last=Holmes |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=19 January 2002 |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> The second single in the UK after "Torn" was "[[Big Mistake]]", which debuted at #2. "[[Wishing I Was There]]" was less successful, peaking at #19. "Wishing I Was There" on peaked at #2 on UK radio in summer 1998, and in the US peaked at #14 on the Top 40 Show. The final single from ''Left of the Middle'' was "[[Smoke (Natalie Imbruglia song)|Smoke]]", the reception was more divided than previously. It was a hit in the UK and made the top 5, while in Australia it missed the top 40. Eventually, the album became a million-seller after charting well in many countries and entering the Top 10 in the US and UK. In 1999, she recorded a cover of [[Never Tear Us Apart]] by INXS with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] which appeared on his album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]''.

The "Torn" single and the ''Left of the Middle'' album earned Imbruglia six [[ARIA Awards]] in 1998,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1998 |title=History - Winners by Year: 1998 |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |date=20 October 1998 |access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> while the "Wishing I Was There" single and her overall worldwide achievements earned her two more ARIA awards in 1999,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1999 |title=History - Winners by Year: 1999 |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |date=12 October 1999 |access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> an [[MTV Awards|MTV Award]] for Best New Artist in 1998, and three constitutive [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations in 1999. That year, she won two [[Brit Awards]] for Best International Newcomer and Best International Female.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1999 |title=History - Brit Awards 1999 |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |date=16 February 1999 |access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> She was ranked No.&nbsp;11 on Rock of the Net's single artists of the year in 1998, and No.&nbsp;76 in 2001. Imbruglia tied up her four-album deal with BMG after her [[compilation album]], ''[[Glorious: The Singles 97–07]]''.

=== 2001–2004: ''White Lilies Island'' ===
Imbruglia's next album, ''[[White Lilies Island]]'', in 2001, was named after where she lived beside the [[River Thames]] at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Imbruglia co-wrote every track over three years. The album's first single, "[[That Day (Natalie Imbruglia song)|That Day]]", was stylistically different from her singles but did not reach the UK Top 10. In the US, "[[Wrong Impression]]" was the first single and charted in the [[Hot 100 Singles]] and [[adult contemporary]] charts. In the UK it did slightly better than ''That Day''. "[[Beauty on the Fire]]", the final single, barely entered charts worldwide, and did not make the top 50 in Australia. The album, briefly notorious in the [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal]], sold 1&nbsp;million but did not repeat the success of ''[[Left of the Middle]]''.

[[File:Trl 2005 napoli imbruglia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Imbruglia (centre) in [[Naples]], Italy, in 2005]]
Imbruglia's third album was in November 2003. The record label refused to release it due to it being too rock and not radio-friendly{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. She was given songs to record with Swedish pop producers, [[Bloodshy & Avant]], but refused{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. She and the record label separated at the beginning of 2004. Four months later she signed with Brightside Recordings, formed by a former Innocent Records executive, Hugh Goldsmith.
In 2003, she appeared in the spy parody film "[[Johnny English]]," playing Rowan Atkinson's love interest, Laura, in a Bond girl-style fashion.

=== 2005–2008: ''Counting Down the Days'' ===
In April 2005, Imbruglia's third album ''[[Counting Down the Days]]'' had "[[Shiver (Natalie Imbruglia)|Shiver]]" as its first single. "Shiver" became her longest running single in the UK since "Torn." It topped UK airplay charts for several weeks, reaching eighth in the UK. It became the most played song of 2005. ''Counting Down The Days'' became her first album to reach the top spot on the album charts.

"Sanctuary" was the second single from the album and singles sent to radio stations. The decision was later changed to the title track [[Counting Down the Days (song)|"Counting Down the Days"]], with stations asked to play the album version, because the radio mix was not finished. The single on 25 July did not have as much success in the singles chart as "Shiver," although it reignited interest in its album and received airplay in the UK. Due to the single, the album re-entered the top 40 in the UK charts.

Imbruglia made a small European tour (her first since [[Left of the Middle]]) in late October and November. Though the album never entered UK Top 40 again, several concerts sold out; notably London.

The album was the 100th best-selling album in 2005, selling 204,877 copies in the UK .<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1031537 |url-access=subscription |title=This week's sales analysis |work=[[Music Week]] |date=16 September 2007 |access-date=9 January 2011}}</ref>

Imbruglia started on her fourth album in late-2005. In mid-2007 plans changed and her record company released a compilation of Imbruglia's 10 years in music. The only single from the album&nbsp;– "[[Glorious (Natalie Imbruglia song)|Glorious]]" premiered in [[BBC Radio 1]] on the Chris Moyles Show. The Singles Collection debuted at #5 in the UK, including the single "Glorious" as well as a DVD of Imbruglia's videos. The album sold 600,000 copies.
