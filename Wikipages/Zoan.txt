'''Zoan''' or Tso'an (Hebrew: צֹועַן ''Ṣōʕan'') was, according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], a city of Egypt in the eastern [[Nile delta]]. Numbers 13:23 says that it was built seven years after [[Hebron]] was built. Psalm 78:12,43 identifies the "field of Zoan" as where Moses performed miracles before Pharaoh to persuade him to release Israel from his service.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brugsch |first1=Heinrich Karl |title=A history of Egypt under the pharaohs, derived entirely from the monuments : to which is added a memoir on the Exodus of the Israelites and the Egyptian monuments |date=21 May 2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=1108084737 |page=394}}</ref> The city is also mentioned in Isaiah 19:11, [[Isaiah 19:13|13]], [[Isaiah 30:4]] and Ezekiel 30:14. 

The Greek [[Septuagint]] in all of these verses uses the Greek name Τάνις ''Tánis''; both ''Tanis'' and ''Tso'an'' are ultimately derived from the Ancient Egyptian name for [[Tanis]], ''ḏꜥn.t'' (Bohairic Coptic ϫⲁⲛⲓ; Sahidic Coptic ϫⲁⲁⲛⲉ; Modern Arabic صان ''Ṣan''). The mentions in Isaiah and Ezekiel correspond with Tanis.
