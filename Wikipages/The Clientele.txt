'''The Clientele''' is a London-based [[indie pop]] band, formed in 1991. The band is currently composed of lead singer/guitarist Alasdair MacLean, drummer Mark Keen and bassist James Hornsey. Since its inception, the Clientele has released eight full-length albums and five [[Extended play|EPs]].

The band have toured extensively in the United States, where they have experienced more success than in their native Britain. They are currently signed to [[Merge Records]], an independent record label based out of North Carolina.

==History==
MacLean and Hornsey both grew up in [[Hampshire, England]], and began collaborating musically while still in school, after MacLean saw that Hornsey had written the name of the band [[Felt (band)|Felt]] on his pencil case. The band formed in 1991, with Innes Phillips sharing singing and songwriting duties with MacLean; their original name was ''The Butterfly Collectors''. The band recorded an album's worth of material but failed to get any label interest. Innes left the band (and would go on to found The Relict); the rest of the group re-formed in 1997, after which they moved to London and released a number of singles that were eventually collected on ''Suburban Light'' (2000). That compilation won the band glowing reviews; ''[[SF Weekly]]'' said the band "offers a brand of appealingly melancholy pop that might just surpass that of its forebears."<ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2001-04-11/music/music3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127224110/http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2001-04-11/music/music3.html |date=27 January 2005 }}</ref> ''The Violet Hour'' (2003) was their first album proper, which again saw great acclaim, but, as yet, little commercial success.

August 2005 saw the release of their second full album, ''[[Strange Geometry]]'', the first the band recorded with a producer, Brian O'Shaughnessy, who had previously produced [[Primal Scream]]. It was notable for a much cleaner production sound than the reverb-heavy sound that had previously been their defining characteristic; it was also the first time the band had used a strings section on one of their records. The task of writing these arrangements was given to [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]]. One single, "Since K Got Over Me", was released from the album. Another song from the album, "(I Can't Seem) To Make You Mine", was featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Lake House (film)|The Lake House]]''.

''Strange Geometry'' was quickly followed by a collection of recordings from 1991 to 1996, featuring Innes Phillips, called ''It's Art, Dad''. After a U.S. tour in August 2006, The Clientele became a four-piece again, adding Mel Draisey (on violin, keys and percussion), who became their first female member. They then recorded the album ''[[God Save The Clientele]]'' with producer Mark Nevers, known for his work with Merge labelmates [[Lambchop (band)|Lambchop]]; the album again featured several Louis Philippe-composed string arrangements. ''God Save The Clientele'' was released in May 2007 in the United States. ''Bonfires on the Heath'' followed in October 2009, and ''Minotaur'', a Mini-LP, was released on 17 July 2010.

On 6 July 2011, the band announced on its website that The Clientele would be taking an indefinite hiatus. MacLean subsequently spent time on a project called Amor de Días, a collaboration with Spanish vocalist and instrumentalist Lupe Núñez-Fernández (of the indie pop duo Pipas). Amor de Días released two albums between 2011 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17567-the-house-at-sea/|title=Pitchfork review "The House at Sea"; |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2013-01-31 | access-date=2021-05-02}}</ref>

The band announced that it would reunite for a lone gig at [[The Bell House (New York)|The Bell House]] in Brooklyn on 21 March 2014.

Since then, the 'Suburban Light' album has been reissued with bonus tracks and gave the band a Billboard top 30 album for the first time in their history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hangoverloungerecords.bandcamp.com/album/hl007-the-third-hangover-lounge-picture-disc |title=HL007 - the third hangover lounge picture disc &#124; Hangover Lounge Records |publisher=Hangoverloungerecords.bandcamp.com |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> They also released two new singles in 2014, 'Falling Asleep'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Clientele-King-Khan-The-Shrines-Destroyer-Falling-Asleep-Orpheus-Avenue-Know-Your-Product-Te-Recuerd/release/5641572 |title=The Clientele / King Khan & The Shrines* / Destroyer (4) - Falling Asleep / Orpheus Avenue / Know Your Product / Te Recuerdo Amanda (Vinyl) |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> and 'On A Summer Trail'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Clientele-Birdie-The-Third-Hangover-Lounge-Picture-Disc/release/5881705 |title=The Clientele / Birdie (2) - The Third Hangover Lounge Picture Disc (Vinyl) |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> The band have continued to tour in both the US<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/54647-the-clientele-announce-summer-tour/ |title=The Clientele Announce Summer Tour &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2014-04-03 |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> and Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclientele.co.uk/shows/ |title=The Clientele / Shows |publisher=Theclientele.co.uk |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> and MacLean is writing songs which may constitute a forthcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|author=Philip Runco |url=http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interview-the-clientele.htm |title=BYT Interviews The Clientele (2014) - BrightestYoungThings - DC |publisher=BrightestYoungThings |date=2014-07-16 |access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref> On 24 March 2016, the group's official Facebook page posted an image of the mixing board at Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in London, with the implication that the group were recording new material. On 16 June 2017, the band announced a new album, ''Music for the Age of Miracles'', and a tour.

==Style==
Their music has often been noted for its reverb-rich production<ref>[http://www.spin.com/features/ithappenedlastnight/2006/09/060905_clientele/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120258/http://www.spin.com/features/ithappenedlastnight/2006/09/060905_clientele/ |date=29 September 2007 }}</ref> and MacLean's distinctive breathy vocals (an effect achieved partly by MacLean singing with a microphone plugged into a guitar amplifier) and [[fingerstyle]] guitar technique. Their lyrics take a strong inspiration from [[surrealist]] literature and art from the early 20th century; "We Could Walk Together" quotes a line ("like a silver ring thrown into the flood of my heart") from a 1928 poem by French surrealist [[Joë Bousquet]]; in its final two verses, the song "What Goes Up" quotes the poem "Stupidity Street" by [[Ralph Hodgson]] in its entirety. {{cn|date=March 2016}}
