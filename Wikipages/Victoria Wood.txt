'''Victoria Wood''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (19 May 1953&nbsp;– 20 April 2016) was an English [[comedian]], actress, lyricist, singer, [[composer]], [[pianist]], [[screenwriter]], producer and director.

Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions which she performed at the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to activities, attitudes and products that are considered to exemplify Britain. She was noted for her skills in [[observational comedy]] and in [[satire|satirising]] aspects of [[Social class in the United Kingdom|social class]].<ref name="Brandwood">{{cite book |last = Brandwood |first = Neil |title= Victoria Wood&nbsp;– The Biography |edition = 1st |year = 2002 |publisher = Boxtree |location = London |isbn = 1-85227-982-6}}

Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on, and winning, the [[Associated Television|ATV]] talent show ''[[New Faces]]''. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance|BAFTA TV Award]] in 1986 for the sketch series ''[[Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV]]'' (1985–87), and became one of Britain's most popular stand-up comics,<ref name="Brandwood" /> winning a second BAFTA for ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Victoria Wood]]'' (1988). In the 1990s, she wrote and co-starred in the television film ''[[Pat and Margaret]]'' (1994), and the sitcom ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|dinnerladies]]'' (1998–2000), which she also produced.<ref name="thecustard.tv">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecustard.tv/shows/dinnerladies.html |title=The custard.tv guide to... dinnerladies |access-date=2007-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410065003/http://www.thecustard.tv/shows/dinnerladies.html |archive-date=10 April 2008}}</ref> She won two more [[BAFTA TV Awards]], including [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], for her 2006 [[ITV1]] television film, ''[[Housewife, 49]]''.<ref name="Brandwood" /><ref name="Screenonline" /> Her frequent long-term collaborators included [[Julie Walters]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Duncan Preston]], and [[Anne Reid]].<ref name="Brandwood" /> In 2006, Wood came tenth in [[ITV (TV Network)|ITV]]'s poll of the British public's [[TV's 50 Greatest Stars|50 Greatest TV Stars]].

==Early life==
Victoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley Wood, an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his company's Christmas parties, was the author of the musical play "Clogs" based in a Lancashire village in 1887 and also wrote part time for Coronation Street, Northern Drift and others;<ref>{{cite news |last=Iley |first=Chrissy |date=12 June 2011 |title=Victoria Wood interview: 'I fear being my mother'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/actors/victoria-wood-interview-i-fear-being-my-mother/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=20 April 2014 }}</ref> and Ellen "Nellie" Wood (''née'' Mape).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discoveryourancestors.co.uk/articles/a-comedy-heroine-descended-from-a-ww1-hero-6/|title=Sample Articles Archive – Discover Your Ancestors|website=discoveryourancestors.co.uk|access-date=27 May 2019}}</ref> She had three siblings: a brother, [[Chris Foote Wood|Chris]], and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind.<ref name="Whetstone">{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/victoria-woods-supermum-4584918|title=Victoria Wood's supermum|last=Whetstone|first=David|date=11 February 2006|work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]|access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref>

Wood was born in [[Prestwich]] and brought up in nearby [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary School<ref>{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Daniel |date=20 April 2016|title=Comedian Victoria Wood dies, aged 62, after cancer battle |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/14440140.Comedian_Victoria_Wood_dies__aged_62__after_cancer_battle/|newspaper=Bolton News|access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref> and [[Bury Grammar School (Girls)|Bury Grammar School for Girls]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/broadcasters4.html |title= Manchester Stars & Celebrities of Television & Film |encyclopedia= Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopedia & Guide to Greater Manchester |publisher=manchester2002-uk.com |access-date=22 August 2010 }}</ref> where she immediately found herself out of her depth.

{{quote| I was always top of the class, and when I went to [[grammar school]] I could not deal with everyone being as clever... I went under. I was a mess, a bit of a misfit. I didn't have any friends, let alone try to be funny...I didn't do any work, didn't have clean clothes and didn't wash. If I didn't have any money I'd steal from people, and if I hadn't done my homework I'd steal someone else's. I was envious of all the groups: the horsey group, the girls who went out with boys, the clever ones. Looking back, I feel really sorry for that little girl.<ref>''Desert Island Discs'', Radio 4, 24 December 2007</ref>}}

Wood developed [[eating disorder]]s, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/04/20/victoria-wood---obituary/|title=Victoria Wood – obituary|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 April 2016|access-date=27 May 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> She later said of this unhappy time "The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on.

==Career==
===1970s===
Wood began her show business career while an undergraduate, appearing on the TV talent show ''[[New Faces]]'' in 1974.<ref name="Whetstone"/> It led to an appearance in a sketch show featuring the series' winners ''[[The Summer Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/488970|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207205154/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/488970|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 December 2007|title=BFI Film & TV Database on The Summer Show|publisher=BFI|date=29 March 2007}}</ref> A further break came as a novelty act on the [[BBC]]'s consumer affairs programme ''[[That's Life!]]'' in 1976. She had met long-term collaborator [[Julie Walters]] in 1971, when Wood applied to the [[Manchester School of Theatre]], then part of [[Manchester Polytechnic]].<ref name = "WD ITV DFM"/> Coincidentally the pair met again when they appeared in the same theatre revue ''[[In at the Death]]'' in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Wood's first play ''[[Talent (play)|Talent]]'' (in 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role originally written for Walters), for which Wood won an award for the Most Promising New Writer. [[Peter Eckersley (TV producer)|Peter Eckersley]], the head of drama at [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]], saw ''Talent'' and invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time, Julie Walters took the lead role, while Wood reprised her stage role.<ref name="Brandwood" /><ref>{{cite web |last =Duguid |first =Mark |title = Talent (1979) |work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher =British Film Institute |date =July 2003 |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241050/index.html |access-date = 18 October 2007 }}</ref>

===1980–1988===
The success of the television version of ''Talent'' led to Wood writing the follow-up ''[[Nearly a Happy Ending]]''. Shortly afterwards she wrote a third play for Granada, ''[[Happy Since I Met You]]'', again with Walters alongside [[Duncan Preston]] as the male lead. In 1980 she wrote and starred in the stage play ''[[Good Fun]]''.<ref name="Brandwood" />

Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although Wood was unsure of the project: she only agreed to go ahead if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with an obvious title – ''[[Wood and Walters]]'',<ref name = "WD ITV DFM">[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 50: ''What Did ITV Do For Me?'', interview with Victoria Wood (September 2005).</ref> and the pilot episode was recorded. It led to a full series, featuring Duncan Preston and a supporting cast. In the period between the completion of the pilot and the shooting of the series, Eckersley died. Wood credited him with giving her her first big break, and felt that ''Wood and Walters'' suffered due to his death.<ref name = "WD ITV DFM"/> She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, his fill-in, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors.<ref name="Brandwood"/>

Wood appeared as a presenter in [[Yorkshire Television]]'s 1984 schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, ''Insight'', in a remake of the series originally presented by [[Derek Griffiths]]. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4's ''[[Just a Minute]]''.

In October 1983 Wood performed her first solo stand-up show, ''Lucky Bag'', in a five-week run at the King's Head Theatre in Islington. The show transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre for a 12-night run in February 1984. ''Lucky Bag'' went on a short UK tour in November and December 1984 and was also released as a live album recorded at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983.<ref name="Brandwood"/>

Wood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, which promised her more creative control over projects. Later that year her sketch show ''[[Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV]]'' went into production. Wood chose the actors: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Wood's friends [[Celia Imrie]], [[Susie Blake]] and [[Patricia Routledge]] were in the cast. ''As Seen on TV'' featured the ''[[Acorn Antiques]]'' series of sketches, parodying the low-budget soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'', and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. ''Acorn Antiques'' is remembered for characters such as "Mrs Overall" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie's sarcastic tone as "Miss Babs". One of Wood's most popular comic songs,<ref name="Brandwood" /> ''The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's Do It)'', originated on this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of intimate relations), and makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqué activities while avoiding all taboo words.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Victoria

Following the success of the first series of ''[[Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV]]'', Wood went on tour again with ''Lucky Bag'' in March 1985. ''Scene'', a documentary for BBC2 later that year, showed footage of Wood preparing for the tour.

A second series of ''[[Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV]]'' was made in 1986. Before filming began in the summer, Wood went on a short 23 date tour of England and Scotland during March and April. A final 'Special' 40-minute episode of ''As Seen on TV'' was made in 1987 and broadcast later that year.

During autumn 1987 Wood went on the road with what was to be her largest tour yet. The tour included a sell-out two-week run at the [[London Palladium]], and had a second leg in the spring of 1988.

In 1988 she appeared in the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Victoria Wood]]'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. At the time of recording the show she was six months pregnant. The end of 1988 saw the release of her second live performance ''Victoria Wood Live'', recorded at the Brighton Dome.<ref name="Brandwood"/>

===1989–1999===
During this period Wood moved away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a bittersweet flavour. ''[[Victoria Wood (1989 TV series)|Victoria Wood]]'' (six parts, 1989) featured Wood in several individual stories such as "We'd Quite Like To Apologise", set in an airport departure lounge, and "Over to Pam", set around a fictional talk show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241016/index.html |title=Victoria Wood (1989)| work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher= British Film Institute |year=2007}}</ref>

In May 1990, Wood began a large tour of the United Kingdom, which was followed by a ten-week run at the Strand Theatre in London titled ''Victoria Wood Up West''. Wood took the show on the road again during March and April 1991, where it was recorded at the [[Mayflower Theatre]] in Southampton, and later released as ''Victoria Wood Sold Out'' in 1991.<ref name="Brandwood"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7bd1b31f |publisher= [[British Film Institute]] |access-date= 20 April 2016 |title= Victoria Wood Sold Out}}</ref>

In 1991, she appeared on the Comic Relief single performing "The Smile Song", the flipside to "The Stonk" (a record by ITV comedians
[[Gareth Hale]] and [[Norman Pace]] with charity supergroup The Stonkers).<ref>London Records 90 Ltd LON 296/LON 296CD/869 363-2</ref><ref>http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2011/03/hale-and-pace-the-stonk/ {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref><ref name="Mabbett">{{Cite book| publisher = Omnibus| isbn = 0-7119-4109-2| last1 = Miles| first1 = Barry| last2 = Mabbett| first2 = Andy| title = Pink Floyd - The Visual Documentary |year= 1994}}</ref> 
A [[List of number-one singles from the 1990s (UK)#1991|UK number-one single]] for one week on 23 March 1991, the record was the UK's 22nd-best-selling single of the year. However, even though it was a joint-single (with "The Smile Song" credited on the front of the single cover<ref>http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/gallery/collaborations/hale-and-pace-the-stonk.htm {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref> and listed as track 2 on the seven-inch and CD single rather than being a B-side), the UK singles chart compilers (now the Official Charts Company) did not credit her with having number one hit, in a situation similar to the fate of BAD II's "[[Rush (Big Audio Dynamite II song)|Rush]]", the AA-side of the preceding number one, "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]" by [[The Clash]].

She briefly returned to sketches for the 1992 Christmas Day special ''[[Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast]]'', and also branched out into children's animation, voicing all the characters for the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] series ''[[Puppydog Tales]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Puppydog Tales|date=1992-09-17|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1710111/|type=Animation, Family|access-date=2021-09-27}}</ref>

In April 1993, Wood began a seven-month tour of the UK. The 104-date tour broke box office records, including 15 sell out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall, and played to residencies in Sheffield, Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Oxford, Southampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Hull.<ref name="Brandwood"/><ref>Tour dates listed in 1993 and 1994 Tour Programmes.</ref>

The television film ''[[Pat and Margaret]]'' (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy.<ref>{{cite web |last =Duguid |first =Mark |title =Pat and Margaret (1994) |work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher = British Film Institute |date =July 2003 |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1246899/index.html |access-date =18 October 2007}}</ref>

In 1994, Wood starred in the one-off BBC 50-minute programme based on her 1993/94 stage show ''Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home''. The special featured stand-up routines, character monologues and songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17625869.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529073150/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17625869.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 May 2016|title=Television: Behave yourself Parky!|last=Young|first=Graham|date=24 March 2000|work=[[Birmingham Evening Mail]]|access-date=20 April 2016}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref name=bficat>{{cite web |url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/578938/credits.html |publisher= [[British Film Institute]] |access-date= 20 April 2016 |title= Wood, Victoria (1953–)}}</ref> An extended 80 minute version was released on VHS.

Wood set out on a 68-date tour of the UK in May 1996, which played at venues in Leicester, Sheffield, Ipswich, Blackpool, Wolverhampton, Bradford, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Oxford, Southend, Manchester and Cambridge. The tour culminated with another 15 sell-out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall in the autumn. The tour recommenced in April 1997 in Liverpool and then travelled to Australia and New Zealand during the summer. It was later released as ''Victoria Wood Live 1997''.<ref name="Brandwood"/><ref name=bficat/>

In October 1997, Wood released a compilation of 14 of her songs titled ''Victoria Wood, Real Life The Songs''.<ref name="Brandwood"/>

Her first sitcom ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|dinnerladies]]'' (1998), continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.<ref>{{cite web

===2000–2005===
December 2000 saw the Christmas sketch show special ''[[Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings]]'', featuring her regular troupe of actors as well as a string of special guest stars including [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Angela Rippon]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Roger Moore]].

2001 saw Wood embark on her final stand-up tour, ''Victoria Wood at It Again'' but was postponed slightly by Wood having to have an emergency [[hysterectomy]] shortly before the tour was due to begin. She re-wrote the entire first half of the show and incorporated the operation into her act. The 62-date tour included 12 nights at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and had a further 23 dates in 2002.<ref name="Brandwood"/><ref name=bficat/>

During this period, Wood tended to move away from comedy to concentrate on drama. She continued to produce one-off specials including ''Victoria Wood's Sketch Show Story'' (2002) and ''Victoria Wood's Big Fat Documentary'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web |title =Victoria Wood's Sketch Show Story |publisher =Simply Stephanie Beacham |year =2007 |url =http://simplystephaniebeacham.com/SketchShow/sketchshowstory.html |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060321165013/http://simplystephaniebeacham.com/SketchShow/sketchshowstory.html |url-status =dead |archive-date =21 March 2006 |access-date =18 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =Victoria Wood's Big Fat Documentary |publisher =weightlossresources.co.uk |year =2004 |url=http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/bigfatdocumentary.htm |access-date =18 October 2007}}</ref>

Wood wrote her first musical, ''[[Acorn Antiques: The Musical!]]'', which opened in 2005 at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal, Haymarket]], London, for a limited period, directed by [[Trevor Nunn]]. It starred several of the original cast, with [[Sally Ann Triplett]] playing Miss Berta (played in the series by Wood).

===2006–2010===
Wood wrote the one-off [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] serious drama ''[[Housewife, 49]]'' (2006), an adaptation of the diaries of [[Nella Last]], and played the eponymous role of an introverted middle-aged character who discovers new confidence and friendships in Lancashire during the [[Second World War]]. ''Housewife, 49'' was critically acclaimed, and Wood won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for both her acting and writing for this drama; a rare double.<ref>{{cite news |title =Victoria Wood Scoops BAFTA Double |work =BBC News |date =20 May 2007 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6670797.stm |access-date = 18 October 2007 }}</ref> The film also starred [[Stephanie Cole]] and David Threlfall as well as, in a small role, [[Sue Wallace]] with whom Wood had worked before and studied alongside at Birmingham.

In November 2006, Wood directed a revival production of ''Acorn Antiques: The Musical!'' with a new cast.
