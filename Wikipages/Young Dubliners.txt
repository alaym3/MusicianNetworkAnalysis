'''The Young Dubliners''' (sometimes shortened to the '''Young Dubs''') is an Irish rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1988. AllMusic.com states, "Their live shows (have) a jam-like appeal, similar to the vibes of [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]]."<ref name=Wilson>Wilson, MacKenzie. "Young Dubliners bio", Allmusic, accessed December 26, 2008.</ref>

==Origins==
The Young Dubliners were founded in 1988 by Dublin native Keith Roberts and Paul O'Toole. The two had been tweaking some Irish ballads of original music and decided that it was time to put a band together. The band consisted of Roberts, O'Toole and Brendan Holmes (bass), Randy Woolford (electric and acoustic guitar) and Douglas James (drums).<ref name=Wilson/>

''Alive Alive O''' was released on February 10, 1998, and gathered warm reviews. Daily Vault said "(the album) shows that they are not a product of the producer's skills, but instead, can thrive in the challenging live environment."<ref>Bellach, Allison. "Alive Alive'O - The Young Dubliners", The Daily Vault.com, April 8, 1998.</ref>

On July 13, 2013, the band released their ninth album, titled ''9''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youngdubliners.com |title=Celtic Rock and Roll :: |publisher=Young Dubliners |access-date=2014-08-01}}</ref>
