The '''National Collegiate Athletic Association''' ('''NCAA'''){{efn|NCAA is usually pronounced "N C double A", though some pronounce the initialism one letter at a time, "N-C-A-A". However, the organization itself officially pronounces the former.}} is a [[nonprofit organization]] that regulates student athletes from up to 1,268 North American institutions and conferences. It also organizes the [[athletic sports|athletic]] programs of [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and helps over 480,000 college [[student-athlete]]s who compete annually in college sports. The organization is headquartered in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].

In August 1973, the current three-division system of [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer [[scholarship]]s to [[Sportsperson|athletes]] for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. Division I [[College football|football]] was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978. In 2006, Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and [[NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). In its 2016–17 fiscal year, the NCAA took in $1.06&nbsp;billion in revenue, over 82% of which was generated by the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]].

Controversially, the NCAA formerly capped the benefits that collegiate athletes could receive from their schools. The consensus among economists is these caps for men's basketball and football players benefit the athletes' schools (through [[rent-seeking]]) at the expense of the athletes.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson|first1=Allen R.|last2=Siegfried|first2=John J.|date=February 2015|title=The Case for Paying College Athletes|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=29|issue=1|pages=115–138|doi=10.1257/jep.29.1.115|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Garthwaite |first1=Craig |last2=Keener |first2=Jordan |last3=Notowidigdo |first3=Matthew J |last4=Ozminkowski |first4=Nicole F |date=October 2020 |title=Who Profits From Amateurism?

==History==
===Formation and early years===
{{further|List of charter members of the NCAA}}
Intercollegiate sports began in the United States in 1852 when crews from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] universities met in [[Harvard-Yale Regatta|a challenge race]] in the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/06/06/harvard-and-yale-crews-celebrate-boat-race/uFRfgEVkENrWKXAUDoQVPK/story.html |title=Harvard and Yale crews celebrate the 150th Boat Race |author=Michael Whitmer |work=Boston Globe |date=June 6, 2015 |access-date=September 25, 2015}}</ref> As rowing remained the preeminent sport in the country into the late-1800s, many of the initial debates about collegiate athletic eligibility and purpose were settled through organizations like the [[Rowing Association of American Colleges]] and the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]]. As other sports emerged, notably football and basketball, many of these same concepts and standards were adopted. Football, in particular, began to emerge as a marquee sport, but the rules of the game itself were in constant flux and often had to be adapted for each contest.

The NCAA dates its formation to two White House conferences convened by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the early 20th century in response to repeated injuries and deaths in college football which had "prompted many college and universities to discontinue the sport."<ref name="ncaahist"/> Following those White House meetings and the reforms which had resulted, Chancellor [[Henry MacCracken]] of [[New York University]] organized a meeting of 13 colleges and universities to initiate changes in football playing rules; at a follow-on meeting on December 28, 1905, in New York, 62 higher-education institutions became charter members of the '''Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS)'''.<ref name="ncaahist"/> The IAAUS was officially established on March 31, 1906, and took its present name, the NCAA, in 1910.<ref name="ncaahist">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/who+we+are/about+the+ncaa+history |title=About the NCAA History |publisher=NCAA |quote=President Theodore Roosevelt summoned college athletics leaders to two White House conferences to encourage reforms. In early December 1905, Chancellor Henry M. MacCracken of New York University convened a meeting of 13 institutions to initiate changes in football playing rules. At a subsequent meeting on December 28 in New York City, 62 colleges and universities became charter members of the '''Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States''' (IAAUS). The IAAUS officially was constituted March 31, 1906, and took its present name, the NCAA, in 1910. |access-date=August 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807060521/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about%2Bthe%2Bncaa/who%2Bwe%2Bare/about%2Bthe%2Bncaa%2Bhistory |archive-date=August 7, 2011  }}</ref>

For several years, the NCAA was a discussion group and rules-making body, but in 1921, the first NCAA national championship was conducted: the National Collegiate Track and Field Championships. Gradually, more rules committees were formed and more championships were created, including a basketball championship in 1939.<ref name="History">[https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/history NCAA History between 1910 and 1980]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212033410/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/about%2Bthe%2Bncaa/history |date=December 12, 2013 }}</ref>

A series of crises brought the NCAA to a crossroads after World War II. The "Sanity Code" – adopted to establish guidelines for recruiting and financial aid – failed to curb abuses, and the Association needed to find more effective ways to curtail its membership.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sinful Seven: Sci-fi Western Legends of the NCAA|url=https://gumroad.com/l/xwUYa|access-date=August 3, 2020|website=gumroad.com}}</ref> Postseason football games were multiplying with little control, and member schools were increasingly concerned about how the new medium of television would affect football attendance.<ref name="History"/>

The complexity of those problems and the growth in membership and championships demonstrated the need for full-time professional leadership. [[Walter Byers]], previously a part-time executive assistant, was named executive director in 1951, and a national headquarters was established in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in 1952.<ref name="History"/>

Byers wasted no time placing his stamp on the Association. A program to control live television of football games was approved, the annual Convention delegated enforcement powers to the Association's Council, and legislation was adopted governing postseason bowl games.<ref name="History"/>

===1970s–present===
[[File:NCAA 70s logo.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|NCAA logo, 1971–1979]]
As [[college athletics]] grew, the scope of the nation's athletics programs diverged, forcing the NCAA to create a structure that recognized varying levels of emphasis. In 1973, the association's membership was divided into three legislative and competitive divisions – I, II, and III.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Collegiate-Athletic-Association|title=National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{!}} American organization|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref> Five years later in 1978, Division I members voted to create subdivisions I-A and I-AA (renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship Subdivision in 2006) in football.<ref name="History"/>

Until the 1980s, the association did not govern women's athletics. Instead, the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW), with nearly 1,000 member schools, governed women's collegiate sports in the United States. The AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in the early-1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women's championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women's athletics programs under the governance of the NCAA.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grundy|first1=Pamela|first2=Susan|last2=Shackelford|year=2005|title=Shattering the Glass|url=https://archive.org/details/shatteringglassr0000grun|url-access=registration|publisher=The New Press|isbn=978-1-56584-822-1}}</ref> By 1982 all divisions of the NCAA offered national championship events for women's athletics. A year later in 1983, the 75th Convention approved an expansion to plan women's athletic program services and pushed for a women's championship program.<ref name="History"/>

By the 1980s, [[College football on television|televised college football]] had become a larger source of income for the NCAA. <!-- How did this become a source of income for the NCAA? -->In September 1981, the Board of Regents of the [[University of Oklahoma]] and the [[University of Georgia]] Athletic Association filed suit against the NCAA in district court in [[Oklahoma]]. The plaintiffs stated that the NCAA's football television plan constituted price fixing, output restraints, boycott, and monopolizing, all of which were illegal under the [[Sherman Act]]. The NCAA argued that its pro-competitive and non-commercial justifications for the plan – protection of live gate, maintenance of competitive balance among NCAA member institutions, and the creation of a more attractive "product" to compete with other forms of entertainment – combined to make the plan reasonable. In September 1982, the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the plan violated antitrust laws. It enjoined the association from enforcing the contract. The NCAA appealed all the way to the [[United States Supreme Court]], but lost in 1984 in a 7–2 ruling ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=468&invol=85 |title=NCAA v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV.

In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under [[Title IX]] for systematically giving men in graduate school more waivers than a woman to participate in college sports. In ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith]]'', 525 U.S. 459 (1999) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA was not subject to that law, without reviewing the merits of the discrimination claim.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ginsburg, Ruth Bader|title=NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSN. v.

Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a growing trend among NCAA institutions. For example, most German athletes outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many European athletes, the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and athletic career at the same time. Many of these students come to the US with high academic expectations and aspirations.<ref>Benjamin Bendrich: Studentischer Spitzensport zwischen Resignation, Mythos und Aufbruch: eine Studie zur dualen Karriere in Deutschland und den USA.Göttingen: Optimus, 2015. {{ISBN|3-86376-164-2}}</ref>

In 2014, the NCAA set a record high of $989 million in net revenue. Just shy of $1 billion, it is among the highest of all large sports organizations.

===Notable court cases===
* In the late-1940s, there were only two colleges in the country, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] and [[Penn Quakers football|Pennsylvania]], with national TV contracts, a considerable source of revenue. In 1951, the NCAA voted to prohibit any live TV broadcast of college football games during the season. No sooner had the NCAA voted to ban television than public outcry forced it to retreat. Instead, the NCAA voted to restrict the number of televised games for each team to stop the slide in gate attendance. [[University of Pennsylvania]] president [[Harold Stassen]] defied the monopoly and renewed its contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Eventually, Penn dropped its suit when the NCAA, refusing Penn's request that the U.S. Attorney General rule on the legality of the NCAA's restrictive plan,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u240448 |entry=Mason, John H. |encyclopedia=Who's Who |year=2007|title=Mason, John H., (13 June 1875–15 June 1951) }}</ref> threatened to expel the university from the association.

*In 1957, the Colorado Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased Trinidad College football player Ray Herbert Dennison. Despite suffering a lethal concussion injury on the field in a game versus Fort Lewis A&M College, Dennison was not entitled to any compensation because he was not under a contractual obligation to play football. Furthermore, the court stated that the "college did not receive a direct benefit from the activities, since the college was not in the football business and received no benefit from this field of recreation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/supreme-court/1957/18284.html|title=State Compensation Ins.

* In 1977, prompted partly by the Tarkanian Case, the US Congress initiated an investigation into the NCAA.<ref>{{cite report |doi=10.3886/icpsr07818 |title=CBS News/New York Times Polls, 1977-1978 |website=Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research |year=1984 }}</ref> It, combined with Tarkanian's case, forced the NCAA's internal files into the public record.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Political philosophy : what it is and why it matters |year=1953 |last1=Beiner |first1=Ronald|isbn=9781107707115|location=New York, NY|oclc=885338105}}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>
* In 1998, the NCAA settled a $2.5&nbsp;million lawsuit filed by former UNLV basketball coach, [[Jerry Tarkanian]]. Tarkanian sued the NCAA after he was forced to resign from UNLV, where he had been head coach from 1973 to 1992. The suit claimed the agency singled him out, penalizing the university's basketball program three times in that span. Tarkanian said, "They can never, ever, make up for all the pain and agony they caused me. All I can say is that for 25 years they beat the hell out of me". The NCAA said that it regretted the long battle and it now has more understanding of Tarkanian's position and that the case has changed the enforcement process for the better.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ranbaxy agrees to pay $500&nbsp;million drug safety settlement |journal=Reactions Weekly |date=May 25, 2013 |volume=1453 |issue=1 |pages=4 |doi=10.1007/s40278-013-3239-y |s2cid=195088138 }}</ref>
* In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under [[Title IX]] for systematically giving men in graduate school more waivers than a woman to participate in college sports.

* In 2007, the case of ''White et al. v. NCAA, No. CV 06-999-RGK'' (C.D. Cal. September 20, 2006) was brought by former NCAA student-athletes [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]], Brian Pollack, Jovan Harris, and Chris Craig as a class action lawsuit. They argued that the NCAA's current limits on a full scholarship or grant-in-aid was a violation of federal antitrust laws. Their reasoning was that in the absence of such a limit, NCAA member schools would be free to offer any financial aid packages they desired to recruit the student and athlete. The NCAA settled before a ruling by the court, by agreeing to set up the Former Student-Athlete Fund to "assist qualified candidates applying for receipt of career development expenses and/or reimbursement of educational expenses under the terms of the agreement with plaintiffs in a federal antitrust lawsuit."<ref>{{cite report |doi=10.3886/icpsr26801.v2 |title=NCAA Division I Academic Progress Rate, 2011 |website=Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research |year=2010 |last1=Paskus |first1=Thomas }}</ref>
* In 2013, [[Jay Bilas]] claimed that the NCAA was taking advantage of individual players through jersey sales in its store. Specifically, he typed the names of several top college football players, [[Tajh Boyd]], [[Teddy Bridgewater]], [[Jadeveon Clowney]], [[Johnny Manziel]], and [[AJ McCarron]], into the search engine of the NCAA's official online store.

* In March 2014, four players filed a class action [[antitrust]] lawsuit, alleging that the NCAA and its five dominant conferences are an "unlawful cartel".

On September 30, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that limiting compensation to the cost of an athlete's attendance at a university was sufficient. It simultaneously ruled against a federal judge's proposal to pay student athletes $5,000 per year in deferred compensation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3886/icpsr03919 |title=New York Times New York City Poll, September 2003 |website=Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research |year=2004}}</ref>
*In August 2015, the National Labor Relations Board reversed a decision settled in the prior year that classified members of Northwestern University's scholarship football players as employees, thus, granting them the right to collectively bargain for their rights. The unionization efforts were a direct effort led by the College Athletes Player Association and Kain Colter, who operated with the support of the United Steelworkers group.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Strauss|first=Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/sports/ncaafootball/nlrb-says-northwestern-football-players-cannot-unionize.html|title=N.L.R.B.

The NCAA made several improvements to the value of athletic scholarships and the quality of healthcare coverage in response to this movement by the Northwestern football players.<ref name=":2" /> These reforms included guaranteeing the entire four years of scholarship in the event of a career-ending injury, the implementation of “cost of attendance” stipends, the institution of “unlimited” athlete meal plans, and protections for the name, image, and likeness of athletes by third parties such as Electronic Arts.<ref name=":2" />
*In 2018 former [[University of Central Florida|UCF]] kicker [[Donald De La Haye]] filed a lawsuit alleging that the university violated his First Amendment rights when it rescinded his full athletic scholarship over the income De La Haye made from his monetized YouTube channel, which he started before he attended college. [[University of Central Florida|UCF]] argued De La Haye violated the [[NCAA Division I|NCAA]] policy forbidding student-athletes from using their likenesses to make money.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morey|first=Alex|date=July 13, 2018|title=Former University of Central Florida kicker scores courtroom win in YouTube case|url=https://www.thefire.org/former-university-of-central-florida-kicker-scores-courtroom-win-in-youtube-case/|access-date=February 28, 2021|website=FIRE|language=en-US}}</ref> De La Haye ultimately settled with [[University of Central Florida|UCF]] so that he could obtain his degree from the university.
*In June 2021 the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed a ruling that provides for an incremental increase in how college athletes can be compensated. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the court's opinion, which upheld a district court judge's decision that the NCAA was violating antitrust law by placing limits on the education-related benefits that schools can provide to athletes. The decision allows schools to provide their athletes with unlimited compensation as long as it is some way connected to their education. The idea that college athletes should not be paid, a fundamental tenet of the 115-year-old NCAA, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years.

[[File:National Collegiate Athletic Association National Office, Indianapolis, Indiana, 2016.jpg|thumb|National Office, [[Indianapolis]]]]

The modern era of the NCAA began in July 1955 when its executive director, [[Kansas City, Missouri]] native [[Walter Byers]], moved the organization's headquarters from the LaSalle Hotel in [[Chicago]] (where its offices were shared by the headquarters of the [[Big Ten Conference]]) to the Fairfax Building in [[Downtown Kansas City]]. The move was intended to separate the NCAA from the direct influence of any individual conference and keep it centrally located.

The Fairfax was a block from [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]] which had hosted men's basketball Final Four games in 1940, 1941, and 1942. After Byers moved the headquarters to Kansas City, the championships would be held in Municipal Auditorium in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1961, and 1964.

The Fairfax office consisted of three rooms with no air conditioning. Byers' staff consisted of four people: an assistant, two secretaries, and a bookkeeper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/NCAANewsArchive/1973/19730615.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140916223208/http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/NCAANewsArchive/1973/19730615.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 16, 2014 |title=Growth of NCAA Apparent; But Optimism Still Abounds |publisher=NCAA News |date=June 15, 1973 |access-date=November 6, 2009  }}</ref>

In 1964, it moved three blocks away to offices in the [[Midland Theatre]]. In 1973, it moved to [[Shawnee Mission Parkway]] in suburban [[Mission, Kansas]] in a $1.2&nbsp;million building on {{convert|3.4|acre|m2}}. In 1989, it moved {{convert|6|mi}} farther south to [[Overland Park, Kansas]]. The new building was on {{convert|11.35|acre|m2}} and had {{convert|130000|sqft|m2}} of space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/NCAANewsArchive/1988/19880504.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140916223210/http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/NCAANewsArchive/1988/19880504.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 16, 2014|title=NCAA will move in 1989 to Overland Park, Kansas – NCAA News – May 4, 1988}}</ref>

The NCAA was dissatisfied with its [[Johnson County, Kansas]] suburban location, noting that its location on the south edges of the Kansas City suburbs was more than 40 minutes from [[Kansas City International Airport]]. They also noted that the suburban location was not drawing visitors to its new visitors' center.<ref name="allbusiness.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/united-states-indiana/613342-1.html |title=Final Four: Indianapolis competes with Dallas, Denver and Kansas City for the NCAA's new headquarters|work= Indiana Business Magazine |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date=March 1, 1997 |access-date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>

In 1997, it asked for bids for a new headquarters. Various cities competed for a new headquarters with the two finalists being Kansas City and Indianapolis. Kansas City proposed to relocate the NCAA back downtown near the [[Crown Center]] complex and would locate the visitors' center in [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]. However Kansas City's main sports venue [[Kemper Arena]] was nearly 30 years old.<ref name="allbusiness.com"/> Indianapolis argued that it was in fact more central than Kansas City in that two-thirds of the members are east of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name="allbusiness.com"/> The 50,000-seat [[RCA Dome]] far eclipsed the 17,000-seat Kemper Arena. In 1999, the NCAA moved its 300-member staff to its new headquarters in the [[White River State Park]] in a four-story {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on the west edge of downtown [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Adjacent to the headquarters is the {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[NCAA Hall of Champions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.docs.hopeark.com/1999/1999071501ms.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140411013440/http://fs.ncaa.docs.hopeark.com/1999/1999071501ms.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2014 |title=NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis to open July 26 |date=July 15, 1999 |publisher=NCAA }}</ref>

==Structure==
The NCAA's Board of Governors (formerly known as the Executive Committee) is the main body within the NCAA. This body elects the NCAA's president.<ref>[http://onwardstate.com/2010/04/29/ncaa-elects-mark-emmert-as-new-president/ "NCAA Elects Mark Emmert as New President"], April 29, 2010.</ref>

The NCAA's legislative structure is broken down into cabinets and committees, consisting of various representatives of its member schools.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These may be broken down further into sub-committees. The legislation is then passed on to the Management Council, which oversees all the cabinets and committees, and also includes representatives from the schools, such as athletic directors and faculty advisers. Management Council legislation goes on to the Board of Directors, which consists of school presidents, for final approval. The NCAA national office staff provides support, acting as guides, liaisons, researchers, and public and media relations.

The NCAA runs the officiating software company [[ArbiterSports]], based in [[Sandy, Utah]], a joint venture between two subsidiaries of the NCAA, Arbiter LLC and eOfficials LLC. The NCAA's stated objective for the venture is to help improve the fairness, quality, and consistency of officiating across amateur athletics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.docs.hopeark.com/2008/Announcements/20080925_arbiter_eso_officiating_rls.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124350/http://fs.ncaa.docs.hopeark.com/2008/Announcements/20080925_arbiter_eso_officiating_rls.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 13, 2014 |title=NCAA Invests in Largest Officiating Management Organizations in Amateur Sports |publisher=NCAA.org |date=September 25, 2008 |access-date=November 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.mndaily.com/2008/10/12/ncaa-invests-officiating-companies NCAA invests in officiating companies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605013518/http://www.mndaily.com/2008/10/12/ncaa-invests-officiating-companies |date=June 5, 2009 }}</ref>

==Player eligibility==
<!--*** linked from redirect [[NCAA eligibility]] ***-->
To participate in college athletics in their freshman year, the NCAA requires that students meet three criteria: having graduated from high school, be completing the minimum required academic courses, and having qualifying grade-point average (GPA) and SAT or ACT scores.<ref name="hishinuma">Hishinuma and Fremstad, 589–591{{full citation needed|date=August 2011}}</ref>

Hosick, Brutlag, and Sproull in 2012 said, "NCAA members are motivated by the principle that participation in intercollegiate athletics is part of the higher education experience; student-athletes must be students first". 

The 16 academic credits are four courses in English, two courses in math, two classes in social science, two in natural or physical science, and one additional course in English, math, natural or physical science, or another academic course such as a foreign language.<ref>2009–2010 Guide for the College-Bound Athletes</ref>

To meet the requirements for grade point average and SAT scores, the lowest possible GPA a student may be eligible with is a 1.70, as long as they have an SAT score of 1400. The lowest SAT scores a student may be eligible with is 700 as long as they have a GPA of 2.500.<ref name="hishinuma"/>

As of the 2017–18 school year, a high school student may sign a [[National Letter of Intent|letter of intent]] to enter and play football for a Division I or Division II college in either of two periods.{{efn|The NCAA prohibits Division III members from using the National Letter of Intent program, or requiring that prospective athletes sign any pre-enrollment document that is not executed by other prospective students at that institution. The NCAA does allow the signing of a standard, non-binding celebratory form upon the student's acceptance of enrollment, but this signing cannot take place at the institution's campus, and staff members of that school cannot be present at the signing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D319.pdf |title=Bylaw 13.9.1 Letter-of-intent Prohibition |work=2018–19 NCAA Division III Manual |publisher=NCAA |pages=80–81 |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref>}} The first, introduced in 2017–18, is a three-day period in mid-December, coinciding with the first three days of the previously existing signing period for junior college players.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/19339267/collegiate-commissioners-association-approves-early-signing-period-football |title=Collegiate Commissioners Association approves early signing period for football |first=Adam |last=Rittenberg |work=ESPN.com |date=May 8, 2017 |access-date=May 9, 2017}}</ref> The second period, which before 2017 was the only one allowed for signings of high school players, starts on the first Wednesday in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/football/news/story?id=4452768 |title=Football recruiting now a 24/7/365 event |publisher=ESPN |date=October 22, 2010 |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> In August 2011, the NCAA announced plans to raise academic requirements for postseason competition, including its two most prominent competitions, football's now-defunct [[Bowl Championship Series]] (replaced in 2014 by the [[College Football Playoff]]) and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]; the new requirement, which are based on an "[[Academic Progress Rate]]" (APR) that measures retention and graduation rates, and is calculated on a four-year, rolling basis.<ref name="cnn930rate">{{cite web| title=NCAA's stricter academic rules: What does it mean for your team?| publisher=CNN| work=This Just In (blog)| date=August 17, 2011| url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/17/ncaas-stricter-academic-rules-what-does-it-mean-for-your-team/ |first=Ali |last=Elkin |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> The changes raise the rate from 900 to 930, which represents a 50% graduation rate.<ref name="cnn930rate"/>

Student-athletes can accept prize money from tournaments or competitions if they do not exceed the total expenses from the event. During high school, D1 tennis players may take up to $10,000 in total prize money. If the student surpassed the amount of $10,000 of prize money in a calendar year, they would lose eligibility.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Prize Money|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hYxth-mv2t4J:fs.ncaa.org/Docs/eligibility_center/ECMIP/Amateurism_Certification/Prize_Money.pdf+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|access-date=November 11, 2020|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}</ref>

Students are generally allowed to compete athletically for four years. Athletes are allowed to sit out a year while still attending school but not lose a year of eligibility by [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirting]].

==NCAA sponsored sports==
The NCAA currently awards 90 national championships yearly – 46 women's, 41 men's, and coed championships for fencing, rifle, and skiing. Sports sanctioned by the NCAA include the following: [[basketball]], [[baseball]] (men), [[beach volleyball]] (women), [[softball]] (women), [[college football|football]] (men), [[cross country running|cross country]], [[field hockey]] (women), [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]] (women), [[golf]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] (coeducational), [[lacrosse]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[artistic gymnastics|gymnastics]], [[sport rowing|rowing]] (women only), [[volleyball]], [[ice hockey]], [[water polo]], [[shooting sports|rifle]] (coeducational), [[tennis]], [[Alpine skiing|skiing]] (coeducational), [[track and field]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] (men). The newest sport to be officially sanctioned is beach volleyball, which held its first championship in the 2015–16 school year.

The Football Bowl Subdivision of Division I determines its own champion separately from the NCAA via the "College Football Playoff"; this is not an official NCAA championship (see below). The most recently added championship is a single all-divisions championship in women's [[beach volleyball]], which was approved by leaders of all three divisions in late 2014 and early 2015. The [[2016 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship|first championship]] was held in spring 2016.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2015-01-17/ncaa-dii-diii-membership-approves-sand-volleyball-90th-championship |title=NCAA DII, DIII membership approves Sand Volleyball as 90th championship |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |date=January 17, 2015 |access-date=March 23, 2015}}</ref> The NCAA had called the sport "sand volleyball" until June 23, 2015, when it announced that it would use the internationally recognized name of "beach volleyball".<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2015-06-30/ncaas-newest-championship-will-be-called-beach-volleyball |title=NCAA's newest championship will be called beach volleyball |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |date=June 30, 2015 |access-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref>

===Emerging sports for women===
{{Main|NCAA Emerging Sports for Women}}
In addition to the above sports, the NCAA recognizes Emerging Sports for Women. These sports have scholarship limitations for each sport, but do not currently have officially sanctioned NCAA championships. A member institution may use these sports to meet the required level of sports sponsorship for its division. An "Emerging Sport" must gain championship status (minimum 40 varsity programs for team sports, except 28 for Division III) within 10 years, or show steady progress toward that goal to remain on the list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emerging Sports for Women|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/ncaa/NCAA/About+The+NCAA/Diversity+and+Inclusion/Gender+Equity+and+Title+IX/New+Emerging+Sports+for+Women?pageDesign=Printer+Friendly+General+Content+Layout|work=www.ncaa.org|publisher=NCAA|access-date=September 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427161416/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/ncaa/NCAA/About+The+NCAA/Diversity+and+Inclusion/Gender+Equity+and+Title+IX/New+Emerging+Sports+for+Women?pageDesign=Printer+Friendly+General+Content+Layout|archive-date=April 27, 2011}}</ref> Until then, it is under the auspices of the NCAA and its respective institutions. Emerging Sport status allows for competition to include club teams to satisfy the minimum number of competitions bylaw established by the NCAA.

The five sports currently designated as Emerging Sports for Women are:
* [[Acrobatic gymnastics|Acrobatics]] & [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]]
* [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]]
* [[College rugby|Rugby]]
* [[Triathlon]]
* [[Freestyle wrestling|Wrestling]]<!--Women's college wrestling uses freestyle rules, not collegiate rules.-->

==Sports added and dropped==
The popularity of each of these sports programs has changed over time. Between 1988–89 and 2010–11, NCAA schools had net additions of 510 men's teams and 2,703 women's teams.<ref name="ncaapublications.com">{{cite web |title=Student-Athlete Participation 1981-1982–2010-11: NCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report |publisher=NCAA |date=2011 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/PR2012.pdf |access-date=September 17, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The following tables show the changes over time in the number of NCAA schools across all three divisions combined sponsoring each of the men's and women's team sports.

===Men's sports===
The men's sports with the biggest net gains during the 1988/89 to 2010/11 period were indoor track and field, lacrosse, and cross country (each with more than 100 net gains). The men's sports with the biggest losses were wrestling (−104 teams), tennis, and rifle; the men's team sport with the most net losses was water polo.<ref name="ncaapublications.com"/> Other reports show that 355 college wrestling programs have been eliminated since 2000; 212 men's gymnastics programs have been eliminated since 1969 with only 17 programs remaining as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |first=Karen |last=Owoc |title=Title IX and Its Effect on Men's Collegiate Athletics |url=http://usa-sports.org/TitleIX.pdf |access-date=February 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116230304/http://www.usa-sports.org/TitleIX.pdf |archive-date=November 16, 2009}}</ref>

Additionally, eight NCAA sports—all men's sports—were sponsored by fewer Division I schools in 2020 than in 1990, despite the D-I membership having increased by nearly 60 schools during that period. Four of these sports, namely wrestling, swimming & diving, gymnastics, and tennis, lost more than 20 net teams during that timeframe. As a proportion of D-I membership, men's tennis took the greatest hit; 71.5% of D-I members had men's tennis in 2020, compared to 93.2% in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college/2020/06/11/college-sports-program-cuts-ncaa-olympics |title=A Collegiate Model in Crisis: The Crippling Impact of Schools Cutting Sports |first1=Ross |last1=Dellenger |first2=Pat |last2=Forde |author-link2=Pat Forde |work=Sports Illustrated |date=June 11, 2020 |access-date=June 30, 2020}}</ref>

* Equestrian was not a women's varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Equestrian is first listed in the NCAA report in 1988–89 with 41 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.

[[File:NCAA titles.jpg|thumb|NCAA National Championship [[trophy|trophies]], rings, and watches won by [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]] teams]]

===Trophies===
For every NCAA sanctioned sport other than Division I FBS football, the NCAA awards trophies with gold, silver, and bronze plating for the first-, second-, and third-place teams respectively.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} In the case of the NCAA basketball tournaments, both semifinalists who did not make the championship game receive bronze plated trophies for third place (prior to 1982 the teams played a "consolation" game to determine third place).{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Similar trophies are awarded to both semifinalists in the NCAA football tournaments (which are conducted in Division I FCS and both lower divisions), which have never had a third-place game. Winning teams maintain permanent possession of these trophies unless it is later found that they were won via serious rules violations.

Starting with the 2001–02 season, and again in the 2007–08 season, the trophies were changed.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Starting in the 2006 basketball season, teams that make the Final Four in the Division I tournament receive bronze-plated "regional championship" trophies upon winning their Regional Championship which state the region they won and have the Final Four logo. The teams that make the National Championship game receive an additional trophy that is gold-plated for the winner. Starting in the mid-1990s, the National Champions in men's and women's basketball receive an elaborate trophy with a black marble base and crystal "neck" with a removable crystal basketball following the presentation of the standard NCAA Championship trophy.

As of April 18, 2021,<ref>[[List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships]]</ref> [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]], [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]], and [[USC Trojans|Southern California]] (USC) have the most NCAA championships. Stanford has won 128 and UCLA has won 119 NCAA team championships in men's and women's sports, while USC is third with 107.

===Football Bowl Subdivision===
{{main|College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|College Football Playoff}}
The NCAA has never sanctioned an official championship for its highest level of football, now known as [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]]. Instead, several outside bodies award their own titles. The NCAA does not hold a championship tournament or game for Division I FBS football. In the past, teams that placed first in any of a number of season-ending media polls, most notable the [[AP Poll]] of writers and the [[Coaches Poll]], were said to have won the "[[Mythical national championship|national championship]]".

Starting in 2014, the [[College Football Playoff]] – a consortium of the conferences and [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent schools]] that compete in Division I FBS and six [[bowl game]]s – has arranged to place the top four teams (based on a thirteen-member committee that selects and seeds the teams) into two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to compete in the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]], which is not officially sanctioned or recognized by the NCAA. The winner of the game receives a trophy; since the NCAA awards no national championship for Division I FBS football, this trophy does not denote ''NCAA'' as other NCAA college sports national championship trophies do.

==Conferences==
{{See also|List of NCAA conferences|List of college athletic conferences in the United States}}

The NCAA is divided into three levels of conferences, [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]], organized in declining program size, as well as numerous sub-divisions.

==Media==
The NCAA has current media rights contracts with [[CBS Sports]], [[CBS Sports Network]], [[ESPN]], [[ESPN Plus]], [[Turner Sports]] and the Golf Channel for coverage of its 88 championships. According to the official NCAA website,<ref>[https://www.ncaa.com/championshiphub/default.aspx?id=78152 NCAA Broadcast Information – NCAA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305103329/http://www.ncaa.com/championshiphub/default.aspx?id=78152 |date=March 5, 2008 }}</ref> ESPN and its associated networks have rights to 21 championships, CBS to 65, Turner Sports to one and [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC's]] [[Golf Channel]] to two. The following are the most prominent championships and rights holders:
* CBS: Men's basketball ([[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]], [[NCAA March Madness (TV program)|with Turner Sports]], and NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament), track and field, ice hockey (women's division I), golf (Divisions II and III, both genders)
* ESPN: Women's basketball (all divisions), baseball, softball, ice hockey (men's Division I), football (all divisions including Div. I FCS), soccer (Division I for both genders)
* Turner Sports: NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament with CBS
*NBC and Golf Channel: golf (Division I, both genders)

[[Westwood One|WestwoodOne]] has exclusive radio rights to the men's and women's basketball Final Fours to the men's [[College World Series]] (baseball). [[DirecTV]] has an exclusive package expanding CBS' coverage of the men's basketball tournament.

From 1998 to 2013, [[Electronic Arts]] had a license to develop college sports video games with the NCAA's branding, which included its ''[[NCAA Football (video game series)|NCAA Football]]'', ''[[NCAA Basketball series|NCAA Basketball]]'' (formerly ''NCAA March Madness'') and ''[[MVP Baseball series|MVP Baseball]]'' series. The NCAA's licensing was not required to produce the games, as rights to use teams are not licensed through the NCAA, but through entities such as individual schools and the [[Collegiate Licensing Company]]. EA only acquired the license so that it could officially incorporate the Division I Men's Basketball Tournament into its college basketball game series. The NCAA withdrew EA's license due to uncertainties surrounding a series of lawsuits, most notably ''[[O'Bannon v. NCAA]]'', involving the use of player likenesses in college sports video games.<ref name=kotaku-eancaa>{{cite web|title=EA Sports Didn't Need the NCAA's Logo, and Maybe It Didn't Want It|url=http://kotaku.com/ea-sports-didnt-need-the-ncaas-logo-and-maybe-it-did-860124604|work=Kotaku|access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/17/ncaa-will-not-renew-ea-sports-contract|title=NCAA Will Not Renew WA Sports Contract|website=IGN|date=July 17, 2013|access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

==Office of Inclusion==
===Inclusion and Diversity Campaign===
The week-long program took place October 1–5, 2018. The aim was to utilize social media platforms in order to promote diversity and inclusion within intercollegiate athletics. Throughout the NCAA's history, there has been controversy as to the levels of diversity present within intercollegiate athletics, and this campaign is the NCAA's most straightforward approach to combatting these issues.<ref name="Swaim"/>

====NCAA Inclusion Statement====
As a core value, the NCAA believes in and is committed to diversity, inclusion and gender equity among its student-athletes, coaches and administrators. It seeks to establish and maintain an inclusive culture that fosters equitable participation for student-athletes and career opportunities for coaches and administrators from diverse backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion improve the learning environment for all student-athletes and enhance excellence within the Association.<ref name="Swaim"/>

The Office of Inclusion will provide or enable programming and education, which sustains foundations of a diverse and inclusive culture across dimensions of diversity including but not limited to age, race, sex, class, national origin, creed, educational background, religion, gender identity, disability, gender expression, geographical location, income, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation and work experiences.

This statement was adopted by the NCAA Executive Committee in April 2010, and amended by the NCAA Board of Governors in April 2017.<ref name="Swaim"/>

====Gender equity and Title IX====
While no concrete criteria are given as to a state of [[Gender equality|gender equity]] on campuses, an athletics program is considered gender equitable when both women's and men's sports programs reach a consensus.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Sanger|first=Kevin L.|title=Athletic directors, faculty athletic representatives, and women's basketball coaches perceptions of Title IX compliance at NCAA Division III institutions|publisher=Iowa State University|doi=10.31274/rtd-180814-233|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The basis of [[Title IX]], when amended in 1972 to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964 Civil Rights Act]], criminalized discrimination on the basis of sex.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Busch|first=Elizabeth Kaufer|date=May 20, 2018|title=Title IX|doi=10.4324/9781315689760|isbn=9781315689760}}</ref> This plays into intercollegiate athletics in that it helps to maintain gender equity and inclusion in intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA provides many resources to provide information and enforce this amendment.

The NCAA has kept these core values central to its decisions regarding the allocation of championship bids. In April 2016, the Board of Governors announced new requirements for host cities that include protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for all people involved in the event. This decision was prompted by several states passing laws that permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in accordance with religious beliefs.<ref name="Sport, media and mega-events">{{Cite book|title=Sport, media and mega-events|others=Wenner, Lawrence A.,, Billings, Andrew C.|isbn=9781138930384|location=London|oclc=962234703|last1 = Wenner|first1 = Lawrence A.|last2=Billings|first2=Andrew C.|year=2017}}</ref>

====LGBTQ====
The [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] community has been under scrutiny and controversy in the public eye of collegiate athletics, but the NCAA moves to support the inclusion of these groups. The NCAA provides many resources concerning the education of the college community on this topic and policies in order to foster diversity.<ref name="Churchill">{{Cite thesis|last=Churchill|first=Kevin|title=Are Student-Athletes in the NCAA Exploited?|publisher=Carleton University|doi=10.22215/etd/2015-10959|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Title IX protects the [[transgender]] community within intercollegiate athletics and on college campuses. While controversy surrounds the topic, the NCAA's current policy on transgender student-athlete participation is dependent on [[testosterone]] levels. A transgender male student-athlete is not allowed to compete on a male sports team unless they have undergone medical treatment of testosterone for gender transition, and a transgender female student-athlete is not allowed to compete on a women's sports team until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Transgender males are no longer eligible to compete on a women's team, and transgender females are no longer eligible to compete on a men's team without changing it to a mixed team status.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Student-Athlete Gambling: The FCCG, NCAA and NFHS Team Up for Student-Athlete Programming|last=Fowler|first=Pat|date=2007 |website=APA PsycNet Direct |doi = 10.1037/e595762007-009}}</ref>

In 2010, the NCAA Executive Committee announced its support and commitment to diversity, inclusion, and gender equality among its student-athletes, coaches, and administrators. The statement included the NCAA's commitment to ensuring that all students have equal opportunities to achieve their academic goals, and coaches and administrators have equal opportunities for career development in a climate of respect.<ref name="Churchill"/> In 2012, the LGBTQ Subcommittee of the NCAA association-wide Committee on Women's Athletics and the Minority Opportunities and Interests Committee commissioned ''Champions of Respect,'' a document that provides resources and advocacy that promotes inclusion and equality for LGBTQ student-athletes, coaches, administrators and all others associated with intercollegiate athletics''.'' This resource uses guides from the [[Women's Sports Foundation]] It Takes a Team! project for addressing issues related to LGBTQ equality in intercollegiate athletics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Are Student-Athletes in the NCAA Exploited?.|last=D.|first=Churchill, Kevin T.|date=2015|publisher=Carleton University|oclc=1032992240}}</ref> The document provides information on specific issues LGBTQ sportspeople face, similarities and differences of these issues on women's and men's teams, policy recommendations and best practices, and legal resources and court cases.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fil |first1=Walter G. |s2cid=2007443 |title=Whither object orientation?

The NCAA expressed concern over Indiana's [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)|Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] that allows businesses to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. This bill was proposed just before Indianapolis was set to host the 2015 Men's Basketball Final Four tournament.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Robert |title=Indiana's Flawed Religious Freedom Law |journal=Indiana Law Review |date=October 27, 2015 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=37 |doi=10.18060/4806.0060 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The bill clashed with the NCAA core values of inclusion and equality, and forced the NCAA to consider moving events out of Indiana. Under pressure from across the nation and fearing the economic loss of being banned from hosting NCAA events, the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, revised the bill so that businesses could not discriminate based on sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. The NCAA accepted the revised bill and continues to host events in Indiana.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historic Documents of 2015|others=Kerrigan, Heather|isbn=9781506333502|location=Los Angeles|oclc=956376398|last1 = Kerrigan|first1 = Heather|date=July 15, 2016}}</ref> The bill was enacted into law on July 1, 2015.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historic Documents of 2015|others=Kerrigan, Heather|isbn=9781506333502|location=Los Angeles|oclc=956376398|last1 = Kerrigan|first1 = Heather|date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>

On September 12, 2016, the NCAA announced that it would pull all seven planned championship events out of North Carolina for the 2016–2017 academic year.<ref name="Denham 2017 232–246">{{Citation|last=Denham|first=Bryan E.|chapter=The NCAA Basketball Championships|pages=232–246|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315680521|doi=10.4324/9781315680521-16|title=Sport, Media and Mega-Events|year=2017}}</ref> This decision was a response to the state passing the [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act|Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act]] (H.B. 2) on March 23, 2016. This law requires people to use public restrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth and stops cities from passing laws that protect against discrimination towards gay and transgender people.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} The NCAA Board of Governors determined that this law would make ensuring an inclusive atmosphere in the host communities challenging, and relocating these championship events best reflects the association's commitment to maintaining an environment that is consistent with its core values.<ref name="Denham 2017 232–246"/> North Carolina has lost the opportunity to host the 2018 Final Four Tournament which was scheduled to be in Charlotte, but is relocated to San Antonio. If H.B. 2 is not repealed, North Carolina could be barred from bidding for events from 2019 to 2022.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reisyan |first1=Garo D. |title=The Times of Random Leadership Capacity Are over |journal=Leader to Leader |date=March 2017 |volume=2017 |issue=84 |pages=17–23 |doi=10.1002/ltl.20286 }}</ref>

====Race and ethnicity====
Racial/Ethnic minority groups in the NCAA are protected by inclusion and diversity policies put in place to increase sensitivity and awareness to the issues and challenges faced across intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA provides a demographics database that can be openly viewed by the public.<ref name="Swaim"/>

Historically, the NCAA has used its authority in deciding on host cities to promote its core values. The Association also prohibits championship events in states that display the Confederate flag, and at member schools that have abusive or offensive nicknames or mascots based on Native American imagery. Board members wish to ensure that anyone associated with an NCAA championship event will be treated with fairness and respect.<ref name="Sport, media and mega-events"/>

====Student-athletes with disabilities====
The NCAA defines a disability as a current impairment that has a substantial educational impact on a student's academic performance and requires accommodation. Student-Athletes with disabilities are given education accommodations along with an adapted sports model. The NCAA hosts adapted sports championships for both track and field and swimming and diving as of 2015.<ref name="Churchill"/>

====International student athletes====
Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a growing trend among NCAA institutions. For example, most German athletes outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many European athletes, the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and athletic career at the same time. Many of these students come to the US with high academic expectations and aspirations.<ref name="Churchill"/>

==College team name changes==
As of 2018, there has been a continuation of changing school mascots that are said by some to be based on racist or offensive stereotypes. Universities under NCAA policy are under scrutiny for specifically Native American-inspired mascots. While many colleges have changed their mascots, some have gotten legal permission from the tribe represented and will continue to bear the mascot. This [[Native American mascot controversy]] has not been completely settled; however, many issues have been resolved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kevin Bruyneel |s2cid=157543200 |title=Race, Colonialism, and the Politics of Indian Sports Names and Mascots: The Washington Football Team Case |journal=Native American and Indigenous Studies |date=2016 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1 |doi=10.5749/natiindistudj.3.2.0001 }}</ref>

Here is a list of notable colleges that changed Native American mascots and/or nicknames in recent history:

* Stanford – Indians to Cardinals (1972); became Cardinal in 1981
* UMass – Redmen and Redwomen to Minutemen and Minutewomen (1972)
* Dartmouth – Indians to Big Green (1974)
* Siena – Indians to Saints (1988)
* Eastern Michigan – Hurons to Eagles (1991)
* St. John's (NY) – Redmen to Red Storm (1994)
* Marquette – Warriors to Golden Eagles (1994)
* Chattanooga – Moccasins to Mocs, suggestive of mockingbirds (1996)
* Miami (OH) – Redskins to RedHawks (1997)
* Seattle – Chieftains to Redhawks (2000)
*Colgate - Red Raiders to Raiders (2001)
*Quinnipiac - Braves to Bobcats (2002)
* Southeast Missouri State – Indians (men) and Otahkians (women) to Redhawks (2005)
* Louisiana–Monroe – Indians to Warhawks (2006)
* Arkansas State – Indians to Red Wolves (2008)<ref name="Springer Reference">{{Cite book|chapter=Native American Schools|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_70031|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>
* North Dakota – Formally dropped Fighting Sioux in 2012; adopted Fighting Hawks in 2015<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kalita |first1=Deep |last2=Tarnavchyk |first2=Ihor |last3=Sundquist |first3=David |last4=Samanta |first4=Satyabrata |last5=Bahr |first5=James |last6=Shafranska |first6=Oleana |last7=Sibi |first7=Mukund |last8=Chisholm |first8=Bret |title=Novel biobased poly(vinyl ether)s for coating applications |journal=INFORM: International News on Fats, Oils, and Related Materials |date=July 1, 2015 |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=472–475 |doi=10.21748/inform.07.2015.472 }}</ref>

Others:

* Illinois – Removed Chief Illiniwek as official symbol in 2007. Athletics teams are still called Fighting Illini.
* Bradley, Alcorn State – Both schools stopped using Native American mascots but have retained their Braves nickname.
* William & Mary – Adjusted Tribe logo to remove feathers to comply with NCAA. Athletics teams are still called Tribe. (2007)
* Chattanooga – removed the mascot, Chief Moccanooga and the Moccasin Shoe imagery in 1996; Kept the term, "Mocs", but reassigned its representation to the official State Bird.

Of note: Utah (Utes), Central Michigan (Chippewas), Florida State (Seminoles) and Mississippi College (Choctaws) all appealed successfully to the NCAA after being deemed "hostile and offensive." Each cited positive relationships with neighboring tribes in appeal.<ref name="Springer Reference"/> UNC Pembroke (Braves), an institution originally created to educate Native Americans and enjoying close ties to the local Lumbee tribe, was approved to continue the use of native-derived imagery without needing an appeal.

==Rules violations==
{{See also|List of NCAA institutions on probation}}
Member schools pledge to follow the rules promulgated by the NCAA. Creation of a mechanism to enforce the NCAA's legislation occurred in 1952 after careful consideration by the membership.

Allegations of rules violations are referred to the NCAA's enforcement staff, who monitor information about potential violations, investigate and process violations, provide notice of alleged violations, and bring cases before the NCAA's Committees on Infractions.<ref name="infractions">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/infractions-process |title=Infractions Process |publisher=NCAA |access-date=September 17, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> A preliminary investigation is initiated to determine if an official inquiry is warranted and to categorize any resultant violations as secondary or major. If several violations are found, the NCAA may determine that the school as a whole has exhibited a "lack of institutional control." The institution involved is notified promptly and may appear on its own behalf before the NCAA Committee on Infractions.

Findings of the Committee on Infractions and the resultant sanctions in major cases are reported to the institution. Sanctions will generally include having the institution placed on "probation" for a period of time, in addition to other penalties. The institution may appeal the findings or sanctions to an appeals committee. After considering written reports and oral presentations by representatives of the Committee on Infractions and the institution, the committee acts on the appeal. Action may include accepting the infractions committee's findings and penalty, altering either, or making its own findings and imposing an appropriate penalty.<ref name="infractions"/>

In cases of particularly egregious misconduct, the NCAA has the power to ban a school from participating in a particular sport, a penalty is known as the [[Death penalty (NCAA)|"Death Penalty"]]. Since 1985, any school that commits major violations during the probationary period can be banned from the sport involved for up to two years. However, when the NCAA opts not to issue a death penalty for a repeat violation, it must explain why it did not do so. This penalty has only been imposed three times in its modern form, most notably when [[Southern Methodist University]]'s (SMU) football team had its 1987 season canceled due to [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|massive rules violations]] dating back more than a decade. SMU opted not to field a team in 1988 as well due to the aftershocks from the sanctions, and the program has never recovered. The Mustangs did not post a winning season until 1997, did not appear in their next bowl game until 2009,  did not post consecutive winning seasons until 2011 and 2012, and did not return to the national rankings until 2019. The devastating effect the death penalty had on SMU has reportedly made the NCAA skittish about issuing another one. Since the SMU case, there are only three instances where the NCAA has seriously considered imposing it against a Division I school; it imposed it against Division II [[Morehouse College]]'s men's soccer team in 2003 and Division III [[MacMurray College]]'s men's tennis team in 2005. In addition to these cases, the most recent Division I school to be considered was Penn State. This was because of the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Jerry Sandusky Incident]] that consequently almost landed Penn State on the hook for the death penalty. They received a $60&nbsp;million fine, in addition to forfeited seasons and other sanctions as well. The NCAA later reversed itself by restoring all forfeited seasons and overturning the remaining sanctions.

Additionally, in particularly egregious cases of rules violations, coaches, athletic directors, and athletic support staff can be barred from working for any NCAA member school without permission from the NCAA. This procedure is known as a "[[show-cause penalty]]" (not to be confused with an [[order to show cause]] in the legal sense).<ref name="ncaa-baylor-nr">{{cite press release |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/NCAA/Media+and+Events/Press+Room/News+Release+Archive/2005/Infractions/Baylor+University+Former+Basketball+Coaches+Penalized+for+Multiple+Violations+of+NCAA+Rules?pageDesign=Printer+Friendly+News+Release+Detail+Layout |title=Baylor University, Former Basketball Coaches Penalized for Multiple Violations of NCAA Rules |publisher=NCAA |access-date=September 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225214546/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/NCAA/Media%2Band%2BEvents/Press%2BRoom/News%2BRelease%2BArchive/2005/Infractions/Baylor%2BUniversity%2BFormer%2BBasketball%2BCoaches%2BPenalized%2Bfor%2BMultiple%2BViolations%2Bof%2BNCAA%2BRules?pageDesign=Printer+Friendly+News+Release+Detail+Layout |archive-date=December 25, 2008}}</ref> Theoretically, a school can hire someone with a "show cause" on their record during the time the show cause order is in effect only with permission from the NCAA Infractions Committee. The school assumes the risks and stigma of hiring such a person. It may then end up being sanctioned by the NCAA and the Infractions Committee for their choice, possibly losing athletic scholarships, revenue from schools who would not want to compete with that other school, and the ability for their games to be televised, along with restrictions on recruitment and practicing times. As a result, a show-cause order essentially has the effect of [[blackballing]] individuals from being hired for the duration of the order.

One of the most famous scandals in NCAA history involved [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning quarterback Cam Newton of the Auburn Tigers in 2011. As a direct effect of not being compensated for his college athletics, Cam Newton's family sought upwards of 100,000 dollars for him to instead play at Mississippi State. This was revealed days before the conference SEC championship game; however, Cam Newton was later reinstated as there was insufficient evidence against him.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/7190987/auburn-tigers-records-reveal-details-cam-newton-scandal |title = Auburn records reveal details of Newton scandal |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date = November 4, 2011 |access-date=September 17, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Finances==
As a governing body for amateur sports the NCAA is classified as a [[tax-exempt]] [[not-for-profit]] organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/not-for-profit.asp|title=Not For Profit Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last=root|date=May 28, 2010|language=en-US|access-date=August 3, 2016}}</ref> As such, it is not required to pay most taxes on income that for-profit private and public corporations are subject to.

===NCAA expenditures===
According to the NCAA, it receives most of its annual revenue from two sources: Division I Men's Basketball television and marketing rights, and championships ticket sales. According to the NCAA, "that money is distributed in more than a dozen ways – almost all of which directly support NCAA schools, conferences and nearly half a million student-athletes."<ref name="ncaa">[https://www.ncaa.org/about/where-does-money-go NCAA: Where does the money go?]</ref>

In 2017 total NCAA revenues were in excess of $1.06&nbsp;billion.<ref name="si">[https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2018/03/07/ncaa-1-billion-revenue Sports Illustrated: NCAA Reports $1.1 Billion in Revenues]</ref> Division I basketball television and marketing rights generated $821.4&nbsp;million, and "championships ticket sales" totaled $129.4&nbsp;million. Other "smaller streams of revenue, such as membership dues" contributed an unspecified amount.<ref name="ncaa" />

====Expenses by category====
The NCAA provided a breakdown of how those revenues were in turn spent, organizing pay-outs and expenses into some 14 basic categories. By far the largest went to Sports Scholarship and Sponsorship Funds, funding for sports and student scholarships under the Division I Basketball Performance Fund, expenses incurred in producing Division I Championships (including team food, travel, and lodging), the Student Assistance Fund, and Student Athlete Services. Together these top five recipients accounted for 65% of all NCAA expenditures. General and Administrative expenses for running the NCAA day-to-day operations totaled approximately 4% of monies paid out, and other association-wide expenses, including legal services, communications, and business insurance totaled 8%.<ref name=ncaa/>

'''The categories:'''
*'''$210.8M Sport Sponsorship and Scholarship Funds'''
:Distributed to Division I schools to help fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*'''$160.5M Division I Basketball Performance Fund'''
:Distributed to Division I conferences and independent schools based on their performance in the men’s basketball tournament over a six-year rolling period. The money is used to fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*'''$96.7M Division I Championships'''
:Provides college athletes the opportunity to compete for a championship and includes support for team travel, food and lodging.

*'''$82.2M Student Assistance Fund'''
:Distributed to Division I student-athletes for essential needs that arise during their time in college.

*'''$71.8M Student-Athlete Services'''
:Includes funding for catastrophic injury insurance, drug testing, student-athlete leadership programs, postgraduate scholarships and additional Association-wide championships support.

*'''$50.3M Division I Equal Conference Fund'''
:Distributed equally among Division I basketball-playing conferences that meet athletic and academic standards to play in the men's basketball tournament. The money is used to fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*'''$46.7M Academic Enhancement Fund'''
:Distributed to Division I schools to assist with academic programs and services.

*'''$42.3M Division II Allocation'''
:Funds championships, grants and other initiatives for Division II college athletes.

*'''$9.5M Division I Conference Grants'''
:Distributed to Division I conferences for programs that enhance officiating, compliance, minority opportunities and more.

*'''$3.3M Educational Programs'''
:Supports various educational services for members to help prepare student-athletes for life, including the Women Coaches Academy, the Emerging Leaders Seminars and the Pathway Program.

*'''$74.3M Other Association-Wide Expenses'''
:Includes support for Association-wide legal services, communications and business insurance.

*'''$39.7M General and Administrative Expenses'''
:Funds the day-to-day operations of the NCAA national office, including administrative and financial services, information technology and facilities management.

According to the NCAA, the 2017 fiscal year was the first in which its revenues topped $1.0&nbsp;billion. The increase in revenue from 2016 came from hikes in television and marketing fees, plus greater monies generated from championship events and investment income.<ref name=si/>

An [[ESPN]] critique of the organization's 2017 financials indicated some $560.3&nbsp;million of the total $956&nbsp;million paid out went back to its roughly 1,100 member institutions in 24 sports in all three divisions, as well as $200&nbsp;million for a one-time payment the NCAA made to schools to fund additional programs.<ref name=espn>[http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/22678988/ncaa-tops-1-billion-revenue-first NCAA tops $1 billion in revenue]</ref>

The Division I basketball tournament alone generated some $761&nbsp;million, with another $60&nbsp;million in 2016–17 marketing rights. With increases in rights fees it is estimated the basketball tournament will generate some $869&nbsp;million for the 2018 championship.<ref name=espn/>

===Player compensation proposals===
{{See also|National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston|Fair Pay to Play Act}}
The NCAA has limited the amount of compensation that individual players can receive to scholarships equal to school tuition and related expenses. This rule has generated controversy, in light of the large amounts of revenues that schools earn from sports from TV contracts, ticket sales, and licensing and merchandise. Several commentators have discussed whether the NCAA limit on player compensation violates antitrust laws. There is a consensus among economists that the NCAA's compensation caps for men's basketball and football players benefit the athletes' schools (through [[rent-seeking]]) at the expense of the athletes.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/the-ncaa|title=The NCAA|website=www.igmchicago.org|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Economists have subsequently characterized the NCAA as a [[cartel]] and collusive [[monopsony]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Tollison|first=Robert D.|editor2-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Shmanske|editor1-first=Leo H|editor1-last=Kahane|date=April 13, 2012|title=To Be or Not to Be|url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195387773-e-18|access-date=August 17, 2020|website=The Oxford Handbook of Sports Economics|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001|isbn=9780195387773}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Blair|first1=Roger D.|last2=Wang|first2=Wenche|s2cid=158775179|date=March 1, 2018|title=The NCAA Cartel and Antitrust Policy|journal=Review of Industrial Organization|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=351–368|doi=10.1007/s11151-017-9603-y|issn=1573-7160}}</ref>

Pro-rating payouts to Division I basketball players in proportion to the size of revenues its championship tournament generates relative to the NCAA's total annual revenues would be one possible approach, but will open the door to litigation by students and schools adversely affected by such a formula.

According to a national study by the National College Players Association (NCPA) and the Drexel University Sport Management Department, the average FBS “full” athletic scholarship falls short of the full cost of attending each school by an average of $3285 during 2011–12 school year, and leaves the vast majority of full scholarship players living below the federal poverty line.

In 2020, the NCAA Board of Governors announced that they supported rule changes that would permit players to receive athletics-related endorsements from third-parties.<ref>Board of Governors moves toward allowing student-athlete compensation for endorsements and promotions, NCAA (April 29, 2020)([https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/board-governors-moves-toward-allowing-student-athlete-compensation-endorsements-and-promotions])</ref> All divisions were expected to adopt new rules relating to the use of players' names, images, and likenesses before the 2021-2022 academic year begins.

On May 6, 2021, Governor Brian Kemp signed Bill 617 into law, giving collegiate athletes the ability to profit off their Name, Image and Likeness. The [[University of Georgia]] have said they will immediately compensate their student athletes, while [[Georgia Tech]] and [[Georgia State University]] have not set anything yet.<ref>Brian Kemp signs House Bill 617, allowing Georgia’s NCAA athletes to profit off Name, Image and Likeness, The Signal, Andrew Freedman,(May. 6, 2021)([https://georgiastatesignal.com/brian-kemp-signs-house-bill-617-allowing-georgias-collegiate-athletes-to-profit-off-name-image-and-likeness/])</ref>

On June 21, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously in ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston]]'' that the NCAA's restrictions on education-related payments were unlawfully in violation of [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890|Sherman Act]]'s anti-trust and trade regulations.<ref name=directnotyet>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/21/supreme-court-ncaa-antitrust-ruling-495319|title=Supreme Court rules in favor of athletes in NCAA compensation case|first1=Leah|last1=Nylen|publisher=Politico|date=June 21, 2021|accessdate=June 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/politics/ncaa-supreme-court/index.html|title=Supreme Court rules against NCAA, opening door to significant increase in compensation for student athlete|first1=Ariane|last1=de Vogue|first2=Chandelis|last2=Duster|publisher=CNN|date=June 21, 2021|accessdate=June 21, 2021}}</ref> Though this holding did not address restrictions on direct compensation payment to athletes, it also opened the door for the possibly of future court cases concerning this matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/us-supreme-court-rejects-ncaa-defense-athlete-compensation-limits-2021-06-21/|title=In win for athletes, U.S. Supreme Court rejects some NCAA compensation limits|first=Lawrence|last=Hurley|publisher=Reuters|date=June 21, 2021|accessdate=June 21, 2021}}</ref><ref name=directnotyet />

The NCAA announced on July 1, 2021, that as a result of ''O'Bannon'' and numerous state laws giving college players the ability to manage their publicity, the board had agreed to new rules that removed restrictions on college athletes from entering paid endorsements and other sponsorship deals, and from using agents to manage their publicity. Students would still be required to inform the school of all such activities, with the school to make determinations if those activities violate state and local laws.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://apnews.com/article/laws-sports-6fb10bea4176ac6a912138ce7f0a764e | title = NCAA clears way for athlete compensation as state laws loom | first = Schuyler | last = Dixon | date = July 1, 2021 | accessdate = July 1, 2021 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] }}</ref>

On the first day of effect for the NIL rule change (July 1), athletes such as [[D'Eriq King]] (Miami (FL) quarterback), Justyn Ross (Clemson wide receiver), [[Bo Nix]] (Auburn quarterback), Antwan Owen (Jackson State defensive end), [[McKenzie Milton]] (Florida State quarterback), [[Malik Cunningham]] (Louisville Quarterback), [[Michael Penix Jr.]] (Indiana quarterback), [[Spencer Rattler]] (Oklahoma quarterback), Lexi Sun (Nebraska volleyball), [[Paige Bueckers]] (UConn basketball) and twins Hanna & [[Haley Cavinder]] (Fresno State basketball), all signed deals and/or unveiled trademarks to profit off of their names, images, and likenesses. As of day one, LSU gymnast [[Olivia Dunne]] is projected to be the highest earning college athlete of 2021-2022, out of both men's and women's sports.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NCAA NIL tracker: Which college athletes signed endorsement deals on Day 1?|url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/ncaa-name-image-likeness-nil-tracker-college-athletes-signed-endorsement-deals-day-1-antwan-owens-bo-nix-deriq-king|access-date=2021-10-15|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US}}</ref>

The new NiL agreement has given student athletes big time deals and opportunities to put theirselves out there and gain profit using their name, image, and likeness. For example, Ga’Quincy McKinstry, quarterback from Alabama signed a deal with Kool-Aid. Not only can they partner up with companies, student athlete's can get paid for other talents; such as, singing. 

Russel Steinberg in 2021 says, "In addition to his prowess on the football field, where he has a shot at tying the school record for most starts, Marshall’s Will Ulmer is a talented musician who wasn’t able to earn money using his own name — until now. He had been going by “Lucky Bill” to avoid running afoul of NCAA regulations, but now says he is ready to book shows using his real name" (Steinberg 2021).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-23|title=The Most Fascinating NIL Deals in College Sports So Far|url=https://boardroom.tv/most-fascinating-ncaa-nil-deals/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Boardroom|language=en-US}}</ref> The NIL has allowed Ulmer great opportunities to further pursue his football and musician career. 

Some companies have partnered up with multiple athletes and created a team of their own. Degree, the deodorant brand, started a team of 14 student athletes to help promote their brand. Degree calls this team Breaking Limits. "The Unilever-owned antiperspirant brand has committed $5 million over the next five years to inspire people to break limits.The first group of athletes that Degree has selected represent a diverse range of backgrounds regarding race, gender, and sport, and their stories will be unveiled on Instagram. These athletes will also have the chance to participate in events to help their local communities" (Steinberg 2021). <ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-23|title=The Most Fascinating NIL Deals in College Sports So Far|url=https://boardroom.tv/most-fascinating-ncaa-nil-deals/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Boardroom|language=en-US}}</ref>
