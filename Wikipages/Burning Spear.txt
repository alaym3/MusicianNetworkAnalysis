'''Winston Rodney''' [[Order of Distinction|OD]] (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name '''Burning Spear''', is a Jamaican [[roots reggae]] singer-songwriter, vocalist and musician. Burning Spear is a [[Rastafarian movement|Rastafarian]] and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s.<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (2002) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of 70s Music'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|978-1-85227-947-9}}, p. 57</ref><ref>Some sources state 1948 (e.g. Thompson)</ref>

==Early life==
Winston Rodney was born in Saint Ann's Bay, [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|Saint Ann]], Jamaica. As a young man he listened to the R&B, soul and jazz music transmitted by the US radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica. [[Curtis Mayfield]] is cited by Rodney as a major US musical influence along with [[James Brown]].<ref name="NPR">[http://m.npr.org/story/4964910  'Our Music': New Reggae from Burning Spear by Christopher Johnson]{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} NPR Radio Show transcription 19 October 2005.

==Career==
Burning Spear was originally Rodney's group, named after a military award given by [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the first President of an independent [[Kenya]],<ref name="Moskowitz" /> and included bass singer Rupert Willington. The duo auditioned for Dodd in 1969 which led to the release of their debut single "Door Peep" (the session also included [[Cedric Brooks]] on saxophone).<ref name="Thompson" /><ref>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100311/ent/ent2.html Cedric Brooks – Jamaica Gleaner "Saxophonist Cedric Brooks recovering but critical"] Published 11 March 2010. Reporter: Howard Campbell. Retrieved 27 April 2013.</ref> They were then joined by tenor Delroy Hinds. The trio recorded several more singles for Dodd, and two albums, before they moved on to work with [[Jack Ruby (record producer)|Jack Ruby]] in 1975.<ref name="Thompson" /> Their first recording with Ruby, "Marcus Garvey", was intended as an exclusive track for Ruby's [[Ocho Rios]]–based Hi-Power [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]], but was released as a single, giving them an immediate hit, and was followed by "Slavery Days".<ref name="Thompson" /> These recordings featured the backing band The Black Disciples, which included [[Earl "Chinna" Smith]], [[Valentine Chin]], [[Robbie Shakespeare]] and [[Leroy Wallace]].<ref name="Thompson" /> The group worked with Ruby on their third album, ''[[Marcus Garvey (album)|Marcus Garvey]]'' (1975), which was immediately successful and led to a deal with [[Island Records]] to give the album a wider release.<ref name="Thompson" /> Island remixed and altered the speed of some of the tracks, much to the annoyance of fans and the group,<ref name="Greene">Greene, Jo-Ann "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2872/biography|pure_url=yes}} Burning Spear Biography]", [[AllMusic]], Macrovision Corporation</ref> leading Rodney to set up his own Burning Music<ref>correction per discussion with Winston Rodney aka Burning Spear</ref> label for future releases where he would have full control, although further releases followed on Island including ''[[Garvey's Ghost]]'', a [[Dub music|dub]] album, and the ''[[Man in the Hills]]'' album.<ref name="Thompson" /> In late 1976, Rodney split from both Ruby and group members Willington and Hinds, and from that point on used the name Burning Spear for himself alone. ''Dry and Heavy'' followed in 1977, self-produced but still on Island, and with a sizeable following by now in the United Kingdom,<ref name="Greene" /> he performed in London that year with members of [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] acting as his backing band for a sold-out show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], which was recorded and released as the album ''Live!''.<ref name="Thompson" /> Aswad also provided backing on his next studio album, ''[[Social Living]]'' (1978), which also featured [[Sly Dunbar]] and [[Rico Rodriguez (musician)|Rico Rodriguez]].<ref name="Thompson" /> A dub version of the album, ''Living Dub'' (1979), was mixed by [[Sylvan Morris]].<ref name="Thompson" /> His profile was raised further by an appearance in the film ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', performing "Jah no Dead".<ref name="Greene" />

In 1980, Rodney left Island Records and set up the Burning Music Production Company,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burningspear.net/history |title=Official Website |publisher=Burning Spear |access-date=25 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214840/http://www.burningspear.net/history |archive-date=26 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>conversation with Winston Rodney, Spring 2012</ref> which he signed to [[EMI]],<ref name="Greene" /> debuting on the label with ''[[Hail H.I.M.]]'', recorded at Marley's [[Tuff Gong]] studio and co-produced by [[Aston Barrett]].<ref name="Thompson" /> A Sylvan Morris dub version followed in the form of ''Living Dub Volume Two''.<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1982, Rodney signed with [[Heartbeat Records]] with a series of well-received albums following, including the 1985 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated ''Resistance''.<ref name="Thompson" /> He returned to Island in the early 1990s, releasing two albums before rejoining Heartbeat.  This arrangement in which Burning Music Productions delivered completed albums of music to EMI, Island and Heartbeat Records for worldwide distribution lasted for many years. When Heartbeat ceased releasing new material, Burning Music took matters into their own hands and began to release music solely through their own imprint.<ref>confirmation by telephone and email with Sonia and Winston Rodney January 2013.</ref> Albums released by Heartbeat through an agreement with Burning Music include: ''The World Should Know'' (1993), ''Rasta Business'' (1995), ''Appointment with His Majesty'' (1997) and the Grammy award winning ''Calling Rastafari'' (1999) which was the last completed album to be solely pressed by an outside label.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Burning Spear spent decades touring extensively, and several live albums have been issued including ''Burning Spear Live'', ''Live in Paris'', ''Live in South Africa'', ''Live in Vermont'', ''Peace and Love Live'', ''Live at Montreux Jazz Festival'' and ''(A)live 1997''.<ref>conversation with Sonia Rodney January 2013. www.burningspear.net</ref> Touring the world time and time again, the band's live sound matured and grew more sophisticated. While remaining firmly rooted in reggae, accents of free jazz, funk and psychedelic music were increasingly in evidence.<ref>Heselgrave, Douglas  'the burning spear experience' January 2007 CD greatest hits liner notes</ref>

His 1999 album, ''[[Calling Rastafari]]'' brought his first [[Grammy Award]] in 2000,<ref name="Moskowitz">Moskowitz, David V.
