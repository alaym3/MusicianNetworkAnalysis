'''Harold Forster Chapin''' (December 7, 1942 – July 16, 1981) was an American singer-songwriter, [[philanthropist]], and hunger activist best known for his [[folk rock]] and [[pop rock]] songs. He achieved worldwide success in the 1970s. Chapin, a [[Grammy Award]]-winning artist and [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] inductee, has sold over 16 million records worldwide.

Chapin recorded a total of 11 albums from 1972 until his death in 1981. All 14 singles that he released became hits on at least one national music chart.

As a dedicated humanitarian, Chapin fought to end [[world hunger]]. He was a key participant in the creation of the [[Presidential Commission (United States)|Presidential Commission on World Hunger]] in 1977.<ref>Harry Chapin: The Gold Medal Collection, album notes, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]/[[Asylum Records]], 1988.</ref><ref name=obitNYT/> In 1987, Chapin was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for his humanitarian work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Gold Medal Recipients|website=United States House of Representatives|URL=https://history.house.gov/Institution/Gold-Medal/Gold-Medal-Recipients/|access-date=2021-09-11}}</ref>

==Biography==
Harry Forster Chapin was born on December 7, 1942 in New York City, the second of four children, who also included future musicians [[Tom Chapin|Tom]] and [[Steve Chapin|Steve]]. His parents were Jeanne Elspeth (née Burke), daughter of the literary critic [[Kenneth Burke]],<ref>{{cite AV media | title=Harry Chapin Behind the Music | publisher=VH1 | time=4:07 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GgDccwnSg | date=n.d. | medium= Television production}}</ref><ref name="Circle">{{cite web |last1=Grayeb |first1=Mike |last2=McCarty |first2=Linda |title=Reflections From Harry's Mom: An Interview with Elspeth Hart |url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/elspeth.htm |website=Circle! |access-date=September 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105025338/http://rememberingharrychapin.com/circle/winter05/elspeth.htm |archive-date=2005-11-05 |date=Winter 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Jim Chapin]], a legendary percussionist. He had English ancestry. The earliest Chapin to come to America was [[Samuel Chapin]], who was the first [[deacon]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1636. His other great-grandparents on his mother's side had immigrated in the late 19th century. His parents divorced in 1950, with his mother retaining custody of their four sons, as Jim spent much of his time on the road as a drummer for [[Big Band]]-era acts such as [[Woody Herman]]. Chapin's mother married ''[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|Films in Review]]'' magazine editor Henry Hart a few years later.

Chapin's first formal introduction to music was trumpet lessons at The Greenwich House Music School under Mr. Karrasic (sic){{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. Harry's younger brothers Tom and Steve were choirboys at Grace Episcopal Church in Brooklyn Heights, and through them Chapin met [[John Wallace (musician)|"Big" John Wallace]], a baritone with a five-[[octave]] range, who later became his bassist, backing vocalist, and [[Double act|straight man]] onstage. Chapin began performing with his brothers while a teenager, with their father occasionally joining them on drums. Chapin graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] in 1960 and was among the five inductees in the school's Alumni Hall Of Fame for the year 2000. He briefly attended the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and was then an intermittent student at [[Cornell University]] in [[New York State]], but did not complete a degree.

He originally intended to be a documentary film-maker and took a job with The Big Fights, a company run by [[Bill Cayton]] that owned a large library of classic boxing films. Chapin directed ''[[Legendary Champions]]'' in 1968, which was nominated for a documentary [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.elektra.com/news/harry-chapin-biography-50336 |title=Harry Chapin : Biography |website=elektra.com |access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> In 1971, he began focusing on music. With John Wallace, Tim Scott, and Ron Palmer, Chapin started playing in various [[nightclub]]s in New York City.

==Career==
===Early music career (1971–1972)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harry Chapin Sniper and Other Love Songs Photoshoot.jpg|thumb|right|Chapin at a photo-shoot for his 1972 album, Sniper and other Love Songs]] -->
In 1972, there was a bidding war over Chapin between music business heavyweights Clive Davis at Columbia and Jac Holzman at Elektra. Chapin signed a multi-million dollar recording contract with [[Elektra Records]]. The contract was one of the biggest of its time. It granted him free recording time, along with many other perks.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd9PZyV7-HQC | title = Taxi: The Harry Chapin Story; see pages 204–207| isbn = 9780806521916| last1 = Coan| first1 = Peter M.| date = January 2001}}</ref>

The same year, he released his debut album, ''[[Heads & Tales (album)|Heads & Tales]]''. The album was an international success, selling over 1 million units. Its success was due to the top 25 [[Billboard Hot 100]] hit single, "[[Taxi (song)|Taxi]]". The song also became a top 5 hit in Canada. The success of the song in America is credited to American radio personality [[Jim Connors]], who helped promote the song on the radio despite its length, and helped it to stay on the charts for 16 weeks. It became the number one requested song for 10 weeks in a row. The song was performed on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', which received so many calls that Chapin returned the next night. It was the first time in the show's history that a performer had been called back the next night. It was also one of the first performances on [[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]], with [[John Denver]] hosting.

When asked if the song was true, Chapin said "It's emotionally true, if not literally true. I've been in the film business on and off for a lot of years, and wasn't doing well at one point. So I went out and got a hack license for bread, and during the month that I was waiting for it to come through, I heard an old girlfriend of mine had gotten married and instead of becoming an actress she married a rich guy. I envisioned some night I'd be driving a cab in the big city streets and this lady would get in the back, and I'd turn and look at her and she'd look at me and know we both sold out our dreams."<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx31JCWcbr8 |title = Harry Chapin Midnight Special, Taxi; intro|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Billboard ranked "Taxi" as the 85th song of the year. "Taxi" also earned Chapin a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist of the Year.

The follow up album, ''[[Sniper and Other Love Songs]]'', was also released in 1972. The album's title song, "[[Sniper (song)|Sniper]]", is a semi-fictional account of the [[University of Texas tower shooting]]. The single release from the album, "[[Sunday Morning Sunshine]]", charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and became a top 40 on [[Billboard Adult Contemporary]]. The album was less successful than the last, selling 350,000 units. The album also contained the Chapin anthem, "Circle". In 2004, the double album ''Sniper and Other Love Songs and Heads & Tales'' was released. It contained previously unreleased tracks from both albums.

===Career peak (1973–1975)===
In 1973, Chapin released his third album, ''[[Short Stories (Harry Chapin album)|Short Stories]]''. The album sold over 1 million units and produced another international hit, "[[W·O·L·D (song)|W·O·L·D]]", a song about an aging disc jockey who has given up his entire life and family for his career. The song is sung from the point of view of the disc jockey, who is singing to his ex-wife. It was inspired by American radio personality [[Jim Connors]]. Chapin wrote the song when he listened to Connors calling his ex-wife in the [[WMEX (AM)|WMEX]] studio. The song became a top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], a top 10 in Canada, and top 10 and 20 in various other countries. Other notable songs from the album not released as singles are "[[Mr. Tanner]]", "Mail Order Annie", and "They Call Her Easy". The song, "Mr. Tanner", was loosely based on a pair of ''New York Times'' concert reviews of baritone Martin Tubridy&nbsp;– once in 1971<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/28/archives/tubridy-makes-song-debut.html | title = Tubridy Makes Song Debut| newspaper = The New York Times| date = March 28, 1971}}</ref> and once in 1972.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/17/archives/tubridy-a-bassbaritone-performs-in-2d-recital-here.html | title = Tubridy, a Bass‐Baritone, Performs in 2d Recital Here| newspaper = The New York Times| date = February 17, 1972}}</ref>

In 1974, Chapin released his most successful album, ''[[Verities and Balderdash]]''. The album sold 2.5 million units due to the number 1 hit, "[[Cat's in the Cradle]]". The song is about a father who doesn't find time for his son during the boy's childhood; ultimately the son grows up to be just like his father, not making any time for his dad. The song earned Chapin another Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, and he was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. Verities and Balderdash peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard 200]]. The album's follow-up single, "[[I Wanna Learn a Love Song]]", charted at number 7 on [[Billboard Adult Contemporary]]. The song is a true story of how he met his wife, [[Sandra Chapin]]. "[[30,000 Pounds of Bananas]]" was included on the album and became the number one requested song for a few weeks, despite not being released as a single. It is a semi-fictional account of a truck crash that occurred in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], transporting bananas - based loosely on a March 18, 1965 accident involving truck driver Gene Sesky.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11891601/eugene_sesky_35_killed_in_scranton/ | title = Runaway Truck Kills Driver; 16 Persons Hurt| newspaper = The Daily Courier| date = March 19, 1965| page = 17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://wnep.com/2015/03/18/the-banana-truck-crash-50-years-later/ | title = The 'Banana Truck' Crash: 50 Years Later|website=Wnep.com}}</ref> Other notable songs from the album include "Shooting Star", "Halfway to Heaven", and "[[Six String Orchestra]]".

In 1975, Chapin released his fifth album, ''[[Portrait Gallery (album)|Portrait Gallery]]''. The album produced a top 40 [[Billboard Adult Contemporary]] hit, "[[Dreams Go By]]". However, the album was less successful than the last,  selling 350,000 units. In addition, he wrote and performed a Broadway play, ''[[The Night That Made America Famous]]''. The play earned two [[Tony Award]] nominations and two [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations.

===Later years (1976–1981)===
By 1976, Chapin was established as one of the most popular singers of the decade. He released his first live album, ''[[Greatest Stories Live]]''. The album sold 2.1 million units.
However, [[Elektra Records]] underwent a management change and gave almost no promotion for his later albums with Elektra, but they all sold at least 250,000 units each and charted successfully.

By the end of the decade, Chapin concentrated more on touring than producing hit singles, but still released one album a year. He earned an estimated $2,000,000 per year (approximately $11,75 M in 2017) until his death in 1981, making him one of the highest paid artists in the world. His album [[Dance Band on the Titanic]] sold poorly, but was voted Album of the Year by [[The Times]] of London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GgDccwnSg|title=Harry Chapin Behind the Music|access-date=August 19, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In 1980, his recording contract with Elektra expired. He signed a one-album contract with [[Boardwalk Records]], and released his ninth studio album, ''[[Sequel (album)|Sequel]]''. The album has been described as his fastest breaking album. Three singles were released, with all of them becoming hits. The first single, [[Taxi (song)#"Sequel"|"Sequel"]], became a top 25 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The song is a followup to Taxi. The second single, "[[Remember When the Music (song)|Remember When the Music]]", became a top 50 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. The last single, "[[Story of a Life (song)|Story of a Life]]", became a hit on the Bubbling Under chart. The album sold 500,000 units.

==Personal life==
<!-- {{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
 -->Chapin met [[Sandra Chapin]], a New York socialite eight years his senior, in 1966 after she called him asking for music lessons. They married two years later. The story of their meeting and romance is told in his song "I Wanna Learn a Love Song". Chapin wrote several additional songs about her, including "Shooting Star" about their relationship, and "Sandy". He had two children with her, [[Jen Chapin|Jennifer]] and Joshua, and was stepfather to her three children from a previous marriage, Jaime, Jason, and Jonathan.

==Philanthropic work==
Chapin resolved to leave his imprint on Long Island. He envisioned a Long Island where the arts flourished, universities expanded, and humane discourse was the norm. "He thought Long Island represented a remarkable opportunity", said Chapin's widow, Sandy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=More than a Troubadour|journal=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs9chap,0,6013734.story|access-date=January 18, 2008|first=Fred|last=Bruning|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415204306/http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs9chap,0,6013734.story|archive-date=April 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Chapin devoted much time and effort to social activism, including raising money to combat hunger in the United States. His daughter Jen said: "He saw hunger and poverty as an insult to America."<ref name=jeninterview>"[http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/02/20/jen_chapin_shares_her_dads_idealism____but_not_his_voice/ Jen Chapin shares her dad's idealism – but not his voice]", ''Boston Globe'', February 20, 2004</ref> He co-founded the organization [[World Hunger Year]] with radio personality [[Bill Ayres]], before returning to music with ''[[On the Road to Kingdom Come]]''. He also released a book of poetry, ''Looking ... Seeing'', in 1975. More than half of Chapin's concerts were benefit performances (for example, a concert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/54/comments|title=Text of 1977 review of Chapin concert at Landmark Theatre|publisher=Cinematreasures.org|access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref> to help save the [[Landmark Theatre (Syracuse, New York)|Landmark Theatre]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], as well as hunger causes such as food banks), and proceeds from his concert merchandise were used to support World Hunger Year. Among those he helped is filmmaker [[Michael Moore]], who, in 1977, got help funding his Mid-Michigan based independent newspaper startup, ''The Flint Voice'', with Chapin benefit concerts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Story of How Harry Chapin Helped Michael Moore Start 'The Flint Voice' in 1977 (10/21/11)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVAfCMpets&t=230|publisher=[[YouTube]]|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Chapin's social causes at times caused friction among his band members. Chapin donated an estimated third of his paid concerts to charitable causes, often performing alone with his guitar to reduce costs. Mike Rendine accompanied him on bass throughout 1979.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

One report quotes his widow saying soon after his death – "only with slight exaggeration" – that "Harry was supporting 17 relatives, 14 associations, seven foundations, and 82 charities. Harry wasn't interested in saving money. He always said, 'Money is for people,' so he gave it away." Despite his success as a musician, he left little money and it was difficult to maintain the causes for which he raised more than $3 million in the last six years of his life.<ref>{{cite news|last=Diliberto|first=Gioia|title=Harry Chapin's Family Fights to Carry on His Extraordinary Legacy of Compassion|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081662,00.html|access-date=March 3, 2013 |newspaper=People|date=15 March 1982}}</ref> The Harry Chapin Foundation was the result.

== Death ==
[[File:Harrychapingravesite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Gravestone in the Huntington Rural Cemetery, Huntington, New York]]

On the afternoon of July 16, 1981, Chapin was en route on the [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Long Island Expressway]] to perform at a free [[benefit concert]] at [[Eisenhower Park]] in [[East Meadow, New York]] that evening. At 12:27 PM, Chapin was fatally injured in a fiery traffic collision with a [[semi-trailer truck]] outside [[Jericho, New York]]. Passersby managed to help the unconscious Chapin out of his engulfed 1975 [[Volkswagen Golf#A1|Volkswagen Rabbit]] and he was immediately taken by helicopter to the nearby [[Nassau University Medical Center|Nassau County Medical Center]] where he was pronounced dead at 1:05 PM due to [[internal bleeding]].<ref name=obitNYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/17/obituaries/harry-chapin-singer-killed-in-crash.html |title=Harry Chapin, Singer Killed in Crash |first=John |last=Rockwell |date=July 17, 1981 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/07/17/Singer-songwriter-Harry-Chapins-drivers-license-was-revoked-at-the/6052364190400/ |title=Singer-songwriter Harry Chapin's driver's license was revoked at the... |last=Logeman|first=Henry|date=July 17, 1981|publisher=UPI|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>  Chapin's widow Sandy won a $12 million decision in a negligence lawsuit against [[Pathmark|Supermarkets General]], the owners of the truck involved.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19861008&id=yk1OAAAAIBAJ&pg=4236,2334908 |title=Singer Chapin's Widow to Give Lawsuit Funds to Hunger Bsttle |via=Google News Archive Search |website=Wilmington Morning Star |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

Chapin is buried in the Huntington Rural Cemetery in [[Huntington, New York]]. His epitaph is taken from his 1978 song "I Wonder What Would Happen to This World":

{{poemquote|
Oh if a man tried
To take his time on Earth
And prove before he died
What one man's life could be worth
I wonder what would happen 
to this world}}

== Legacy ==
His work on hunger included being widely recognized as a key player in the creation of the Presidential Commission on World Hunger (under 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]]) in 1977 (he was the only member who attended every meeting).<ref>Harry Chapin: The Gold Medal Collection, album notes, Elektra/Asylum Records, 1988.</ref>

He was also the inspiration for the antihunger projects [[USA for Africa]] and [[Hands Across America]], which were organized by [[Ken Kragen]], who had been Chapin's manager at the end of Chapin's career, after Fred Kewley.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Holden| first = Stephen| author-link = Stephen Holden |title = The Pop Life| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = December 2, 1987| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D6113AF931A35751C1A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1}}</ref> Kragen, explaining his work on these benefit events, said, "I felt like Harry had crawled into my body and was making me do it."<ref>{{Cite news| title = Harry Chapin Is Gone, but Friends Carry His Song in Their Hearts| newspaper = [[People (magazine)|People]]| date = December 21, 1987| url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097873,00.html}}</ref>

From around 1975 until the owners changed the format of the station in the late 1990s, [[WNEW-FM]], 102.7, a NYC radio station with the motto, "Where Rock Lives" held an annual "Hungerthon" every Thanksgiving, to benefit Harry Chapin's World Hunger League.  During the 24-hour period of the event,  little to no music was played, with the exception of the iconic "[[Alice's Restaurant]]" by [[Arlo Guthrie]] played at noon and 6 pm.  For the remainder of the day, during every DJ's four-hour show, guests such as Harry himself, other music stars, and experts on hunger brought to the listeners information about the severity of hunger in America, in New York City, and in the [[Tri-State area (New York-New Jersey-Connecticut)|tri-state area]], sometimes in graphic detail. After Harry's death, the "Hungerthon" continued, and at the "U.S. Live Aid" concert in [[Philadelphia]] at [[JFK Stadium]] in 1985, [[Kenny Loggins]] was presented with the first "Harry Chapin Award" for his work for the World Hunger League in fighting hunger in America. Since WNEW-FM changed formats, other New York stations have continued to do fundraisers for the charity.

Chapin had co-operated before his death with the writer of the biography entitled ''Taxi: The Harry Chapin Story'', by Peter M. Coan, released posthumously, from which the family withdrew their support. Some concern existed about the accuracy of the details included in the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The Lakeside Theatre at [[Eisenhower Park]] in [[East Meadow, New York]], was renamed Harry Chapin Lakeside Theatre during a memorial concert held one month after his death, as a tribute to his efforts to combat world hunger. Other Long Island landmarks named in honor of Chapin include a graduate-student apartment complex at [[Stony Brook University]], a theater in [[Heckscher Park (Huntington, New York)|Heckscher Park]] in [[Huntington, New York]], and a [[playground]] at the intersection of Columbia Heights and Middagh Street in [[Brooklyn Heights]].

The village of [[Croton-on-Hudson]], New York, has hosted the Harry Chapin Run Against Hunger, a 10k, 5k, and Fun Run, since 1981.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Harry Chapin Run Against Hunger |url=https://runagainsthunger.com/ |access-date=2020-09-27 |website=Run Against Hunger |language=en-US}}</ref>

On December 7, 1987, on what would have been his 45th birthday, Chapin was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for his campaigning on social issues, particularly his highlighting of hunger around the world and in the United States.

In 1994, admirers of the late singer's passionate fight against hunger re-named the then 11 year old Lee County Food Cooperative (Fort Myers, FL) as the Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida in tribute to Chapin, with the permission of his widow.  Its mission to lead its five-county service area in the fight to end hunger continues to this day.

In 2001, Chapin's "Cat's in the Cradle" was ranked number 186 of 365 on the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]  list of [[Songs of the Century]].

Chapin was inducted into the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] on October 15, 2006.

On September 27, 2011, former U.S. Representative [[Alan Grayson]] wrote an [[article (publishing)|article]] on the internet publication ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' about Chapin's song "What Made America Famous".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/harry-chapin-on-what-made_b_983457.html |title=Harry Chapin on What Made America Famous |author=Alan Grayson|work=Huffington Post |date= September 27, 2011|access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref>

Singer and songwriter Guthrie Thomas has long publicly stated that Chapin's song "Cat's in the Cradle" is one of the most difficult songs to perform, due to Chapin's master guitar playing and his brilliant syncopation of the lyrics, meaning each word must fit perfectly and in time with the playing.  Also, despite seeming social and political differences with Chapin, Dr. [[James Dobson]] often quotes the entirety of "Cat's In The Cradle" to illustrate dynamics of contemporary American families.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okQ-4YOQ4kAC&q=%22harry+chapin%22+%22james+dobson%22&pg=PA8|title=The Jesus Machine: How James Dobson, Focus on the Family, and Evangelical America Are Winning the Culture War|author=Dan Gilgoff|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=[[New York, New York]]|pages=7–8|date=2008-04-29|isbn=9781429917094|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>

A children's picture book was created using the lyrics of "Mr. Tanner" and the illustrations of Bryan Langdo; it was published by Ripple Grove Press in May 2017.

[[Greenwich Entertainment]] released a documentary film titled ''[[Harry Chapin: When in Doubt, Do Something]]''. It was directed Rick Korn and produced by Jason Chapin. The film was released theatrically and through [[virtual cinema]] on October 16, 2020 ([[World Food Day]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martoccio |first=Angie |date=2020-09-16 |title=Billy Joel, DMC, Pat Benatar Appear in Harry Chapin Doc Trailer |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/harry-chapin-doc-trailer-billy-joel-pat-benatar-1060177/ |access-date=2020-09-27 |website=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Family ==
Harry's widow Sandy is now chair of the Harry Chapin Foundation, where she continues to pursue Harry's legacy. His son Josh is involved with the foundation, along with other family members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harrychapinfoundation.org/ |title=The Harry Chapin Foundation|website=Harrychapinfoundation.org |access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref>

Chapin often remarked that he came from an artistic family. His father [[Jim Chapin|Jim]], brothers [[Tom Chapin|Tom]] and Steve, and daughter [[Jen Chapin]] are musicians. His nieces Abigail and Lily Chapin perform under the name the [[Chapin Sisters]]. His paternal grandfather, [[James Ormsbee Chapin]], was an artist who illustrated [[Robert Frost]]'s first two books of poetry; his maternal grandfather was the philosopher and rhetorician [[Kenneth Burke]].<ref name=Circle/>

Harry Chapin's brothers sometimes performed with Harry at various times throughout his career, particularly during live performances. They played with him before his solo career took off, and were credited on the albums ''[[Greatest Stories Live]],'' ''[[Legends of the Lost and Found]],'' and ''Chapin Music!''  Tom and Steve continued to perform together (often with Harry's former bandmates) from time to time after his death.

Country singer [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] is Chapin's [[Cousin chart|fifth cousin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/carpentermc.html |title=Ancestry of Mary Chapin Carpenter |publisher=Wargs.com |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref>
