==Career==
{{Main|Kishore Kumar filmography|List of songs by Kishore Kumar}}

After Ashok Kumar became a star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Bombay (now Mumbai) regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to 'Kishore Kumar' and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at [[Bombay Talkies]], where his brother worked. Music director [[Khemchand Prakash]] gave Kumar a chance to sing "Marne Ki Duayen Kyon Mangu" for the film ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]'' (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career.<ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987">[[Filmfare]] (1–15 November 1987)</ref> In 1949, he settled in Bombay.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kishore Kumar {{!}} Biography, Songs, Movies, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kishore-Kumar|access-date=4 August 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=20 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520044942/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kishore-Kumar|url-status=live}}</ref> 

During the initial stage of his career, Kumar was deeply inspired by singer [[K. L. Saigal]] and imitated his style of singing in some of his early films. He had a great respect for poet and musician [[Rabindranath Tagore]] who influenced him in many ways.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Kishore Kumar Declined A Cover Version Of His Idol KL Saigal's Songs|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/blog/story/why-kishore-kumar-declined-a-cover-version-of-his-idol-kl-saigals-songs/3979|access-date=4 August 2020|website=outlookindia.com/|archive-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026105012/https://www.outlookindia.com/blog/story/why-kishore-kumar-declined-a-cover-version-of-his-idol-kl-saigals-songs/3979|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was an ardent admirer of [[Hollywood]] actor-singer [[Danny Kaye]]. He hung the portraits of all these three personalities at his ''Gouri Kun'' residence and would bow respectfully before them everyday as a rule.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Kishore Kumar|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/71302/kishore-kumar-singer-actor/|publisher=The Better India|access-date=23 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810235557/https://www.thebetterindia.com/71302/kishore-kumar-singer-actor/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In his later career, Kumar was also heavily influenced by playback singer [[Ahmed Rushdi]] and his liking towards Rushdi was to the extent that former paid a tribute at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London to the latter by singing some of his songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legendary singer Ahmed Rushdi|url=http://arynews.tv/en/legendary-singer-ahmed-rushdis-31st-death-anniversary-today/|publisher=[[ARY News]]|access-date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075142/http://arynews.tv/en/legendary-singer-ahmed-rushdis-31st-death-anniversary-today/|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kumar employed [[yodeling]] in many of his songs including; ''Yeh dil na hota bechara'', ''Zindagi ek safar hai suhana'', and ''Chala jata hoon''.  The style eventually became an essential feature of his singing and was inspired by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Tex Morton]].<ref>Pal, Sanchari.

In the movie ''[[Half Ticket]]'', for one of the songs – "Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe" – the music director [[Salil Chowdhary]] had a duet in mind and wanted Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before she could return, Kumar solved the problem by singing both the male and female parts of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out to be fine as he did admirably well singing both in male and female voices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Music director [[S. D. Burman]] is credited with spotting Kumar's talent for singing. During the making of ''Mashaal'' (1950), Burman visited Ashok's house, where he heard Kumar imitating K. L. Saigal. He complimented him and told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal.<ref name="ToI_Avijit_unforgettable"/> Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured [[yodeling]], which he had heard on the records of [[Tex Morton]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].<ref name="Derek2004">{{cite book | author=Derek Bose | title=Kishore Kumar: method in madness | year=2004 | publisher=Rupa & Co. }}</ref>{{rp|60}}S. D. Burman kept making Kishore sing for [[Dev Anand]] from the 50s to the early 70s. S. D.

==Acting Career==

Kumar is said to have been paranoid about not being paid.<ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"/> During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment.<ref name="tribuneindia_kuldip_prankster">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct04/book.htm#2|title=A melancholy but life-long prankster|author=Kuldip Dhiman|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=4 October 1998|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930045854/http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct04/book.htm#2|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied "Aadha paisa to aadha make-up." (Half make-up for half payment).<ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"/> On the sets of ''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 Hindi film)|Bhai Bhai]]'', Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him {{INR}} 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a few paces and said, ''Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya'' (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault.

The film ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) was originally supposed to star Kishore and [[Mehmood Ali]] in the lead.<ref name="hanif_mehmood_moods">{{cite book| last = Zaveri| first = Hanif| title = Mehmood, a Man of Many Moods| year = 2005| publisher = Popular Prakashan| isbn = 81-7991-213-2| page = 133| chapter = A Comedy King and Superstar
}}</ref> [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]], the director of the film, was asked to meet Kishore to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kumar's house he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kumar{{mdash}}himself a [[Bengali people|Bengali]]{{mdash}}had not been paid for a stage show organized by another Bengali man and had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this "Bengali", if he ever visited the house. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well, and new actors ([[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]) were signed up for the film.<ref name="hanif_mehmood_moods"/>

In spite of his "no money, no work" principle, sometimes Kumar recorded free even when the producers were willing to pay. Such films include those produced by [[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Danny Denzongpa]].<ref name="thehindu_kochi_yodeller">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/09/stories/2004090900810300.htm|title=What a yodeller!|author=Suresh Kohli|date=16 September 2004|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628072657/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/09/stories/2004090900810300.htm|archive-date=28 June 2006|work=[[The Hindu]]|url-status=dead}}</ref> On one occasion, Kishore helped actor-turned-producer [[Bipin Gupta]] by giving him {{INR}} 20,000 for the film ''Dal Mein Kala'' (1964). When actor Arun Kumar Mukherjee{{mdash}}one of the first persons to appreciate Kishore's singing talent{{mdash}}died, Kumar regularly sent money to Mukherjee's family in Bhagalpur.<ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/>

Many journalists and writers have written about Kumar's seemingly eccentric behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/feb/18dinesh.htm|title=Kishore Kumar: The Master's Voice|work=[[Rediff.com]]|author=[[Dinesh Raheja]]|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214703/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/feb/18dinesh.htm|archive-date=29 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct09/art-trib.htm|title=Life is a lovely journey|author=O.P.

Once, producer-director [[H. S. Rawail]], who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked "Didn't you see the sign?". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly.<ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/> According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director [[G. P. Sippy]]. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to [[Madh Island]] where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined [[Madh Fort]]. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiafm.com/features/2007/02/01/2191/index.html |title=One evening with Kishore Kumar Khandwewala |publisher=India FM |date=1 February 2007 |access-date=13 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224435/http://www.indiafm.com/features/2007/02/01/2191/index.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

Once, a producer went to court to get a decree that Kumar must follow the director's orders. As a consequence, he obeyed the director to the letter. He refused to alight from his car until the director ordered him to do so. After filming a car scene in Bombay, Kumar drove until he reached [[Khandala]] because the director forgot to say "Cut".<ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/> In the 1960s, a financier named Kalidas Batvabbal, who was disgusted with Kumar's alleged lack of cooperation during the shooting of ''[[Half Ticket]]'', reported to the income tax authorities, who raided his house. Later, Kumar invited Batvabbal to his home, asked him to enter a cupboard for a chat and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him, "Don't ever come to my house again".<ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/>

Kumar was a loner; in a 1985 interview with [[Pritish Nandy]] he said that he had no friends{{mdash}}he preferred talking to his trees instead.<ref>{{cite news | title = I screamed, pretended to be crazy: Kishore Kumar in 1985 | year = 1985 | url = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/I-screamed-pretended-to-be-crazy-Kishore-Kumar-in-1985/articleshow/9527820.cms | access-date = 23 August 2011 | publisher = [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]] (republished in The Times of India) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809154235/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/I-screamed-pretended-to-be-crazy-Kishore-Kumar-in-1985/articleshow/9527820.cms | archive-date = 9 August 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref> Once, when a reporter made a comment about how lonely he must be, Kumar took her to his garden, named some of the trees there and introduced them to the reporter as his closest friends.<ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/>
