On June 25, 2007, Wehbe survived an accident while filming a music video for the song "[[Hasa Ma Bena]]" in [[Lebanon]]. In the video, a single engine airplane was to chase Wehbe as she drove a car.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Allegations of racism===
In 2009, the [[lyrics]] "Where is my teddy bear and the Nubian monkey?" in Wehbe's song "Baba Fein" (from her unreleased 2010 kids' album) seemed to refer to [[Nubians]] as "monkeys".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/17/nubian-fury-haifa-wehbe |work=The Guardian |location= London |title=Nubian fury at 'monkey' lyric of Arab pop star Haifa Wehbe | first=Jack |last=Shenker |date=November 17, 2009 |access-date= May 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/6597012/Singer-Haifa-Wehbe-offends-with-Nubian-monkeys-lyric.html |location= London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title= Singer Haifa Wehbe offends with 'Nubian monkeys' lyric |date= November 18, 2009}}</ref> Nubians in Egypt accused the artist of racism and singing a song that fueled racism and discrimination against them.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/people/lebanese-divas-lyrics-hit-sour-note-20091120-iquv.html |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |title= Lebanese diva's lyrics hit sour note |first=Jack |last=Shenker |date= November 21, 2009}}</ref>

===Algeria===
Another incident occurred after the [[2009 Egypt–Algeria World Cup dispute]], adding to the diplomatic tension between the two countries. Wehbe went on to make statements that she would not be performing in [[Algeria]] anytime soon, because Algerians "...wouldn't understand her music". Algeria's cultural minister responded by stating that Wehbe would be banned from performing in Algeria for insulting Algeria and the Algerian people regardless of whether she apologizes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173422/http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/interviews/45716.html لخضر بن تركي للشروق :مهرجانات الجزائر مستمرة بدونكم.. وهيفاء وهبي لن ترى الجزائر حتى إن تابت]. echoroukonline.com (December 17, 2009)</ref>

===Revealing dress===
In November 2014, Wehbe caused controversy and was later heavily criticized, when she wore a revealing dress during a live episode of ''[[Star Academy (Arabia)|Arab Star Academy]]''. She later apologized and blamed the stage lighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30104554|title=#BBCtrending: The dress that shocked the Arab world|website=BBC|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

===Fan base including LGBT community===
In January 2012, Wehbe tweeted that she loves all her fans including her "gay fan base".<ref>{{cite tweet |user=haifawehbe |title=Of course i do. I love all my fans & dont know discrimination.

==Political views==
During the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 Israel–Lebanon War]], she left her home, in Verdun, [[Beirut]] and moved to [[Egypt]] for the duration of the conflict.<ref name="Casbah"/> In a concert in the Lebanese town of [[Jounieh]], Wehbe congratulated Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] for his stand against Israel during the war.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web |title= Hezbollah chief wins unlikely fan in pop diva |url= http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/10/31/10078726.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302021224/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/10/31/10078726.html |archive-date= March 2, 2008}}</ref>

Wehbe also refused to perform at any concert during the 34 days of the war, including fundraisers, saying that there were more ways than one to show support for Lebanon.<ref name="Reuters"/>

==Image==
Wehbe was ranked 8th in the 2006 Edition of the Top 99 Most Desirable Women by the website [[AskMen.com]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090225132323/http://www.askmen.com/specials/2006_top_99/haifa-wehbe-49.html Haifa Wehbe]. Askmen.com.</ref>

Some in the more conservative Arab countries deem her revealing outfits as scandalous. One Bahraini member of parliament called her a sexual singer who spoke with her body, not her voice. Wehbe said she was aware of the efforts to ban her from performing at the concert but had chosen to ignore their attempts to silence her.

In April 2008, the [[Islamic]]-dominated parliament of [[Bahrain]] passed a motion urging the government to ban Haifa Wehbe's show in the country.<ref name="Bahrain">Harrison, Frances (30 April 2008). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7376167.stm Lebanese singer causes Gulf storm]".
