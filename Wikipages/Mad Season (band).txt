'''Mad Season''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Barbara|title=Mad Season: Above|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/madseason/albums/album/302265/review/5941176/above|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=May 12, 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080926212453/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/madseason/albums/album/302265/review/5941176/above|archive-date=September 26, 2008|url-status=dead|date=February 2, 1998}}</ref> formed in 1994 as a side project of members of other bands in the [[Seattle]] [[grunge]] scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/mad-season-above-anniversary/|title=21 Years Ago: Grunge Supergroup Mad Season Release 'Above'|website=Diffuser.fm|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004133336/http://diffuser.fm/mad-season-above-anniversary/|archive-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band's principal members included guitarist [[Mike McCready]] of [[Pearl Jam]], lead singer [[Layne Staley]] of [[Alice in Chains]], drummer [[Barrett Martin]] of [[Screaming Trees]], and bassist [[John Baker Saunders]]. Mad Season released only one album, ''[[Above (Mad Season album)|Above]]'', in March 1995. Its first single, "[[River of Deceit]]", was a radio success, and ''Above'' was certified a gold record by the [[RIAA]] in June.

The band went on a semi-permanent hiatus in 1996 due to the band members' conflicting schedules and Staley's problems with substance abuse. Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group without Staley, and material for a follow-up release to ''Above'' had been worked on; however, the band dissolved following the death of bassist [[John Baker Saunders]] in 1999 from a drug overdose. Staley also died of a drug overdose three years later. Martin and McCready have since made two short partial reunions, one in 2012 and one from 2014 to 2015. A special edition box set containing a remastered edition of ''Above'' and various unreleased material was released in March 2013.

==History==

===Career beginnings (1994-1995)===
During the production of 1994's ''[[Vitalogy]]'', [[Pearl Jam]] guitarist [[Mike McCready]] went into drug and alcohol rehab at the [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden Clinic]] in [[Minnesota]], where he met bassist [[John Baker Saunders]].<ref name="Gilbert">Gilbert, Jeff. [http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/gw04951.shtml "Alive-Pearl Jam's Mike McCready Says Goodbye to Drugs and Alcohol and is a Better Man For it"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024747/http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/gw04951.shtml |date=July 20, 2011 }}. ''[[Guitar World]]''. April 1995.</ref> In 1994, when the two returned to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], they formed a side band with drummer [[Barrett Martin]]. McCready played in bands such as [[Pearl Jam]] and [[Temple of the Dog]], Martin with [[Skin Yard]] and the [[Screaming Trees]] and Saunders with blues talents such as Little Pat Rushing, [[Hubert Sumlin]], Sammy Fender, and [[The Lamont Cranston Band]].<ref name="Prato">Prato, Greg. "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p141703|pure_url=yes}} Mad Season]". [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on June 13, 2005.</ref> Immediately the trio set up rehearsal time together and wrote the music for two songs that would later become Mad Season's "Wake Up" and "[[River of Deceit]]", both of which would later appear on the band's album ''[[Above (Mad Season album)|Above]]''. McCready then brought in friend and [[Alice in Chains]] frontman [[Layne Staley]] to round out the line-up. McCready had hoped that being around [[Sobriety|sober]] musicians would push Staley to get himself sober.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Charles R. |last=Cross |author-link=Charles R. Cross |title=The Last Days of Layne Staley |url=http://rollinpapers.blogspot.com/2006/01/layne-links.html |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 1, 2002 |access-date=2007-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402123922/http://rollinpapers.blogspot.com/2006/01/layne-links.html |archive-date=April 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Despite not having a single song completely prepared (only beginnings of songs, according to Martin) and not even having a name for the band, McCready scheduled an unannounced show at the [[Crocodile Cafe]] on October 12, 1994, which turned out to be a big success.<ref name="Gilbert"/> The song "Artificial Red", which was also to appear on the album, actually came together during the show itself. Two more gigs were scheduled (November 6 & 20, 1994) at the same venue,<ref name="chronology">{{cite web|url=http://www.giventowail.com/mike/wenis.php |title=The Mike McCready Concert Chronology |access-date=2008-10-22 |publisher=giventowail.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221215027/http://www.giventowail.com/mike/wenis.php |archive-date=2008-12-21 }}</ref> with the band calling itself The Gacy Bunch, after both the notorious serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]] of [[Chicago]] and the 1970s [[sitcom]] [[The Brady Bunch]].<ref name="Prato"/> On January 8, 1995, the band made an appearance on Pearl Jam's ''Self-Pollution'' satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it,<ref>Gaar, Gillian G. "Radio Free Vedder". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. February 23, 1995.</ref> performing "Lifeless Dead" and "I Don't Know Anything".<ref name="chronology"/>

===''Above'' (1995)===
After gaining more popularity, the band recorded its only album and changed its name to Mad Season, which is an English term for the time of the year when [[psilocybin mushrooms]] are in full bloom,<ref name="Prato"/> and a term which McCready related to "the seasons of drinking and drug abuse."<ref name="Gilbert"/> The album, ''[[Above (Mad Season album)|Above]]'', which was recorded in Seattle, Washington at [[Bad Animals Studio]] (co-owned by [[Ann Wilson|Ann]] and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]]) and co-produced by the band and Pearl Jam sound engineer Brett Eliason, featured ten songs. It also included guest vocals and additional lyrics by [[Screaming Trees]] frontman and solo artist [[Mark Lanegan]]. McCready said, "We did all the Mad Season music in about seven days. It took Layne just a few more days to finish his vocals, which was intense since we only rehearsed twice and did four shows."<ref name="Gilbert"/> The album was released on March 14, 1995 through [[Columbia Records]] to critical and commercial success. Over the course of 1995, ''Above'' scaled the ''Billboard'' 200, eventually peaking at No.&nbsp;24 and spawning two singles: "River of Deceit" (#2 Mainstream Rock Tracks, No.&nbsp;9 Modern Rock Tracks) and "I Don't Know Anything" (#20 Mainstream Rock Tracks). ''Above'' was certified gold on June 14, 1995.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=mad+season&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=May 12, 2018|date=June 14, 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220055941/http://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Mad+Season&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Dormancy, Disinformation, and dissolution (1996-1999)===
The band continued to play shows during the spring of 1995 before going on hiatus so that the members could return to work with their main bands.<ref name="chronology"/> During this time the band released the ''[[Live at the Moore]]'' [[concert film]], which was a live performance recorded at Seattle's [[Moore Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Moore Theatre]] on April 29, 1995. Also, during this time the band contributed a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier Mama|I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier]]" to the 1995 John Lennon tribute album, ''[[Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon|Working Class Hero]]''. In 1996, a live version of "River of Deceit" surfaced on the ''Bite Back: Live at Crocodile Cafe'' compilation album, although by this time Mad Season had long been dormant from live work as McCready and Martin went back to work with their respective bands and Saunders joined [[The Walkabouts]].<ref name="McCready">{{cite news|author1=McCready, Mike|author-link1=Mike McCready|title=Mike McCready Remembers Seattle Bassist, John Baker Saunders, 1954-1999|work=[[The Rocket (newspaper)|The Rocket]]|date=January 27, 1999}}</ref>

In 1997, attempts were made by McCready, Saunders and Martin to revive Mad Season,<ref name=mtv-saunders /> although by this point Staley's health had worsened due to severe drug addiction; he would never perform again after a July 1996 Alice in Chains show.<ref name="lastdays">{{cite news |first=Charles R. |last=Cross |author-link=Charles R. Cross |title=The Last Days of Layne Staley |url=http://rollinpapers.blogspot.com/2006/01/layne-links.html |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 6, 2002 |number=897 |page=21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419095219/http://rollinpapers.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/layne-links.html |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 26, 2009 }}</ref> As a result, Mad Season was without a singer. With Staley now out of the picture, the band recruited vocalist Mark Lanegan (of the Screaming Trees), who had previously guested on the ''Above'' album (as well as at live shows) as its new permanent singer. With the switch in frontmen the group also switched names adopting the Disinformation moniker in late 1997.<ref name=mtv-saunders>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431539/19990119/mad_season.jhtml |title=Mad Season Bassist Baker Saunders Dies |access-date=2008-11-01 |publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]] |date=1999-01-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040809024426/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431539/19990119/mad_season.jhtml |archive-date=August 9, 2004 }}</ref>

Work reportedly began in 1998 on what would have been Disinformation's debut album, although between everyone's busy schedules, it became difficult to meet in the studio together. Over the course of the year the quartet gradually grew apart, making a Disinformation album all the more unlikely. Another critical blow was dealt to the project in January 1999 with the death of bassist John Baker Saunders from an overdose of [[heroin]]. The group (especially Saunders' long-time friend Mike McCready) was deeply saddened to hear news of his death.<ref name="McCready" /> Although no official announcement by the band was ever given, Staley confirmed in July 1999 (during an Alice in Chains interview) that the group had disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8w-r7ApfW0|title=Alice In Chains-Interview on RockLine 1999|last=Wickedlala- laynestaleyfans|date=13 March 2012|access-date=18 May 2017|via=YouTube|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Post-breakup===
Following Saunders' death, McCready returned to working and touring with Pearl Jam and also later formed a new side project, [[The Rockfords]].<ref name="mccready-amg">{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Mike McCready|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mike-mccready-mn0000491447/biography|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=May 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231070152/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mike-mccready-mn0000491447/biography|archive-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> Martin briefly returned to work with Screaming Trees before the band disbanded in 2000. Since then Martin has worked as an occasional touring drummer for [[R.E.M.]] and performs with R.E.M guitarist Peter Buck in the band [[Tuatara (band)|Tuatara]]. Staley briefly reunited with Alice in Chains in the late 1990s before dropping out of the public eye permanently. His body was later found on April 19, 2002 in his condominium, the victim of an apparent overdose of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] about two weeks prior.<ref>D'Angelo, Joe.

===Partial reunion===
On May 23, 2012, the surviving members of Mad Season (Mike McCready and Barrett Martin) reunited at the Showbox Theatre in Seattle for Mike's annual benefit concert for [[Crohn's disease]]. They were joined by [[Loaded (band)|Loaded]] singer Jeff Rouse and The Rockfords bassist Rick Friel.<ref name="cornell-mckagan">{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Gregory |title=Chris Cornell and Duff McKagan Join Mad Season for Reunion Show |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/chris_cornell_duff_mckagan_join_mad_season_for_reunion_show |website=[[Exclaim!]] |access-date=September 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503192203/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/chris_cornell_duff_mckagan_join_mad_season_for_reunion_show |archive-date=May 3, 2016 |date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>

In 2012 Barrett Martin, Mike McCready and Duff McKagan, along with singer [[Jeff Angell]] and keyboardist [[Benjamin Anderson]] collaborated on an album called ''[[Walking Papers (album)|Walking Papers]]''. Spurred by this collaboration, Martin, McCready and McKagan revisited the unreleased Mad Season material.  In July 2012, Barrett Martin confirmed that Mark Lanegan would be singing several songs on a new Mad Season release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillacandy.com/2012/07/23/new-mad-season-album-to-feature-mark-lanegan/|title=New Mad Season album to feature Mark Lanegan|first=Travis|last=Hay|date=23 July 2012|access-date=18 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527111023/http://www.guerrillacandy.com/2012/07/23/new-mad-season-album-to-feature-mark-lanegan/|archive-date=May 27, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Seattle Supergroup Walking Papers: Duff N' McCready N' Screaming Trees Jam|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/seattle-supergroup-walking-papers-duff-n-mccready-n-screaming-trees-jam/|work=[[Grantland]]|author=Steven Hyden|date=2012-08-13|access-date=2012-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301143412/http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/seattle-supergroup-walking-papers-duff-n-mccready-n-screaming-trees-jam/|archive-date=March 1, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 2012, Barrett Martin announced a Mad Season box set:

{{quote|To honor our departed brothers, Mike [McCready] and I oversaw a Mad Season box set, which comes out March 12th, 2013. It contains the re-mastered ''Above'' album, the Moore concert on DVD with surround sound, and a bunch of live recordings that we never released. The most exciting stuff: three songs that Mark Lanegan wrote lyrics and sang on, songs we started to record for the second album but never finished because of Baker's and Layne's deaths. One of the songs Peter Buck wrote with us, and the other two are from me and Mike. They are three of the heaviest and most beautiful songs Mad Season did, and I know Layne and Baker will love them.<ref name="The Sun Break">{{cite web|url=http://thesunbreak.com/2012/10/04/seattle-rock-veterans-present-their-walking-papers-part-2/|title=Seattle Rock Veterans Present their Walking Papers (Part 2)|date=4 October 2012|access-date=18 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023214744/http://thesunbreak.com/2012/10/04/seattle-rock-veterans-present-their-walking-papers-part-2/|archive-date=October 23, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> }}

Staley is credited for writing all the lyrics on the original release within the liner notes of the 2013 deluxe issue. As was the case with much of his work with Alice in Chains, Staley's lyrics dealt with his struggle against addiction as well as other personal troubles. Lyrically, much of "River of Deceit" was inspired by Khalil Gibran's ''The Prophet''. Vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] of Screaming Trees contributes guest vocals on "I'm Above" and "Long Gone Day"; he is also credited for co-writing the music to those tracks along with McCready and Martin. Lanegan also wrote the lyrics for the three bonus tracks on Disc 1 of the deluxe issue - "Locomotive", "Black Book of Fear", and "Slip Away". [[R.E.M.]] guitarist [[Peter Buck]] is credited for co-writing the music to "Black Book of Fear" along with McCready, Martin, Saunders, and Lanegan.<ref name="Deluxe credits">{{cite AV media notes |title=Above |type=deluxe edition liner notes |others=Mad Season |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] |year=2013 |id=88725473392}}</ref>
