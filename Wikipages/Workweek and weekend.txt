The '''weekdays ''' and '''weekend''' are the complementary parts of the [[week]] devoted to [[Labour (economics)|labour]] and [[Leisure|rest]], respectively. The legal '''weekdays''' ([[British English]]), or workweek ([[American English]]), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to working. In most of the world, the workweek is from [[Monday]] to [[Friday]] and the weekend is [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]]. A '''weekday''' or '''workday''' is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow this pattern, such as places of [[education]]. The constituted weekend has varying definitions, based on determined calendar days, designated period of time, and/or regional definition of the working week (e.g., commencing after 5:00&nbsp;p.m. on Friday and lasting until 6:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sunday). Sometimes the term "weekend" is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week (e.g., Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend).

In some Christian traditions, Sunday is the "[[Lord's Day|day of rest and worship]]". The [[Judaism|Jewish]] ''[[Shabbat]]'' or [[Biblical Sabbath (Hebrew)|Biblical Sabbath]] lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday–Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically instituted a Thursday–Friday weekend. Today, many of these countries, in the interests of furthering business trade and cooperation, have shifted to Friday–Saturday or Saturday–Sunday.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-23031706|publisher=BBC|date=24 June 2013|access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Maxwell|first=Brandt|url=http://www.geographylists.com/list19s.html|title=Countries with days off from work besides Saturday and Sunday|date=2006}}</ref>

The [[Christian Sabbath]] is just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the 20th century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week. The present-day concept of the "weekend" first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early  19th century.<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=weekend|title=weekend – Origin and meaning of weekend by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=October 2, 2018}}</ref> The [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.

Some countries have adopted a one-day weekend, i.e. either Sunday only (in seven countries), Friday only (in [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]] and [[Somalia]]), or Saturday only (in [[Nepal]]). However, most countries have adopted a two-day weekend, whose days differ according to religious tradition, i.e. either Friday and Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday, or Friday and Sunday (in [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]], [[Aceh]] province (Indonesia) and state of [[Sarawak]] (Malaysia)), with the previous evening post-work often considered part of the weekend. Proposals continue to be put forward to reduce the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.

A continuous seven day cycle that runs throughout history, paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon and having a fixed day of rest, was most likely first practised in [[Judaism]], dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&pg=PA11 |title=The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |last=[[Eviatar Zerubavel]] |date=1989-03-15 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-98165-9 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5c7C2rQzU0C |title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical |last=Senn |first=Frank C. |date=1997 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=978-0-8006-2726-3 |language=en}}</ref>

In [[Ancient Rome]], every eight days there was a [[nundinae]]. It was a market day, during which children were exempted from school<ref>The Teacher in Ancient Rome: The Magister and His World, Lisa Maurice, Lexington Books, 2013, pp. 26</ref> and agricultural workers stopped work in the field and came to the city to sell the produce of their labor<ref>Ancient Rome in So Many Words, Christopher Francese, Hippocrene Books, 2007, pp. 76</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Nundinae.html |title=LacusCurtius • Roman Calendar — Nundinae (Smith's Dictionary, 1875) |website=penelope.uchicago.edu |language=en |access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> or to practice religious rites.{{Citation needed|reason=nundunae page says it's doubtful that this day had religious characteristics. || date=June 2017}}

The [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] had ten-day weeks (called ''décades'') and allowed ''décadi'', one out of the ten days, as a leisure day. From 1929 to 1940, the [[Soviet Union]] utilized [[Soviet calendar|a calendar]] with five and six-day work weeks, with a rest day assigned to a worker either with a colour or number.

In cultures with a [[four-day week]], the three [[Sabbath]]s derive from the culture's main religious tradition: Friday ([[Muslim Sabbath|Muslim]]), Saturday ([[Jewish Sabbath|Jewish]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventist]]), and Sunday ([[Christian Sabbath|Christian]]).

The present-day concept of the relatively longer 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early 19th century<ref name="etymonline.com" /> and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2 pm on the basis that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.<ref name="ReferenceA">Waiting for the Weekend, Witold Rybzinski, 1991</ref> The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first use of the term ''weekend'' to the British magazine ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' in 1879.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stanton |first1=Kate |title=The origin of the weekend |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-origin-of-the-weekend-20150807-giu3ay.html |access-date=10 June 2017 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1908, the first five-day workweek in the [[United States]] was instituted by a [[New England]] [[cotton mill]] so that [[Jewish]] workers would not have to work on the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.<ref name="theatlantic.com">{{cite web |author=Witold Rybczynski |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/91aug/rybczynski-p2.htm |title=Waiting for the Weekend |pages=35–52 |date=August 1991 |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref> In 1926, [[Henry Ford]] began shutting down his [[car factory|automotive factories]] for all of Saturday and Sunday. In 1929, the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] Union was the first union to demand and receive a five-day workweek. The rest of the United States slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|Fair Labor Standards Act]] mandating a maximum 40-hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.<ref name="theatlantic.com" />

Over the succeeding decades, particularly in the 1940s to 1960s, an increasing number of countries adopted either a Friday–Saturday or a Saturday–Sunday weekend to harmonize with international markets. A series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the [[Arab World]] in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world, in terms of working hours, the length of the workweek, and the days of the weekend. The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) currently defines a workweek exceeding 48 hours as excessive. A 2007 study by the ILO found that at least 614.2 million people around the world were working excessive hours.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/06/07/news/ilo_study/ |title=22% of workers work more than 48 hours a week, study finds – Jun. 7, 2007 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2007-06-07 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>

Actual workweek lengths have been falling in the developed world. In the United States, the workweek length reduced slowly from before the Civil War to the start of the 20th century. There was a rapid reduction between 1900 and 1920, especially between 1913 and 1919, when weekly hours fell by about eight percent.<ref name=hunnicutt>Hunnicutt, B.K. (1984) The end of shorter hours

=== Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] the working week traditionally was Monday to Friday with a half-day on Saturday and Sunday a public holiday. However, since 2013 there have been changes to the working week concept based on more than one variation. The week can be 5 days of work, or more. The maximum number of hours someone can work in a week remains 45.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/legislation/acts/basic-guides/basic-guide-to-working-hours |title=Basic Guide to Working Hours — Department of Labour |publisher=Labour.gov.za |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>

===Americas===

==== Brazil ====
As a general rule, [[Brazil]] adopts a 44-hour working week, which typically begins on Monday and ends on Friday, with a Saturday–Sunday weekend. [[Brazilian Law]],<ref>Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho: http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del5452.htm</ref> however, also allows for shorter Monday-to-Friday working hours so employees can work on Saturdays or Sundays, as long as the weekly 44-hour limit is respected and the employee gets at least one weekend day. This is usually the case for malls, supermarkets and shops. The law also grants [[labor unions]] the right to negotiate different work weeks, within certain limits, which then become binding for that union's labor category. Overtime is allowed, limited to two extra hours a day, with an increase in pay.

==== Chile ====
The working week in [[Chile]] averages 45 hours, most often worked on a Monday–Friday schedule, but is not uncommon to work on Saturdays. Retail businesses mostly operate Monday through Saturday, with larger establishments being open seven days a week.

==== Colombia ====
In general, [[Colombia]] has a 48-hour working week. Depending on the business, people work five days for [https://web.archive.org/web/20151203220944/http://www.mintrabajo.gov.co/preguntas-frecuentes/jornada-de-trabajo.html a maximum of 8 hours per day], typically Monday to Friday, or six days for eight hours a day, Monday to Saturday.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Colombia/Colombia-Guide/Jobs/Legal-regulations-in-the-Colombian-job-market |title=Legal regulations in the Colombian job market |work=Just Landed |access-date=2017-06-19 |language=en}}</ref>

==== Mexico ====
[[Mexico]] has a 48-hour work week (8 hours × 6 days),<ref>{{cite web |title=Ley federal del trabajo. |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/125.pdf |access-date=May 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604154515/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/125.pdf |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it is a custom in most industries and trades to work half day on Saturday. Most public employees work Monday to Friday as well in some office companies. Shops and retailers open on Saturday and Sunday in most large cities.

==== United States ====
The standard working week in the [[United States]] begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week, with Saturday and Sunday being weekend days.{{Citation needed|reason=It's not clear which law or standard sets this || date=August 2019}} However, in practice, only 42% of employees work 40-hour weeks. The average workweek for full-time employees is 47 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-average-workweek-gallup-labor-day-20140829-story.html |title=Average full-time workweek is 47 hours, Gallup says |work=LA Times |date=2014-08-29 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref> Most stores are open for business on Saturday and often on Sunday as well, except in a few places where prohibited by law (see [[Blue law]]). Increasingly, employers are offering compressed work schedules to employees. Some government and corporate employees now work a 9/80 work schedule (80 hours over 9 days during a two-week period)—commonly 9-hour days Monday to Thursday, 8 hours on one Friday, and off the following Friday. Some government or corporate employees work a 10/40 schedule—10 hours per day over 4 days, usually with Fridays off. Jobs in healthcare, law enforcement, transportation, retail, and other service positions commonly require employees to work on the weekend or to do [[shift work]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.tnsemployeeinsights.com/non-traditional-work-hours-and-retention/ |title=Non-Traditional Work Hours and Retention |publisher=tnsemployeeinsights.com|date=April 10, 2012|access-date=June 27, 2018}}</ref>

===Asia and Australasia===
==== Australia ====
A five-day, 40-hour week was introduced nationally from 1 January 1948 following a ruling of the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/70-years-ago-today-the-40hour-five-day-working-week-began-20180101-h0c3dd.html|title=70 years ago today, the 40-hour, five day working week began|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 January 2018|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref> A 44-hour week, usually taken as a half-day on Saturday, had been applied for some industries from 1927 following a ruling by the court in a case brought by the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union (Australia)|Amalgamated Engineering Union]]. The ruling "led to a gradual and more general reduction of hours across industries",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fwc.gov.au/waltzing-matilda-and-the-sunshine-harvester-factory/historical-material/44-hour-week-case|title=44 Hour Week Case [1927]|publisher=Fair Work Commission|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref> culminating in a nationwide 44-hour week in 1939.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atui.org.au/union-history-blog/w591fndiezikol6j1ejk99zvfswo59|title=The Engineering Union wins the 44 hour week - 1927|publisher=Australian Council of Trade Unions|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref>

In [[Australia]] the working week begins on Monday and terminates on Friday. An eight-hour working day is the norm. Working three weekdays a fortnight, for example, would therefore be approximately twenty-four hours (including or excluding traditional breaks tallying up to two hours). Some people work overtime with extra pay on offer for those that do, especially for weekend work. Shops open seven days a week in most states with opening hours from 9am to 5:30 pm on weekdays, with some states having two "late night trading" nights on Thursday and Friday, when trading ceases at 9pm. Many supermarkets and low-end department stores remain open until midnight and some trade 24/7. Restaurants and cinemas can open at all hours, save for some public holidays. Bars generally trade seven days a week but there are local municipal restrictions concerning trading hours. Banks trade from Monday to Friday, with some branches opening on Saturdays (and in some cases Sundays) in high demand areas. The Post Office (Australia Post) trades Monday to Friday as per retail shops but some retail post offices may trade on Saturdays and Sundays in some shopping centers. A notable exception to the above is South Australia whereby retail establishments are restricted to trading between the hours of 11am-5pm on Sundays.

==== China (People's Republic) ====
In [[China]], there is a five-day Monday–Friday working week, prior to which work on Saturday was standard. China began the two-day Saturday–Sunday weekend on May 1, 1995. Most government employees work 5 days a week (including officials and industrial management). Most manufacturing facilities operate on Saturdays as well. However, most shops, museums, cinemas, and commercial establishments open on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Banks are also open throughout the weekend and on most public holidays.

During the period of [[Public holidays in China|public holidays]], swapped holidays are common between the actual holiday and weekend, so three-day or seven-day holiday periods are created. The nearby Saturday or Sunday may be changed to a normal working day. For example, on a three-day holiday period, if the actual holiday falls on a Tuesday, Monday will be swapped as a holiday, and citizens are required to work on the previous Saturday.

A number of provinces and municipalities across China, including Hebei, Jiangxi and Chongqing, have issued new policies, calling on companies to create 2.5-day weekends. Under the plan, government institutions, state-owned companies, joint-ventures and privately held companies are to be given incentives to allow their workers to take off at noon on Friday before coming back to the office on Monday.<ref>{{cite web |title=China to implement 2.5-day weekend this summer |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-02/03/content_23369098.htm |website=www.chinadaily.com.cn |access-date=2016-02-03 |last=江巍}}</ref>

;Hong Kong SAR
In [[Hong Kong]], a typical working week for local enterprises begins on 9am on Monday and ends at 1pm on Saturday, although most employees have alternate Saturdays off. After the introduction of the five-day working week for the majority of government departments in 2006, most multinational enterprises and large local companies followed suit, extended the working day from 9am to 5pm so as to adopt a five-day work week. Despite the aforementioned official hours, and many employees still work overtime, and in the case of the financial industry in particular, working 12-hour days on a chronic basis is still not uncommon.

Most commercial establishments in the retail sector such as restaurants, shops and cinemas, as well as public venues such as museums and libraries are open on Saturdays, Sundays and most public holidays. For schools, lessons are not normally held on Saturdays, but students may be required to go school on Saturdays for extra-curricular activities or make-up classes.

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, the standard working week is Monday to Friday (36–40 hours).<ref>{{cite web |title=More two-income couples with one full-time job and one large part-time job |url=https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2015/05/more-two-income-couples-with-one-full-time-job-and-one-large-part-time-job |website=CBS – Statistics Netherlands |publisher=CBS – Statistics Netherlands |access-date=21 July 2016}}</ref> Shops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays, depending on the location.

==== Poland ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Large malls are open on Saturdays and Sundays; many small shops are closed on Sundays. Since 11 March 2018 all malls and shops are close on Sundays with banned trading.

Under the new rules, trading will be only allowed on the first and last Sunday of the month. The ban will be stepped up to all Sundays except the last each month in 2019, while in 2020 trading will be prohibited on all Sundays except seven, including those in the run-up to Christmas and Easter. 11 March 2018 will be the first Sunday on which trading is banned.

Bakeries, confectioners, petrol stations, florists, post offices, train stations and airports will be exempt from the ban. Owners will be able to open their shops as long as they serve customers themselves.

Anyone infringing the new rules faces a fine of up to PLN 100,000 (EUR 23,900; USD 29,250). Repeat offenders may face a prison sentence.

==== Portugal ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Street shops are almost always open on Saturday mornings but shopping centres are typically open every day (including Saturdays and Sundays).

==== Romania ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Shops are open on Saturday and Sunday. The weekend begins on Friday, and ends on Monday.

==== Russia ====
In [[Russia]] the common working week begins on Monday and ends on Friday with 8 hours per day.

Federal law defines a working week duration of 5 or 6 days with no more than 40 hours worked. In all cases Sunday is a holiday. With a 5-day working week the employer chooses which day of the week will be the second day off. Usually this is a Saturday, but in some organizations (mostly government), it is Monday. Government offices can thereby offer Saturday service to people with a normal working schedule.

There are non-working public holidays in Russia; all of them fall on a fixed date. By law, if such a holiday coincides with an ordinary day off, the next work day becomes a day off. An official public holiday cannot replace a regular day off. Each year the government can modify working weeks near public holidays in order to optimize the labor schedule. For example, if a five-day week has a public holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the calendar is rearranged to provide a reasonable working week.

Exceptions include occupations such as transit workers, shop assistants, and security guards. In many cases independent schemes are used. For example, the service industry often uses the X-through-Y scheme (Russian: ''X через Y'') when every worker uses X days for work and the next Y days for rest.
;Soviet Union
In the former [[Soviet Union]] the standard working week was 41 hours: 8 hours, 12 minutes, Monday to Friday. Before the mid-1960s there was a 42-hour 6-day standard working week: 7 hours Monday to Friday and 6 hours on Saturday.{{Fix|text=That makes 41.}}

==== Serbia ====
In [[Serbia]], the working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day (with 30 minutes break included), 40 hours in total per week. Shops are open on Saturday and Sunday, usually with shorter working hours, although many large shops of shop chains and shopping malls have same weekday and weekend working hours.

==== Slovakia ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Large malls are open on Saturday and Sunday; many small shops are closed on Sunday. All shops are closed on public holidays.

==== Spain ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. The traditional opening hours are 9:00 to 13:00–14:00 and then 15:00–16:00 to 18:00 for most offices and workplaces. Most shops are open on Saturday mornings and many of the larger shopping malls are open all day Saturday and in some cities like Madrid, they are open most Sundays. Some restaurants, bars, and shops are closed Mondays, as Mondays are commonly a slow business day.<ref>Weekend spanish traditions – ''[http://escapadasdefindesemana.net/ escapadas de fin de semana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020816/http://escapadasdefindesemana.net/ |date=March 5, 2016 }}''</ref>

==== Sweden ====
In [[Sweden]], the standard working week is Monday to Friday, both for offices and industry workers. The standard workday is eight hours, although it may vary greatly between different fields and businesses. Most office workers have flexible working hours and can largely decide themselves on how to divide these over the week. The working week is regulated by ''Arbetstidslagen'' (''Work time law'') to a maximum of 40 hours per week.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arbetstidslagen |url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel02.aspx |publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket |access-date=August 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318050210/http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel02.aspx |archive-date=March 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The 40-hour-week is however easily bypassed by overtime. The law allows a maximum of 200 hours overtime per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arbetstidslagen – Övertid |url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/Kapitel03.aspx |publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket |access-date=August 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814060859/http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel03.aspx |archive-date=August 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> There is however no overseeing government agency; the law is often cited as toothless.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Shops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays, supermarkets and shopping centres, so that employees there have to work. Traditionally, restaurants were closed on Mondays if they were opened during the weekend, but this has in recent years largely fallen out of practice. Many museums do however still remain closed on Mondays.

==== United Kingdom ====
The traditional business working week is from Monday to Friday (35 to 40 hours depending on contract). In retail, and other fields such as healthcare, days off might be taken on any day of the week. Employers can make their employees work every day of a week, although the employer is required to allow each employee breaks of either a continuous period of 24 hours every week or a continuous period of 48 hours every two weeks.

Laws for shop opening hours differ between Scotland and the rest of the UK. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, many shops and services are open on Saturdays and increasingly so on Sundays as well. In England and Wales, stores' maximum Sunday opening hours vary according to the total floor space of the store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizhelp24.com/law/business-trading-hours-law.html |title=Working Hours – Business Trading Hours |access-date=March 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314095843/http://www.bizhelp24.com/law/business-trading-hours-law.html |archive-date=March 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In Scotland, however, there is no restriction in law on shop opening hours on a Sunday.

Under the EU [[Working Time Directive]] (which continues to remain UK law<ref>{{Cite web|title=EU legislation and UK law|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eu-legislation-and-uk-law|access-date=2020-12-02|website=UK Legislation|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]]}}</ref>), workers cannot be forced to work for more than 48 hours per week on average. However, the UK allows individuals to opt out if they so choose. Individuals can choose to opt in again after opting out, even if opting out was part of their employment contract. It is illegal to dismiss them or treat them unfairly for so doing – but they may be required to give up to 3 months notice to give the employer time to prepare, depending on what their employment contract says.<ref name="govuk-workingtime">{{cite web|date=June 27, 2014|title=Maximum weekly working hours|url=https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours/weekly-maximum-working-hours-and-opting-out|access-date=December 2, 2020|website=Gov.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]]}}</ref>

The minimum holiday entitlement is now 28 days per year, but that can include public holidays, depending on the employee's contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10029788 |title=Holiday entitlement }}</ref> England & Wales have eight, Scotland has nine, and Northern Ireland has ten permanent public holidays each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741 |title=UK bank holidays }}</ref><ref>[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/WorkingHoursAndTimeOff/DG_10029426 Directgov: Working time limits (the 48-hour week)], business trading hours law.</ref> The 28 days holiday entitlement means that if the government creates a one-off public holiday in a given year, it is not necessarily a day off and it does not add 1 day to employees' holiday entitlement – unless the employer says otherwise, which some do.

=== Muslim-majority countries ===

==== Thursday–Friday weekend ====
In [[Islam]], Friday is the weekly day of prayer when [[Jumu'ah]] prayers take place. For this reason, most of the Middle Eastern countries and some other predominantly Muslim-majority countries used to consider Thursday and Friday as their weekend. However, this weekend arrangement is no longer observed by a significant number of Muslim-majority countries ([[#Friday–Saturday weekend|see below]]).

==== Friday weekend (One day weekend) ====
Only two Muslim-majority countries have only Friday as the only weekend day and have a six-day working week.

* In [[Iran]], Thursday is half a day of work for most public offices and all schools are closed, but for most jobs, Thursday is a working day. Private and foreign companies however normally have Friday and Saturday as their weekend.
* In [[Djibouti]], many offices also tend to open early – around 7:00 or 8:00, then closing at 13:00 or 14:00, especially during the summer due to the afternoon heat.

==== Friday–Saturday weekend ====
[[Jordan]] was the first Arab country to shift to a Friday–Saturday weekend arrangement in January 2000. Other Arab states followed in the coming years. Following reforms in a number of [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Arab states in the Persian Gulf]] in the 2000s and 2010s, the Thursday–Friday weekend was replaced by the Friday–Saturday weekend. This change provided for the Muslim offering of Friday prayers and afforded more work days to coincide with the working calendars of international financial markets.

==== Saturday–Sunday weekend ====
Other countries with Muslim-majority populations or significant Muslim populations follow the Saturday–Sunday weekend, such as [[Indonesia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]]. While Friday is a working day, a long midday break is given to allow time for worship.

* [[Indonesia]] – With the exception of [[Aceh]], due to prayer time for Muslims on Friday, the lunch break is extended for 2 hours or more. Shopping malls are always open and very crowded on Saturday and Sunday. Thus, some banks offer weekend banking services, especially for branches located in or near shopping malls.
* [[Malaysia]] – The Monday-Friday work week is observed in most of the country especially the capital [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Johor]] however observe a Sunday-Thursday work week. Johor had previously followed a Monday-Friday work week between 1994 and 2013.
* [[Mauritania]] (2014)<ref name="Mauritania weekend">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-29174054|title=weekend}}</ref>
* [[Morocco]] – The working week is Monday to Friday, 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week.
* [[Pakistan]] follows the standard international 40-hour working week, from Monday to Friday, with Saturday and Sunday being the weekend.<ref name="Pakistan weekend">{{cite web |title=Pakistani Weekend Public Holidays Update |url=https://www.qppstudio.net/public-holidays-news/2010/pakistan-moves-to-sunday-weekends-004010.htm|publisher=Reuters |access-date=March 5, 2019 |date=April 24, 2010}}</ref> However, in many schools and enterprises, Friday is usually considered a half-day. The public sector weekend is Sunday only.
* [[Senegal]] – The working week is Monday to Friday, with a large break on Friday afternoon.
* [[Tunisia]] – The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week.
* [[Turkey]] – Working above 45 hours is considered overtime, and the employer is required to pay 1.5 times the hourly wage per hour.

==== Non-contiguous working week ====
There are some areas that unusually implement a non-contiguous workweek (Monday–Thursday and Saturday) and weekend (Friday and Sunday), as listed below.

* [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] is the only country in the world that has a non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday to Thursday plus Saturday. The resting days are Friday, that a significant part of the population devotes to [[Jumu'ah]] prayers, and Sunday. Some non-government companies in Brunei adopt the working week of Monday to Friday. Depending on the company rules, employees may be required to work half-day on Saturday.
* The [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Aceh]] is the only province that currently uses the non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday to Thursday plus Saturday. Resting days are Friday, often used for [[Jumu'ah|Friday]] prayers, and Sunday. Some private and foreign businesses and companies in Aceh however adopted the Monday-Friday workweek.
* [[Malaysia]] – Since 1 January 2020, [[Sarawak]] state government introduced a non-contiguous weekend of Friday and Sunday, replacing the former Saturday–Sunday weekend. This means the [[East Malaysia]]n states is the only state in Malaysia that has a non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday–Thursday and Saturday. Unlike [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] and the [[Aceh]] province in Indonesia, such implementation is meant to accommodate the Muslim and Christian communities, both very large, that respectively observe Friday and Sunday as a prayer day.
