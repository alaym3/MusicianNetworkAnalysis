'''Vicetone''' is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] electronic musical artist and production duo formed by Ruben den Boer (({{IPA-nl|ˈrybə(n) dəm ˈbuːr}}), born 22 January 1992) and Victor Pool (born 9 July 1992) from [[Groningen]]. The duo began as a DJ act, and in 2013, they were voted into the [[DJ Mag|''DJ Mag'' Top 100 DJs]] list for the first time at 60th as a new entry.<ref>{{cite web |title = Top 100 DJs 2013|url = http://djmag.com/content/poll-2013-vicetone|publisher = [[DJ Mag]]|access-date = 26 November 2014}}</ref> Later in 2014, they went up 24 places on the list, coming 36th.<ref>{{cite web |title = Top 100 DJs 2014|url = http://djmag.com/content/poll-2014-vicetone|publisher = [[DJ Mag]]|access-date = 26 November 2014}}</ref> In 2015, they fell 14 places to 50th.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Top 100 DJs 2015|url = http://djmag.com/top-100-djs/poll-2015-vicetone|access-date = 29 October 2015|publisher = [[DJ Mag]]}}</ref> They made a return to the Top 100, coming in at 83rd in 2019 but dropped out the subsequent year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top 100 DJs|url=https://djmag.com/top100djs|access-date=2021-05-28|website=DJMag.com}}</ref>

==Career==
In 2015, Vicetone released two singles with [[Kat Nestel]] titled "Angels" and "Nothing Stopping Me," both on [[Ultra Music]], released a remix for a song from the popular game ''[[League of Legends]]'' called "Project Yi" and they remixed [[Hardwell]] and [[Tiesto]]'s collaboration, "Colors".

To start off 2016, Vicetone released a new track on [[Spinnin' Records]] called "Pitch Black".<ref name="weraveyou pitchblack" /> This was followed by the release of their first EP entitled ''[[Aurora (Vicetone EP)|Aurora]]'', which was released in April before the beginning of a headline tour of the same name. In June 2016, they released the song 'Nevada' to [[Monstercat]] in collaboration with [[Cozi Zuehlsdorff]].<ref name="billboard nevada" />

In 2018, Vicetone released another single with Cozi Zuehlsdorff titled "Way Back".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edmsauce.com/2018/03/09/vicetone-drops-brilliant-new-single-off-monstercat-way-back-feat-cozi-zuehlsdorff/|title=Vicetone drops brilliant new single off Monstercat – ‘Way Back’ (Feat. Cozi Zuehlsdorff)|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=9 March 2018|website=EDM Sauce|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref>

In 2020, Vicetone rose to international stardom over the rise of [[Astronomia (Vicetone remix)|their 2014 remix]] of [[Tony Igy]]'s song "Astronomia" as an [[internet meme]], in which the remix plays over [[Dancing Pallbearers|a group of Ghanaian men dancing while carrying a coffin]], a common funeral tradition in Ghana and parts of Africa with the idea of sending off deceased loved ones in style, rather than in the usual manner of mourning.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Amter |first1=Charlie |title=Tracing the ‘Coffin Dance’ Meme Music’s Path From Russia to Ghana to the World |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/coffin-dance-meme-music-song-astronomia-origin-russia-1234594523/ |website=Variety |access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

On 22 January 2021, Vicetone announced that their debut album titled "Legacy" would be releasing on 2 April of that same year. This announcement came alongside the release of its lead single, "No Rest".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stone|first=Katie|title=Vicetone Announces Debut Album, Drops New New Single "No Rest"|url=https://edm.com/music-releases/vicetone-announces-debut-album-legacy|access-date=5 February 2021|website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Legacy">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cultr.com/news/vicetone-drop-new-single-no-rest-off-forthcoming-monstercat-album/ |title=Vicetone Drop New Single "No Rest" Off Forthcoming Monstercat Album |website=CULTR |access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref>
