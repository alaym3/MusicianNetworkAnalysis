==History==

===As Katzenjammer and Sons of Kyuss (1987–1991)===
The band formed in 1987 jamming under the name '''Katzenjammer''' (German slangword for "Hangover" [''archaic''], literally "moaning of a cat") before eventually deciding upon '''Sons of Kyuss'''. Brant Bjork selected the name from the [[Son of Kyuss|undead monster]] found in the ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[roleplaying game]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> In 1989 the band recorded their [[eponymous]] debut EP, ''[[Sons of Kyuss EP|Sons of Kyuss]]'', which was their only release to feature Chris Cockrell on bass. After self-releasing the EP in 1990, the band recruited [[Nick Oliveri]] – who had previously played second guitar in Katzenjammer – to replace Cockrell on bass, and shortened their name to Kyuss.

===As Kyuss (1991–1995)===

Kyuss' first line-up consisted of vocalist [[John Garcia (singer)|John Garcia]], guitarist [[Josh Homme]], bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] and drummer [[Brant Bjork]]. The band gradually built a local following in Palm Desert, California and frequently performed at parties in and around the isolated towns of [[Southern California]]'s desert areas. These impromptu and predominantly outdoor shows, referred to locally as "generator parties",<ref name="Morris"/> consisted of small crowds of people, beer drinking, and the use of gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for the equipment.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Billik | first = Kira L. | title = Confused punk rockers' have an identity crisis | newspaper =[[Buffalo News]] | pages =G3 | date =March 14, 1993}}</ref> Homme commented that playing in the desert "was the shaping factor for the band" noting that "there's no clubs here, so you can only play for free. If people don't like you, they'll tell you. You can't suck."<ref name="Morris"/>

The band then signed with independent record label [[Chameleon Records|Dali]], who released their debut album, ''[[Wretch (album)|Wretch]]'', in September 1991. Several songs on the album were re-recorded versions of those that appeared on the ''Sons of Kyuss'' EP. Album sales were sluggish, though the band was quickly making a name for itself as a live act.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web | last = Rivadavia | first =Eduardo | title =Kyuss Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | url =https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kyuss-mn0000776011/biography | access-date = July 4, 2007}}</ref> Guitarist Josh Homme soon gained a reputation for his unique downtuned, [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] style of guitar playing, and his convention of playing electric guitars through bass guitar amplifiers to create a bass-heavy sound.

In 1992, the band, along with new producer [[Chris Goss]], began work on their next album, ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]''. Goss understood the band, and was able to accurately capture their live sound in the studio. Released in June that year, the album was critically hailed and is today widely regarded as a pioneering [[stoner rock]] record. By the end of 1993, they were invited to open nine dates for [[Metallica]] touring Australia.<ref name="Morris" /> Comparisons to stoner rock godfathers [[Black Sabbath]] became common, though Homme claimed to have little knowledge of the band at the time<ref>{{cite web

| title =My Life in Music: Josh Homme
| access-date=October 23, 2014
| date =June 13, 2003
| publisher =spin.com}}</ref> but Bjork asserted he and Oliveri were hugely influenced by the British group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://endhits.hu/kyuss-lives-%E2%80%93-interview-with-drummer-brant-bjork/ |title=Kyuss lives! - Interview with drummer Brant Bjork |publisher=endhits.hu |date=April 7, 2011 |access-date=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030165618/http://endhits.hu/kyuss-lives-%E2%80%93-interview-with-drummer-brant-bjork/ |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Oliveri left the band following completion of the album and [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with [[The Obsessed]], made his debut at the release party for ''Blues for the Red Sun''.
{{listen|filename=Kyuss_Thee_Ol'_Boozeroony.ogg|title="Thee Ol' Boozeroony"|description=Sample of "Thee Ol' Boozeroony", from ''[[...And the Circus Leaves Town]]''.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The band then soon found themselves signed with major label [[Elektra Records]] after Dali Records hit financial problems and was bought by Elektra. In 1994, they would release their first major label album, self-titled ''Kyuss''. Originally intended to be titled ''Pools of Mercury'', the album commonly came to be known among fans as ''[[Welcome to Sky Valley]]''. Between record company shuffling and bandmember shuffling it would take a whole year for the album recorded in 1993 to be released. Once again produced by Chris Goss, it received critical acclaim and, musically, demonstrated a much more psychedelic and mature sound. However, personal problems emerged and drummer Brant Bjork left the band following completion of the recording sessions. Bjork cited his extreme distaste for touring, particularly band relationship problems that develop during long periods on the road. He was replaced by [[Alfredo Hernández]], who had previously played with Reeder in the band Across the River during the mid-80s. In July 1995, they released their fourth and final album, ''[[...And the Circus Leaves Town]]''. A video was made for "[[One Inch Man]]", the album's only official single. The album was not as successful commercially as ''Sky Valley'', receiving mixed reviews. Kyuss broke up during the late summer of 1995.

After the band's breakup in 1995, there had been frequent and persistent speculation among fans regarding the possibility of a Kyuss reunion. When asked in late 2004 about whether the band would ever re-unite, Homme replied that this was unlikely to happen in the near future. However, on December 20, 2005, Garcia made a guest appearance onstage with Queens of the Stone Age during their encore at the [[Wiltern Theatre|Wiltern LG]] in Los Angeles. They performed three Kyuss songs together: "Thumb", "Hurricane" and "Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop".<ref>{{cite web | last = Orzeck | first = Kurt| title = QOTSA End Year On A High Note: Josh Homme Reunites With Kyuss Singer In L.A | publisher = VH1| date = December 21, 2005| url = http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1519071/20051221/queens_stone_age.jhtml | access-date = June 5, 2007}}</ref> The band has reportedly received numerous offers to re-form, all of which have been turned down:

{{quote|"The offers come in all the time. They're getting more and more expensive, and more and more elaborate. The money is crazy, but I've never been tempted – I don't really care about the money, I never have. That's not what KYUSS was about, so to punctuate the end of our sentence with that would be blasphemy. KYUSS fans are so fuckin' rad, they're fuckin' badass – but to me, reunions are just not necessary. It's not what it was, it's what it is, and KYUSS was a really magical thing – and if you weren't there, well, you weren't. That's just the luck of the draw. I don't feel the urge to do it for somebody who didn't have the opportunity to see us, or just didn't take the opportunity to see us. I'll let other bands alter their great legacies. KYUSS has such a great history that it would be a total error. I like that nobody saw KYUSS, and that it was largely misunderstood. That sounds like a legend forming to me. I'm too proud of it to rub my dick on it."|Josh Homme to [[Joel McIver]], May 2007<ref>{{cite news

Scott Reeder also commented on a possible Kyuss reunion in early 2008, saying "I think everyone but Josh would do it in a heartbeat". Reeder also noted that he would "do it for free beer again".<ref>{{cite web

===Post-breakup (1996–present)===
Shortly after the breakup, Homme toured as the rhythm guitarist with [[Screaming Trees]] and began work on ongoing [[The Desert Sessions]] recording series. In December 1997, a [[Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age|transitional split EP]] was released, featuring three songs by Kyuss (the [[Black Sabbath]] cover "Into the Void," "Fatso Forgotso", and "Flip the Phase") and three songs by Queens of the Stone Age ("[[If Only Everything]]", "Born to Hula" and "Spiders & Vinegaroons"). Homme and Hernandez formed [[Queens of the Stone Age]] in 1998, and recruited Oliveri as bassist after completion of their debut album.

Hernandez later played with [[Yawning Man]], [[Che (band)|Che]] and [[Orquestra Del Desierto]], while Oliveri formed the band [[Mondo Generator]], named after the only Kyuss song credited solely (words and music) to him. Drummer [[Brant Bjork]] went on to form the band [[Brant Bjork and the Bros]], recorded and performed with [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]] and Mondo Generator, and has recorded several solo albums.

John Garcia went on to form [[Slo Burn]], although the band was short-lived and released only one EP, ''[[Amusing the Amazing]]'', before disbanding in September 1997. He was also briefly associated with the band [[Karma to Burn]]. In 1998, he began working with the band [[Unida]], recording one EP, one LP and an unreleased album. At the same time he started working with the band Hermano, having released three LP's and one live album to date. Garcia has more recently been working on a solo album.<ref>{{cite web | title = Garcia Vs Garcia| publisher = Garcia Vs Garcia official website| url =http://www.garciavsgarcia.com| access-date = July 4, 2007}}</ref>

In 1997, Homme, Bjork, and Oliveri recorded three songs together ("13th Floor", "Simple Exploding Man", & "Cocaine Rodeo") for Mondo Generator's debut album [[Cocaine Rodeo]], released in 2000. Also featuring Garcia and Chris Goss on one track, the songs are regarded by many fans as the true final Kyuss recordings.

In 2000, a compilation album, ''[[Muchas Gracias: The Best of Kyuss]]'', was released. The album is a collection of the band's singles, as well as B-sides and live material.

Although Kyuss left behind some "rarities", many of them were released on ''Muchas Gracias'', and further releases from the band appear unlikely. Singer John Garcia told [[Billboard.com]] in a 2005 interview:

{{quote|"There are so many untitled songs that have never been heard, that I have up in my little crawl space up above my bed. I don't see those songs coming out anytime in the near future. Everybody's too busy to do stuff like that. It's a job to go back and listen to it, and then if you want to re-record them."<ref>{{cite magazine| url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63329/ex-kyuss-singer-resurfaces-in-hermano| title =Ex-Kyuss Singer Resurfaces In Hermano| access-date=2007-06-05| date =2005-04-11| magazine =[[Billboard.com]]}}</ref>}}

In 2010, a European "John Garcia plays Kyuss" tour was announced. In June 2010, former Kyuss members Nick Oliveri and Brant Bjork joined Garcia onstage to perform "Green Machine" and "Gardenia" during a headlining appearance by "Garcia Plays Kyuss" at [[Hellfest Summer Open Air|Hellfest]] in [[Clisson]], France,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141999|title=Three Quarters Of Kyuss Reunites At France's Hellfest; Video Available - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=January 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811023256/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141999|archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> and they also appeared onstage with Garcia in other concerts on the tour.
[[file:Kyuss lives1.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Kyuss Lives!]] in 2011]]
In November 2010, Garcia, Oliveri and Bjork announced plans to tour under the moniker "[[Kyuss Lives! Tour|Kyuss Lives!]]" with guitarist Bruno Fevery. In reference to the new band name, Garcia stated that "there is never going to be a Kyuss without [[Josh Homme]]" and that "hopefully in the future him and I can get together and do some writing."<ref>December/January 2011 issue of ''[[Rock-A-Rolla]]''</ref> The band went on to tour Europe,<ref name=reunion/> Australasia<ref>{{cite web | title = KYUSS LIVES!: Australian Tour Announced | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | date = November 11, 2010 | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=149271 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120911061617/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=149271 | archive-date = September 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Kyuss Lives!

The band then announced plans to record a new studio album for a summer 2012 release in addition to a live album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verdammnis.com/interviews.php?id=63|title=VerdamMnis Music E-Magazine - Interviews - Kyuss Lives : None - Juin 2011|author=Lederlé Eric|access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref>

However, in March 2012, it was revealed that Josh Homme, after persuading bassist Scott Reeder to support him, had filed a federal lawsuit against John Garcia and Brant Bjork alleging "trademark infringement and consumer fraud" over the use of the Kyuss name despite the fact Brant Bjork had originally created the name. Nick Oliveri left Kyuss later that month after it was revealed that Garcia and Bjork had tried to take control of the Kyuss trademark.<ref name=OliveriOut2012/>

In August 2012, the courts ruled that Garcia and Bjork could not release any recordings, studio or live, under the Kyuss Lives! moniker. While they were allowed to continue using the moniker for live shows (as long as, unlike the band's current logo, Lives! is written in the same size and next to the word Kyuss to avoid confusion), the judge stated that they may face issues in the future and that "it may be in Defendants' best interest to begin re-branding under a new name".<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Greg Prato |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/court-rules-on-kyuss-lives-lawsuit-20120815 |title=Court Rules on Kyuss Lives Lawsuit &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 15, 2012 |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> On November 29, 2012, it was announced that Kyuss Lives! had changed their name to [[Vista Chino]].<ref name="namechange"/>

In July 2020, Homme stated that he was open to the possibility of participating in a Kyuss reunion. "(T)here have been times I thought (Kyuss) cannot end that way, and the only real way to end it correctly now would be to play," he said. "And because they sort of perverted the punctuation and they knocked the wing off this beautiful dragon that's an ice sculpture, and the only way to put the motherfucking wing back on would be to (play again).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=July 15, 2020|title=JOSH HOMME Is Open To Playing With KYUSS Again|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/josh-homme-is-open-to-playing-with-kyuss-again/|access-date=July 18, 2020|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref>
