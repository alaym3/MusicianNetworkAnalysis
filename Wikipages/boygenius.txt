'''Boygenius''' (stylized in all lowercase) is an [[indie rock]] group formed in 2018 by American musicians [[Julien Baker]], [[Phoebe Bridgers]], and [[Lucy Dacus]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus Formed an Indie-Rock Supergroup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/arts/music/boygenius-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing boygenius, a Supergroup of Indie-Rock Cool Girls |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/boygenius-lucy-dacus-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker-indie-rock-group}}</ref> Their self-titled debut EP ''[[boygenius (EP)|boygenius]]'' was written and recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/boygenius-are-the-egoless-supergroup-of-your-indie-rock-dreams/|title=boygenius Are the Egoless Supergroup of Your Indie Rock Dreams|last=Mapes|first=Jillian|date=October 18, 2018|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/boygenius-is-driven-by-the-spirit-of-solidarity|title=Boygenius Is Driven by the Spirit of Solidarity|last=Battan|first=Carrie|edition=November 12, 2018|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name="BoygeniusNPR">{{cite web |last1=Larusso |first1=Marissa |title=Hear New Music From Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus' Supergroup Boygenius |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/639528019/hear-new-music-from-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker-lucy-dacus-supergroup-boygenius |website=NPR |publisher=NPR}}</ref>

== History ==
===2018: Formation, EP, and tour===
Bridgers has called the formation of the group “kind of an accident,” wherein each of the members were simply fans of each other's work and then became friends.<ref name="BoygeniusVogue">{{cite web |last1=Read |first1=Bridget |title=A Brief Oral History of Boygenius |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/boygenius-oral-history-lucy-dacus-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker |website=Vogue |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref> Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [[Independent music|indie]] scene.<ref name="Phoebe Bridgers's Frank, Anxious Music">{{cite web |last1=Petrusich |first1=Amanda |title=Phoebe Bridgers's Frank, Anxious Music |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/25/phoebe-bridgers-frank-anxious-music |website=The New Yorker |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref><ref name="Boygenius is Driven by the Spirit of Solidarity">{{cite web |last1=Battan |first1=Carrie |title=Boygenius Is Driven by the Spirit of Solidarity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/boygenius-is-driven-by-the-spirit-of-solidarity?reload |website=The New Yorker |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref>

The three became close, and they shared frustration at constantly being compared to each other as “[[women in rock]]” despite their considerably different musical styles.<ref name="BoygeniusGQ">{{cite web |last1=Rollins |first1=Samantha |title=Boygenius is Bigger Than the Moment |url=https://www.gq.com/story/boygenius-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus-interview |website=GQ |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref> Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music “should not be remarkable whatsoever,” with Bridgers adding, “it’s not a genre.”<ref name="BoygeniusGQ" /> Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea.<ref name="BoygeniusVogue" /><ref name="BoygeniusGQ" /> “I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,” Dacus says. “You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.”<ref name="BoygeniusUndertheRadar">{{cite web |last1=Conner |first1=Matt |title=boygenius - The Under the Radar Cover Story |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/boygenius_-_the_under_the_radar_cover_story/ |website=Under the Radar |publisher=Under the Radar Magazine}}</ref>

Baker had joked to Dacus years before about a “pipe dream” that they could one day all form a band.<ref name="BoygeniusKEXP">{{cite web |last1=Albertson |first1=Jasmine |title=Boygenius Give Emotive Debut Television Performance on Late Night with Seth Meyers |url=https://www.kexp.org/read/2018/11/6/boygenius-give-emotive-debut-television-performance-late-night-seth-meyers/ |website=KEXP.org |publisher=KEXP-FM}}</ref> The three decided to book a co-headlining tour in early 2018 and originally planned on recording a single or a cover so that they could perform something together on stage.<ref name="BoygeniusVogue" /> Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the ''[[Boygenius (EP)|Boygenius]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.<ref name="BoygeniusUndertheRadar" /><ref name="BoygeniusNYT">{{cite web |last1=Coscarelli |first1=Joe |title=Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus Formed an Indie-Rock Supergroup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/arts/music/boygenius-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus.html |website=The New York Times }}</ref>

Each brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group.<ref name="BoygeniusNewsweek">{{cite web |last1=Schonfeld |first1=Zach |title=How All-Female Supergroup Boygenius is Changing Indie Rock |url=https://www.newsweek.com/2018/11/09/boygenius-julien-baker-lucy-dacus-phoebe-bridgers-supergroup-ep-interview-1194109.html |website=Newsweek}}</ref> They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and “bravado” they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they've remarked that the absence of adult men in the process allowed them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves.<ref name="BoygeniusVogue" /><ref name="BoygeniusNYT" /> The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and their subsequent tour that November saw them performing all across the U.S. as well as on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'' and the [[Tiny Desk Concerts|NPR Tiny Desk]].<ref name="BoygeniusKEXP" /><ref name="BoygeniusMetacritic">{{cite web |title=Boygenius [EP] by boygenius Reviews and Tracks |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/boygenius-ep/boygenius |website=Metacritic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Music |first1=NPR |title=boygenius: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS48Lp34Zic |website=YouTube |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

===2019-present: Continuing collaborations===
The group was slated to perform in summer 2019 at [[Woodstock 50]], before its cancellation due to a series of production issues.<ref name="Woodstock50RollingStone">{{cite web |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=Woodstock 50 Details Full Lineup With Jay-Z, Dead & Company, Killers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/woodstock-50-details-full-lineup-with-jay-z-dead-company-killers-809290/ |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref name="Woodstock50NYT">{{cite web |title=Woodstock 50 Is Canceled: 'We Just Ran Out of Time' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/music/woodstock-50-canceled.html#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20the%20anniversary,to%20move%20it%20to%20Maryland.&text=Woodstock%2050%20is%20officially%20dead. |work=The New York Times}}</ref> In 2020, they were featured on [[Hayley Williams]]’ “Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris” from her EP ''[[Petals for Armor II]]'', and also reunited on backing vocals for numerous songs from each other's solo projects: “Graceland Too” and "I Know the End" from Bridgers’ [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated ''[[Punisher (album)|Punisher]]'', Baker's ''[[Little Oblivions (album)|Little Oblivions]]'' single “Favor,” and "Please Stay" and "Going Going Gone" on Dacus's ''[[Home Video (album)|Home Video]]''.<ref name="BoygeniusFavorVulture">{{cite web |last1=Curto |first1=Justin |title=Julien Baker Gets the Band Back Together on 'Favor' |url=https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/julien-baker-favor-boygenius.html |website=Vulture |publisher=Vox Media}}</ref> With the releases scattered throughout the year, all of these were actually recorded on the same day, a process Dacus said “had the same atmosphere as when we recorded the ''boygenius'' EP[...] a natural result of being together, easy as can be.”<ref name="BoygeniusFavorVulture" />

In July 2020, the trio released a handful of [[Demo (music)|demos]] from their ''[[Boygenius (EP)|Boygenius]]'' recording sessions on [[Bandcamp]] to raise money for charitable organizations in their respective hometowns, raising over $23,000 for the Downtown Women's Center of Los Angeles, OUTMemphis, and Mutual Aid Distribution Richmond.<ref name="BoygeniusDemosPitchfork">{{cite web |last1=Hussey |first1=Allison |title=boygenius to Release Demos on Bandcamp Benefit Day |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/boygenius-to-release-demos-on-bandcamp-benefit-day/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=xboygeniusx |title=Y'all raised 23,729.37 buying the boygenius demos on bandcamp day. |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CCgqdzIpkWl/ |website=Instagram |publisher=Facebook}}</ref>

After reuniting on stage for occasional surprise appearances at one another's solo tours throughout fall 2021, the group performed their first full show together since 2018 as the headliner of [[Bread and Roses Presents]]' annual benefit concert in San Francisco on November 19th.<ref name="BGnewshowstereogum">{{cite web |last1=Breihan |first1=Tom |title=Boygenius Announce First Show in 3 Years |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2166208/boygenius-announce-first-show-in-3-years/news/ |website=Stereogum}}</ref>

== Name ==
The group has been vocal about the origins of their name, which began as a joke and a way to encourage each other in the studio.<ref name="BoygeniusNYT" /> All three had shared negative experiences with overconfident male collaborators—as Baker puts it, "the archetype of the tortured genius, [a] specifically male artist who has been told since birth that their every thought is not only worthwhile but brilliant."<ref name="BoygeniusNewsweek" /> “Men are taught to be entitled to space and that their ideas should be heard because they’re great ideas, and women are taught […] that they should listen instead of speak,” Bridgers has explained.<ref name="BoygeniusVogue"/>

Dacus describes the “boy genius” trope as “boys and men we know who’ve been told that they are geniuses since they could hear, basically,” and detailed how they attempted to channel that energy while making the EP. “If one person was having a thought—‘I don’t know if this is good, it’s probably terrible’—it was like, ‘No! Be the boy genius! Your every thought is worthwhile, just spit it out.’”<ref name="BoygeniusNYT" /> Ironically, Bridgers has said that after they decided to become a band, numerous men attempted to take credit for the idea of them collaborating.<ref name="BoygeniusNPR" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Lauren |title=A Conversation With Boygenius Gets Weird |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/boygenius-tour-interview/ |website=W Magazine |publisher=Bustle}}</ref>
