The band got its name when on their way to a [[New Found Glory]] show on [[Long Island]], with the intention of giving New Found Glory a demo CD, and they were trying to think of a name to write on the CD. They passed the [[Bayside (LIRR station)|Bayside train station]], and decided to write "Bayside" on the CD simply as a name for New Found Glory, but the name became permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyraneri.com/post/125896769/steve-from-new-found-glory-made-this-amazing-video |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145431/http://www.anthonyraneri.com/post/125896769/steve-from-new-found-glory-made-this-amazing-video |archive-date=2011-07-07 |title=Raneri, Anthony.
