'''Frou Frou''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|uː|f|r|uː}} are a British [[Electronic music|electronic]] duo composed of singer [[Imogen Heap]] and producer-songwriter [[Guy Sigsworth]]. They released their only album, ''[[Details (album)|Details]],'' in 2002. The duo wrote, produced, and played instruments on the tracks, while Heap also provided lead vocals. In 2004, they recorded a cover of "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]" by [[Bonnie Tyler]], which was used in the credits of the 2004 film ''[[Shrek 2]]''. Frou Frou amicably disbanded later that year.

In 2017, it was announced that Heap and Sigsworth would be reuniting as Frou Frou.

== History ==

=== 1997&ndash;2000: Introductions ===
Heap and Sigsworth met in the mid-1990s on the London music scene, Sigsworth coming to the attention of Heap and her record label due to his writing/production/keyboard-playing work with [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] and [[Björk]].<ref name="all music2"/> Their first work together consisted of Heap providing extra vocals for Sigsworth's band [[Acacia (band)|Acacia]]. She subsequently contributed to the live Acacia lineup at several concerts, became a significant "floating member" of the band (although never a full member) and sang on all but one track on Acacia's ill-fated debut album ''Cradle''.

Sigsworth subsequently contributed to Heap's debut album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8061156/Imogen-Heap-fully-connected.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017041524/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8061156/Imogen-Heap-fully-connected.html|url-status=live|archive-date=17 October 2010|work=Telegraph|title=Imogen Heap: fully connected
|first=Naomi|last=West|date=14 October 2010|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> ''[[I-Megaphone|i Megaphone]]'', which was released on the now defunct [[Almo Sounds]] in 1998. Together they wrote the first single to be taken from ''i Megaphone'', the angst-ridden "Getting Scared," which Sigsworth also produced, and the B-side to the album's second single, "Shine," entitled "Airplane."

Heap went on to tour ''i Megaphone'' internationally, promoting the record, while Sigsworth (following the split of Acacia in 1997) continued to write and produce for other artists, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Lamb (electronic band)|Lamb]].<ref name="all music2">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/guy-sigsworth-mn0000546133/credits|publisher=All Music|title=Biography|first=John|last=Buchanan|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Having remained friends, the pair kept in contact.

=== 2001&ndash;2002: Formation ===
In 2001, Sigsworth began to put together an album under the project name of "Frou Frou". The initial project outline was for a collection of tracks written and produced by Sigsworth and added to by singers, songwriters, poets or rappers. The name "Frou Frou" (pronounced "froo froo") was chosen by Sigsworth himself, a noted Francophile. It derives from the 1870 [[Rimbaud]] [[poem]], "Ma Bohème," and is [[French language|French]] [[onomatopoeia]] for the swishing noise made by [[skirt]]s on dancing women. Frou-Frou is also the name of Count Vronsky's tragic horse in [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]''.

One of the first vocalists Sigsworth contacted was Imogen Heap. Heap relates that Sigsworth invited her to his studio to write lyrics for a four-bar motif he had, on condition that she included the word "love" somewhere. The first line she came up with was "lung of love, leaves me breathless"; thus the ''Details'' album track "Flicks" was born. A week later, Sigsworth phoned her again and together they wrote and recorded "Breathe In", which would eventually become the first Frou Frou single.

At the time, Heap was in career limbo. Her record label had folded, been bought, and subsequently disbanded, leaving her without a record contract (despite her second album being written and ready to record). Having been stalled for a year, she welcomed the opportunity to begin collaborating on new tracks with Sigsworth.

Further collaborations continued throughout the year with both Heap and Sigsworth playing equal roles in writing, instrumentation and production until nearly half the album was completed. In December 2001, Sigsworth and Heap made the conscious decision to establish themselves as a formal duo project. Heap approved of the name "Frou Frou", and it was kept as the band title. The first official Frou Frou release was a remix of "Airplane" (renamed "Aeroplane") which the duo had completed for the Japanese re-release of Heap's debut album.

=== 2002&ndash;2003: ''Details'' ===
In 2002, Frou Frou signed a record deal with Universal Records on the [[Island Records]] imprint in the UK and Europe, and [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Records]] in the USA. They released their first and only [[album]], ''[[Details (album)|Details]]'' in June 2002. An album of [[electronic music]] with elements of [[trip hop]], [[Pop music|pop]] and rock, the eclectic, intricately produced tracks use a wide range of traditional instruments including cellos, [[autoharp]]s, guitars, keyboards, and Indian drums, with layered vocals from Heap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13|work=Billboard|title=Pasionate, Motivated MCA Duo Frou Frou Is Here To Make A Change|first=Adam|last=Keim|page=13|date=20 July 2002}}</ref>

The album received critical acclaim, but this did not translate into mass sales the duo had hoped for. "Breathe In" was released as the first single internationally. It reached number two on the Italian radio airplay charts, and debuted in the Top 50 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"Breathe In" and "Must Be Dreaming" did become minor hits in [[Asia]], particularly in [[Indonesia]], where both singles made Top 10, peaking at number 7 and 5 respectively on the Indonesian Airplay Chart.

A video was made for a fourth single from the album, the closer "The Dumbing Down of Love", directed by [[Joel Peissig]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/30/advertising|work=The Guardian|title=Chocolate ad ripped off my video, says director|first=Ben|last=Bold|date=30 June 2005|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> (who later directed Heap's solo video "[[Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)|Hide and Seek]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/20/arts/music/reggaes-bootleg-respect-and-a-hit-for-the-textmessage-set.html|work=New york Times|title=Reggae's Bootleg Respect and a Hit for the Text-Message Set|first=Kelefa|last=Sanneh|date=20 November 2005|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>). After touring the record extensively across the United States, where the duo had established a cult fan base, Frou Frou amicably disbanded in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bloom |first1=Madison |title=Frou Frou (Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth) Share First New Song in 15+ Years: Listen |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/frou-frou-imogen-heap-and-guy-sigsworth-share-first-new-song-in-15-years-listen/ |website=Pitchfork |access-date=30 November 2020 |language=en-us |date=19 April 2019}}</ref>

Heap and Sigsworth recorded a cover version of "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]" for the ''[[Shrek 2]]'' [[Shrek 2 (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. The duo were approached by the music director of the film, who had been a fan of ''Details''.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Frou Frou also experienced a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' star [[Zach Braff]] chose "Let Go" as the key track for his independent film, ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''.

The duo also worked together in 2003 on a track for [[Britney Spears]]'s fourth album ''[[In The Zone]]'',<ref name="all music2"/> entitled "Over To You Now". The track was written by Sigsworth, Swedish pop star [[Robyn]] and her long-term songwriting companion, and Sigsworth asked Heap to come in and make the song more suitable for Spears, adding backing vocals and making the track more electronic music-infused. Despite not being used on ''In The Zone'', the track was released in late 2005 on the Japan CD single of Spears' single, "Someday (I Will Understand)" and on the UK and Japan bonus CDs of the DVD release of her reality TV show, ''[[Britney and Kevin: Chaotic]]''.

=== 2017{{endash}}present: Reunion, "Guitar Song", tour ===

In November 2017, it was announced that Heap and Sigsworth would be reuniting to tour as Frou Frou in conjunction with an Imogen Heap solo tour in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2025831/frou-frou-reuniting-for-2019-tour/tour-dates/|publisher=Stereogum|title=Frou Frou Reuniting For 2019 North American Tour|first=James|last=Rettig|date=11 December 2018|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> In April 2019, Frou Frou released a live recording of "Guitar Song", their first new single in 15 years and one of two singles not released at the time of the band's initial break-up.<ref name="guitar_song_live">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/frou-frou-imogen-heap-guy-sigsworth-guitar-song-live-listen-824601/|publisher=Rolling Stone|title=Hear Frou Frou's First New Song in 15 Years 'Guitar Song (Live)'|first=Althea|last=Legaspi|date=19 April 2019|access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>
