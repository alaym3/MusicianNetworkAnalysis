'''Charlotte Emma Aitchison''' (born 2 August 1992), known professionally as '''Charli XCX''', is an English singer and songwriter. Born in [[Cambridge]] and raised in [[Start Hill, Essex]], she began posting songs on [[Myspace]] in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse [[raves]]. In 2010, she signed a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.

In 2012, Charli XCX rose to prominence with the [[Icona Pop]] collaboration "[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]", which became an international success, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, ''[[True Romance (Charli XCX album)|True Romance]]'' (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the hook and bridge to "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]" by rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], which finished the year as one of the [[best-selling singles worldwide]] and was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The same year, Charli XCX released "[[Boom Clap]]", which became her first solo top-ten single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her second studio album, the [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', was released at the end of the year, and spawned the successful singles "[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]" and "[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]".

In 2015, Charli XCX began working alongside producers associated with the UK collective [[PC Music]], developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the ''[[Vroom Vroom (EP)|Vroom Vroom]]'' EP (2016) and the mixtapes ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' (both 2017), as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified "[[After the Afterparty]]", "[[Boys (Charli XCX song)|Boys]]", and "[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]". Her third and fourth studio albums, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]]'' (2019) and ''[[How I'm Feeling Now]]'' (2020), received widespread acclaim; the latter was created within a span of six weeks during the [[COVID-19 lockdowns]]. In 2021, Charli XCX co-wrote and provided vocals on the [[Jax Jones]] and [[Joel Corry]] single "[[Out Out (song)|Out Out]]". The singer's fifth album, ''[[Crash (Charli XCX album)|Crash]]'', is scheduled for release in March 2022.

In addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including [[Iggy Azalea]]'s "[[Beg for It (song)|Beg for It]]" (2014), [[Selena Gomez]]'s "[[Same Old Love]]" (2015), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Tonight (Blondie song)|Tonight]]" (2017), and the [[Shawn Mendes]] and [[Camila Cabello]] collaboration "[[Señorita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Señorita]]" (2019).

In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to [[Asylum Records]]. She later described herself as being "lost". In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Charli XCX said: "I was still in school, I'd just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And when I got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."<ref name="theguardian2013"/> She eventually flew out to [[Los Angeles]] to meet producers, and found it "wasn't working out for me" until she met with American producer [[Ariel Rechtshaid]]. They had a two-hour session and wrote the song "Stay Away". She stated that's "when things started to come together".<ref>{{cite web |last=Tinkham |first=Chris |url=http://undertheradarmag.com/interviews/charli_xcx|title=Charli XCX|website=undertheradarmag.com|access-date=22 January 2019|archive-date=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123121259/http://undertheradarmag.com/interviews/charli_xcx}}</ref><ref name="theguardian2013"/> Early in 2011, she was featured on the [[Alex Metric]] single "End of the World".

In addition to Rechtshaid, she began working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger.

Charli XCX began writing her second album in mid-2013, saying she initially wanted to go to India to record, but later decided she wanted to record in France, she said: "Two months ago, I wanted to go to India and record it, and now I want to record it in France.
