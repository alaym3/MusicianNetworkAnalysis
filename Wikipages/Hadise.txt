[[File:Hadise Açıkgöz.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Hadise performing in [[Ghent]], Belgium, in November 2006]]
The self-titled album, was originally intended to be named ''On High Heels'', referring to the fact that she had grown enormously in her professional career and knowledge. Hadise began to work on her second studio album in December 2007. The album was recorded in several countries, including Belgium, France, Turkey and Italy. The lead single, "[[A Good Kiss]]", was released in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=7433278 | title = Hadise'den yeni klip | publisher = Hürriyet | access-date = 17 January 2013 | date = 7 October 2007}}</ref> This became her sixth consecutive single to chart on the Belgian "Ultratop 50".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/28241|title=Hadise – A Good Kiss – Music Charts|publisher=acharts.co|access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref> The song was also successful in Turkey, where it became her first single to chart on the "[[Billboard Türkiye|Turkish Billboard Chart]]".

Due to leaked images of Hadise being affectionate with a male model, the music video "Deli Oğlan" generated controversy amongst those who considered the images to be 'racy' or 'erotic'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flortcafe.com/hadise-deli-oglan-klipi-muzik-haberleri-haber-detay-1502.html |title=Hadise deli oğlan klip'i |access-date=11 June 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519215602/http://www.flortcafe.com/hadise-deli-oglan-klipi-muzik-haberleri-haber-detay-1502.html |archive-date=19 May 2008  }}.

No. 'He's a man so he does whatever he likes, she's a woman so she stays quiet' I will fight with this mindset until the end".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/hadiseden-klibine-erotik-diyen-rtuke-bir-kadin-olarak-boyun-egmek-zorunda-miyim/|title=Hadise’den klibine 'erotik' diyen RTÜK'e: Bir kadın olarak boyun eğmek zorunda mıyım?|newspaper=Diken|date=4 January 2018|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109044524/http://www.diken.com.tr/hadiseden-klibine-erotik-diyen-rtuke-bir-kadin-olarak-boyun-egmek-zorunda-miyim/|archive-date=9 January 2018|language=tr}}</ref> Two more music videos from the album were released for the songs "Farkımız Var" and "Aşk Dediğin", the first of which ranked sixth on Turkey's official music chart.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/MusicTopTR/status/1010111437480644613 | access-date = 28 June 2019 | title = MusicTopTR Top 10 Yerli Listesini #spotify linkinden dinleyebilirisiniz. | publisher = Twitter | date = 22 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/cadde/hadiseden-yeni-klip-ask-dedigin-2863346|title=Hadise'den yeni klip: Aşk Dediğin|publisher=Milliyet|date=24 April 2019|access-date=7 August 2019|language=tr}}</ref>

===Acting===

In July 2008, Hadise was again offered a role in a Turkish [[comedy film]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://showbizzsite.be/nieuws/detail.asp%3FiImsNid%3D71516&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=2&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dclub%2Breina%2Bhadise%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.co.uk |access-date=3 March 2011}}</ref>
