'''The Coasters''' are an American [[rhythm and blues]]/[[rock and roll]] vocal group who had a string of hits in the late 1950s. Beginning with "[[Searchin']]" and "[[Young Blood (The Coasters song)|Young Blood]]" in 1956, their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Leiber and Stoller]].<ref name=pc13/> Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream [[doo-wop]], their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo-wop legacy through the 1960s.  They were the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/coasters|title=The Coasters &#124; Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
The Coasters were formed on October 12, 1955, when two of [[The Robins]], a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]–based [[rhythm and blues|rhythm-and-blues]] group, joined [[Atlantic Records]]. They were dubbed The Coasters because they went from the west coast to the east. The Robins included [[Carl Gardner]] and [[Bobby Nunn (doo-wop musician)|Bobby Nunn]].<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=49/50}}</ref> The original Coasters were Gardner, Nunn, [[Billy Guy]], [[Leon Hughes]] (who was replaced by [[Young Jessie]] on a couple of their early Los Angeles recordings), and the guitarist [[Adolph Jacobs]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Jacobs left the group in 1959.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

The songwriting team of [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]] started [[Spark Records]] and in 1955 produced "Smokey Joe's Cafe" for the Robins<ref name=pc13>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19762/m1/ |title=Show 13 – Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' Roll in the Late Fifties. [Part 3&#93; : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |year=1969 |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref> (their sixth single with Leiber and Stoller). The record was popular enough for [[Atlantic Records]] to offer Leiber and Stoller an independent production contract to produce the Robins for Atlantic. Only two of the Robins—Gardner and Nunn—were willing to make the move to Atlantic, recording their first songs in the same studio as the Robins had done (Master Recorders).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In late 1957, Nunn and Hughes moved to New York and joined with [[Cornell Gunter]] and [[Will "Dub" Jones]] to form The Coasters.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The new quartet was from then on stationed in New York, although all had Los Angeles roots.

The Coasters' association with Leiber and Stoller was an immediate success.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Together they created a string of good-humored "storytelling" hits that are some of the most entertaining from the original era of rock and roll.<ref name=pc13/> According to Leiber and Stoller, getting the humor to come through on the records often required more recording "takes" than for a typical musical number.<ref name=pc13/>

Their first single, "[[Down in Mexico]]", was an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hit in 1956.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The following year, the Coasters crossed over to the pop chart in a big way with the double-sided "[[Young Blood (The Coasters song)|Young Blood]]"/"[[Searchin']]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Searchin'" was the group's first U.S. Top 10 hit,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and topped the R&B chart for 13 weeks, becoming the biggest R&B single of 1957 (all were recorded in Los Angeles).

"[[Yakety Yak]]" (recorded in New York), featuring [[King Curtis]] on tenor [[saxophone]], included the famous lineup of Gardner, Guy, Jones, and Gunter, and became the act's only national number one single, topping both the pop and R&B charts.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The next single, "[[Charlie Brown (The Coasters song)|Charlie Brown]]", reached number two on both charts.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> It was followed by "[[Along Came Jones (song)|Along Came Jones]]", "[[Poison Ivy (1959 song)|Poison Ivy]]" (number 1 for almost two months on the R&B chart), and "[[Little Egypt (Ying-Yang)]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Changing popular tastes and changes in the group's line-up contributed to a lack of hits in the 1960s.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> During this time, [[Billy Guy]] was also working on solo projects; the New York singer [[Vernon Harrell]] was brought in to replace him for stage performances. Later members included [[Earl Carroll (vocalist)|Earl "Speedo" Carroll]] (lead of [[the Cadillacs]]), [[Ronnie Bright]] (the bass voice on [[Johnny Cymbal]]'s "[[Mr. Bass Man]]"), [[Jimmy Norman]], and guitarist Thomas "Curley" Palmer. The Coasters signed with [[Columbia Records]]' [[Date Records|Date]] label in 1966, reuniting with Leiber and Stoller (who had parted ways with Atlantic Records in 1963), but never regained their former fame.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1971, the Coasters had a minor chart entry with "[[Love Potion No. 9 (song)|Love Potion No. 9]]", a song that Leiber and Stoller had written for the Coasters, but instead gave to [[the Clovers]] in 1959. In Britain, a 1994 [[Volkswagen]] TV advertisement used the group's "Sorry But I'm Gonna Have to Pass", which led to a minor chart placement in that country.

In 1987, the Coasters became the first group inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], crediting the members of the 1958 configuration. The Coasters also joined the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

Several groups used the name in the 1970s, touring throughout the country, though original member [[Carl Gardner]] held the legal rights to it.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Gardner continued to tour with the Coasters and made many attempts to stop bogus groups with no connection to the original group using the name. In late 2005, Carl's son Carl Gardner Jr. took over as lead with the group when his father retired. The Coasters' line-up then consisted of Carl Gardner Jr., J. W. Lance, Primo Candelara, and Eddie Whitfield. Carl Jr. later left this group and has started his own group with Curley Palmer. Carl's widow Veta owns the rights to the Coasters name.

[[Leon Hughes]] is the last surviving member of the original Coasters and performs with his own group. Some of the former members suffered tragic ends. The saxophonist [[King Curtis]] (the "fifth Coaster") was stabbed to death by two [[Substance dependence|junkie]]s outside his apartment building in 1971. Cornelius Gunter was shot to death while sitting in a Las Vegas parking garage in 1990. Nate Wilson, a member of one of Gunter's offshoot Coasters groups, was shot and his body dismembered in 1980.

Former manager Patrick Cavanaugh was convicted of the murder, which took place after Wilson threatened to notify authorities of Cavanaugh's intent to buy furniture with stolen checks. Cavanaugh was convicted of the murder and given the death sentence in 1984, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died at 60 in 2006, in [[Ely State Prison]], in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-11-Tue-2006/news/6807731.html |title=News – Ex-Coasters Manager Dies at Ely State Prison |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=2006-04-11 |access-date=2011-01-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221102349/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-11-Tue-2006/news/6807731.html |archive-date=2011-02-21}}</ref>

The Coasters continue to appear regularly on "oldies" shows and PBS specials.

Carl Gardner published his autobiography, ''Carl Gardner: Yakety Yak I Fought Back: My Life with the Coasters'', in 2007.

The Coasters' recordings produced by Leiber and Stoller for Date/King (1966–1972) were released on the CD ''Down Home'' by Varèse Vintage (Varèse Sarabande) in 2007. The complete Atco recordings (1954–1966) were released in a four-CD set, ''There's a Riot Goin' On: The Coasters on Atco'', by Rhino, also in 2007.
