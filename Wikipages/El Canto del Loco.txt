'''El Canto del Loco''' (''The Singing of the Madman'' in English) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[pop rock]] band, although its members recognize that some of their songs are more in the style of [[power pop]].<ref name="elcantodelloco">{{cite web|url = http://www.elcantodelloco.com/|title = El Canto del Loco - Disco|access-date = 15 April 2008|publisher = elcantodelloco.com|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022043508/http://www.elcantodelloco.com/|archive-date = 22 October 2007|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The name of the band comes from the song ''[[El Canto del Gallo]]'' by [[Radio Futura]].

The group sometimes known through the abbreviation '''ECDL''' was created in 1994 by [[Dani Martín (singer)|Dani Martín]] and [[Ivan Ganchegui]] (who left the group in 2002) although the final line up would not come together until years later.  Influenced mainly by other Spanish groups from the 1980s and with five studio albums, ''El Canto del Loco'' has gone on to sell more than a million albums,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/03/27/cultura/1206638892.html |title=El Canto del Loco enseña cuerpo y alma en 'Personas', su nuevo álbum de estudio|first=Cristina |last=Ruiz |work=El Mundo|date=27 March 2008 |language=es | access-date=11 February 2011}}</ref> making them one of the most successful bands on the Spanish music scene in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ideal.es/almeria/20080406/cultura/apos-canto-loco-apos-20080406.html|title = El Canto del Loco revoluciona al público en el Teatro de El Ejido |access-date=19 April 2008|author = Pedrosa, M.J.|publisher = [[Diario Ideal]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.los40.com/articulo/entrevistas/Canto/Loco/ideologia/sello/hacer/todo/malo/nos/han/hecho/l40actn03/20080404l40l40ent_2/Tes/|title = El Canto del Loco: "La ideología de nuestro sello es no hacer todo lo malo que nos han hecho" |access-date=19 April 2008|author1=De la Rúa, Álvaro  |author2=Herrero, Nacho|date = 4 April 2008|publisher = [[Los 40 principales]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/04/10/cultura/1207843548.html|title = Anatomía de una gira |access-date=19 April 2008|author = Blánquez, Javier|date = 11 April 2008|newspaper = [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}</ref>

== History of the group ==
=== Origins ===
El Canto del Loco began in 1994 when Dani Martín was studying at the Cristina Rota School of Dramatic Arts.<ref name="El País">{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/portada/salto/cuerdo/locos/elpepucul/20080406elpepspor_8/Tes|title = El salto más cuerdo de los locos |access-date=7 April 2008|author = Abril, Guillermo|date = 6 April 2008|publisher = [[El País (Spain)|El País]]}}</ref> There, he met Iván Ganchegui, a guitarist, and their shared musical tastes resulted in the formation of the band.  Both were fans of Radio Futura and in particular of their song ''El canto del gallo'' (The Song of the Rooster), which led them to name the group El Canto del Loco.<ref name="click2music">{{cite web|url=http://www.click2music.es/vermasinfo.asp?id=675 |title=El Canto del Loco - Más información |access-date=7 April 2008 |publisher=click2music from [[Sony BMG]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209003732/http://www.click2music.es/vermasinfo.asp?id=675 |archive-date=9 December 2007 }}</ref> At this time the group also included a female [[drummer]], a [[bassist]] and another guitarist. However, the latter soon left the group because of other commitments,<ref name="click2music" /> and the day before their first concert David Otero, Dani's cousin, joined the group as a substitute.<ref name="El País" />

The drummer and bassist also decided to leave the group not long after. The band's original drummer was replaced by Jandro Velázquez, an electrician,<ref name="El País" /> who was the son of friends of Dani's parents and who he first met in a [[flamenco]] competition.<ref name="click2music" /> The position of bassist was filled by Chema Ruiz who was studying [[physiotherapy]] at the same university as David and who was a friend of one of his friends.<ref name="El País" /> With this line-up the band started to meet in a [[warehouse]] in the [[Algete]] area of [[Madrid]] in order to rehearse and their friends would act as critics.<ref name="El País" />

=== Beginnings and first albums ===
A year later the group recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] record, which they sent to different [[record company|record companies]]. However, it was only when Dani met the [[record producer]] Pedro del Moral that they got their first opportunity.<ref name="click2music" /> Moral listened to the demo and took it to the [[Ariola]] record company (currently [[Sony BMG]]), where Paco Martín, who had discovered groups such as Radio Futura and [[Hombres G]], heard it. The group then received a call from Martín, who proposed a trial [[concert]] along with two other groups, with the objective that the record company would sign one of them. Despite the fact that the concert was not very good El Canto del Loco were eventually signed to the record label.<ref name="El País" />

The group's first [[studio album]] went on sale on 16 June 2000, produced by Alejo Stivel, the former singer with the Spanish group [[Tequila (band)|Tequila]]. Before this album went on sale it was suggested that the group change their name, with other suggestions including "Superratones" (Super Rats), "Los móviles" (The Mobiles) and "La dulce sonrisa de Lulú" (Lulú's Sweet Smile). However, the group decided to keep their name and for this reason the first album was also called ''El Canto del Loco''.<ref name="El País" />

[[Image:Chema de El Canto del Loco.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Jandro Velázquez (left) and Chema Ruiz (right) during a concert.]]
The arrival of Nigel Walker as producer produced a change in direction for the group and their second album, called ''A contracorriente'' (Against the Flow), was released on 1 March 2002, which had a more mature style.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/pais/vasco/Artistas/foraneos/variedad/musical/elpepiesppvs/20020426elpvas_28/Tes|title = Artistas foráneos y variedad musical |access-date=11 April 2008|author = Cubillo, Igor|date = 26 April 2002|publisher = [[El País (Spain)|El País]]}}</ref> In the same year El Canto del Loco also received a nomination at the MTV Europe Music Awards for "Best Spanish Artist", although the group [[Amaral (band)|Amaral]] actually won the award.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.los40.com/articulo/noticias/Eminem/Kylie/Minogue/triunfadores/premios/MTV/otorgados/Barcelona/l40actn01/20021115l40l40not_1/Tes/|title = Eminem, triunfador de los MTV Europe Music Awards otorgados en Barcelona |access-date=7 May 2008|date = 26 April 2002|publisher = [[Los 40 principales]]}}</ref>

=== Estados de ánimo (2003-2004) ===
Following the voluntary exit of Iván Ganchegui from the band, the rest of the group decided to take a break. However, a few days later David and Dani had both written several songs on their own and it was decided to record them using the four remaining members of the band. After a delay due to the busy work schedule of Nigel Walker, who was working on the new album by [[La Oreja de Van Gogh]], the group recorded their third studio album which they called ''Estados de ánimo'' (States of Mind) and which went on sale on 26 May 2003.<ref name="El País (2)">{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espectaculos/Canto/Loco/perfecciona/pop/fresco/solido/Estados/animo/tercer/disco/elpepiept/20030715elpepiesp_8/Tes/|title = El Canto del Loco perfecciona su pop fresco y sólido con Estados de ánimo, su tercer disco |access-date=20 April 2008|author = Martín, Fernando|date = 15 July 2003|publisher = [[El País (Spain)|El País]]}}</ref>

In collaboration with a number of other singers, El Canto del Loco played on the song ''Latido urbano'' (Urban Beat), which was the [[single (music)|single]] taken from the album and which went on sale in November of that year. The profits from the record went to children's [[oncology]] hospitals run by the ''Asociación Española contra el Cáncer'' Spanish Cancer Association.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.los40.com/articulo/noticias/Diversos/artistas/colaboraran/nuevo/proyecto/discografico/Tony/Aguilar/l40actnot/20031007l40l40not_7/Tes/|title = Diversos artistas colaborarán en el nuevo proyecto discográfico de Tony Aguilar |access-date=12 April 2008|author = González, Tatiana|date = 8 October 2003|publisher = [[Los 40 principales]]}}</ref> They also recorded another of the songs on the album along with Aguilar himself, called ''Casi un Universo'' (Almost a Universe).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.los40.com/articulo/noticias/Principales/estrena/Latino/urbano/single/solidario/Tony/Aguilar/l40actnot/20031105l40l40not_9/Tes/|title = Los 40 Principales estrena Latino urbano, el single solidario de Tony Aguilar |access-date=12 April 2008|author = E.S.|date = 5 November 2003|publisher = [[Los 40 principales]]}}</ref>

After finishing the ''Zapatillas'' tour and before Dani Martín started filming ''[[Yo soy la Juani]]'' (I am the Juani) directed by [[Bigas Luna]] rumours started to circulate regarding the possible break up of the group.

The group also participated in the recording of a compilation album in aid of a Telethon held by TV3. The album, which went on sale on 10 December 2006, was sold for 9 euros with the proceeds going to charities working with people suffering from chronic pain. It sold in conjunction with a number of Catalan newspapers (''[[Avui]]'', ''[[El Punt]]'', ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' and ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya]]''). The song chosen by the group was "Puede ser" (It Can Be), from their second studio album ''A Contracorriente'', but with the difference that it was sung in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] under the title ''Pot ser''.
