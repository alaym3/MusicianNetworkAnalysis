In the late 1990s, during the release of her album ''[[Bathhouse Betty]]'', Midler commented on her time performing there, "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride."<ref>{{cite news|title=Bette Midler|url=http://delveintothedivine.com/bio/bettebathhouse.html|work=Houston Voice|date=October 23, 1998|publisher=DelveIntoTheDevine.com|access-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313082552/http://delveintothedivine.com/bio/bettebathhouse.html|archive-date=March 13, 2012}}</ref>

===1972–1980: ''The Divine Miss M'' and success===
[[File:Hoffman-Midler - 1977.jpg|thumb|Midler with [[Dustin Hoffman]] on Bette Midler TV special (1977)]]
Midler released her debut album, ''The Divine Miss M,'' on [[Atlantic Records]] in December 1972. The album was co-produced by Barry Manilow, who was Bette's arranger and music conductor at the time.  It reached Billboard's Top 10 and became a million-selling Platinum-certified album,<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web| title=Gold & Platinum Searchable database-Bette Midler| url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database| publisher=Recording Industry Association of America| access-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> earning Midler the 1973 Grammy Award for Best New Artist.<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web| title=Past Winners Search-Midler| url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=midler&title=&year=All&genre=All| publisher=Grammy.com| access-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> It featured three hit singles—"[[Do You Wanna Dance?]]", "[[Friends (Bette Midler song)|Friends]]", and "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]"—the third of which became Midler's first No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit. "Bugle Boy" became a successful rock cover of the classic swing tune originally introduced and popularized in 1941 by the [[Andrews Sisters]], to whom Midler has repeatedly referred as her idols and inspiration, as far back as her first appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What else did you record?{{'"}}<ref name="ReferenceA">Sforza, John: "Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages.</ref> During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle.

In 1977, Midler's first television special, whose title, ''Ol' Red Hair is Back'', was a takeoff on [[Frank Sinatra]]'s ''[[Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back]]'', premiered, featuring guest stars [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. It went on to win the ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/bette-midler |title=Bette Midler |publisher=Emmys.com |access-date=December 18, 2012}}</ref> for Outstanding Special&nbsp;— Comedy-Variety or Music.

[[File:Bette Midler (1981).jpg|thumb|1981, in [[Amsterdam]] promoting the film ''[[Divine Madness (film)|Divine Madness]]'' (1980)]]
Midler made her first motion picture in 1979, starring in the 1960s-era [[rock and roll]] tragedy ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]'', as a drug-addicted rock star modeled after [[Janis Joplin]].<ref name=tca/> That year, she also released her fifth studio album, ''[[Thighs and Whispers]].'' Midler's first foray into disco was a commercial and critical failure and went on to be her all-time lowest charting album, peaking at No. 65 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart.<ref name="Thighs">{{cite web| title=Thighs and Wispers| url=http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/album-09.htm| publisher=betteontheboards.com| access-date=July 25, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717134410/http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/album-09.htm| archive-date=July 17, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Soon afterward, she began a world concert tour, with one of her shows in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] being filmed and released as the concert film ''[[Divine Madness (film)|Divine Madness]]'' (1980).

Her performance in ''The Rose'' earned her a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], a role for which she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Comedy or Musical).<ref name=tca/> The film's acclaimed soundtrack album sold over two million copies in the United States alone, earning a Double Platinum certification.<ref name="RIAA"/>  The single version of the title song, which [[Amanda McBroom]] had written and composed, held the No. 1 position on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart for five consecutive weeks and reached No. 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. It earned Midler her first Gold single<ref name="RIAA"/> and won the Grammy award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.<ref name="Grammy"/>

===1981–1989: "Wind Beneath My Wings", ''Beaches'', and chart comeback===
Midler worked on the troubled comedy project ''[[Jinxed (1982 film)|Jinxed!]]'' in 1981. However, during production, there was friction with co-star [[Ken Wahl]] and the film's director, [[Don Siegel]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Released in 1982, the film was a major flop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bette Midler|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=bettemidler.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> Midler did not appear in any other films until 1986; however, she was an early choice for Miss Hannigan in the 1982 film ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]''.  During those four years, she concentrated on her music career and in 1983, released the album ''[[No Frills (Bette Midler album)|No Frills]]'', produced by [[Chuck Plotkin]], who was best known for his work with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The album included three single releases: the ballad "[[All I Need to Know (Emma Bunton song)|All I Need to Know]]", a cover of Detroit native [[Marshall Crenshaw]]'s "[[You're My Favorite Waste of Time]]"—which Midler fell in love with after flipping his 45 of "[[Someday Someway]]"{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}—and Midler's take on the [[Rolling Stones]]' "[[Beast of Burden (song)|Beast of Burden]]". She also released an all-comedy album (with a few songs tied into the comedy) called ''[[Mud Will Be Flung Tonight]]'' in 1985.

Midler performed on [[USA for Africa]]'s 1985 fund-raising single "[[We Are the World]]", and participated at the [[Live Aid]] event at [[JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="Jet">{{Cite news| title={{-'}}We Are The World' Tune Brings Out The Best of America's 46 Stars| page=16| work=Jet| date=February 18, 1985| publisher=Johnson Publishing Company| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbMDAAAAMBAJ&q=jackson%20%22we%20are%20the%20world%22&pg=PA16| access-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> Also in 1985, she signed a multi-picture deal with the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], where she starred in a string of successful films produced by the studio's newly formed [[Touchstone Pictures]] division.

===2000–2005: ''Bette'' sitcom, tribute albums, and ''Kiss My Brass'' tour===
Midler starred in her own sitcom in 2000, ''[[Bette (TV series)|Bette]]'', which featured Midler playing herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing on [[CBS]], initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001.<ref name="abcnews-2001">{{cite web|title=CBS Reportedly Cancels 'Bette'|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=108743&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=March 6, 2001|access-date=February 18, 2010}}</ref> Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-star [[Kevin Dunn]] whose departure was attributed to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler by the media.<ref name="abcnews-2001"/> However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded a [[27th People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for her performance in the show and received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] nomination the following year.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Also in 2000, Midler made an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] in [[Nancy Meyers]]' fantasy rom–com ''[[What Women Want]]'', starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Helen Hunt]].<ref name="www-variety"/> In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women's [[Telepathy|thoughts]].<ref name="www-variety">{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796916?refcatid=31|title=''What Women Want'' review|work=Variety|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=December 10, 2000|access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nancy|last=Griffin|title=Diane Keaton Meets Both Her Matches|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/movies/film-diane-keaton-meets-both-her-matches.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2003|access-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|title=No Complications For Meyers|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/01/01/nothing_complicated_about_director_meyerss_attention_to_detail/|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 1, 2010|access-date=February 18, 2010}}</ref>

The same year Midler starred in ''[[Isn't She Great]]'' and ''[[Drowning Mona]]''. In [[Andrew Bergman]]'s ''Isn't She Great'', a highly fictionalized account of the life and career of author [[Jacqueline Susann]], she played alongside [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Stockard Channing]], portraying Susann with her early struggles as an aspiring actress relentlessly hungry for fame, her relationship with [[press agent]] Irving Mansfield, her success as the author of ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'', and her battle with and subsequent death from breast cancer.

After nearly three decades of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from the [[Warner Music Group]] in 2001. Following a reported long-standing feud with Barry Manilow, the two joined forces after many years in 2003 to record ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook]]''. Now signed to [[Columbia Records]], the album was an instant success, being certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. One of the ''Clooney Songbook'' selections, "This Ole House", became Midler's first Christian radio single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a Grammy the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Complete list of 46th annual Grammy winners and nominees|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-grammys-nominees,0,3626237.story|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Associated Press|access-date=February 11, 2012}}</ref>

Throughout 2003 and 2004, Midler toured the United States in her new show, ''[[Kiss My Brass]]'', to sell-out audiences. Also in 2004, she appeared in a supporting role in [[Frank Oz]]' [[science fiction film|science fiction]] satire ''[[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|The Stepford Wives]]'', a [[remake]] of the [[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|1975 film of the same name]] also based on [[The Stepford Wives|the Ira Levin novel]]. Also starring [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Glenn Close]], Midler played Bobbie Markowitz, a writer and recovering alcoholic. The project underwent numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule, with reports of problems on-set between director Oz and the actors being rampant in the press. Oz later blamed Midler — who was amid recording her next album and rehearsing for her tour — for being under a lot of stress by other projects and making "the mistake of bringing her stress on the set."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/frank-oz.s-tense-remake|title=Nicole Kidman-Frank Oz's Tense Remake |publisher=contactmusic.com |date=February 10, 2003}}</ref> While the original book and film had tremendous cultural impact, the remake was marked by poor reviews by many critics, and a financial loss of approximately $40 million at the box office.<ref name="BoxOfficeMojo">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=stepfordwives.htm |title=The Stepford Wives (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=September 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="TheNumbers">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/STEPF.php |title=Stepford Wives 2004 budget details |publisher=The Numbers |access-date=September 20, 2010}}</ref>

Also starring Hunt along with [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Colin Firth]], the comedy-drama film tells the story of a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show, played by Midler, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Critical response to the film was mixed; whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues.

Midler has written several books, including ''Saga of Baby Divine'',  ''A View from a Broad, Bette Midler Greatest Hits: Experience the Divine, The Wind Beneath My Wings.''<ref>{{Cite web|last=ThriftBooks|title=Bette Midler Books {{!}} List of books by author Bette Midler|url=https://www.thriftbooks.com/a/bette-midler/226496/|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=ThriftBooks|language=en}}</ref> In 2020 she published a children's book entitled ''The Tale of the Mandarin Duck'', based on the story of a rare duck seen in [[Central Park]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bette Midler writes kids' book about Central Park duck 'that had enchanted an entire city'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/08/14/bette-midler-writes-kids-book-central-park-duck-new-york/3373426001/|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=USA Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

She played Miriam Nessler, a retired teacher from New York, in HBO's ''[[Coastal Elites]]'' by [[Paul Rudnick]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Bette Midler on "Coastal Elites"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/bette-midler-on-coastal-elites|access-date=September 21, 2020|magazine=The New Yorker|language=en-us}}</ref>

As [[Casey Kasem]] reported on the ''[[American Top 40]]'' broadcast of August 11, 1973, Midler has been acclaimed as, "She's faster than speeding bullet, is louder than [[Ethel Merman]], has a bigger nose than [[Barbra Streisand]], is shorter than [[Mickey Rooney]], and more outrageous than [[Mick Jagger]].  She is an eclectic ripoff artist who takes off on 40s musicals, [[Carmen Miranda]] and [[the Andrews Sisters]]. She's the Divine Miss M!"

==Personal life==
Midler married artist [[Martin von Haselberg]] on December 16, 1984. Their daughter, actress [[Sophie von Haselberg]], was born on November 14, 1986.<ref name="JWA">{{cite web| url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/midler-bette| title=Bette Midler| publisher=Jewish Women's Archive| access-date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>

==Charity work==
In 1991, Midler was an early sponsor of the [[Adopt-a-Highway]], paying $2,000 a month for a crew to clean up a {{convert|2|mi}} section of the [[Ventura Freeway]] in [[Burbank, California]].  Signs at both ends of the section read "Litter Removal Next 2 Miles, Bette Midler."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bootlegbetty.com/2010/04/29/betteback-midler-begins-adopt-a-highway/ |title=BetteBack: Midler Begins Adopt-A-Highway |publisher=BootLeg Betty |date=April 29, 2010 |access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>  The location was so prominent that it became fodder for her 1993 guest appearance on the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]",  where she is seen picking up trash along a stretch of highway she has adopted, and causes car crashes for drivers who deliberately litter. In 1995, she carried the same idea to the east coast, adopting a section of the [[Long Island Expressway]] and [[Bronx River Parkway]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Russo |first=Tom |url=https://www.ew.com/article/1995/06/16/bette-midler-has-adopted-highway |title=Bette Midler has adopted-a-highway |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 16, 1995 |access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>

Midler founded the [[New York Restoration Project]] (NYRP) in 1995, a non-profit organization with the goal of revitalizing neglected neighborhood parks in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods of New York City.<ref name=tca/> These include [[Highbridge Park]], [[Fort Washington Park (New York)|Fort Washington Park]], and [[Fort Tryon Park]] in upper Manhattan and [[Roberto Clemente State Park]] and ''Bridge Park'' in the [[Bronx]].<ref name="NYRP">{{cite web| title=About NYRP| publisher=New York Restoration Project| url=http://www.nyrp.org/About/our_mission_and_strategic_plan_| access-date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>

When the city planned in 1991 to auction 114 [[community gardens]] for commercial development, Midler led a coalition of greening organizations to save them. NYRP took ownership of 60 of the most neglected plots. Today, Midler and her organization work with local volunteers and community groups to ensure that these gardens are kept safe, clean and vibrant. In 2003, Midler opened Swindler Cove Park, a new {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} public park on the [[Harlem River]] shore featuring specially designed educational facilities and the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse, the first community [[Sport rowing|rowing]] facility to be built on the Harlem River in more than 100 years. The organization offers free in-school and after-school [[environmental education]] programming to students from high-poverty [[Title I]] schools.<ref name="NYRP"/>

In 2001 after 9/11, she established programs run by her foundation which helps wounded service members and their families by providing them resources, including custom homes. One of these programs helps service members recovering from trauma, injury and loss. Also, ever since the first Gulf War she goes to the USO and on bases to show her gratitude to military members by serving them meals just before deployment.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= December 1, 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/us/bette-midler-fast-facts/ |title=Bette Midler Fast Facts |website=CNN |access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>
