'''Jona''' is a former municipality in the ''Wahlkreis'' (constituency) of [[See-Gaster (Wahlkreis)|See-Gaster]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[St. Gallen (canton)|St. Gallen]] in [[Switzerland]].

== Geography ==
[[File:ETH-BIB-Rapperswil-Jona, Hafen, Bahnhof-Inlandflüge-LBS MH01-001668.tif|thumb|Aerial view by [[Walter Mittelholzer]] (1919)]]
Jona is located at the eastern shore of [[Obersee (Zürichsee)|''Obersee'']]. It has been part of the municipality of [[Rapperswil-Jona]] since 2007, as before comprising the villages of [[Bollingen, Switzerland|Bollingen]], [[Busskirch]], Curtiberg, [[Kempraten]]-Lenggis, Wagen and [[Wurmsbach, Switzerland|Wurmsbach]] ([[Wurmsbach Abbey]]).

== History ==
The river [[Jona (river)|Jona]] flows through the municipality in the Lake Zürich, the settlement is named after the river, first recorded in Latinized form ''Johanna'' in AD 834, as ''super Johannam fluvium''. The Middle High German form ''Jonun'' is recorded 1243.<ref>{{HLS|1370|author=Alois Stadler|date=2008}}; Daniel Gut, ''Lunnern. Londons Zwilling im Reusstal: Eine sprach- und kulturgeschichtliche Verortung von Siedlungsnamen'' (2013), S. 48.</ref>
The river name was likely adapted into Alemannic (Old High German) around the 8th century from a Gallo-Roman ''*Jauna'' as a weakly inflecting feminine ''*Jōna(n)'', yielding modern [[Zürich German|dialectal]] ''Jōne(n)''.

In 1350, Rapperswil and its [[Rapperswil Castle|castle]] was widely destroyed by [[Rudolf Brun]], and the ''Herrschaft Rapperswil'' – Rapperswil and some surrounding villages including Jona – was acquired by the [[Habsburg]] family.

After 1803's [[Act of Mediation]], Rapperswil and Jona joined the [[canton of St. Gallen]], and the former ''Herrschaft Rapperswil'' was split into the municipalities [[Rapperswil (St. Gall)|Rapperswil]] and Jona. Jona, as municipality, was established in 1803 ''around the former boundaries of the city of Rapperswil'', comprising the small rest of the former Herrschaft Rapperswil and the villages of Bollingen, Busskirch, Curtiberg, Kempraten-Lenggis, Wagen and Wurmsbach.

In the early 19th century, Jona river's [[hydropower]] was used for a larger number of [[watermill]]s along the small river. As a renewable source, the river was important for [[industrialization]] of the rapidly growing village.

On January 1, 2007, the municipalities of [[Rapperswil]] and Jona merged to form a new political entity: [[Rapperswil-Jona]] has a population of 25,777 (December 2007). This makes it the second largest town in the canton after the capital [[St. Gallen]] itself.

== Transportation ==
The town's bus service has been provided, since 2008, by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee und Oberland]] (VZO).<ref name=vzomarket>{{cite web | url = http://www.vzo.ch/marktgebiet_de.cfm | title = Marktgebiet | language = de | trans-title = Market area | publisher = VZO | access-date = 2013-10-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004082654/http://www.vzo.ch/marktgebiet_de.cfm | archive-date = 2013-10-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Jona railway station area will be newly constructed by probably the end 2015, as well as the bus station situated nearby.
