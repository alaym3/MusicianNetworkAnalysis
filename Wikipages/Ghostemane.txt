Ghostemane's merging of trap and metal gained him popularity on [[SoundCloud]]. In 2018, Ghostemane released his seventh [[studio album]], ''N/O/I/S/E'', which was highly anticipated in the underground music scene<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/ghostsmane-surprise-releases-new-album-noise-week-early|title=Ghostsmane Surprise-Releases New Album 'N/O/I/S/E' a Week Early|date=October 10, 2018|work=Revolver|access-date=November 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref> due to its heavy influence from [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[nu metal]] groups.

==Early life==
Eric Whitney was born on April 15, 1991 in Lake Worth, Florida to parents from New York.<ref name=":2">{{Citation|last=Kinda Neat|title=KINDA NEAT EPISODE 110: GHOSTEMANE|date=July 6, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNWAtG7B_kI|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> Whitney grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida. As a teenager, he was mainly interested in [[hardcore punk]] music. He learned to play the guitar and performed in several bands,<ref name="skullcandy">{{cite web|url=https://stayloud.skullcandy.com/stories/ghostemane/|title=Ghostemane's Hardcore Past Inspired His Underground Rap Presence|publisher=Skullcandy|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> including Nemesis and Seven Serpents.<ref name=":32"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wenke |first1=Carrick |title=Underground Hype: GHOSTEMANE |url=http://www.theblowup.co/underground-hype-ghostemane |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> He also played football while he was in high school, saying he was practically forced to by his father, who died when Whitney was seventeen.<ref name=":2" />

Whitney was introduced to rap music when he was the guitarist in the hardcore punk band Nemesis and a band mate introduced him to [[Memphis rap]].<ref name=":32"/>

==Career==
Prior to his musical career, Whitney worked in several [[Business-to-business|B2B sales]] positions.<ref name=":2" /> In 2015, Whitney moved to Los Angeles, California due to him not musically thriving in Southern Florida. He also gave up his employment.<ref name="skullcandy" /> Meeting up with JGRXXN, Whitney joined his collective Schemaposse, which included artists such as [[Craig Xen]] and [[Lil Peep]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theblowup.co/underground-hype-ghostemane|title=Underground Hype: GHOSTEMANE – The Blow Up – A Place for the Independent Artist|website=www.theblowup.co|language=en-US|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref>

In April 2016, after just 1 year with the group, Whitney left Schemaposse.<ref>{{Citation|last=No Jumper|title=No Jumper - The Schema Posse Interview|date=April 18, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI_a8EwrmWU|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> He subsequently released his self-produced album "Blackmage" and his first cinematic music video with his single "John Dee". Whitney eventually began to associate with fellow Florida rapper [[Pouya (rapper)|Pouya]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2016/11/14/music-for-the-aspiring-occultist-ghostemane-and-the-collision-of-metal-and-underground-rap/|title=Music For The Aspiring Occultist: Ghostemane and the Collision of Metal and Underground Rap - Heavy Blog Is Heavy|website=www.heavyblogisheavy.com|language=en-US|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> Pouya released the video for "1000 Rounds" with Ghostemane in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/pouya-and-ghostemane-1000-bulletsinmyass-video-new-video.41444.html|title=Pouya & Ghostemane "1000 Rounds" Video|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> The video quickly went viral and as of May 2021, has over 29 million views.<ref>{{Citation|last=Buffet Boys|title=Pouya x Ghostemane - 1000 Rounds [Music Video]|date=April 27, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia8xqNWa0eY|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref>

In late 2017, Whitney saw greater success when art collective TRASH GANG created and released their 1930s cartoon edit music video for his song Mercury: Retrograde. The cartoon was a 1933 Betty Boop short, [[Snow-White_(1933_film)|Snow-White]], featuring [[Cab_Calloway|Cab Calloway]] as Koko singing St. James Infirmary. The video has since climbed to over 361 million views, making his most well known single.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GHOSTEMANE - Mercury|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31j4DIpgY9U|url-status=live|access-date=5 October 2021|website=YouTube}}</ref>

In October 2018 he teamed up with Zubin to release a track titled ''Broken''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/10/16/ghostemane-zubin-parv0-broken-tour|title=Ghostemane and Zubin team up on "Broken"|work=The FADER|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
Also in 2018, he released his seventh studio album, ''N/O/I/S/E'', in which many of the songs are influenced by [[industrial metal]], [[nu metal]], [[Metallica]], [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]]. In May 2020, he unveiled his latest project, a lo-fi [[black metal]] band called Baader-Meinhof, of which he is the sole member (credited as Eric Ghoste).<ref>[https://www.revolvermag.com/music/ghostemanes-black-metal-project-hear-baader-meinhoffs-sinister-new-ep-0 Ghostemane's Black-Metal Project: Hear Baader-Meinhoff's Sinister New EP] Revolver.
