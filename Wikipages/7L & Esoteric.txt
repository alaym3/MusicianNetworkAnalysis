==History==

=== Early Career (1993-1996) ===
The duo formed in 1993 when Esoteric DJed a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] show at a college radio station (WMWM) north of [[Boston]]. 7L, a DJ and producer who listened to the show, contacted Esoteric in the interest of collaborating. The two found they shared a common love of [[the golden age of hip-hop]] and decided to form a group.

After performing for some time in the Boston/Cambridge underground, the duo released their first single in 1996 as '''God Complex''' with MC Karma. The [[B-side]], "Secret Wars", gained a lot of attention as Esoteric paid tribute to the heroes of [[Marvel Comics]] in rhyme form. This led to the release of the ''Rebel Alliance'' LP, featuring acts such as Virtuoso, [[Mr. Lif]], and Force Five. Also at this time, the two dropped the God Complex moniker and became known as simply 7L & Esoteric.

=== ''Rebel Alliance'' & ''Speaking Real Words'' (1997-1999) ===
Soon after, 7L & Esoteric put out their first 12” with re-mastered versions of their ''Rebel Alliance'' songs "Protocol" and "Be Alert". "Be Alert", the B-side on the record, began to receive significant radio play, due to its unique sampling of the [[Transformers]] TV theme song.  The track, which was produced by Beyonder, became very popular in the underground scene, leading the duo to several European tours, major label interest, and becoming one of the first New England hip-hop acts to appear on the Stretch & Bobbito WKCR radio show in NYC and get spins on the Wake Up Show with MTV's Sway & King Tech. URB Magazine chose 7L & Esoteric for their "Next 100" issue in 1997.

The duo then dropped the “Def Rhymes” single through Landspeed Distribution which earned them press in [[The Source (magazine)|the Source]]. "Def Rhymes" was also featured on the EP ''Speaking Real Words'', released in 1999. The album also featured [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[Inspectah Deck]] on the title track. During promotion for the 12", Esoteric had spent time in Philadelphia and formed the supergroup [[Army of the Pharaohs]] with [[Jedi Mind Tricks]]' frontman [[Vinnie Paz]]. Esoteric would appear three times on Jedi Mind Tricks' breakthrough album ''Violent By Design'' in 2000.

===''The Soul Purpose'', ''Dangerous Connection'' & ''DC2: Bars of Death'' (2000-2005)===
7L & Esoteric released their debut LP ''The Soul Purpose'' in the summer of 2001. The single "Call Me E.S." charted at #83 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hip-hop singles chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/431993/7l-esoteric/chart |title=7L & Esoteric - Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> The album received the Boston Music Award for “Best Hip-Hop Album,” {{citation needed|date=June 2007}} and led to the duo headlining tours of the United States and Europe. Upon their return, they recorded and released their second LP in the fall of 2002 entitled ''Dangerous Connection'' featuring Jedi Mind Tricks' Stoupe, Vinnie Paz, J-Live, Apathy, and others.

After taking a break from recording, the duo released their third LP ''DC2: Bars of Death'' in the spring of 2004 with [[Babygrande Records]]. The album received overall positive reviews and was lauded by long-time fans.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} In 2006, Esoteric compiled an album entitled "Moment of Rarities" which was also released with Babygrande. This CD was a collection of previously unreleased tracks. Esoteric has stated that this CD was put out to fulfill contractual obligations with Babygrande Records.

=== ''A New Dope'' & ''1212'' (2006-2010) ===
In 2006, ''[[A New Dope]]'' was released, taking the duo in a new direction with a more electro influenced sound and the production shared between both 7L and Esoteric. The cover featured a re-creation of an [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] gallery poster, something that was later used by Complex Magazine for A$AP Rocky and Jeremy Scott. The mix of eclectic samples, including pieces of Suicide's electro-punk classic "Girl" ("3 Minute Classic"), Angelo Badalamenti's theme to cult TV show Twin Peaks ("Perfect Person"), and the Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot duet "Bonnie And Clyde" ("Everywhere"), evokes the Dust Brothers' work on the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique according to XLR8R magazine.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jesse Serwer|title=7L & Esoteric: Path to Dopeness|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2006/07/7l-esoteric|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720030539/http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2006/07/7l-esoteric|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 20, 2008|website=XLR8R|access-date=May 18, 2015|date=August 11, 2006}}</ref> The album featured Ultramagnetic MCs' Kool Keith on the track "Daisy Cutta".

2010 saw the release of ''[[1212 (7L & Esoteric album)|1212]]'' which marked a return to their original sound, featuring [[Brand Nubian]]'s Sadat X rhyming with Esoteric on "The Handle," an ode to 1980s NBA Basketball that was recognized by ESPN.

=== ''Czarface'' & ''Every Hero Needs a Villain'' (2011-present) ===
In 2011, it was announced that 7L & Esoteric have formed a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] trio with [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[Inspectah Deck]] called [[Czarface]]<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=MCEsoteric |number=303246187065118721 |date=17 February 2013 |title=@uncle_nutty nah it's CZARFACE as the group name, and it's a self titled album }}</ref> and that they were working on a self-titled debut album.
