'''Helmet''' is an American [[alternative metal]] band from [[New York City]] formed in 1989 by vocalist and lead guitarist [[Page Hamilton]]. Helmet has had numerous lineup changes with Hamilton as the only constant member. Since 2010, the band has consisted of Hamilton, drummer Kyle Stevenson, guitarist Dan Beeman and bassist Dave Case.

Helmet has released eight studio albums and two compilation albums. After releasing their debut album, ''[[Strap It On]]'' (1990), on [[Amphetamine Reptile Records|Amphetamine Reptile]], Helmet signed to [[Interscope Records]] and released three albums for the label, including the highly successful ''[[Meantime (album)|Meantime]]'' (1992). Their next two albums ― ''[[Betty (Helmet album)|Betty]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aftertaste (album)|Aftertaste]]'' (1997) ― were also successful, but did not match the critical or popular acclaim of ''Meantime''. Helmet broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2004, and has since released four more albums ― ''[[Size Matters]]'' (2004), ''[[Monochrome (Helmet album)|Monochrome]]'' (2006), ''[[Seeing Eye Dog]]'' (2010) and ''[[Dead to the World (album)|Dead to the World]]'' (2016). The band is currently working on their ninth studio album.<ref name="newalbum">{{cite web|title=The week in music: new local jazz sampler CD release, fifth annual American Roots Revue and Ike Reilly|url=https://www.twincities.com/2019/11/22/the-week-in-music-new-local-jazz-sampler-cd-release-fifth-annual-american-roots-revue-and-ike-reilly/|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|twincities.com]]|date=November 22, 2019|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref>

===Formation and early years (1989–1991)===
Hamilton formed Helmet in early 1989 after leaving the [[alternative rock]] group [[Band of Susans]] with whom he had recorded two albums. Having originally moved to New York to study [[jazz guitar]] at the [[Manhattan School of Music]], the [[Oregon]] born guitarist recruited bassist Henry Bogdan who was also from Oregon, Australian guitarist [[Peter Mengede]] and [[Floridia|Floridian]] drummer John Stanier as the group's first official line-up.<ref name="allmusic biography">{{cite web|title=Helmet|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/helmet-mn0000572737}}</ref> Before Hamilton had settled on a name, the guitarist Peter Mengede's then-wife Reyne Cuccuro<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview - Rolling Stone|url=http://www.bluecricket.com/helmet/interviews/stone894.html|publisher=bluecricket}}</ref> suggested the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] name "[[Helmuth]]". Hamilton misinterpreted her and mistakenly believed that she was referring to the form of [[Helmet|protective gear]]. Hamilton then thought excitedly that Helmet had "sounded like a pretty cool name for a band" and opted for the Anglicized spelling. Other names taken in consideration were "Cry Ruth" and "Poly Orchids", along with the more esoteric and obscure "Tuna Lorenzo" and "Froth Albumen".<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview - Rolling Stone - Helmet|url=http://www.bluecricket.com/helmet/interviews/stone892.html|website=bluecricket}}</ref>

They were spotted by [[Tom Hazelmyer]] from the band [[Halo of Flies (band)|Halo of Flies]] guitarist and signed to Hazelmeyer's label, [[Amphetamine Reptile Records]], releasing their first [[single (music)|7 inch single]], "[[Born Annoying]]", later that year. Amphetamine Reptile released Helmet's debut studio album ''[[Strap It On]]'' in 1990, selling over 40,000 copies soon thereafter. Hazelmyer once stated that the album kept the label going through the 1990s.<ref name="Billboard 1995">{{Citation | last = Clark | first = Rick | title = Give Them One Good Region: Local Labels Congregate In Cities Where Talent Gathers | newspaper = Billboard | pages = 114 | date = 25 February 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4gsEAAAAMBAJ&q=omnium&pg=PA1 | access-date = 19 April 2015 }}</ref>

Eschewing the traditional metal image of long hair and black clothing, the band stood out with their preference for simple T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers, and short haircuts. Their atypical look was referenced in an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', in which the pair's commentary on the video for "[[Unsung (song)|Unsung]]" included the lines "That drummer looks like a regular guy" and "If you, like, saw these guys on the street, you wouldn't even know they were cool."<ref>{{cite book

===Commercial successes (1992–1998)===
The band achieved mainstream attention after signing to [[major label]] [[Interscope Records]] in early 1992. It is rumored that the members received in excess of one million dollars at signing, along with an unprecedented amount of control over their work. Their first album for Interscope, ''[[Meantime (album)|Meantime]]'', was released in 1992 and certified [[Gold album|gold]] in 1994. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide and remains Helmet's top-selling album.
[[File:John Stanier e5100801.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former drummer John Stanier]]
Helmet toured the United States, Brazil, Europe, and Asia relentlessly, generally with other AmRep recording artists. Internal tensions rose high at times. In early 1993, guitarist Peter Mengede left the band and formed [[Handsome (band)|Handsome]] which released one sole album in 1997. Mangede was replaced by [[Rob Echeverria]], guitarist from the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band Rest in Pieces. Helmet's third album, ''[[Betty (Helmet album)|Betty]]'', was released in 1994. Despite managing the band's highest-ever chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]  at number 45, the album did not sell as many copies as ''Meantime''. In 1995, the band appeared in ''[[The Jerky Boys: The Movie]]'', covering [[Black Sabbath]]'s "Symptom of the Universe" with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] making a [[cameo appearance]] as the band's manager. Later, after recording and touring in support of ''Betty'', Echeverria made an amicable departure from the band to join [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]].{{Listen

Helmet pushed on to record 1997's ''[[Aftertaste (album)|Aftertaste]]'' as a three-piece. A first version of the album had been withdrawn at the last minute in the fall of 1996 when promotional activities had already begun, delaying the disc's release to March of the following year with a new audio mix. Guitarist [[Chris Traynor]] (formerly of [[Orange 9mm]]) was recruited for the tour to support the album. The song "Exactly What You Wanted" became a moderate radio hit, the album's did not fare as well as Helmet's prior major label releases, spending a few weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and selling 135,000 copies over the next decade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The ''Aftertaste Tour'' in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last for nearly a decade. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and we found it hard to look at each other anymore"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/chats/dbchatpage0900.htm |title=Web Chat with Page Hamilton |publisher=Bowie Wonderland |date=September 28, 2000 |access-date=May 7, 2012}}</ref>

===Aftermath and subsequent projects (1999–2003)===
After the dissolution of Helmet, the members went on to different projects.

Hamilton relocated from New York to Los Angeles and became involved in a variety of projects. This included playing guitar for [[David Bowie]], doing sessions for film scores, working with composer [[Elliot Goldenthal]] on the 1999 soundtracks to ''[[In Dreams (soundtrack)|In Dreams]]'' and ''[[Titus (soundtrack)|Titus]].'' It was Hamilton's second time working with Goldenthal, the first being the 1995 soundtrack to the movie ''[[Heat (soundtrack)|Heat]]''. When working on film scores, he was part of a "guitar orchestra" called ''"Deaf Elk"''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1966119/ |title=Deaf Elk |publisher=Internet Movie Database |access-date=May 7, 2012}}</ref> with other guitarists. He periodically returned to New York to work with his band [[Gandhi (American band)|Gandhi]], which is where several of the songs appearing on ''[[Size Matters]]'' began.

Bogdan formed the Moonlighters in New York with [[Bliss Blood]], for whom he played [[steel guitar]], before returning home to Oregon to play for the Midnight Serenaders. Stanier took a break from drumming, but returned to play drums for [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]], [[The Mark of Cain (band)|The Mark of Cain]], [[Battles (band)|Battles]] and [[Primer 55]].

===Reunion (2004–present)===

After moving to Los Angeles, Hamilton began working with drummer [[John Tempesta]] (formerly of [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]) on a new project. After searching for a record label and a name for the project, Hamilton was urged by [[Jimmy Iovine]] of [[Interscope]] to release the new project under the established Helmet moniker, to which Interscope held the rights.<ref name="blab2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/page-hamilton-i-ve-heard-helmet-riffs-in-evanescence/|title=PAGE HAMILTON: 'I've Heard HELMET Riffs In EVANESCENCE'|date=December 1, 2010|website=blabbermouth.net|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Hamilton had resisted for some time, but since his relationships with Stanier and Bogdan had not improved since 1998, and his previous offers to reunite had been rebuffed or ignored, he decided to move on and release more music as Helmet without them.
[[File:Helmet.jpg|thumb|upright|Page Hamilton c. 2008]]
Chris Traynor, still on good terms with Hamilton, soon came on board to cover bass and guitar parts. With Tempesta on drums and Hamilton covering vocals and guitar, the three recorded ''[[Size Matters]]'' in early 2004. The album featured lyrics which were inspired by Hamilton's brief 2003 relationship with Hollywood actress [[Winona Ryder]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/reviews/reviews-live/2014/01/06/helmet-the-hi-fi-tom-hersey/|title=Helmet, Warped, Batpiss|website=theMusic|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> and has been cited by critics as a departure from Helmet's earlier, more experimental sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3812-size-matters/|title=Helmet: Size Matters Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> [[Frank Bello]] was later recruited to play bass on the supporting tour; however, he left before its conclusion to reunite with his original band, [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Anthrax bassist Frank Bello joins reunited Helmet|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-anthrax-bassist-frank-bello-joins-reunited-helmet/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=October 25, 2014|date=April 17, 2004}}</ref> [[Jeremy Chatelain (bassist)|Jeremy Chatelain]] replaced Bello for the duration of the tour. John Tempesta left in early 2006 to join [[The Cult]].

In late 2005, Helmet were dropped by Interscope following lackluster sales for ''Size Matters''. Helmet then signed with [[Warcon Enterprises]] and announced that a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]], with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of [[Gandhi (American band)|Gandhi]]) on guitar. The new album, ''[[Monochrome (Helmet album)|Monochrome]]'', was recorded and co-produced by [[Wharton Tiers]], who recorded Helmet's first two albums, ''Strap It On'' and ''Meantime''. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, [[Mike Jost]] (formerly of [[Adair (band)|Adair]]). Helmet headlined the 2006 [[Warped Tour]] in support of ''Monochrome'', with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 ''Size Matters'' tour. The band later split with Warcon due to a variety of financial disputes between Hamilton and the label's owners.<ref name="la2010"/> Hamilton stated "Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon was the first time that I’d actually run into any problems with a label. I trusted somebody and got screwed. I’m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money. They never paid me tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I’ve never seen one penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [''Monochrome''] now, so it’s my record."<ref name="la2010">{{cite web|url=http://lamusicblog.com/2010/11/interview/interview-with-page-hamilton-of-helmet/|title=Interview with Page Hamilton of Helmet - LA Music Blog|website=lamusicblog.com|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2006, Chris Traynor announced that he had left the band after nearly a decade of working with [[Page Hamilton]]. A few days later, [[Mike Jost]] also left the band to attend to his duties as a new father. Jeremy Chatelain also made other commitments. Hamilton announced in early October 2006 that drum and bass duties would be filled by Kyle Stevenson and Jon Fuller, respectively, both from [[Milwaukee]], and both previously members of Big Collapse.<ref>{{cite news|title=Helmet mainman announces new rhythm section|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/helmet-mainman-announces-new-rhythm-section/|access-date=October 25, 2014|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Australian Jimmy Thompson (formerly of [[Full Scale (band)|Full Scale]]) also joined the band on guitar in 2006, but was replaced by Dan Beeman by late 2008. Due to line-up changes, Hamilton was forced to cancel many shows scheduled for late 2006 in the U.S. and Europe. Helmet opened up for [[Guns N' Roses]] for the remaining dates of their tour in December 2006. The band toured Australia in April and May 2008, playing shows throughout the eastern and southern coasts. Helmet's seventh studio album, ''[[Seeing Eye Dog]]'', was released on September 7, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=137485|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328222653/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=137485|url-status=dead|title=Helmet To Release 'Seeing Eye Dog' In June|archive-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612033908/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140910|url-status=dead|title=New Helmet Album Pushed Back To August|archive-date=June 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2010/06/27/news/helmet-delay-new-album-to-september-reveal-special-editions/ |title=Helmet Delay New Album To September, Reveal Special Editions &#124; Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More |publisher=Theprp.com |access-date=2012-03-09}}</ref>

Regarding Helmet's influence on the heavy rock world, Hamilton remarked "I hear it all over the place. I've heard Helmet riffs in [[Evanescence]]. Kids today have no idea at this point, because they [first] got into, say, Korn or System of a Down. Bands like Mastodon and Norma Jean tell me, 'Oh, we ripped you guys off with this,' or 'We got turned on by that.' Some bands do cool things with it, and there's a bunch of shitty bands that have imitated us too."<ref name="blab2010"/>

I pretty much just tried to figure the songs out and that's how I learned to play basically. Helmet is a band that I have listened to for years and will always enjoy them because they have the sweetest riffs I have ever heard. I love to air drum to them in the car also. I wouldn't be the same without Helmet in my life."<ref name="blabwarcon"/>

Helmet is considered a major influence on the [[nu metal]] genre,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BURB&p_multi=LBCB&p_theme=burb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10D0A8E9C34C8738&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Nu metal pioneer Helmet returns|first=Ed|last=Condran|newspaper=Courier Times|access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/monochrome-mw0000426555 |title=Monochrome - Helmet : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=July 18, 2006 |access-date=February 26, 2013}}</ref> with the band's use of [[Drop D tuning]] influencing many in the genre. Hamilton,  displeased with this connection, responded "it's frustrating that people write [us] off because we're affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating nu-metal and rap metal or whatever the fuck it is, which we sound nothing like."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/helmet_were_better_than_999_of_the_other_bands_out_there.html |title=Helmet: We're Better Than 99.9% Of The Other Bands Out There &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=February 21, 2013}}</ref> Though Hamilton would eventually go on to work with bands [[Linkin Park]] and [[P.O.D.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hunting-party-mw0002664226/credits|title=The Hunting Party - Linkin Park &#124; Credits &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/when-angels-and-serpents-dance-mw0000502712/credits|title=When Angels and Serpents Dance - P.O.D. &#124; Credits &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref>
