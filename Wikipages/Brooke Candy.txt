'''Brooke Dyan Candy''' (born July 20, 1989) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, tattoo artist, director, model, and fashion stylist. Raised in the suburbs of [[Los Angeles]], daughter of Tom Candy, former CFO of Hustler Magazine, Brooke rose to prominence after starring in [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes']] music video for "[[Genesis (Grimes song)|Genesis]]" (2012), which went [[viral video|viral]]. Following its success, Candy's status in the underground scene rose as she began to release her own material: "Das Me" (2012), "Everybody Does" (2013), and "I Wanna Fuck Right Now" (2013). In 2014, she signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]] and released her debut major label single, "Opulence", with an accompanying [[Opulence (EP)|EP of the same name]] on May 6, 2014.<ref name="RCAsigning">{{cite web|title=Dynamic Rapper / Singer Brooke Candy Signs with RCA Records |url=http://www.rcarecords.com/news/dynamic-rappersinger-brooke-candy-signs-rca-records|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|access-date=November 21, 2015|date=February 18, 2014}}</ref><ref name="opulenceep" /> Later, she joined [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]'s [[United Kingdom|UK]] roster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earmilk.com/2014/07/11/brooke-candy-signs-to-columbia-records-and-drops-this-fire-cory-enemy-remix-of-opulance-premiere/|title=Brooke Candy drops this fire Cory Enemy remix of "Opulence" [Premiere] - EARMILK|date=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Both are divisions of [[Sony Music]].

Following a slew of pop-driven singles, including the moderately-successful "[[Living Out Loud (song)|Living Out Loud]]" (2017), Candy left the labels in 2017. Throughout 2017 and 2018, she toured alongside [[Charli XCX]] and [[Lizzo]], also headlining her own tour, the Tie Me Up Tour (2018), in [[Asia]]. Candy released her first full-length album, ''[[Sexorcism (Brooke Candy album)|Sexorcism]]'', in 2019.
