Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring [[emo]], [[Trap music|trap]], [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[indie rock]], [[nu metal]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[punk rock]].

Onfroy uploaded a music video to YouTube for his song "Riot" after sharing a music video for his on September 12, 2017.

That white boy is still alive. So the people that died in the video are real. Everyone is so bothered by the child being lynched, but whether you realize it or not, the murders in the beginning are all real.

<blockquote>It was a lack of appreciation on his end, not because of me, I guess just from a business perspective. But he put a business perspective before a personal relationship, and I've been with him as a friend and as a brother for a very long time. I mean, it's just on some other shit to be honest. It's not on anything I've done wrong. I can't even say I've done anything to him, and I wouldn't go on the Internet and express that if I didn't care about the relationship, but you already know how it goes. They use you to where they wanna go and then part ways. And I've been used a lot if you haven't noticed.<ref name="slump back2" /></blockquote>

Ski Mask replied shortly afterward, using Instagram's story feature, "[I'll] always love that alien-looking nigga named XXX, but I have to distance myself because it's like nobody would see me as an individual rapper if I don't, on top of that, that nigga crazy as hell", Ski Mask then went on to post a much more intense version of the story, claiming that Onfroy threatened his family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/10/ski-mask-the-slump-god-love-xxxtentacion-distance-friendship/ |title=Ski Mask The Slump God Distances Himself From XXXTentacion – XXL |website=XXL Mag |access-date=November 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103003047/http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/10/ski-mask-the-slump-god-love-xxxtentacion-distance-friendship |archive-date=November 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> On December 8, 2017, Onfroy wrote on Instagram, "don't care about what you said about me, you know who got your back, love you, forever", referring to Ski Mask the Slump God.

Onfroy was involved in another brawl with a fan during California's Rolling Loud Festival on October 21, 2017. Onfroy announced on Instagram that the fight was purely self-defense before any video of the altercation was uploaded.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8007078/xxxtentacion-fight-rolling-loud-festival-2017-video |title=XXXTentacion Involved in Brawl With Fan at Rolling Loud Festival |work=Billboard |access-date=October 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026202344/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8007078/xxxtentacion-fight-rolling-loud-festival-2017-video |archive-date=October 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Legal issues==
===Juvenile charges===
In late 2012, Onfroy was arrested for possession of 21 grams of marijuana, a felony in Florida law. He was sentenced to one month of juvenile detention and six months at a behavioral correction facility.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=52-53}} Shortly after his release, he was arrested again for breaking into a house to steal a laptop in order to create music.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=53}}

In 2014, Onfroy was sent to a [[youth detention center]] for a year on gun possession charges.<ref name="TheBreakPresentsSki22" /><ref name=":022"/> According to Onfroy, during his time in detention, the district attorney was attempting to try him as an adult for gun possession, which would have had a sentence of 5–10 years in prison.<ref name=":022"/> Onfroy's narrative of this time in youth detention has been disputed by sources interviewed for a 2020 biography; he may have served one month's detention as part of a wider sentence of less than one year, and his charges cannot be corroborated by public files as he was a juvenile.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=93-94}}

===Stabbing of Dylan Turner===
Dylan Turner, known professionally as Tablez, a New Jersey native studying at [[Full Sail University]], managed XXXTentacion and his best friend [[Ski Mask the Slump God]] in 2016.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=99-100}} Due to Onfroy's inexperience in music and Turner's inexperience in management, they agreed that Turner would be paid only in the proceeds from the song "Look at Me!".{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=105}} One night, Ski Mask and Turner got into an argument while at Turner's apartment, which led to Ski Mask storming out.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=109}} 

Ski Mask later called Onfroy [[Drunk dialing|while drunk]] and lied that Turner had taken thousands from Onfroy. Days later, an angry Onfroy broke into Turner's apartment and shouted, "What if I stab you? What if I fucking stab you?" while poking a knife towards Turner's stomach, stopping just a few inches short and then pulling back. Turner said that he doesn't know if Onfroy meant to stab him, because Onfroy said in shock, "Oh fuck," after Turner exclaimed to Onfroy that he had stabbed him. However, the blade sank into his abdomen.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=109}} 

Turner required emergency surgery and suffered life-changing injuries.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=110}} He pledged to drop charges against Onfroy if his computer could be returned, saying that he "didn't want one bad choice to define who [Onfroy] was." Turner stuck to his word despite all its files being deleted. Onfroy paid for the entirety of Turner's hospital bills, and later apologized to Turner and thanked him for dropping the charges. When asked if he thought Onfroy was genuinely changing later in life to become a better person, Turner responded, "Yes. Deep down we all are."{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=110-112}}

===Robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and home invasion charges===
On July 14, 2016, days after being bailed for stabbing Dylan Turner, Onfroy was arrested and charged with [[robbery]], [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and [[home invasion]] committed in November 2015.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=111}}<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1437-xxxtentacion-is-blowing-up-behind-bars-should-he-be/ |title=XXXTentacion Is Blowing Up Behind Bars.

Onfroy was arrested in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] originally, but was later transferred to [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]].<ref name=":12" /> His constant relocations were due to an eventually successful plan by prosecutors to find a jurisdiction that would charge him as an adult for a crime committed as a juvenile.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=7-9}} He was released on a $10,000 bond in September 2016.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|p=111}}

===Leaked audio regarding domestic violence and a stabbing incident===
On October 23, 2018, ''Pitchfork'' released secretly recorded audio of 18-year old Onfroy talking with acquaintances around the time of his October 8, 2016, arrest. ''Pitchfork'' claimed that he had allegedly confessed to domestic violence in the recording and described an incident in which he stabbed eight people.<ref name="Hogan">{{cite web |title=XXXTentacion Confessed to Domestic Abuse and Other Violent Crimes in Newly Obtained Secret Recording |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-confessed-to-domestic-abuse-secret-recording-listen/ |last=Hogan |first=Marc |website=Pitchfork |date=October 23, 2018 |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024012856/https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-confessed-to-domestic-abuse-secret-recording-listen/ |archive-date=October 24, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The tape was considered a confession by the prosecution and defense.<ref name="Hogan" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/xxxtentacion-confession-abuse-violence-why-it-matters-after-rappers-death|title=Why XXXTentacion's violent confession matters even after his death|last=Suarez|first=Gary|date=October 26, 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=November 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106223121/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/xxxtentacion-confession-abuse-violence-why-it-matters-after-rappers-death|archive-date=November 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Some criticized ''Pitchfork's'' interpretation of the stabbing incident that Onfroy described, arguing that he and his friend were about to be jumped and that he acted in [[self-defense]].

I forgave her."<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube - XXXTENTACION Full Tape|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&t=380&v=Z0YGGjk0Ah4}}</ref> 

One especially fraught conversation about Onfroy's ex-girlfriend took place on the afternoon of October 26, 2016 when he told a woman, "I already got what I wanted, I already bashed her face—her face on the internet, bruh, I done made her look bad on the internet, bruh." Later that day, an audio clip from the call was posted on Instagram of Onfroy saying he "bashed her face" without the hurried clarification.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hogan |first1=Marc |title=XXXTentacion Discussed Sex, Violence, and Donald Trump in Recorded Prison Phone Calls After 2016 Arrest |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |access-date=April 6, 2019 |agency=Pitchfork |date=November 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406155834/https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |archive-date=April 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Relationships===

Onfroy's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala had accused Onfroy of [[domestic abuse]]. According to Ayala's statement, Onfroy beat her at times, choked her, broke clothes hangers on her legs, threatened to chop off her hair or cut out her tongue, pressed knives or scissors to her face, and held her head underwater in their bathroom while promising to drown her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/10/23/xxxtentacion-admits-domestic-violence-pregnant-girlfriend-tape/1745682002/|title=Secret tape reveals XXXTentacion confessed to domestic violence against girlfriend: Report|last=Henderson|first=Cydney|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2019-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830203914/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/10/23/xxxtentacion-admits-domestic-violence-pregnant-girlfriend-tape/1745682002/|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> "His favorite thing was to just backhand my mouth", Ayala says.

The first incident of domestic violence allegedly occurred when Onfroy slapped Ayala and broke her iPhone 6S, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry. Onfroy later repaired the phone.<ref name="pitchfork.com">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/xxxtentacions-reported-victim-details-grim-pattern-of-abuse-in-testimony/|title=XXXTentacion's Reported Victim Details Grim Pattern of Abuse in Testimony|website=Pitchfork|date=September 8, 2017|access-date=2019-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909205905/https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/xxxtentacions-reported-victim-details-grim-pattern-of-abuse-in-testimony/|archive-date=September 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In one incident recounted to a prosecutor, Ayala said Onfroy asked her which object she wanted him to force into her vagina: a long-handled barbecue fork, or a wire barbecue brush, she chose the fork and Onfroy told her to undress. She claimed Onfroy was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out; he did not penetrate her with it. Ayala stated that once she woke up, Onfroy started apologizing to her profusely for the incident.{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=126}}

A couple of weeks after Sanchez requested Onfroy's DNA samples to prove the paternity of her son Gekyume, Onfroy's mother filed to block the test. Onfroy's mother sealed her court filings in opposition, so it's unclear why she objects to a paternity test. Some fans suspect it has something to do with her financial stake in Onfroy's estate.

==Politics==
Onfroy was public about his political and personal beliefs throughout his career. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Onfroy opposed the presidential candidacy of [[Donald Trump]] and had instead signaled support for [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic]] candidate [[Bernie Sanders]]. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Hogan |first1=Marc |title=XXXTentacion Discussed Sex, Violence, and Donald Trump in Recorded Prison Phone Calls After 2016 Arrest |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |access-date=April 6, 2019 |agency=Pitchfork |date=November 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406155834/https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |archive-date=April 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=xxxtentacion on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/xxxtentacion/status/708087959015321600?s=21}}</ref> He also took to [[Twitter]] predicting a Trump victory, saying, "As much as I hate that piece of shit Donald Trump, y'all know this motherfucker's gonna win right?"<ref>{{cite web|title=xxxtentacion on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/xxxtentacion/status/708424929046306816?s=21}}</ref> He also stated that, although he did not hold a positive opinion of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], describing her as "garbage", he did not want Trump to win because, "Once Trump gets in it's over for all the minorities pretty much... the lower classes are gonna be fucked." His songs "[[A Ghetto Christmas Carol|Hate Will Never Win]]" and "Suicide Pit" contain [[Protests against Donald Trump|anti-Trump]] lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTentacion's "Hate will never win" Samples Donald Trump's Charlottesville Speech & J Dilla Production|url= https://genius.com/a/xxxtentacion-s-hate-will-never-win-samples-donald-trump-s-charlottesville-speech-j-dilla-production}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTENTACION - SUICIDE PIT (Freestyle)|url=https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-suicide-pit-freestyle-lyrics|website=genius.com}}</ref>

Onfroy said he believed that, "If [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] was legal everywhere, the world would be a better place",<ref>{{cite web|title=xxxtentacion on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/xxxtentacion/status/459200104818544640?s=21}}</ref> and voiced support for [[criminal justice reform]] movements, stating that "the judicial system is [[slavery]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTENTACION talks how the government is wrongly imprisoning Kodak Black|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYQRkX8U07k&feature=youtu.be}}</ref> Despite previously expressing opposition to [[gun control]] measures,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hogan |first1=Marc |title=XXXTentacion Discussed Sex, Violence, and Donald Trump in Recorded Prison Phone Calls After 2016 Arrest |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |access-date=April 6, 2019 |agency=Pitchfork |date=November 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406155834/https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-prison-phone-calls/ |archive-date=April 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Onfroy reversed his stance on [[Gun politics in the United States|the issue]] following the 2018 [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in [[Parkland, Florida]]. Onfroy held multiple charity events for the [[March for Our Lives]] movement and visited Parkland survivor Anthony Borges in the hospital while Borges was recovering from gunshot wounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTentacion Organizing "Put Down The Guns" Charity Paintball Tournament|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/xxxtentacion-organizing-put-down-the-guns-charity-paintball-tournament-news.47355.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTentacion and Lil Wayne Pay Tribute to Parkland Victims with "School Shooters" Video|url=https://consequence.net/2020/04/xxxtentacion-school-shooters-video-watch/}}</ref> 

Onfroy was [[pro-choice]]. He had also expressed his support for the legalization of [[same-sex marriage|gay marriage]], and he had worked closely with [[transgender]] musician Fifty Grand, who described Onfroy's beliefs as "incredibly [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]" and that Onfroy was one of the only people to reach out to him and show support for him [[coming out]] as transgender. Likewise, transgender artist N.Gantz said that after revealing to Onfroy that he was struggling with his gender identity, Onfroy told him not to "blame myself for the way I was born... but to be myself because I only have one life."<ref name="The Xxxtentacion Interview"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Fifty Grand Is The Trans Artist Making All The Experimental Soundcloud Jams You Love|date=June 25, 2019|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/fifty-grand-is-the-trans-artist-making-all-the-experimental-soundcloud-jams-you-love-news.84061.html}}</ref>{{sfn|Reiss|2020|pp=97}}

Onfroy said many times that he distrusted police due to both personal experiences and publicized instances such as the [[killing of Philando Castile]], which Onfroy described as a [[murder]]. In the music video for "[[Riot (XXXTentacion song)|Riot]]", depictions of the killings of [[Emmett Till]], [[Heather Heyer]], and Philando Castile are shown, in addition to the fictional depiction at the end of the video of a white child being [[lynched]]. Onfroy said that the last depiction wasn't an expression of [[reverse racism]], but was to show that public outrage from the video would be more so focused on the fictional white child's death rather than the depictions of actual racist killings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/09/14/outrage-as-well-known-rapper-lynches-small-white-child-in-music-video.html/ |title=Outrage as well-known rapper 'lynches' small white child in music video |website=XXL Mag |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917022714/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/09/14/outrage-as-well-known-rapper-lynches-small-white-child-in-music-video.html |archive-date=September 17, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTentacion explains his 'Look at Me' video and apologizes to anyone who he offended recently|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWHzOSIF6aE&feature=youtu.be}}</ref>

During the Revenge concert tour, Onfroy had publicly declared his support for [[Civil rights movements|civil rights]] and [[LGBT movements|gay rights]], and denounced [[racist]] and [[homophobic]] rhetoric from [[hate groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]], saying, "I don't give a fuck if you're black, white, yellow, purple—I don't give a fuck if you're gay, I don't give a fuck if you're straight, I give a fuck if you're a person... I stand for equality for all people."<ref>{{cite web|title=XXXTentacion Starts 'F*ck the KKK!'

==Death==
{{Main|Murder of XXXTentacion}}
[[File:XXXTentacion Memorial 1.png|thumb|Memorial of Onfroy outside the motorcycle dealership where he died in Deerfield Beach]]
At 3:56 p.m EDT on June 18, 2018, Onfroy, upon leaving Riva Motorsports Motorcycle & Marine Superstore in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]], was blocked from exiting the parking lot by a black [[Dodge Journey]] SUV. Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat. A brief struggle occurred, and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small [[Louis Vuitton]] bag containing $50,000, and shot Onfroy multiple times. The shooters fled the scene in their SUV. Onfroy was later transported by paramedics to the nearby [[Broward Health North]] hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Trischitta">{{cite news | last = Trischitta | first = Linda | date = June 22, 2018 | title = Deadly Ambush of XXXTentacion Detailed in New Court Papers | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-sb-xxx-targeted-20180622-story.html | work = Florida Sun Sentinel | access-date = June 24, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180624150417/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-sb-xxx-targeted-20180622-story.html | archive-date = June 24, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Christopher Weingarten of [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] opined that XXXTentacion's success as "a zeitgeist-grabbing, industry-defying, boundary-destroying phenomenon" is "overshadowed" by his alleged violence towards his ex-girlfriend, but contended that despite media attempts to suppress him, XXXTentacion's "impact on music will be felt for years to come" and his recordings have "helped signal a new era of post-streaming, post-genre teenagers".<ref name="BegunToUnderstand" /> XXXTentacion left behind what ''Rolling Stone'' called "a huge musical footprint" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his career.<ref name="BegunToUnderstand">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weve-only-begun-understanding-xxxtentacions-musical-legacy-w521739|title=We've Only Begun to Understand XXXTentacion's Musical Legacy|last=Weingarten|first=Christopher R.|date=June 19, 2018|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=June 21, 2018|department=Music (News)|issn=0035-791X|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621132633/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weve-only-begun-understanding-xxxtentacions-musical-legacy-w521739|archive-date=June 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Given his immense influence only to die young, the article compared his cultural impact with that of [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[Darby Crash]].<ref name="BegunToUnderstand" />

According to the article, his music "reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own"; and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on "mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness", though acknowledging that XXXTentacion "made some attempts to rehabilitate his image."<ref name="HyperfastLife" />

An article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' expressed similar criticisms, though it also noted that XXXTentacion "reminded young fans in particular that their hurt was valid but that it did not form the sum total of their lives" and that he "gave voice to their insecurities."<ref name="HowRemembered" /> Contrasting these elements of his legacy, the article acknowledged that though he spent his career encouraging young fans to recognize their greater worth, XXXTentacion's legacy is nonetheless characterized by the trauma he both experienced and caused.<ref name="HowRemembered" /> In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Chris Richards commented on XXXTentacion's complicated legacy, contrasting how he "encouraged his fans to find hope in the fog of their despair, but bragged enthusiastically about the joy he felt in brutalizing others."<ref name="StruggleToMakeSense" /> 

According to Richards, XXXTentacion's music "brought solace to the depressed" while validating the sort of violence he practiced, and legitimized the pain of his fans while erasing the suffering of domestic violence victims.<ref name="StruggleToMakeSense" /> XXXTentacion's music serves as an example for Richards of how "a hateful song" might normalize such feelings in "hateful people," which contributes to the profound paranoia in society about the hatred that might be in the minds of others.<ref name="StruggleToMakeSense" />

XXXTentacion's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, who had accused him of domestic abuse in 2016, said of the controversy surrounding her and Onfroy's past, "It's disgusting that people are speaking for me. I don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, I didn't lose my life. He did. It's permanent. I'm still here. Like, how do you think that makes me feel? Everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy? No, I'm broken."<ref name="meaww.com"/> Following XXXTentacion's death, Ayala appeared in the music video and the cover art for the 2019 single "[[Hearteater]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch XXXTentacion's New Video for "Hearteater"|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/10/xxxtentacion-hearteater-video}}</ref>
