==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born in [[Deptford Township, New Jersey|Deptford]], New Jersey, Waters is the daughter of Junior Waters, a famed jazz musician,<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=362/3}}</ref> and his wife Betty. Her great-aunt, [[Ethel Waters]],<ref name="LarkinDM"/> was one of the first black American vocalists to appear in mainstream Hollywood musicals.<ref name="vice_2016">{{cite web | url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/jp4gkp/crystal-waters-gypsy-woman-interview | title=The Story of Crystal Waters' "Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)" | work=Thump | publisher=vice.com | date=April 8, 2016 | access-date=July 6, 2018 | quote=My family were very musical. My great-aunt, Ethel Waters, was a very famous actor and singer in the 1940s, and my father was a jazz musician for his entire life. My uncle was the lead saxophonist with MSFB, if you remember them? I grew up with all of that, and there were rehearsals in our house, and I'd go on tour with my father in the summers, so the musician's lifestyle was just part of my life.}}</ref> Her family moved to [[New Jersey]] for a while but they again moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] At age eleven she began writing poetry and took her writing seriously enough to be inducted into the [[Poetry Society of America]] when she was 14,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> the youngest person ever to receive that honor.

She studied business and [[computer science]] at [[Howard University]], but her creative work as a musician dropped off as she found less time for it. After earning her college degree in 1989, Waters secured a job as a probation officer with the Washington, D.C. parole board, making a living that would support her two daughters. One of her daughters, Ella Nicole, is a singer-songwriter who was discovered in 2014 and managed by Samonee K.

==Music career==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}
Waters' first job in the music world was as a backup singer at a local recording studio. She realized she wanted the creative control of writing her own music. Meeting [[the Basement Boys]] at a D.C. conference, they agreed to collaborate. Waters' self-described style was jazz and the Basement Boys was [[House music|house]]. The first two songs she wrote for the 'Boys were "[[Makin' Happy]]" and "[[Gypsy Woman (Crystal Waters song)|Gypsy Woman]]".<ref name="vice_2016"/>

Waters signed a writing contract with [[Mercury Records]] in 1989.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Her single "[[Makin' Happy]]", with contributions by remixer [[Steve "Silk" Hurley]], shot quickly to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs.<ref name=dance/>

With her 1994 follow-up album, ''[[Storyteller (Crystal Waters album)|Storyteller]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Waters made a mainstream comeback with her hit single "[[100% Pure Love]]",<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which hit number 11 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref name=hot100/> No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs,<ref name=dance/> and became one of the longest-charting singles on the Hot 100 at 45 weeks ("Gypsy Woman" had remained on the chart for 16 weeks). Along with the single, her second album ''Storyteller,'' sold over one million copies in the United States.<ref>Paoletta, Michael (May 1, 2004) "Where Have All the Divas Gone?" Billboard (Nielsen Business Media, Inc.) Retrieved 16 March 2011.</ref> Feminist scholar and social activist [[bell hooks]] described Waters as "fierce and politically on the job" because of the singer's socially conscious lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyxtra.com/divine-diva-meter-crystal-waters-61881|title=Divine Diva Meter: Crystal Waters|last=Iannacci|first=Elio|date=2014-06-29|website=Xtra|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>

In 1996, Waters participated in the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'', which was produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]], performing the song "The Boy from Ipanema".

In 2007, the mega European hit "[[Destination Calabria]]" by [[Alex Gaudino]], featuring vocals by Crystal Waters, went to No. 1 on the European Pop Chart in over 30 countries. The track is a mashup, taking the instrumental from Rune's "Calabria" and the vocals from Alex Gaudino's and Crystal Waters' "Destination Unknown", both originally released in 2003. It was produced with the help of Maurizio Nari and Ronnie Milani (Nari & Milani), matching the saxophone hook/riff from "Calabria" to Crystal Waters' voice. "Destination Calabria" was released as a 12-inch single by the Italian label [[Rise Records (Italy)|Rise Records]], and as a CD single on March 19, 2007 by British label [[Data Records]]. It originally charted in Australia in February 2004, peaking at No. 98 under the title "Destination Unknown" before being re-released as "Destination Calabria" and reaching No. 2 in 2007.

In 2012, "Le Bump" with [[Yolanda Be Cool]] gave Waters another No. 1 on the [[Beatport]] House Chart.

With [[Chris Cox (DJ)|DJ Chris Cox]] in 2013, the No. 1 Billboard Dance Club Songs hit "Mama Hey",<ref name=dance/> was listed as one of ''Billboard''{{'s}} "Top 50 Dance Songs of 2013".

In November 2015, Waters released "Synergy", and in October 2016 she released "Believe". Both songs quickly rose to the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs.<ref name=dance/>

Her 2017 single "Testify" with Hifi Sean was released on [[Defected Records]] and went straight to the A-List on [[BBC Radio]] and garnered another No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs.<ref name=dance/>

Her third collaboration with Sted-E & Hybrid Heights, titled "I Am House", reached No. 1 in the club charts in Spring 2018, giving Waters a total of twelve No. 1 singles in the US ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs.<ref name=dance/>

In February 2020, she began a monthly radio/podcast show called "I Am House."

==Impact and legacy==

At the age of 14, Waters became the youngest person in history to be inducted into the national poetry hall of fame. She is cited as one of the pioneers of the dance/house genre. She is one of the first and only artists to experience mainstream success with a dance song. She is one of the longest running vocal house/dance artists of all time. In her 30 year career, she has charted 20 songs on the Billboard Dance Club Chart, with twelve songs reaching number one. As of July 2021, Waters has nearly 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and she has accumulated over 100 million streams on streaming platforms. Though her music sales have yet to be re-certified, she has sold over 5 million records worldwide. According to Billboard, Crystal is one of the most successful dance artists of all time.<ref name=dance/>
