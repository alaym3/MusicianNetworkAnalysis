==History==
John Alexander Tatum (born June 10, 1988) previously played in bands Jack and the Whale and FACEPAINT in the college town of Blacksburg. He began recording under the name Wild Nothing in the summer of 2009. Emerging at a time when a handful of [[C86 (album)|C86]]-esque groups were in vogue, Tatum's demos garnered attention in indie music circles with a cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s "[[Cloudbusting]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Margaret Reges |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wild-nothing-mn0002379297/biography |title=Wild Nothing &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref> Tatum signed with the [[Captured Tracks]] record label after the success of these demos, and began touring with Haley, Goodman and drummer Max Brooks.

Wild Nothing's first single, "Summer Holiday," was released on Captured Tracks in 2009, followed by "Cloudbusting." The band's debut full-length, ''Gemini'', was released in the spring of 2010. ''Gemini'' was ranked the 49th best album of 2010 by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/604052/pitchforks-top-50-albums-of-2010/top-stories/lead-story/ |title=Pitchfork’s Top 50 Albums Of 2010 |publisher=Stereogum |date=2010-12-17 |access-date=2012-09-08}}</ref> and 36th best album of 2010 by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] music editors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/431982/amazon-editors-top-50-albums-of-2010-so-far/top-stories/lead-story/ |title=Amazon Editors’ Top 50 Albums Of 2010 (So Far) |publisher=Stereogum |date=2010-07-07 |access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref> Blogcritics wrote, "While I wasn't totally convinced with Gemini as a whole, I adored it in chunks".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-wild-nothing-gemini/#ixzz1dE0UNL5n/ |title=Music Review: Wild Nothing - Gemini - Blogcritics Music |publisher=Blogcritics.org |date=2010-06-10 |access-date=2012-09-08}}</ref>

Follow-up EP ''Golden Haze'' was released in October 2010.

==Lineup==
[[File:Jack Tatum, Gov Ball 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Lead singer and founder, Jack Tatum, live at the [[Governors Ball Music Festival]] in [[New York City]] on June 8, 2013]]
Founding member and songwriter Tatum records Wild Nothing's albums and EPs alone, and is subsequently joined by the other members for live performances. In 2013, he stated: "I'm not really sure what we are at this point. It's a weird gray area. On the road, it definitely feels like a band; the live show's all about how we individually interpret the songs I made – there's five different takes on them. But the records are all me. ''Gemini'' was all me, and so was ''Nocturne'', save for the drums."<ref>{{cite web|last=Goggins |first=Joe |url=http://mancunion.com/2013/04/30/interview-wild-nothing/ |title=Interview: Wild Nothing |publisher=The Mancunion |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref>
