'''George Roger Waters''' (born 6 September 1943) is an English songwriter, singer, bassist, and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]. Waters initially served solely as the bassist, but following the departure of singer-songwriter [[Syd Barrett]] in 1968, he also became their lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader.

Pink Floyd achieved international success with the [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute over the use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987.

Waters's solo work includes the studio albums ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984), ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' (1987)'','' ''[[Amused to Death]]'' (1992)'','' and ''[[Is This the Life We Really Want?]]'' (2017). In 2005, he released ''{{lang|fr|[[Ça Ira (opera)|Ça Ira]]}}'', an [[opera]] translated from [[Étienne Roda-Gil|Étienne]] and Nadine Roda-Gils' [[libretto]] about the [[French Revolution]].

In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, ''[[The Wall&nbsp;– Live in Berlin]]'', with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates [[Nick Mason]], [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], and [[David Gilmour]] for the [[Live 8]] global awareness event, the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999; he performed ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' in its entirety for his [[The Dark Side of the Moon Live|world tour of 2006–2008]], and the [[The Wall Live (2010–13)|''Wall Live'']] tour of 2010–2013 was the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing tour by a solo artist at the time]].

==Early years==
Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in [[Great Bookham]], [[Surrey]].{{sfn|Thompson|2013|p=7}} His father, the son of a [[coal miner]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] member.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=13}}

In the early years of the [[Second World War]], Waters's father was a [[conscientious objector]] who drove an ambulance during [[the Blitz]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=13}} He later changed his stance on [[pacifism]], joined the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]] as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36253 |date=16 November 1943 |page=5071 |supp=y}}</ref> He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at [[Aprilia, Lazio|Aprilia]], during the [[Battle of Anzio]], when Roger was five months old.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=13–14}}</ref> He is commemorated in Aprilia and at the [[Cassino War Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web |title=WATERS, ERIC FLETCHER |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2099066/WATERS,%20ERIC%20FLETCHER |access-date=1 March 2013}}</ref> On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wanted in Rome |url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/roger-waters-made-honorary-citizen-of-anzio/ |date=18 February 2014}}</ref> Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to [[Cambridge]] and raised them there.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=5–6}} Waters's earliest memory is of the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] celebrations.<ref name="DID">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011j39v|title=Desert Island Discs, Roger Waters|date=29 May 2011|publisher=BBC Radio 4|access-date=29 May 2011}}</ref>

Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]] (now [[Hills Road Sixth Form College]]) with [[Syd Barrett]], while future Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] lived nearby on [[Mill Road, Cambridge|Mill Road]] and attended [[the Perse School]].{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|pp=15–18}} At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (YCND),{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 12–13}} having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}} He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's [[cricket]] and rugby teams.{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=23}} Waters was unhappy at school, saying: "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one&nbsp;... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 14–19}}

Waters met future Pink Floyd founder members [[Nick Mason]] and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the [[University of Westminster]]) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well suited to that field.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=320}} He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=36}}

By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=40}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=20}}: (primary source).</ref> Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe.<ref>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=13}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=17}}: (primary source).</ref> They usually called themselves Sigma&nbsp;6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}} Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=17–18}} In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a [[tearoom]] in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=13–18}}

When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitarist [[Bob Klose]] to join.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=18}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=14}}: (secondary source).</ref> Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}} During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 18, 28}} In late 1965, the Tea Set had changed their name to the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and, by early 1966, Pink Floyd.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=30–37}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=32}}: (secondary source).</ref>

By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd's frontman, guitarist, and songwriter.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=87}} He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', released in August 1967.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 87–107}} Waters contributed the song "[[Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk]]" (his first sole writing credit) to the album.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 91}} By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour,{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=90–114}} rendered him "unable or unwilling"{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=129}} to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=87–107}} In early March 1968, to discuss the band's future, Barrett, Mason, Waters, and Wright met with the band's managers, [[Peter Jenner]] and [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] of the rock music management company they had all founded: [[Blackhill Enterprises]]. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band "agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity" regarding "past activities".{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=105}} Their new manager [[Steve O'Rourke]] made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=106}}

After Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=106–107, 160–161, 265, 278}} He said he wanted to "drag [Pink Floyd] kicking and screaming back from the borders of space, from the whimsy that Syd was into, to my concerns, which were much more political and philosophical".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Epstein|first=Dan|date=2018-03-01|title=Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon': 10 Things You Didn't Know|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/pink-floyds-dark-side-of-the-moon-10-things-you-didnt-know-201743/|access-date=2021-10-06|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> Waters became a dominant songwriter and the band's principal lyricist, sharing lead vocals with Gilmour and sometimes Wright. Throughout the late 1970s, he was the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 106–107, 160–161, 265, 278}} He wrote most of the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his departure, starting with ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973) and ending with ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control. Every Waters studio album from ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' onwards has been a [[concept album]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 3, 9, 113, 156, 242, 279, 320, 398}}

With lyrics written entirely by Waters, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the most successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 consecutive weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. As of 2005, it continued to sell over 8,000 copies a week.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58524/floyds-dark-side-celebrates-chart-milestone|title= Floyd's ''Dark Side'' Celebrates Chart Milestone|last1=Titus|first1=Christa|last2=Waddell|first2=Ray|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|year=2005|access-date=24 October 2011}}</ref> According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, ''Dark Side of the Moon'' is the world's second-bestselling album and the United States' 21st-bestselling album.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=345}} In 1970, Waters composed ''[[Music from The Body]]'' in collaboration with [[Ron Geesin]], a soundtrack album to [[Roy Battersby]]'s documentary film ''[[The Body (1970 film)|The Body]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-waters.com/musicfromthebody.php|title=Roger Waters discography|website=rogerwaters.com|access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/thebookofseth/ron-geesin-roger-waters-music-from-the-body|title=Ron Geesin/Roger Waters – Music from The Body|access-date=18 November 2019|date=November 2001|website=Head Heritage}}</ref>

Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979)—written largely by Waters—and ''The Final Cut'' (1983)—written entirely by Waters.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 265–269}} The cost of war and the loss of his father became a recurring theme, from "[[Corporal Clegg]]" (''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'', 1968) and "[[Free Four]]" (''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'', 1972) to "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" from ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', "[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]", first used in the feature film, ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|The Wall]]'' (1982), later included with "[[The Fletcher Memorial Home]]" on ''The Final Cut'', an album dedicated to his father.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=294}} The theme and composition of ''The Wall'' was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–295, 351}}

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=I think things like "Comfortably Numb" were the last embers of mine and Roger's ability to work collaboratively together.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=275}}|source= —[[David Gilmour]]|align=right|width=25em}}

The double album ''The Wall'' was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 260}} Having sold over 23&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified units]] in the US as of 2013, is tied for sixth-most certified album of all time in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=awards_by_album#search_section |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |title=RIAA GOLD & PLATINUM Top Albums |access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref> Pink Floyd hired [[Bob Ezrin]] to co-produce the album and cartoonist [[Gerald Scarfe]] to illustrate the sleeve art.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=260–261}} The band embarked on [[The Wall Tour (1980–81)|The Wall Tour]] of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of ''The Wall'' was on 17 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p= 185}}

In March 1983, the last Pink Floyd album with Waters, ''The Final Cut'', was released. It was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=230}} Waters wrote all the album's lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of the day and mention Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by name.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–299}} At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 295}} According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 264–270}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine gave the album five stars, with [[Kurt Loder]] describing it as "a superlative achievement" and "art rock's crowning masterpiece".<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=300}}: "art rock's crowning masterpiece"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=262}}: "a superlative achievement".</ref> Loder viewed the work as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".<ref>{{cite web|last=Loder|first=Kurt|author-link=Kurt Loder|title= Pink Floyd: ''The Final Cut'' (Toshiba)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-final-cut-19830414 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=14 April 1983 |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref>

===Departure and lawsuit===
Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241}} In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the "Leaving Member" clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=221, 237, 240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign like Wright had been years earlier, and decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, saying: "If I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 312–313}}

In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241}} Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the ''Wall'' concept and the inflatable ''Animals ''pig.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 139}} Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987), ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Endless River]]'' (2014).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/roger-waters-reminds-curious-fans-i-am-not-part-of-pink-floyd-20141002|title=Roger Waters Reminds Fans: 'I Am Not Part of Pink Floyd'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref> In 2005, Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit&nbsp;... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=395}} In 2013, he said he regretted the lawsuit, saying:

{{Quote|text=I was wrong. Of course I was ... It's one of the few times that the legal profession has taught me something. Because when I went to these chaps and said, "Listen, we're broke, this isn't Pink Floyd anymore," they went, "What do you mean? That's irrelevant, it is a label and it has commercial value. You can't say it's going to cease to exist ... you obviously don't understand English jurisprudence."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24160584|title=Pink Floyd star Roger Waters regrets suing band|date=19 September 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> }}

In 1984, Waters released his first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', which dealt with Waters's feelings about monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} The protagonist, Reg, finally chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], jazz saxophonist [[David Sanborn]], and artwork by Gerald Scarfe.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} Kurt Loder described ''The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking'' as a "strangely static, faintly hideous record".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 305–306}} ''Rolling Stone'' rated the album a "rock bottom one star".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} Years later, Mike DeGagne of [[AllMusic]] praised its "ingenious symbolism" and "brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm", rating it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r21602|pure_url=yes}} |title= The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking |first= Mike|last= DeGagne|work= AllMusic |access-date=17 October 2010 }}</ref>

Waters toured the album with Clapton, a new band, and new material; the shows included a selection of Pink Floyd songs. Waters débuted [[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (tour)|his tour]] in Stockholm on 16 June 1984.

In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated film ''[[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|When the Wind Blows]]'', based on the [[Raymond Briggs]] [[When the Wind Blows (comics)|book of the same name]]. His backing band featuring [[Paul Carrack]] was credited as ''The Bleeding Heart Band''.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=36}} In 1987, Waters released ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'', a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack.

The show reported an attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=346}} [[Leonard Cheshire]] asked Waters to perform the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters's musicians included [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and [[Sinéad O'Connor]]. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US [[7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron]]. Designed by Mark Fisher, the wall was 25&nbsp;metres tall and 170&nbsp;metres long and was built across the set, and Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale. Many rock icons received invitations to the show, though Gilmour, Mason, and Wright did not.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 342–347}} Waters released a double album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="RIAAGPC"/>

In 1990, Waters hired manager [[Mark Fenwick]] and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, ''[[Amused to Death]]'', in 1992. The record was influenced heavily by the events of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the [[Gulf War]], and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by [[Neil Postman]]. [[Patrick Leonard]], who worked on ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'', co-produced the album. [[Jeff Beck]] played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 348–349}} It is Waters's most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 347–352}} Waters described the record as a "stunning piece of work", ranking it alongside ''Dark Side of the Moon'' and ''The Wall'' as one of the best of his career.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 141, 252}} The song "[[What God Wants]], Pt. 1" reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart in the US.<ref name="RWAM">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=roger-waters-p5795/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roger Waters: Billboard Singles |work= AllMusic|access-date=20 November 2010}}</ref> ''Amused to Death'' was certified Silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=BPI Certifications|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref> Sales of ''Amused to Death'' topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his [[In the Flesh (1999-2002 concert tour by Roger Waters)|In the Flesh tour]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 323–324}} In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll Halls of Fame]] as a member of Pink Floyd.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://rockhall.com/inductees/pink-floyd/timeline/ |title= Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Pink Floyd |publisher= Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref>

===1999–2004: In the Flesh tour and ''Wall'' Broadway production===
In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 329–334}} The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, ''[[In the Flesh – Live]]''. During the tour, Waters played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts]], playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=329–334}}

[[Miramax]] announced in 2004 that a production of ''The Wall'' was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from ''The Wall'', but also songs from ''Dark Side of the Moon'', ''Wish You Were Here'' and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3539908.stm |title= Pink Floyd's Wall Broadway bound |work= BBC News|date= 5 August 2004 |access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref> On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its [[overture]], were played on the occasion of the ''[[Enlargement of the European Union|Welcome Europe]]'' celebrations in the accession country of [[Malta]]. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over [[Grand Harbour]] in [[Valletta]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p= 334}} In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks online: "To Kill the Child", inspired by the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and "Leaving Beirut", an anti-war song inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=391}}

=== 2005–2015: Pink Floyd reunion, ''{{lang|fr|Ça Ira}}'', and further touring  ===

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 [[Live 8]] concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of ''The Wall'' at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=237, 266–267}} They played a 23-minute set consisting of "[[Speak to Me]]/[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]"/"[[Breathe (Reprise)]]", "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]", and "[[Comfortably Numb]]". Waters told the [[Associated Press]] that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p= 308}} Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 382–383}} In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] by [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 386}}</ref>

In September 2005, Waters released ''{{lang|fr|[[Ça Ira (opera)|Ça Ira]]}}'' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|sa iˈʁa|}}, French for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late [[Étienne Roda-Gil]]'s French libretto based on the historical subject of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1= Tsioulcas|first1= Anastasia|title= Waters' New Concept |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date= 27 August 2005|page=45 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-BIEAAAAMBAJ&q=ca+ira+Nadine+Roda-Gil&pg=PA45 |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> ''{{lang|fr|Ça Ira}}'' was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone [[Bryn Terfel]], soprano [[Ying Huang (soprano)|Ying Huang]] and tenor [[Paul Groves (tenor)|Paul Groves]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 324–325}} Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p= 256}} and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]&nbsp;...&nbsp;This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 392}} Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]] believes is "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=392}} ''{{lang|fr|Ça Ira}}'' reached number 5 on the ''Billboard'' Classical Music Chart in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.billboard.com/charts/2005-10-15/classical-albums |title=Roger Waters: ''Ça Ira''|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

In June 2006, Waters commenced [[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]] tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters's solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of ''The Wall''. He used elaborate staging by concert lighting designer [[Marc Brickman]] complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree [[quadraphonic sound]] system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=319, 334–338}} Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.

In March 2007, the Waters song "[[Hello (I Love You)]]" was featured in the science fiction film ''[[The Last Mimzy]]''. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/reminder-pink-floyd-rock-icon-roger-waters-records-hello-i-love-you-original-song-new-712330.htm |title= Reminder&nbsp;– Pink Floyd Rock Icon Roger Waters Records "Hello (I Love You)", an Original Song for New Line Cinema's "The Last Mimzy" |publisher= [[Marketwire]] |date=January 2007|access-date=29 June 2015}}</ref> He performed at California's [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]] in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at [[Live Earth India 2008#Live Earth India 2008|Live Earth 2008]] in Mumbai, India in December 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nme.com/news/roger-waters/41209|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to join Bon Jovi at Live Earth India|work=[[NME]]|date=21 November 2008|access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref> but the concert was cancelled in light of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|26 November terrorist attacks]] in Mumbai.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled|title=Live Earth India cancelled after Mumbai attacks|first= Sean |last= Michaels|date= 1 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=18 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> In April 2008, Waters discussed a possible new album with the tentative name ''Heartland''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/rocky_mountain_music/2008/04/read_the_complete_roger_waters.html|title=Read the complete Roger Waters interview|first=Mark|last=Brown|work=Rocky Mountain News|date=25 April 2008|access-date=17 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429170452/http://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/rocky_mountain_music/2008/04/read_the_complete_roger_waters.html|archive-date=29 April 2010}}</ref>

==Activism==
===Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and Accusations of Anti-Semitism===
Waters first saw the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] in 2006, at the request of Palestinian supporters, when he was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv. After viewing the barrier, he moved his Tel Aviv concert to [[Neve Shalom]], because he believed his presence in Tel Aviv would "inadvertently legitimise the oppression [he] had seen".

==Equipment==
Waters's primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass. He briefly played a [[Höfner]] bass but replaced it with a [[Rickenbacker 4001|Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S]], until 1970 when it was stolen along with the rest of the band's equipment in New Orleans.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}} He began using [[Fender Precision Bass]]es in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London, in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972, when it became his main stage guitar. On 2 October 2010, it became the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fender.com/series/artist/roger-waters-precision-bass/ |title= Roger Waters Precision Bass |publisher= [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]] |access-date= 9 October 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130112075529/http://www.fender.com/series/artist/roger-waters-precision-bass/ |archive-date= 12 January 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Waters endorses [[RotoSound]] Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotosound.com/endorsees.php|title=Rotosound Endorsees|publisher=Rotosound|access-date=23 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205210630/http://www.rotosound.com/endorsees.php|archive-date=5 February 2011}}</ref> Throughout his career he has used [[The Selmer Company|Selmer]], [[Watkins Electric Music|WEM]], [[Hiwatt]] and [[Ashdown Engineering|Ashdown]] amplifiers but has used [[Ampeg]] for the last few tours.
