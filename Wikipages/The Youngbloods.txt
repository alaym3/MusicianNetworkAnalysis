'''The Youngbloods''' were an American rock band consisting of [[Jesse Colin Young]] (vocals, bass), [[Jerry Corbitt]] (guitar), Lowell "Banana" Levinger (guitar and [[electric piano]]), and Joe Bauer (drums). Despite receiving critical acclaim, they never achieved widespread popularity. Their only U.S. [[Top 40]] entry was [[Chet Powers]]' "[[Get Together (The Youngbloods song)|Get Together]]".<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

==Band history==
===Background and formation===
Jesse Colin Young (born Perry Miller, November 22, 1941, [[Queens]], New York City) was a moderately successful [[folk singer]] with two LPs under his belt – ''Soul of a City Boy'' (1964) and ''Youngblood'' (1965) – when he met fellow [[Traditional music|folk]] singer and former [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musician from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[Jerry Corbitt]] (born Jerry Byron Corbitt, January 7, 1943, [[Tifton, Georgia]]).<ref name=tribute/><ref name="Dead 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2014.html#sthash.LW2iVCIO.uJpgNEPn.dpbs |title=January to June 2014 |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |access-date=11 March 2014}}</ref> When in town, Young would drop in on Corbitt, and the two played together exchanging harmonies.

Beginning in January 1965, the two began performing on the Canadian circuit as a [[duet (music)|duo]], eventually adopting the name "The Youngbloods".<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1289/90}}</ref> Young played bass, and Corbitt played piano, harmonica and lead guitar. Corbitt introduced Young to a bluegrass musician, Lowell Levinger (born Lowell Vincent Levinger III, September 9, 1944, [[Manhattan]]). Levinger, known as "Banana", could play the piano, [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[mandola]], guitar and bass; he had played in the Proper Bostonians and the Trolls, and played mainly piano and guitar in the Youngbloods. He knew of a fellow tenant who could flesh out the band, Joe Bauer (born September 26, 1941, [[Memphis, Tennessee]]), an aspiring [[jazz]] drummer with experience playing in society dance bands.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===Small gigs to recording success===
Once the line-up was set, Jesse Colin Young and the Youngbloods, as the group was then known, began building a reputation from their club dates. (Early demo sides from 1965 were later issued by [[Mercury Records]] on the ''Two Trips'' album.) Their first concert had been at Gerde's Folk City in [[Greenwich Village]]; months later, they were the [[house band]] at the [[Cafe Au Go Go]] and had signed a recording contract with [[RCA Victor]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Young, however, was not satisfied with RCA.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The arrangement produced one charting single, "Grizzly Bear" (number 52 in 1967).<ref name="Larkin"/> Several critically praised albums followed: ''[[The Youngbloods LP|The Youngbloods]]'' (1967, later retitled ''Get Together''); ''[[Earth Music]]'' (1967); and ''[[Elephant Mountain]]'' (1969), with the track "[[Darkness, Darkness]]".<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1967, when "[[Get Together (The Youngbloods song)|Get Together]]", a paean to universal brotherhood, first appeared, it did not sell well, reaching only number 62 on the chart.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sullivan|first1=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Vol. 2|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810882966|page=410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAQBAJ&q=Get+Together+by+the+youngbloods+1967+chart+position&pg=PA410|access-date=April 14, 2015}}</ref> But two years later – after [[Dan Ingram]] had recorded a brotherhood promotion for [[WABC-AM]] in which the song was used as a bed for the promotion, and after the [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation|National Council of Christians and Jews]] subsequently used the song in television and radio commercials – the track was re-released and cracked the [[Top 40|Top 5]].<ref name="npr2019"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Billboard Singles|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-youngbloods-mn0000692251/awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 14, 2015}}</ref> This [[gramophone record|disc]] sold over one million copies and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]], awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], on October 7, 1969.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

[[Johnny Carson]] once reportedly refused to allow the band to perform on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', saying they were overly demanding during the pre-show [[soundcheck]]. In a 2009 interview, Young stated that the band refused to perform because the show reneged on a promise that they could play a song from their new album ''Elephant Mountain'', instead demanding that they play only "Get Together".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/lltv/index.php?task=video&video=657 |title=Jesse Colin Young – Walking Off Johnny Carson |date=February 5, 2009 |publisher=Living Legends Music |access-date=August 25, 2012}}</ref>

With Corbitt's departure from the band (for a solo career) in 1969, before the band recorded the album ''Elephant Mountain'', Levinger assumed lead guitar duties and played extensively on Wurlitzer electric piano.<ref name="Larkin"/> The band became adept at lengthy improvisations in their live performances (as captured on the albums ''[[Rock Festival (album)|Rock Festival]]'' and ''Ride the Wind'', released after the band moved over to their own Raccoon label,<ref name="Larkin"/> distributed by [[Warner Brothers]]).

The group added the bassist Michael Kane to their lineup in 1971 and released two more albums: ''Good & Dusty'' (1971), which featured "Hippie from Olema" (an answer to [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]"), and ''High on a Ridgetop'' (1972), before disbanding.<ref name="Larkin"/> Young, Levinger and Bauer went on to solo careers; only Young had any notable success. Levinger, Bauer and Kane were part of another group, Noggins, in 1972, which released one album, ''Crab Tunes''. Bauer died of a [[brain tumor]] in September 1982, at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1980.html |title=The 1980s |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |access-date=11 March 2014}}</ref>

===Later history===
In 1971, [[Jerry Corbitt]] and former Youngbloods producer [[Charlie Daniels]] formed a band called Corbitt & Daniels and toured.

In 1976 HT Rabin, the drummer from Alias, joined the Youngbloods for a brief tour.

Banana supplied guitar, banjo, synthesizer, and back-up vocals to [[Mimi Fariña]]'s 1985 solo album, ''Solo'', and also toured with her on and off from 1973 until the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Banana (Lowell Levinger)|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/banana.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234442/http://www.richardandmimi.com/banana.html|archive-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref> During the 1980s and 1990s, he played with the jam rock band Zero on keyboards, vocals and rhythm guitar.

In late 1984, the Youngbloods briefly reunited for a club tour. The 1984 line-up contained Young, Corbitt and Levinger, plus new members [[David Perper]] (drums, ex-[[Pablo Cruise]]) and Scott Lawrence (keyboards, woodwinds). Once the tour was completed, the group disbanded once again by mid-1985.

Jerry Corbitt died of lung cancer on March 8, 2014. He was 71.<ref name=tribute>{{cite web |url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Jerry-Byron-Corbitt-100924020|title=Jerry Byron Corbitt|website=Tributes.com|access-date=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Dead 2"/>

Lowell Levinger released three self-produced [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] albums as "Grandpa Banana": ''I'll Do Anything For You'' (2009), ''Just Trying To Break Even'' (2011) and ''Even Grandpas Get The Blues'' (2012).  He later joined [[Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul]] for their 2017 European and 2018 American tours in support of (Steven) Van Zandt's latest album, ''Soulfire''.

In 2014, Sony Music Japan remastered the first three Youngbloods albums as ''The Youngbloods – 3 Albums Collection 1967–1969'' (Mini LP BSCD2). ''The Youngbloods'' and ''Earth Music,'' contain both mono and stereo versions of the album plus bonus tracks.  ''Elephant Mountain'' contains the full stereo version of the album, plus a few mono versions of selected tracks plus bonus tracks.
