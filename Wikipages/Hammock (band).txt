'''Hammock''' is an American two-member [[Ambient music|ambient]]/[[post-rock]] band from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], United States. Hammock creates atmospheric music by combining orchestral arrangements with electronic beats, piano and droning guitar.

Hammock have released 10 albums and five EPs since 2005, mostly on their own label, [[Hammock Music]], which is distributed through [[Secretly Group|Secretly Distribution]],<ref name="SecretlyDistribution" /> and have garnered favorable reviews from critics, including ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]''<ref name="PitchforkRaisingReview" /><ref name="PitchforkMaybeReview" /><ref name="PitchforkChasingReview" /> and [[AllMusic]].<ref name="AllMusicReviews" />

==History==
Hammock was formed as a collaboration between guitarists [[Marc Byrd]] and Andrew Thompson, both formerly of [[alternative rock]] band [[Common Children]], that developed out of informal recording sessions between songwriting projects.<ref name="EndlessSkyInterview" /> Byrd and Thompson initially had no intention of releasing their studio efforts. After building up a collection of almost 40 songs, however, they changed their minds. In December 2005, American [[Online magazine|webzine]] [[Somewherecold Records|''Somewhere Cold'']] voted Hammock Artist of the Year on their ''2005 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame'' list.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lamoreaux|first=Jason T.|date=December 1, 2005|title=Somewhere Cold Awards 2005|url=https://somewherecold.net/2005/12/01/swc-awards-2005/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930034224/https://somewherecold.net/2005/12/01/swc-awards-2005/|archive-date=September 30, 2005|access-date=September 30, 2005|website=[[Somewherecold Records|Somewhere Cold]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Hammock gave their first live performance at a private event at Chuck Dodson's Gallery@404B in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] on August 3, 2007, to honor [[Jónsi & Alex]], the artistic collaboration between [[Jón Þór Birgisson|Jón Þór (Jónsi) Birgisson]] (lead singer and guitarist of [[Sigur Rós]]) and [[Alex Somers]] (graphic designer and member of the band [[Parachutes (band)|Parachutes]]), on the night of their United States premier, which was also their first-ever exhibition outside of [[Iceland]]. This performance eventually became the inspiration for ''[[Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow]]'' (featuring artwork by Jónsi & Alex), which was recorded live in its entirety, save for a few overdubs.<ref name="OfficialBiography" /><ref name="PasteMagazineInterview" />  In 2008, Hammock performed at the Wordless Music Series in New York City with [[Stars of the Lid]].<ref name="WordlessMusic" />

In May 2010, Hammock released their fifth full-length album, ''[[Chasing After Shadows...Living with the Ghosts]]''. That December, Hammock released their fourth EP, ''[[Longest Year EP|Longest Year]]'', a beatless and wordless mini-album that was born out of the difficulty the band faced in 2010, including the near-total destruction of Byrd's home in the epic 2010 [[Nashville flood]].<ref name="OfficialBiography" />

Over the next few years, Hammock expanded their musical horizons with a variety of collaborations and the addition of more of an [[orchestra]]l aspect to their music. Hammock collaborated with singer-songwriter [[Matthew Ryan (musician)|Matthew Ryan]] on the single "Like New Year's Day", released on January 1, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2011/01/23/mp3-at-3pm-matthew-ryan-hammock/|title=MP3 At 3PM: Matthew Ryan & Hammock|website=Magnetmagazine.com|date=23 January 2011}}</ref> On March 8, 2011, the band issued a cover of [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]]'s "[[Black Metallic]]" as a digital single, featuring vocals by Byrd's wife, [[Christine Glass]] (the couple had previously collaborated as a duo, GlassByrd). On October 5, 2011, they released a four-song collaboration EP with [[Steve Kilbey]] and [[Tim Powles]] of [[The Church (band)|the Church]] called ''Asleep in the Downlights''.<ref name="DownlightsOfficial" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/10/hammock-asleep-in-the-downlights.html|title=Hammock: Asleep in the Downlights|website=Pastemagazine.com|date=24 October 2011}}</ref>

On July 6, 2012, Hammock announced that mastering had started for their sixth LP and first [[double album]], ''[[Departure Songs]]''. It was released on October 2, 2012.<ref name="DoubleAlbumTwitterAnnouncement" />

On May 10, 2013, they announced that they had begun mixing a new record, ''[[Oblivion Hymns]]''. The album was released on November 26, 2013, and was a notable departure from their previously guitar-focused sound, adding a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] element with a full orchestra, [[Choir|children's choir]], and vocals from Timothy Showalter ([[Strand of Oaks]]).<ref name="OfficialBiography" />

On July 1, 2014, Hammock reissued their fully ambient 2005 album ''The Sleep-Over Series (Volume 1)'', following it up with a sequel, ''The Sleepover Series, Volume 2'', on September 23, 2014.

Hammock's ninth album, ''Everything and Nothing'', was released on April 1, 2016. Irish music and politics magazine ''[[Hot Press]]'' said in its review that the album is "the aural equivalent of a flotation tank... an album to lose yourself in completely".<ref name="HotPressEANReview" /> Haydon Spenceley, reviewing for ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', stated that the album has "clarity, purpose, drivenness, even, not words that would necessarily be associated with this stellar band's earlier work... This is music of transcendent beauty, but with an added level of dissonance that grabs the attention in a way that hasn't ever seemed to be Hammock's stock in trade before". Spenceley also claimed that ''Everything and Nothing'' is Hammock's "most immediate, most sonorous and beautiful album to date".<ref name="DrownedInSoundEANReview" />

On November 29, 2016, Hammock announced on their [[Twitter]] page that they were in the process of recording a new album, with [[Slow Meadow]] guesting.<ref name="HammockSlowMeadowNextRecordTweet" /> On June 21, 2017, Hammock announced via their [[Facebook]] page that their 10th album, ''Mysterium'', would be released on August 25, 2017. They also released a video of the first single, "Things of Beauty Burn".<ref name="MysteriumAnnouncement" />

In 2017, Hammock composed the score for Kogonada's critically acclaimed film ''[[Columbus (2017 film)|Columbus]]'', which premiered at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name="ColumbusScore" /><ref name="VarietyColumbusReview" />

In 2018, Hammock released an album, ''We Will Rise Again'', that "reimagined" work composed by [[Dan Romer]] for the 2017 videogame, ''[[Far Cry 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web

In 2018, Hammock released the follow-up to 2017's ''Mysterium'' with the album, ''Universalis''.
In 2019, Hammock released the follow-up to 2019's ''Universalis'' with the album, ''Silencia'', thus concluding their self proclaimed "trilogy" <ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/B45ArX9pSZC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</ref>

In 2020, Hammock released a remaster of their 2010 EP, ''Longest Year'', with a physical release as well as new album artwork <ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CH0j_VqpK-P/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</ref>

In 2021, Hammock released their eleventh studio album, ''Elsewhere''.

==Other projects==
Since 2005, Byrd has occasionally recorded as a member of the band [[The Choir (alternative rock band)|the Choir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2005/features/mbryd.html|title=A Feature of The Phantom Tollbooth|first=Shari|last=Lloyd|website=Tollbooth.org}}</ref>

Hammock guested on the track "Melting the Frozen Sea Within Us" by Amman/Josh, which appeared on that band's 2010 EP ''Places''.

Hammock collaborated with [[Matthew Perryman Jones]] in 2013 on the song "Unknown", released as part of the ''Nashville Indie Spotlight 2014'' compilation album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NbxgEMV_gI/|title=Hammock & Matthew Perryman Jones: Unknown|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref>

Building on their 2011 collaboration with Matthew Ryan, Hammock announced a side project named the Summer Kills in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://matthewryanonline.com/blogs/news/posts/the-summer-kills|title=The Summer Kills|website=Matthewryanonline.com|accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref> After seven years of work, the trio's first album, ''Last Night We Became Swans'' (mixed by [[Peter Katis]]) was released on April 27, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesummerkills.com/about|title=About|website=Thesummerkills.com|accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigtakeover.com/recordings/the-summer-kills-last-night-we-became-swans-hammock-music/|title=The Big Takeover: The Summer Kills - Last Night We Became Swans|first=Elizabeth|last= Klisiewicz}}</ref>
