==Biography==

===Early years===
Kurt Carr was born in the mid-1960s in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he grew up in a family who believed in Jesus, but was not deeply involved in church. At the age of 13, Kurt found himself being increasingly drawn to the church. In his early teen years, he performed as an actor and dancer at the [[Hartford Stage Company]] in a Broadway musical called ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', which was directed by Clay Stevenson. He became an active member in his church's music department. At the age of 17, Carr realized that he was being called to do something even higher with his life. After high school, he entered into the music program at the [[University of Connecticut]], where he studied classical music and earned a Fine Arts degree. Carr is a member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.

===Music career===
====Early career====
Carr was piano accompanist for [[Andrae Crouch]]'s music ministry for one year. Carr was subsequently hired to be musical director and pianist for [[Rev. James Cleveland]]’s ministry in 1986  and was employed there for seven years, until Cleveland's death. Eventually, Carr became director of the West Angeles [[Church of God in Christ]] Choir, where he had the opportunity to work with both gospel and secular musical artists, including [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Yolanda Adams]] and [[Kirk Franklin]]. In 1987 while in Los Angeles, Carr formed a six-member gospel [[vocal ensemble]] called The Kurt Carr Singers. They released their first album in 1988. Years later on Light Records in 1991. The singers released major-label debut Together which was recorded live a few months after Rev. James Cleveland's death. Light Records eventually had problems however, Kurt Carr met Vicki Mack the founder of GospoCentric Records.

====Serious About It, No One Else, Awesome Wonder====
In 1994, the group released their first album on Gospocentric titled Serious About It! The album also featured background vocals by the Background Choir called the Choir of Life which features members from [[West Angeles Church of God in Christ]]. The album also featured a remake of Salt-N-Pepa's [[What a Man (song)#Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue version|Whatta Man]]. They also toured Kirk Franklin & The Family began shortly thereafter. In July 1996, the singers had a live recording at West Angeles church for their album No One Else which was released in March 1997. The live recording featured a lot of celebrities in attendance. The album also features [[Anastacia]], [[Mary Mary]], & Andrea McClurkin-Mellini (who is the sister of [[Donnie McClurkin]]) also serving as one of the additional background singers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anastacia-archive.de/cds/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130909101846/http://www.anastacia-archive.de/cds/ |archive-date=September 9, 2013 }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The album won awards for the song For Every Mountain. In 2000, Kurt Carr and his group released  Awesome Wonder which featured In the Sanctuary which also won awards. The album was considered a "blockbuster" as it was Carr's first album to be that popular, months later Kurt Carr was featured on the Kingdom Come Soundtrack.

====2005-2012 ''One Church, Just the Beginning, Bless this House''====
Years later in 2005 after GospoCentric became owned by [[Zomba Label Group]], Kurt Carr release the One Church Project which was known for God Blocked It and God Great God. The theme of the album was about being a multicultural church. In 2008, Kurt Carr released his first two disc album Just the Beginning which was released on his self titled label Kurt Carr Gospel and Zomba. The group also grew to seven members. In 2013, Kurt Carr released Bless this House on Verity Gospel Music Group which included the single I've Seen Him Do It, We've Gotta Put Jesus Back, & Great God Great  Praise.

===2019–Present=== ''Bless Somebody Else''
After a six-year hiatus, Kurt Carr released Bless Somebody Else on RCA Records' Gospel Label RCA Inspiration in 2019 in which Kurt Carr Gospel Label from Just the Beginning returned. The single was released the same year as long with the single  Blessing After Blessing which is a [[ballad]] a year later.
