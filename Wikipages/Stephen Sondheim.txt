'''Stephen Joshua Sondheim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|n|d|h|aɪ|m}} {{Respell|SOND|hyme}}; March 22, 1930 – November 26, 2021) was an American composer and lyricist. Among the most important figures in 20th-century [[musical theater]], Sondheim was praised for having "reinvented the American musical" with shows that tackled "unexpected themes that range far beyond the [genre's] traditional subjects" with "music and lyrics of unprecedented complexity and sophistication". His shows addressed "darker, more harrowing elements of the human experience" with songs often tinged with "ambivalence" about various aspects of life.

Sondheim started his theatre career by writing the lyrics for ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957) and ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' (1959) before becoming a composer and lyricist. Sondheim's best-known works include ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962), ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), ''[[Follies]]'' (1971), ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (1979), ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1981), ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), and ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987).

Sondheim's accolades include eight [[Tony Awards]] (including a Lifetime Achievement Tony in 2008),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winners|url=https://www.tonyawards.com/winners/?q=Stephen%20Sondheim|access-date=October 3, 2021|website=www.tonyawards.com|language=en-US|archive-date=October 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003230829/https://www.tonyawards.com/winners/?q=Stephen%20Sondheim|url-status=live}}</ref> an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], eight [[Grammy Awards]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]], a [[Laurence Olivier Award]], and a 2015 [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. He has a theater named for him both on [[Stephen Sondheim Theatre|Broadway]] and in [[Sondheim Theatre|the West End of London]]. Sondheim wrote film music, contributing "Goodbye for Now" for [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981). He wrote five songs for 1990's ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', including "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)]]", sung in the film by [[Madonna]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Film adaptations of Sondheim's work include ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962), ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966), ''[[A Little Night Music (film)|A Little Night Music]]'' (1977), ''[[Gypsy (1993 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1993), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), ''[[Into the Woods (film)|Into the Woods]]'' (2014), ''[[West Side Story (2021 film)|West Side Story]]'' (2021), and ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (film)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (TBD).

==Early life and education==
Sondheim was born on March 22, 1930, into a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[New York City]], the son of Etta Janet ("Foxy"; {{née}} Fox; 1897–1992) and Herbert Sondheim (1895–1966).<ref name="Secrest book">[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/secrest-sondheim.html Secrest book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828024544/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/secrest-sondheim.html |date=August 28, 2017 }}''The New York Times''</ref> His father manufactured dresses designed by his mother. The composer grew up on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] and, after his parents divorced, on a farm near [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. As the only child of well-to-do parents living in [[the San Remo]] at 145 [[Central Park West]], he was described in [[Meryle Secrest]]'s biography (''Stephen Sondheim: A Life'') as an isolated, emotionally neglected child. When he lived in New York City, Sondheim attended the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]].

===Mentorship by Oscar Hammerstein II===
[[File:Oscar Hammerstein - portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Studio photo of a smiling Oscar Hammerstein|[[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]] {{circa|1940}}]]
When Sondheim was about ten years old (around the time of his parents' divorce), he formed a close friendship with [[James Hammerstein]], son of lyricist and playwright [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theater. Sondheim met [[Harold Prince|Hal Prince]], who would later direct many of his shows, at the opening of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]],'' Hammerstein's musical with [[Richard Rodgers]]. The comic musical he wrote at George School, ''By George'', was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem. When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: "But if you want to know why it's terrible, I'll tell you.” They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, "In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime."<ref name="Zadan, Craig p. 4">Zadan, Craig, ''Sondheim & Co.'', New York: Harper & Row, 1974 & 1986 p. 4 {{ISBN|0-06-015649-X}}</ref>

Hammerstein designed a course of sorts for Sondheim on constructing a musical. He had the young composer write four musicals, each with one of the following conditions:<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaufman|first=David|date=October 5, 1998|title=Book review: Stephen Sondheim: A Life|work=[[The Nation]]|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stephen+Sondheim%3A+A+Life-a021250311|access-date=November 29, 2021}}</ref>

None of the "assignment" musicals were produced professionally.

=== Education ===
Sondheim began attending [[Williams College]], a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], whose theater program attracted him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musopen.org/pt/education/instrument/323/piano/great-composers/20th-century-composers/stephen-sondheim/|title=Stephen Sondheim for Piano – Guides|website=musopen.org|language=pt|access-date=February 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210002843/https://musopen.org/pt/education/instrument/323/piano/great-composers/20th-century-composers/stephen-sondheim/|archive-date=February 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> His first teacher there was Robert Barrow:

<blockquote>&nbsp;... everybody hated him because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' It never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a [[Leading-tone|leading tone]] is, you think, Oh my God. What a [[diatonic scale]] is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schiff |first1=Stephen |year=2010 |title=Deconstructing Sondheim |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=2 |page=16 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X }}</ref></blockquote>

The composer told Meryle Secrest, "I just wanted to study composition, theory, and harmony without the attendant [[musicology]] that comes in graduate school. But I knew I wanted to write for the theatre, so I wanted someone who did not disdain theatre music."<ref name="An early influence">{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=An early influence |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=4 |page=6 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X }}</ref> Barrow suggested that Sondheim study with [[Milton Babbitt]], whom Sondheim described as "a frustrated show composer" with whom he formed "a perfect combination".<ref name="An early influence"/> When they met, Babbitt was working on a musical for [[Mary Martin]] based on the myth of [[Helen of Troy]]. The two would meet once a week in New York City for four hours. (At the time, Babbitt was teaching at [[Princeton University]].) According to Sondheim, they spent the first hour dissecting [[Rodgers and Hart]] or [[George Gershwin]] or studying Babbitt's favorites ([[Buddy DeSylva]], [[Lew Brown]], and [[Ray Henderson]]). They then proceeded to other forms of music (such as [[Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter Symphony]]), critiquing them the same way.<ref name=Bermel>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBVLHv01WE|title=A Conversation with Stephen Sondheim|date=May 9, 2012|access-date=December 9, 2017|publisher=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409142524/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBVLHv01WE|archive-date=April 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Babbitt and Sondheim, fascinated by mathematics, studied songs by a variety of composers (especially [[Jerome Kern]]). Sondheim told Secrest that Kern had the ability "to develop a single motif through tiny variations into a long and never boring line and his maximum development of the minimum of material". He said about Babbitt, "I am his maverick, his one student who went into the popular arts with all his serious artillery".<ref name="An early influence"/> At Williams, Sondheim wrote a musical adaption of ''[[Beggar on Horseback]]'' (a 1924 play by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Marc Connelly]], with permission from Kaufman) which had three performances.<ref>Lipton, James.

At age 22, Sondheim had finished the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Screenwriters [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip G. Epstein|Philip Epstein]]'s ''Front Porch in Flatbush'', unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by designer and producer [[Lemuel Ayers]]. Ayers approached [[Frank Loesser]] and another composer who both turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius Epstein]] flew in from California and hired Sondheim, who worked with him in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled ''[[Saturday Night (musical)|Saturday Night]]'', was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of [[leukemia]] in his early forties. The production rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned;<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|title=Stephen Sondheim Biography and Interview|website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/achiever/stephen-sondheim/#interview|access-date=April 16, 2020|archive-date=December 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219192108/https://achievement.org/achiever/stephen-sondheim/#interview|url-status=live}}</ref> it opened [[off-Broadway]] in 2000. Sondheim later said, "I don't have any emotional reaction to ''Saturday Night'' at all – except fondness. It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, leave it. It's my baby pictures.

== Career == 
===1954–1959: Early Broadway success===
[[Burt Shevelove]] invited Sondheim to a party where Sondheim arrived before him but knew no one else well. He saw a familiar face, [[Arthur Laurents]], who had seen one of the auditions of ''Saturday Night'', and they began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' with [[Leonard Bernstein]], but they needed a lyricist; [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from ''Saturday Night'' and he could audition for Bernstein. The following day, Sondheim met and played for Bernstein, who said he would let him know. Sondheim wanted to write music and lyrics; he consulted with Hammerstein, who said, as Sondheim related in a 2008 New York Times video interview, "Look, you have a chance to work with very gifted professionals on a show that sounds interesting, and you could always write your own music eventually. My advice would be to take the job."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> ''[[West Side Story]]'', directed by [[Jerome Robbins]], opened in 1957 and ran for 732 performances. Sondheim expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they did not always fit the characters and were sometimes too consciously poetic. Initially Bernstein was also credited as a co-writer of the lyrics; later, however, Bernstein offered Sondheim solo credit, as Sondheim had essentially done all of them. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the show never even mentioned the lyrics.<ref name="Times 90th Tribute">{{cite news |title=Isn't He Something |author=Jesse Green | issue=Theater p. AR 11 |work=The New York Times |date=March 15, 2020}}</ref> Sondheim described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he was satisfied just getting the credit. Sondheim later said he wished "someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

After ''West Side Story'' opened, Shevelove lamented the lack of "low-brow comedy" on Broadway and mentioned a possible musical based on [[Plautus]]' Roman comedies. When Sondheim was interested in the idea he called a friend, [[Larry Gelbart]], to co-write the script. The show went through a number of drafts, and was interrupted briefly by Sondheim's next project.<ref>Dembin, Russell M. [http://www.sondheimreview.com/v18n4.htm "Forum at 50? It's possible!

In 1959, Sondheim was approached by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]]'s memoir after [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Cole Porter]] turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but [[Ethel Merman]] – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished ''[[Happy Hunting]]'' with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that [[Jule Styne]] write the music.<ref>Zadan, p. 38</ref> Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience. Sondheim agreed; ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The first musical for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.playbill.com/article/look-back-at-the-original-production-of-a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-forum|title = Look Back at the Original Production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum|work = [[Playbill]]|date = May 8, 2021|accessdate = November 28, 2021|last = Skethway|first = Nathan}}</ref> The [[Book musical|book]], based on [[farce]]s by [[Plautus]], was written by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]].

Sondheim had participated in three straight hits, but his next show – 1964's ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' – was a nine-performance bomb (although it introduced [[Angela Lansbury]] to musical theater). ''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'', based on [[Arthur Laurents]]' 1952 play ''[[The Time of the Cuckoo]]'', was intended as another [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical with [[Mary Martin]] in the lead. A new lyricist was needed,<ref>Laurents, Arthur, ''Original Story By'' (2000). York: Alfred A. Knopf, {{ISBN|0-375-40055-9}}, p. 212</ref> and Laurents and Rodgers' daughter, [[Mary Rodgers|Mary]], asked Sondheim to fill in. Although [[Richard Rodgers]] and Sondheim agreed that the original play did not lend itself to musicalization, they began writing the musical version.<ref>Secrest, pp.&nbsp;174–175</ref> The project had many problems, Rodgers' alcoholism among them; Sondheim, calling it the one project he regretted, then decided to work only when he could write both music and lyrics.<ref name="rich"/> He asked author and playwright [[James Goldman]] to join him as [[bookwriter]] for a new musical. Inspired by a ''New York Times'' article about a gathering of former [[Ziegfeld Follies]] showgirls, it was entitled ''The Girls Upstairs'' (and would later become ''[[Follies]]'').<ref name="Chapin">Chapin, Ted, (2003).

In 1966, Sondheim semi-anonymously provided lyrics for "[[The Boy From...]]", a parody of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" in the off-Broadway revue ''[[The Mad Show]]''. The song was credited to "Esteban Río Nido",<ref>The Mad Show: A Musical Revue Based on Mad Magazine, Samuel French Inc</ref> Spanish for "Stephen River Nest", and in the show's [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]] the lyrics were credited to "[[pen name|Nom De Plume]]". That year Goldman and Sondheim hit a creative wall on ''The Girls Upstairs'', and Goldman asked Sondheim about writing a TV musical. The result was ''[[Evening Primrose (musical)|Evening Primrose]]'', with [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Charmian Carr]]. Written for the [[anthology series]] ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'' and produced by Hubbell Robinson, it was broadcast on November 16, 1966. According to Sondheim and director [[Paul Bogart]], the musical was written only because Goldman needed money for rent. The network disliked the title and Sondheim's alternative, ''A Little Night Music''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/144210-I-Remember-Original-Evening-Primrose-Director-Recalls-Making-of-TV-Musical/pg2 |title="I Remember": Original "Evening Primrose" Director Recalls Making of TV Musical |publisher=Playbill.com |date=October 22, 2010 |access-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162610/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/144210-I-Remember-Original-Evening-Primrose-Director-Recalls-Making-of-TV-Musical/pg2 |archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

After Sondheim finished ''Evening Primrose'', Jerome Robbins asked him to adapt [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Decision (play)|The Measures Taken]]'' despite the composer's general dislike of Brecht's work. Robbins wanted to adapt another Brecht play, ''[[The Exception and the Rule]]'', and asked [[John Guare]] to adapt the book. Leonard Bernstein had not written for the stage in some time, and his contract as conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]] was ending. Sondheim was invited to Robbins' house in the hope that Guare would convince him to write the lyrics for a musical version of ''The Exception and the Rule''; according to Robbins, Bernstein would not work without Sondheim. When Sondheim agreed, Guare asked: "Why haven't you all worked together since ''West Side Story''?" Sondheim answered, "You'll see". Guare said that working with Sondheim was like being with an old college roommate, and he depended on him to "decode and decipher their crazy way of working"; Bernstein worked only after midnight, and Robbins only in the early morning. Bernstein's score, which was supposed to be light, was influenced by his need to make a musical statement.<ref name=urga>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Stephen Sondheim: A Life|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ndlY6OTKM-sC|page=1188}}|year=2011|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-307-94684-3|pages=1188–|chapter=Being Alive}}</ref> [[Stuart Ostrow]], who worked with Sondheim on ''The Girls Upstairs'', agreed to produce the musical (now entitled ''A Pray By Blecht'' and, later, ''[[The Race to Urga]]''). An opening night was scheduled, but during auditions Robbins asked to be excused for a moment. When he did not return, a doorman said he had gotten into a limousine to go to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. Bernstein burst into tears and said, "It's over". Sondheim later said of this experience: "I was ashamed of the whole project. It was arch and didactic in the worst way."<ref>Abernathy, June.[http://www.sondheim.com/commentary/blecht.html "Sondheim's Lost Musical"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320143349/http://www.sondheim.com/commentary/blecht.html |date=March 20, 2012 }} sondheim.com, accessed February 5, 2012</ref> He wrote one-and-a-half songs and threw them away, the only time he has ever done that.

Sondheim lived in a [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan]] [[brownstone]] from his writing of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard a knock on the door. His neighbor, [[Katharine Hepburn]], was in "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" and told him "You have been keeping me awake all night!" (she was practicing for her musical debut in ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]''). "I remember asking Hepburn why she didn't just call me, but she claimed not to have my phone number. My guess is that she wanted to stand there in her bare feet, suffering for her art".<ref name=wolf>Wolf, Matt.

===1970–1981: Collaborations with Hal Prince===
[[File:Stephen Sondheim, New York.jpg|thumb|Sondheim in New York, 1972]]
After ''Do I Hear a Waltz?'', Sondheim devoted himself solely to writing both music and lyrics for the theater – and in 1970, he began a collaboration with director [[Harold Prince]] that would result in a body of work that is considered one of the high water marks of musical theater history, with critic [[Howard Kissel]] writing that the duo had set "Broadway's highest standards".<ref>{{cite book|title = Harold Prince: A Director's Journey|last = Ilson|first = Carol|year = 1989|publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield|Limelight Editions]]|page = 239|isbn = 978-0879102968}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/1/20748998/hal-prince-dies-at-91-company-cabaret-sondheim-phantom|title = Broadway director Harold Prince left an unparalleled legacy of masterworks|last = Romano|first = Aja|work = [[Vox Media|Vox]]|date = August 1, 2019|accessdate = November 28, 2021}}</ref>

Their first show with Prince as director was the 1970 [[concept musical]] ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''. A show about a single man and his married friends, ''Company'' (with a book by [[George Furth]]) lacked a straightforward plot, and was instead centered around themes such as marriage and the difficulty of making an emotional connection with another person. It opened on April 26, 1970, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], where it ran for 705 performances after seven previews, and won Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Music, and Best Lyrics.<ref name = Franklin>{{cite news|url = https://www.playbill.com/article/look-back-at-the-original-production-of-company-on-broadway|title = Look Back at the Original Production of Company on Broadway

''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1981), with a book by [[George Furth]], is one of Sondheim's more traditional scores; [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Carly Simon]] have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, [[Paul Gemignani]], "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility". However, the show was not the success their previous collaborations had been: after a chaotic series of preview performances, the show opened to widely negative reviews, and closed after a run of less than two weeks. Due to the high quality of Sondheim's score, however, the show has been repeatedly revised and produced in the ensuing years. [[Martin Gottfried]] wrote, "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs&nbsp;... But [despite] that there is nothing ordinary about the music."<ref>Gottfried, Martin (photos By Martha Swope), ''Sondheim'', New York: Harry N.

===1984–1994: Collaborations with James Lapine===
''Merrily''{{'}}s failure greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theater and do movies, create video games or write mysteries: "I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal."<ref>in Gottfried, ''Sondheim'', p. 153</ref> Following ''Merrily'', Sondheim and Prince did not collaborate again until their 2003 production of ''[[Bounce (musical)|Bounce]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Simonson|first1=Robert|last2=Jones|first2=Kenneth|date=June 30, 2003|title=Sondheim and Prince Bounce Back After 20 Years with Goodman Theatre Premiere, June 30|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/sondheim-and-prince-bounce-back-after-20-years-with-goodman-theatre-premiere-june-30-com-113986|url-status=live|access-date=November 29, 2021|website=Playbill|language=en}}</ref>

However, Sondheim decided "that there are better places to start a show" and found a new collaborator in [[James Lapine]] after he saw Lapine's ''[[Twelve Dreams]]'' off-Broadway in 1981: "I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered ''Twelve Dreams'' at the [[Public Theatre]]";<ref name=wolf/> Lapine has a taste "for the [[avant-garde]] and for visually-oriented theatre in particular". Their first collaboration was ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking [[Georges Seurat]]'s [[pointillism]].

They collaborated on ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987), a musical based on several [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]]s. Although Sondheim has been called the first composer to bring [[Hip hop music|rap music]] to Broadway (with the Witch in the opening number of "Into the Woods"), he attributed the first rap in theater to [[Meredith Willson]]'s "Rock Island" from ''[[The Music Man]]'' (1957).<ref name=Bermel/> ''Into the Woods'' was revived on Broadway in 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pressley|first=Nelson|date=May 1, 2002|title=A Spruced-Up 'Into the Woods' Grows on Broadway|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/05/01/a-spruced-up-into-the-woods-grows-on-broadway/fe46862c-9c17-4ab4-bdeb-1c0e014373c1/|access-date=November 29, 2021}}</ref>

On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune|Salt Lake Tribune]]'' theater critic Nancy Melich before an audience of 1,200 at [[Kingsbury Hall]]. Melich described the evening:

<blockquote>He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, "Children Will Listen" and "Sunday", and then returned to reprise "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the [[University of Utah]]'s opera program, our backs to the audience, and I could see tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a sudden, he raised his arms and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their eyes locked with his, until the final "on an ordinary Sunday" was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=More from Sondheim |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=4 |page=6 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X }}</ref></blockquote>

===Work away from Broadway===
Sondheim was an avid fan of puzzles and games. He is credited with introducing [[cryptic crosswords]], a British invention, to American audiences through a series of cryptic crossword puzzles he created for [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] in 1968 and 1969.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/apr/16/1|title=The story of how cryptic crosswords crossed the Atlantic|last=Stephenson|first=Hugh|date=April 16, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=November 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Healy |first1=Patrick |title=This Time It's Crosswords (Not Cross Words) That Surface From Sondheim |url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/this-time-its-crosswords-not-cross-words-that-surface-from-sondheim/ |work=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2021 |archive-date=November 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223539/https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/this-time-its-crosswords-not-cross-words-that-surface-from-sondheim/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Pender2021">{{cite book |last1=Pender |first1=Rick |title=The Stephen Sondheim Encyclopedia |date=2021 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=9781538115862 |pages=423–425 |chapter=Puzzles, Games, and Mysteries}}</ref> In 1987 ''Time'' called his love of puzzlemaking "legendary in theater circles", adding that the central character of [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' was inspired by the composer. According to a rumor (denied by Shaffer in a March 10, 1996 ''New York Times'' interview), ''Sleuth'' had the working title ''Who's Afraid of Stephen Sondheim?''<ref name="master"/>

Sondheim's love of puzzles and mysteries is evident in ''[[The Last of Sheila]]'', an intricate [[whodunit]] written with longtime friend [[Anthony Perkins]]. The 1973 film, directed by [[Herbert Ross]], featured [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[James Mason]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Richard Benjamin]]. Sondheim and Perkins then went on to try to collaborate together again two more times, but the projects were ultimately unrealized. In 1975, Tony Perkins said he and Sondheim were working on another script, ''The Chorus Girl Murder Case''. "It's a sort of stew based on all those Bob Hope wartime comedies, plus a little ''[[Lady of Burlesque]]'' and a little [[Orson Welles]] magic show, all cooked into a ''Last of Sheila''-type plot", said Perkins.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Flatley, Guy|date=December 28, 1975|title=It's Been One of Tony Perkins' Better Years: A Good Year for Tony Perkins|page=O27|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> He later said other inspirations were ''[[They Got Me Covered]]'', ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'', and ''[[Cloak and Dagger (1946 film)|Cloak and Dagger]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Flatley, Guy|date=February 19, 1978|title=Perkins: Film 'sickie' turns to reel bigamy|page=E23|work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> They had sold the synopsis in October 1974.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Winer, Linda|date=October 20, 1974|title=Filling blanks in the puzzle of Sondheim", ''Chicago Tribune''|page=E3}}</ref> At one point, [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] was to direct, with [[Tommy Tune]] to star.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winecoff|first=Charles|title=Split image: the life of Anthony Perkins|publisher=Dutton|year=1996|page=327}}</ref> In November 1979, Sondheim said they had finished it.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mann, Roderick|date=November 29, 1979|title=Cool Down on 'Rough Cut'|page=G25|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> However, the film was never made.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|url-status=live|access-date=September 10, 2021|website=www.sondheim.com|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922170652/http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html}}</ref> In the 1980s, Perkins and Sondheim collaborated on another project, the seven part ''Crime and Variations'' for Motown Productions.

Sondheim also composed music for the screen, notably for [[Warren Beatty]]'s 1990 film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', which included the song "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)]]" that earned Sondheim an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].<ref name="Pender2021520">{{cite book |last1=Pender |first1=Rick |title=The Stephen Sondheim Encyclopedia |year=2021 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-5381-1587-9 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-kmEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA520 |language=en |chapter="Sooner or Later" (Song from Dick Tracy, 1990) |page=520}}</ref>

Sondheim collaborated with ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' librettist [[George Furth]] to write the play ''[[Getting Away with Murder (play)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 1996, though the Broadway production closed after 31 previews and only 17 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/getting-away-with-murder-4322|title = Getting Away With Murder|work = [[Internet Broadway Database]]|publisher = [[The Broadway League]]|accessdate = November 28, 2021}}</ref>

In 2021, he lent his voice to record a voicemail for [[Tick, Tick... Boom! (film)|Tick, Tick... Boom]]. He was unhappy with the dialogue saying he would never say that. He gave a rewrite and did the audio for the voicemail because the production wasn't able to get the actor back to re-record.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-29|title=Lin-Manuel Miranda Reveals That Stephen Sondheim Rewrote His Voicemail Scene in ‘Tick, Tick… BOOM!’|url=https://decider.com/2021/11/29/lin-manuel-miranda-stephen-sondheim-rewrite-tick-tick-boom/|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Decider|language=en-US}}</ref>

==={{anchor|Mentorship of others}}Mentoring===
After he was mentored by Oscar Hammerstein II<ref name="Zadan, Craig p. 4"/> Sondheim returned the favor, saying that he loved "passing on what Oscar passed on to me".<ref name="youtube.com"/> In an interview with Sondheim for ''The Legacy Project'', composer-lyricist [[Adam Guettel]] (son of [[Mary Rodgers]] and grandson of [[Richard Rodgers]]) recalled how as a 14-year-old boy he showed Sondheim his work. Guettel was "crestfallen" since he had come in "sort of all puffed up thinking [he] would be rained with compliments and things", which was not the case since Sondheim had some "very direct things to say". Later, Sondheim wrote and apologized to Guettel for being "not very encouraging" when he was actually trying to be "constructive".<ref name=legacy>{{cite AV media| people = Stephen Sondheim, Adam Guettel| title = The Legacy Project: Stephen Sondheim (In Conversation with Adam Guettel) – Educational Version with Public Performance Rights | medium = DVD| publisher = Transient Pictures | date = 2011}}</ref>

Sondheim also mentored a fledgling [[Jonathan Larson]], attending Larson's workshop for his ''Superbia'' (a musical version of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''). In Larson's musical ''[[Tick, Tick... Boom!]]'', the phone message is played in which Sondheim apologizes for leaving early, says he wants to meet him and is impressed with his work. After Larson's death, Sondheim called him one of the few composers "attempting to blend contemporary pop music with theater music, which doesn't work very well; he was on his way to finding a real synthesis. A good deal of pop music has interesting lyrics, but they are not theater lyrics". A musical-theatre composer "must have a sense of what is theatrical, of how you use music to tell a story, as opposed to writing a song. Jonathan understood that instinctively."<ref>{{cite web |author=Anthony Tommasini |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/theater/theater-a-composer-s-death-echoes-in-his-musical.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1 |title=THEATER;A Composer's Death Echoes in His Musical – New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=February 11, 1996 |access-date=July 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406111532/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/theater/theater-a-composer-s-death-echoes-in-his-musical.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1 |archive-date=April 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Around 2008, Sondheim approached [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] to work with him translating ''[[West Side Story]]'' lyrics into Spanish for an upcoming Broadway revival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nymag.com/guides/fallpreview/2008/theater/49532 |title=This Could Drive a Person Crazy |work=New York Magazine |first=Jeremy |last=McCarter |date=August 24, 2008 |access-date=April 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318120646/http://nymag.com/guides/fallpreview/2008/theater/49532/ |archive-date=March 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Rebecca Mead">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/hamiltons|title=All About The Hamiltons|work=The New Yorker|author=Rebecca Mead|date=February 9, 2015|access-date=June 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930211838/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/hamiltons|archive-date=September 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Miranda then approached Sondheim with his new project ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', then called ''The Hamilton Mixtape'', which Sondheim gave notes on.<ref name="Rebecca Mead"/><ref name="Rosen">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jody |title=The American Revolutionary |work=The New York Times Style Magazine |date=July 8, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/t-magazine/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-roots-sondheim.html |access-date=June 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617013314/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/t-magazine/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-roots-sondheim.html |archive-date=June 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sondheim was originally wary of the project saying he was "worried that an evening of rap might get monotonous". However, Sondheim believed Miranda's attention to, and respect for, good rhyming made it work.<ref name="Rosen" />

===Dramatists Guild===
A supporter of writers' rights in the theater industry, Sondheim was an active member of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]]. In 1973, he was elected as the Guild's sixteenth president, and he continued his presidency of the non-profit organization until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dgf.org/staff/stephen-sondheim/|title=Stephen Sondheim – Dramatists Guild Foundation|website=dgf.org}}</ref>

According to Sondheim, he was asked to translate ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel]]'': "But, I'm not a [[Brecht]]/[[Kurt Weill|Weill]] fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better than I do his stuff before&nbsp;...

Sondheim mentioned, that round 1960 he and Burt Shevelove considered making a musical of the film ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', and had sketched out the opening scenes when they approached the film's director [[Billy Wilder]] at a cocktail party on the possibility. Wilder rejected the idea, believing the story was more suited to opera than musical theater. Sondheim agreed, and resisted a later offer from Hal Prince and Hugh Wheeler to create a musical version starring [[Angela Lansbury]].

Sondheim worked with [[William Goldman]] on ''Singing Out Loud'', a musical film, in 1992, penning the song "Water Under the Bridge".<ref>Robert Gordon – 2014 The Oxford Handbook of Sondheim Studies – Page 294 019990927X "Omitted from this survey are the song "Water under the Bridge" composed for the film Singing out Loud, which was never produced."</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheimguide.com/unproduced.html#Singing|title='Singing Out Loud' listing|publisher=Sondheimguide.com|access-date=September 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714191540/http://www.sondheimguide.com/unproduced.html#Singing|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> According to the composer, Goldman wrote one or two drafts of the script and Sondheim wrote six-and-a-half songs when director [[Rob Reiner]] lost interest in the project. "Dawn" and "Sand", from the film, were recorded for the albums ''Sondheim at the Movies'' and ''Unsung Sondheim''.<ref name=bww/> Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein wrote ''The Race to Urga'', scheduled for Lincoln Center in 1969, but when [[Jerome Robbins]] left the project it was not produced.<ref>Long, Robert.

In 1991, Sondheim worked with [[Terrence McNally]] on a musical, ''All Together Now''. McNally said, "Steve was interested in telling the story of a relationship from the present back to the moment when the couple first met. We worked together a while, but we were both involved with so many other projects that this one fell through". The story follows Arden Scott, a 30-something female sculptor, and Daniel Nevin, a slightly-younger, sexually attractive restaurateur. Its script, with concept notes by McNally and Sondheim, is archived in the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frontain |first1=Raymond-Jean |year=2011 |title=Mutual admiration |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=3 |pages=30–33 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X}}</ref>

In August 2003, Sondheim expressed interest in the idea of creating a musical adaptation of the 1993 comedy film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/sondheim-talks-about-bounce-revisions-in-works-114941|title=Sondheim Talks About Bounce; Revisions in Works|date=August 26, 2003|publisher=[[Playbill]]|work=playbill.com|access-date=May 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425153623/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/sondheim-talks-about-bounce-revisions-in-works-114941|archive-date=April 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of ''Groundhog Day'' would be to [[wikt:gild the lily|gild the lily]].

[[Nathan Lane]] mentioned that he once approached Sondheim on the possibility of creating a musical based on the film ''[[Being There]]'' with Lane starring as the central character of Chance. Sondheim declined on the basis that the central character is essentially a cipher, whom an audience would not accept expressing himself through song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfYMeRjR1g&t=7s | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/iQfYMeRjR1g| archive-date=October 30, 2021|title=Nathan Lane's Closet Picks |author=criterioncollection |website=youtube.com |date=June 10, 2021 |access-date=August 25, 2021 |url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Henry Miller's Theatre, on West 43rd Street in New York City, was renamed the [[Stephen Sondheim Theatre]] on September 15, 2010, for the composer's 80th birthday. In attendance were Nathan Lane, Patti LuPone, and John Weidman. Sondheim said in response to the honor, "I'm deeply embarrassed. Thrilled, but deeply embarrassed. I've always hated my last name. It just doesn't sing. I mean, it's not [[David Belasco|Belasco]]. And it's not Rodgers and it's not [[Neil Simon|Simon]]. And it's not [[August Wilson|Wilson]]. It just doesn't sing. It sings better than [[Gerald Schoenfeld|Schoenfeld]] and [[Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre|Jacobs]]. But it just doesn't sing". Lane said, "We love our corporate sponsors and we love their money, but there's something sacred about naming a theatre, and there's something about this that is right and just".<ref>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=It might not sing, but it's right and just |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=3 |page=4 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X }}</ref>

==Style and themes==
According to Sondheim, when he asked [[Milton Babbitt]] if he could study [[atonality]], Babbitt replied: "You haven't exhausted [[tonality|tonal]] resources for yourself yet, so I'm not going to teach you atonal".<ref>Horowitz, Mark Eden, ''Sondheim on Music'', New York: Scarecrow Press, 2003, p. 117, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-4437-7}}, {{ISBN|0-8108-4437-0}}</ref> Music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] wrote that Sondheim's work, "while hewing to a tonal musical language, activated harmonies and folded elements of [[jazz]] and [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]]<nowiki/> styles in his own distinctive, exhilarating voice."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|date=November 28, 2021|title=Stephen Sondheim, as Great a Composer as He Was a Lyricist|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/arts/music/stephen-sondheim-music.html|access-date=November 29, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

He is noted for complex [[polyphony]] in his vocals, such as the five minor characters who make up a [[Greek chorus]] in 1973's ''[[A Little Night Music]]''. Sondheim used angular harmonies and intricate melodies. His musical influences were varied; although he said that he "loves [[Bach]]", his favorite musical period was from [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] to [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].<ref name="Bach">interview on ''Sunday Arts'', ABC (Australia) TV August 5, 2007 ''An Audience With Stephen Sondheim''[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/txt/s1994677.htm 2007 ABC Australia TV interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403003233/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/txt/s1994677.htm |date=April 3, 2015 }} downloadable [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/video/ ("Episode 26")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716225707/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/video/ |date=July 16, 2007 }}</ref>

Thematically, Raymond-Jean Frontain writes that Sondheim's musicals occupy a paradoxical place in gay culture, describing him as a gay creative artist who never created an explicitly gay character, but nevertheless attained gay cult status. Frontain continues:

<blockquote>He incarnates the paradox of a highly intellectualized gay perspective that prizes ambivalence, undercuts traditional American progressivism, and rejects the musical's historically idealistic view of sex, romance, and the family; but that at the same time eschews camp, deconstructs the diva, and is apparently oblivious to AIDS, the post-Stonewall struggle for civil equality, and other socio-political issues that concern most gay men of his generation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frontain |first1=Raymond-Jean |title=Sondheim, Stephen (b. 1930) |url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts/sondheim_s_A.pdf |website=GLBTQ: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lebian, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Culture |access-date=29 November 2021 |page=1 |year=2015}}</ref></blockquote>

Luca Prono described Sondheim's work as rejecting the traditional image of the [[Western world]] typically presented in Broadway productions, and instead depicting it as "predatory and alienating". His works have acquired a cult following with [[queer]] audiences, and his songs have been adopted as life scores for successive generations of gays, and have often had a primary role in AIDS fundraising events.<ref name="Prono2008">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Popular Culture |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-33599-0 |page=239 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3FYzMPH2OwC&pg=PT252 |language=en}}</ref> "Somewhere" from ''West Side Story'' was informally adopted as a [[gay anthem]] before the start of the [[gay liberation]] movement, but Sondheim rejected that reading, saying, "If you think that's a gay song, then all songs about getting away from the realities of life are gay songs."<ref name="Kaiser2007">{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Charles |title=The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America |year=2007 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0-8021-4317-4 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO7IKU79zgAC&pg=PA93 |language=en}}</ref>

In an interview by Terry Gross for the ''[[Fresh Air]]'' program on [[NPR]], Sondheim stated, 

<blockquote>I'm interested in the theater because I'm interested in communication with audiences," [...] "Otherwise I would be in concert music. I'd be in another kind of profession. I love the theater as much as music, and the whole idea of getting across to an audience and making them laugh, making them cry - just making them feel - is paramount to me."<ref name="Gross2010">{{cite web |last1=Gross |first1=Terry |title='On Sondheim:' The Musical-Theater Legend At 80 |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/04/21/124907187/on-sondheim-the-musical-theater-legend-at-80 |website=NPR.org |access-date=29 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513060546/http://www.npr.org/2010/04/21/124907187/on-sondheim-the-musical-theater-legend-at-80 |archive-date=13 May 2011 |language=en |date=21 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

==Personal life==

Sondheim was often described as introverted and solitary. In an interview with [[Frank Rich]], he said: "The outsider feeling—somebody who people want to both kiss and kill—occurred quite early in my life". Sondheim jokingly told the ''New York Times'' in 1966: "I've never found anybody I could work with as quickly as myself, or with less argument", although he described himself as "naturally a collaborative animal".<ref name="Lawson2021">{{cite news |last1=Lawson |first1=Mark |title=Stephen Sondheim: a daring and dazzling musical theatre icon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/26/stephen-sondheim-a-daring-and-dazzling-musical-theatre-icon |access-date=November 28, 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=November 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211126234529/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/26/stephen-sondheim-a-daring-and-dazzling-musical-theatre-icon |archive-date=November 26, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>
