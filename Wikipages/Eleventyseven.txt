Eleventyseven released their first EP, ''[[Quota (EP)|Quota]]'', on April 1, 2011, followed by the album ''[[Sugarfist]]'', their fourth studio album, on October 26, 2011 under [[Sony Japan]].

== Musical and lyrical themes ==

The group has garnered comparisons to groups such as [[Motion City Soundtrack]] and [[The Faint]]. They make frequent references to recent [[popular culture]], such as [[Conan O'Brien]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/GalacticConquest.asp |title=Jesus Freak Hideout's review of ''Galactic Conquest'' |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |access-date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> and [[Star Wars]]. Their music and lyrics have stylistic similarities to [[emo (music)|third-wave emo]] popular in the 2000s.  They are commonly coupled with other [[Christian punk]] artists from their genre such as [[Relient K]], [[Stellar Kart]], [[Hawk Nelson]], [[Philmont (band)|Philmont]], and [[Capital Lights]].

The band has sought to infuse the music with hope rather than maintain the themes of sadness and grief common to this music.<ref name=christianrock>[http://www.christianrock.net/artistinfo.asp Artist Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001218023100/http://www.christianrock.net/artistinfo.asp |date=December 18, 2000 }} at [[ChristianRock.Net]]. (Must search to access profile.) Accessed September 9, 2007.</ref> Lead singer Matt Langston has said, "You get tired of being yelled at, hearing the same parallels drawn in every song... Knives. Night. Pain. Winter. We have been put here to enjoy the blessings in life, not cry about the curse of our self-inflicted pain. We want to push people past their feelings, passions, and experiences...past their circumstances to see the big picture of God's creation. We want people to feel what He has done for us and wear a smile when they leave our concerts."<ref name=christianrock/>

Presently, the band no longer identifies itself as a Christian band and defines faith as a personal experience separate from a label placed on their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eleventylife.libsyn.com/episode-39 |title=Eleventylife Podcast Episode 3.9 | publisher=libsyn.com |date=October 13, 2017 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eleventylife.libsyn.com/episode-310 |title=Eleventylife Podcast Episode 3.10 | publisher=libsyn.com |date=October 20, 2017 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref>
