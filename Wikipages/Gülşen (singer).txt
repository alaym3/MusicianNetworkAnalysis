'''Gülşen Bayraktar Çolakoğlu''' ({{IPA-tr|ɟylˈʃen bajɾakˈtaɾ|pron}}; born 29 May 1976) is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Istanbul, she graduated from Şehremini High School. After finishing high school, Gülşen enrolled in [[Istanbul Technical University]] and at the same time began performing at bars and later left the university. In 1995, while performing at a bar, she was discovered by a composer and made a contract with Raks Müzik for making her first studio album.

Gülşen's debut album, ''[[Be Adam]]'', was released in 1996, which made her known in the music industry, but she preferred to take a break from her professional career and instead focused on her marital life. In 2004, her fourth studio album ''[[Of... Of...]]'' became a hit in Turkey and a single with the same name as the album earned her both a [[Golden Butterfly Award]] and a [[Turkey Music Awards|Turkey Music Award]]. The [[Mü-Yap]] certified album ''[[Yurtta Aşk Cihanda Aşk]]'' (2006) and her subsequent albums had successful sales, and ''[[Beni Durdursan mı?]]'' (2013) became Turkey's best-selling album of the year, followed by ''[[Bangır Bangır]]'' (2015), which became the second best-selling album of 2015. The singles "Yurtta Aşk Cihanda Aşk", "Bi' An Gel", "Yeni Biri", "Sözde Ayrılık", "Yatcaz Kalkcaz Ordayım", "Kardan Adam", "İltimas", "Bangır Bangır" and "Bir İhtimal Biliyorum" all became number-one hits on [[Türkçe Top 20]].

Gülşen, who has received positive reception from music critics and alongside her singing career is a prominent figure as a songwriter, started singing her own songs, especially after the early years of her career, and has produced many hit songs for her colleagues as well. In 2015, she became the Turkish singer with the most number of viewers on YouTube and a year later she became the first Turkish singer to have a music video watched over 200&nbsp;million times on the platform. Throughout her career, she has won numerous awards, including six Golden Butterfly Awards and nine Kral Turkey Music Awards.

==Life and career==
===1976–95: Early life and career beginnings===
Gülşen Bayraktar was born on 29 May 1976 in [[Fatih]], [[Istanbul]], to a family that originated from [[Ordu Province|Ordu]]. She is her parents' third and last child. Her father, Arslan Bayraktar, was a mechanical engineer, while her mother, Nimet Bayraktar, was a [[housewife]]. She spent her childhood and youth in Çapa and together with her family visited Ordu Province several times a year, where they owned nut gardens. A fan of Far East [[martial arts]], Gülşen began to learn [[karate]] in high school and later received her black belt. She was forced to use the martial art at the age 17 while she and her friend were [[harassment|harassed]] in the street and has said that similar occasions have happened several times in her daily life. After finishing her studies at Şehremini Anadolu High School, she began studying [[Turkish classical music]] at the [[Istanbul Technical University]]. Simultaneously, she began performing at night clubs and bars in Istanbul but as she couldn't handle both her studies and her job, she left the university after the first year.

Gülşen later stated that "[Following ''Be Adam''] I made another album so that I could enjoy it, I went out on the scene several times in my husband's places." She wrote the lyrics for the singles "Yiğidim", "Delisin" and "Gözü Karalım", and subsequently separate music videos were released for each of them.<ref name="hur1701"/>
