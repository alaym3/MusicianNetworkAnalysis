'''Groundbreaking''', also known as '''cutting''', '''sod-cutting''', '''turning the first sod''' or a '''sod-turning ceremony''', is a traditional [[ceremony]] in many cultures that celebrates the first day of [[construction]] for a [[building]] or other project. Such ceremonies are often attended by dignitaries such as [[politician]]s and [[business]]men.  The actual [[shovel]] used during the groundbreaking is often a special ceremonial shovel, sometimes colored gold, meant to be saved for subsequent display and may be [[engraved]]. In other groundbreaking ceremonies, a [[bulldozer]] is used instead of a shovel to mark the first day of construction. In some groundbreaking ceremonies, both the shovel and the bulldozer are used to mark the first day of construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/government/officials-tout-importance-of-public-safety-training-center-at-ground/article_43f2d680-0795-11e8-83e7-537caf3b3283.html|title=Officials break ground on Wiregrass Public Safety Center|first=Jeremy Wise|last=jwise@dothaneagle.com|access-date=2021-10-01|archive-date=2021-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731030624/https://dothaneagle.com/news/government/officials-tout-importance-of-public-safety-training-center-at-ground/article_43f2d680-0795-11e8-83e7-537caf3b3283.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hexus.net/business/news/components/114695-tsmc-started-construction-5nm-fab-18-taiwan/|title=TSMC has started construction of its 5nm ‘Fab 18’ in Taiwan|date=January 26, 2018|website=HEXUS|access-date=October 1, 2021|archive-date=July 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731030554/https://hexus.net/business/news/components/114695-tsmc-started-construction-5nm-fab-18-taiwan/|url-status=live}}</ref>
