Fuzati continued with releasing Klub des Loosers materials and organized formation of a rap collective under the emblem '''Le Klub de 7''' with invitation to known rappers and hip hop artists from various groups. The "seven" were: James Delleck and Le Jouage (from Gravité Zéro project), Gérard Baste (of Svinkels), Cyanure and Fredy K (of the collective ATK) and Detect (his partner in Klub des Loosers).

Many had already participated in a successful joint release in 2003 titled ''Baise Les Gens'' that had been credited to Fuzati, Teki Latex, James Delleck, Cyanure, Tacteel and Para One on cover. In 2007, as the collective formalized as ''Le Klub des 7'', they released the albums  ''Le Klub des 7'' as a self-titled album soon after which, Fredy K (part of the "seven") died in a motorcycle accident on 7 November 2007. The collective had one follow-up album ''La Classe de Musique'' in 2009 before parting ways.
