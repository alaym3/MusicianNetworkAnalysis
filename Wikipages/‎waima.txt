'''Waima''' is an [[Auckland]] [[suburb]].

It is under the local governance of the [[Auckland Council]].

The majority of the modest population is clustered around the comparatively prominent Waima [[superette]], situated just off the main arterial road Woodlands Park Road, on such streets as Waima Crescent, Hollywood Avenue, Boylan Road and Rimutaka Place. The central "hub" could be considered Waima reserve, which consists of various public amenities such as a playground, basketball court, toilets and a sport field.

To the North West, Waima is bordered by popular walking track and Lower Nihotipu Reservoir pipeline route "Exhibition Drive". Two water treatment stations and holding tanks service Auckland city's water supply from locations on Woodlands Park Road. Waima extends East to Tainui Road and the Auckland Centennial Memorial Park and the cul de sac of Rimutaka place represents Waima's Southernmost point.
