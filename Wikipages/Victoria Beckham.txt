Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' in February 2014, Alexander Fury described how Victoria Beckham had made the transition from novelty to respected designer, citing her recent guest editorship of French ''[[Vogue Paris|Vogue]]'' and forthcoming participation in a panel discussion with the dean of [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons]] design school in New York.

=== Business difficulties ===

Despite her high social profile, her fashion brand has not been a business success. In November 2019, the BBC reported that "Victoria Beckham's fashion business has posted another annual loss as demand for the former Spice Girl's high end clothes "plateaued". Victoria Beckham Limited, which has not made a profit since it launched in 2008, reported a loss of £12.3m for 2018. Sales slipped 16% to £35m, amid weaker wholesale demand. Chairman Ralph Toledano said sales of clothing and accessories had levelled off after years of growth. "The performance was in line with expectations, so we were not surprised. Our goal is to reach profitability as soon as possible," he told trade journal Business of Fashion. Mrs Beckham launched her label in 2008 with a collection of luxury dresses, and now sells fashion and accessories in more than 400 stores around the world."

==Alleged kidnap and death threats==
In January 2000, a tip-off to [[Scotland Yard]] detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in [[Hampstead]], London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made.<ref name="kidnap">{{Cite news|last1=Foggo|first1=Daniel|last2=Bamber|first2=David|last3=Lusher|first3=Adam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUX1DTWPDWJEZQFIQMGSFFWAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2002/11/03/nbeck03.xml|title=Five are held in Beckham kidnap plot|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2002|archive-date=9 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309064309/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUX1DTWPDWJEZQFIQMGSFFWAVCBQWIV0?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F11%2F03%2Fnbeck03.xml|location=London|url-status=dead}}</ref> In March of that year, she received a death threat prior to performing at the [[Brit Awards]] with the Spice Girls, and at the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience.<ref name="kidnap"/> In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/19/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing |title=PCC clears NoW over Beckham kidnap case |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 September 2003|access-date=11 January 2008 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Cozens}}</ref> All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.<ref name="collapses">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2956224.stm |title=Beckham 'kidnap' case collapses |work=BBC News |date= 2 June 2003|access-date=11 January 2008}}</ref>
