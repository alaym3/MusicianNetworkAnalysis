==Biography==
She currently resides in New York City. She dreamed of being a [[jazz]] singer while growing up in [[Kyoto]], and participated in all sorts of music-related activities. At age 18, she left for the US alone. While in New York, she was very taken with the "New York sound," including [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], and [[house music|house]]. Around 2001, Juju began to be featured in a number of works by other artists. In 2002, she provided music for the film ''Kyōki no Sakura''. In 2004, she debuted with her first single "Hikaru no Naka e". The same year, concurrent with her musical activities in New York, she started performing live in Japan. When her third single, "Kiseki o Nozomu nara", was released, it topped the [[USEN]] charts and remained on the chart for a record length of 22 weeks. At this point, while she received support from a small group of listeners, she remained mostly unknown. On August 23, 2008, with the release of "Kimi no Subete ni", a [[collaboration]] between [[Spontania]] and Juju, she broke out onto the Japanese [[popular music]] scene, with the single receiving over 2.5&nbsp;million [[music download|downloads]]. Again, on November 26, 2008, another collaboration with Spontania named "Sunao ni Naretara" earned her even more fame, with the song receiving 2.2&nbsp;million downloads.<ref>"{{cite web|url=http://music.goo.ne.jp/artist/ARTLISD1170753/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826020756/http://music.goo.ne.jp/artist/ARTLISD1170753/index.html |archive-date=26 August 2009 }}."
