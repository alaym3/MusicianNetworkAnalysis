== Life and career ==
Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds was born on April 5, 1995, in the [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and raised in [[Oshawa]]. He is the second eldest of four children to his mother Hollace and father Norwill Simmonds, a pastor and gospel singer who released his first album as a high school student in [[Jamaica]]. Caesar attended the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and private school in Oshawa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilymag.com/2018/01/16/daniel-caesars-mother-hollace-simmonds-on-love-interview/|title=Daniel Caesar's Mother, Hollace Simmonds, On Love (Interview)|date=January 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torontolife.com/culture/music/ten-things-need-know-daniel-caesar-toronto-rb-singer-got-shout-barack-obama/|title=Ten things you need to know about Daniel Caesar, the Toronto R&B singer who got a shout-out from Barack Obama|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> He is of Bajan and Jamaican descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2016/05/02/torontos-caesar-has-eye-on-the-throne.html|title=Toronto's Caesar has eye on the throne|date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>

Caesar grew up in church, singing before his father's congregation in Oshawa.<ref name="Green" /> He was raised listening to [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] delivered through [[musicality]] and religion, even though his parents were cautious of temptations that came with music.<ref name="Green" /> Caesar longed for the city, which was an hour’s drive from his home.<ref name="Green" /> At the age of 17, Caesar was kicked out of the house after a fight with his father on the weekend of his high school graduation. He felt no choice but to pursue his calling as a musician.<ref name="Green" /> After leaving his home, he began doing [[gig (music)|gigs]]. The turning point of Caesar's career came in 2015, with the release of his second EP, ''Pilgrim's Paradise''.<ref name="Green" />

In 2014, Caesar received widespread critical acclaim for his debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Praise Break'', which was ranked No. 19 on the "20 Best R&B Albums of 2014" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. His music is influenced by religion, which played a large role in his upbringing, as well as [[unrequited love]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=20 Best R&B Albums of 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-best-r-b-albums-of-2014-20141215/sharon-jones-the-dap-kings-give-the-people-what-they-want-20141211|magazine=[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]|access-date=May 21, 2017|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>

On August 25, 2017, Caesar released his debut album ''[[Freudian (album)|Freudian]]'', which includes the singles "Get You", "We Find Love", and "Blessed". The album was a shortlisted finalist for the [[2018 Polaris Music Prize]].<ref name=shortlist>[https://exclaim.ca/music/article/polaris_music_prize_reveals_2018_short_list "Polaris Music Prize Reveals 2018 Short List"].

== Artistry ==
Caesar's music is influenced by [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. His music draws from his childhood experiences and integrates them with [[R&B]] and [[Electronic music|electronics]], while his lyrics explore subjects of religion, philosophy and [[unrequited love]]. In his music, he often references concepts of philosophy. His singing voice reshapes itself on each track, often veering into a hushed, introspective [[lilting]] style.<ref name="Green" /> According to Caesar, "In my religious surroundings growing up, the point is to be still, to direct as little attention to yourself as possible and instead, direct all attention to what you’re saying. Now, it’s kind of the opposite."<ref name="Green" /> Caesar cites [[Frank Ocean]], [[Kanye West]], [[Beyoncé]], and [[The Doors]] frontman [[Jim Morrison]] as musical and stylistic inspirations.<ref name="Green">{{cite web|author=Green, Alex|title=Get to know Daniel Caesar, the Artist Baring His Soul on Gospel-tinged R'n'B|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/get-to-know-daniel-caesar-the-toronto-born-artist-baring-his-soul-on-gospel-tinged-rnb|work=[[Mixmag]] |date=October 6, 2017}}</ref>

Caesar works in close collaboration with producers [[Matthew Burnett]] and [[Jordan Evans (producer)|Jordan Evans]], with whom he co-founded his independent label, Golden Child Recordings, and has co-produced almost all of his music with since 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ritchie|first=Kevin|date=August 16, 2017|title=Independent soul: Daniel Caesar is staying DIY... with a little help from his friends|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/features/daniel-caesar-independent-soul|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=NOW Magazine}}</ref> Caesar is also part of an informal collaborative of Toronto-based musicians and songwriters that includes [[River Tiber (musician)|River Tiber]], [[BadBadNotGood]], and [[Charlotte Day Wilson]], among others.
