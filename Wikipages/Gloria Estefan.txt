'''Gloria Estefan''' ({{IPA-es|ˈɡloɾja esˈtefan|lang}}; born '''Gloria María Milagrosa Fajardo García'''; 1 September 1957) is a Cuban singer, actress and businesswoman. A [[contralto]], she started her career as the lead singer in the group Miami Latin Boys, which later became known as [[Miami Sound Machine]]. She earned worldwide success with "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" in 1985, which became Estefan's [[signature song]] and led to Miami Sound Machine winning the grand prix in the 15th annual [[Tokyo Music Festival]] in 1986. In 1988, she and the band got their first number-one hit with the song "[[Anything for You (Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine song)|Anything for You]]". She is considered the Latin artist who broke down the barriers of Latin music in the international market and opened the doors to several latin artists such as [[Shakira]], [[Jennifer Lopez|Jlo]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Selena]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Una mujer que abrió puertas a los latinos|url=https://www.nacion.com/viva/musica/una-mujer-que-abrio-puertas-a-los-latinos/CELGHRP4SRFRJDMHDIYM2CQA5U/story/www.lateja.cr|access-date=30 July 2021|website=La Nación|language=es}}</ref>

Estefan became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1974, under the name Gloria Garcia Fajardo, reflecting the switch from the Spanish naming custom of father's surname then mother's surname, to mother's maiden name as middle name and father's surname last.

=== Sexual abuse as a child ===
Estefan revealed on 30 September 2021, during an episode of the Facebook Watch show, "Red Table Talk: The Estefans", that the music teacher hired to teach her guitar lessons sexually abused her at the age of nine.<ref>{{Cite web|date=30 September 2021|title=Singer Gloria Estefan Reveals She was Sexually Abused at Age Nine – September 30, 2021|url=https://dailynewsbrief.com/2021/09/30/singer-gloria-estefan-reveals-she-was-sexually-abused-at-age-nine/|access-date=1 October 2021|website=The Daily News Brief|language=en-US}}</ref> It was revealed that this man, "a highly respected member of the community" told her that he would kill her mother if she told anyone about the abuse. Eventually, Estefan could no longer keep her silence and revealed everything to her mother who promptly advised the police. The police in turn told Estefan's mother that she should not press charges because of the further, additional traumatisation that Gloria would undergo as a result of testifying against the perpetrator.

=== Education ===
Estefan was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and attended St. Michael-Archangel School and [[Our Lady of Lourdes Academy]] in Miami, where she was a member of the [[National Honor Society]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan Build a Music Empire and a Family Compound|date=1 December 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=9 October 2018|issn=0099-9660|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009211514/https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|archive-date=9 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She graduated from college in 1979 with a B.A. in psychology, with a minor in French, from the [[University of Miami]].

Emilio, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band's name changing to Miami Sound Machine. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.<ref name=":0" />

Beginning in 1977, [[Miami Sound Machine]] began recording and releasing various albums and 45s on the Audiofon Records label in Miami. The first album from 1977 was entitled ''Live Again/Renacer'' and was released with two different covers. After several more releases on the Audiofon label as well as the RCA Victor label and Miami Sound Machine's own label MSM Records, the band was signed to Discos CBS International and released several albums, 45s, and 12"s beginning with the 1978 self-titled album ''Miami Sound Machine''. Growing in popularity in both the U.S. and around the world, the group would continue recording and issuing various works for Discos CBS International through 1985.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ramentertainment.com/gloria-estefan|title=Gloria Estefan|work=RAM Entertainment|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013759/https://ramentertainment.com/gloria-estefan|archive-date=11 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also in 1978 that Gloria married Emilio Estefan, Jr. after two years of dating.

In 1984, Miami Sound Machine released their first Epic/Columbia album, ''[[Eyes of Innocence (Miami Sound Machine album)|Eyes of Innocence]]'', which contained the dance hit "[[Dr. Beat]]" as well as the ballad "[[I Need Your Love (Miami Sound Machine song)|I Need Your Love]]".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qE-LBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA252|title=Latin Music: Musicians, Genres, and Themes [2 volumes]|last=Stavans|first=Ilan|date=29 July 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34396-4}}</ref> Their more successful follow-up album ''[[Primitive Love]]'' was released in 1985 launching three Top 10 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" (U.S. No. 10), "[[Words Get in the Way]]" (U.S. No. 5), and "[[Bad Boy (Miami Sound Machine song)|Bad Boy]]" (U.S. No. 8), as well as "[[Falling in Love (Uh-Oh)]]" (U.S. No. 25) which became follow up hits in the U.S. and around the world. "[[Words Get in the Way]]" reached No. 1 on the US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. The song "Hot Summer Nights" was also released that year and was part of the film ''[[Top Gun]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=26 September 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}</ref>

Their next album, 1987's ''[[Let It Loose (album)|Let It Loose]]'', went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone.

In May 2020 Gloria wrote and released "We Needed Time" as a musical piece to reflect the feelings and emotions the world was experiencing around the COVID-19 global pandemic. The genesis of the song came from a late night conversation Gloria had with her son Nayib who exclaimed to Gloria that although he wouldn't have asked for a pandemic, it had gifted him with precious time to spend with his wife and son. Taking this idea, Gloria penned the lyrics and composed the melody. The video for the song was shot in and around Gloria's property on Star Island, Miami by socially distanced cinematographers using drone cameras to capture the beautiful tranquility that the pandemic had created. The song was made available to download for free from Gloria's official website and on some streaming platforms.

=== Film and television appearances ===
Estefan has appeared in two live-action films, ''[[Music of the Heart]]'' (1999) and ''[[For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story]]'' (2000). Estefan made a cameo appearance with her husband in ''[[Marley & Me (film)|Marley & Me]]'' (2008).

Estefan was cast to star as [[Connie Francis]], a U.S. pop singer of the 1950s and early 1960s, in the biographical film ''Who's Sorry Now?'' According to ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine (23 March 2008), filming supposedly began in late 2008. In an interview with www.allheadlinenews.com, Estefan stated that the film would be released in 2009. However, as of December 2009, the film was dropped as Connie Francis had [[irreconcilable differences]] with Estefan over the film's writer. Francis wanted to hire writer [[Robert L. Freedman]], who had written the [[Emmy Award]] winning mini-series ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]''. Estefan, according to Francis, refused to consider him and the project collaboration thus ended.<ref>Ybarra, David (December 2009).
