'''Egypt Central''' is an American  [[alternative metal]]  band from Memphis, Tennessee.

==Band History==

===Formation and debut album (2002–2010)===
Egypt Central was formed on October 2, 2002. Based in Memphis and named after one of its roads. They wrote and recorded for one year until generating a buzz in their hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} After eight shows, they caught the attention of former [[Lava Records]] [[CEO]] [[Jason Flom]]. Flom offered the band a [[recording contract|record deal]] after seeing their live performances. Egypt Central's [[Egypt Central (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded with producer [[Josh Abraham]] in [[Los Angeles]]. It experienced many delays, eventually being released by Fat Lady Music on January 15, 2008. Two [[Single (music)|singles]] were released to promote the album: "You Make Me Sick" and "Taking You Down". These two tracks also ended up being on the soundtrack of the video game ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009]]''. They have performed with bands like [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Seether]], [[Sevendust]], [[Hurt (band)|Hurt]], [[Red (band)|Red]], [[In This Moment]], and many others.

There is rumored to be an entire second album which never got released due to legal issues with their record label. Two songs meant for this album, "Hate" and "California Dreams" (later reworked as "Citizen Radio" and released on the ''Murder in the French Quarter: Rare & Unreleased EP''), were performed live while on tour in 2008.

===''White Rabbit'' (2010–2011)===
Egypt Central completed work on their second studio album, entitled ''[[White Rabbit (Egypt Central album)|White Rabbit]]'', in December 2010 with producer [[Skidd Mills]] and released it on May 31, 2011. The album received many positive reviews from many sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=40-ALBUM-UPDATE|title=Egypt Central|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009130536/http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=40-ALBUM-UPDATE|archive-date=2011-10-09|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=58-ALBUM-RELEASE-DATE|title=Egypt Central|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009130634/http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=58-ALBUM-RELEASE-DATE|archive-date=2011-10-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The album's title track was released as the first single on March 1, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=43-White-Rabbit-Single|title=Egypt Central|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009130645/http://www.egyptcentral.net/?page=news&news=43-White-Rabbit-Single|archive-date=2011-10-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The band toured from March–May on the Tour of the American Dream tour with [[Cold (band)|Cold]] and [[Kopek (band)|Kopek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2011/02/08/news/cold-to-tour-with-egypt-central-and-kopek-next-month/|title=Cold To Tour With Egypt Central And Kopek Next Month – Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More|work=Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More|date=8 February 2011|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027183824/http://www.theprp.com/2011/02/08/news/cold-to-tour-with-egypt-central-and-kopek-next-month/|archive-date=2011-10-27|url-status=live}}</ref> The band toured on their Down the Hole headlining tour with Abused Romance and Candlelight Red in June and with [[Burn Halo]] and [[Red Line Chemistry]] in July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockaccess.net/2011/05/17/egypt-central-announce-dates-with-abused-romance/|title=Rock Access – Rock News » Egypt Central Announce Dates With Abused Romance|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201023/http://rockaccess.net/2011/05/17/egypt-central-announce-dates-with-abused-romance/|archive-date=27 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to several festival appearances, the band toured briefly with [[Hinder]], [[Saving Abel]], and [[Adelitas Way]] in August.
