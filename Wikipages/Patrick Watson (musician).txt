After creating music and releasing albums in various styles, Watson formed a group with guitarist Simon Angell, percussionist Robbie Kuster, and bassist Mishka Stein. The band has performed with artists like [[James Brown]], [[The Dears]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[The Stills]].

In an interview, Watson said regarding his band:
{{blockquote|So we as a band are called Patrick Watson. How it started was that originally, some years ago, we were asked to do some music to accompany a book of photography. Having built a CD to go with all these images we thought it would be fun to do it live and it worked really well and people freaked. We didn't really think we were gonna be a band at that point but over a period of five or six years we got to a point where it became very difficult to change the name. It was difficult to find a name that suited us especially as we had such an eclectic music style. The second album was a kind of middle point, and now here we are at this third album which is much more song orientated.<ref>http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/patrick-watson_0807.htm</ref>}}

The band received a nomination for [[Juno Award for New Artist of the Year|New Artist of the Year]] at the [[Juno Awards of 2007|2007 Juno Awards]].<ref name="junos">{{cite web |title=Artist summary: Patrick Watson |url=http://junoawards.ca/awards/artist-summary/?artist_name=patrick+watson&submit=Search |work=JunoAwards.ca |publisher=[[Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=April 17, 2012 }}</ref> In the same year, Watson and [[Caroline Dhavernas]] received a [[Genie Award]] nomination for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[27th Genie Awards]] in 2007, for the song "Trace-moi" from the film ''[[The Beautiful Beast]] (La Belle bête)''.<ref>[https://www.screendaily.com/the-rocket-bon-cop-lead-canadas-genie-nominations/4030142.article "The Rocket, Bon Cop lead Canada's Genie nominations"].

The band is well known for using unusual objects to make sounds in their music; for example, Watson "played" a bicycle in the studio for the song "Beijing".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-219107/watson-keeps-dreams-alive|title=Patrick Watson keeps dreams alive|date=6 May 2009}}</ref> and percussionist Robbie Kuster used two spoons to create a tremolo picking effect on an acoustic guitar in the opening of "Man Like You".

The album marks a subtle shift in the band's style to a simpler and less experimental sound, described by one critic as "a dreamy bath of chamber-pop and fancy cabaret, less clacky without the kitchen-utensil or bike-wheel percussion of ''[[Wooden Arms]]'' and slightly more grounded than ''[[Close to Paradise]]''".<ref name="globe-review">{{cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Brad |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/disc-of-the-week-patrick-watson/article2401293/ |title=Disc of the week: Patrick Watson |date=April 13, 2012 |access-date=April 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] }}</ref> Prior to the album's release, the band performed at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]],<ref>{{cite web |title=SX Schedule: Patrick Watson |url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_MS17327 |year=2012 |publisher=[[South by Southwest|SXSW]] |access-date=April 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310023232/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_MS17327 |archive-date=March 10, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> where they were named by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine as one of the 25 "can't-miss acts" of the festival.<ref>{{cite web |title=SXSW 2012: 25 Can't-Miss Acts |last=Eisen |first=Benjy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sxsw-2012-25-cant-miss-acts-20120308 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 8, 2012 |access-date=April 12, 2012 }}</ref> The band toured in support of the new album from April to July 2012.
