== Career ==
[[File:Coulton at Dragon*Con.jpg|thumb|Coulton, [[Paul and Storm]], and [[Molly Lewis]] performing at [[Dragon*Con]] 2011]]
Coulton's music tends to fit a [[folk rock]] style, with elements of pop and [[indie rock]].

===Early career and geek culture (1990s-2005)===
Coulton graduated in 1993 from [[Yale]], where he was a member of [[The Spizzwinks]] and the [[Whiffenpoofs|Yale Whiffenpoofs]].<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/fashion/23acappella.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=fashion | title = Perfect Tone, in a Minor Key | date = March 23, 2008 | work = New York Times | access-date = March 23, 2008 | first=Mickey | last=Rapkin }}</ref> In the 1990s, Coulton was in a short-lived band, named SuperGroup, with television producer Eric Salat and best-selling author [[Darin Strauss]].<ref name="Supergroup">{{cite web | url = https://wiki.jonathancoulton.com/Supergroup | title = Supergroup}}</ref> A former [[computer programming|computer programmer]] employed at Cluen, a New York City software company,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/Jonathan_Coulton#cite_note-1 |title=JoCopedia, the Jonathan Coulton wiki |publisher=Jonathan Coulton |access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref> and self-described geek, Coulton tended to write quirky, witty lyrics about science fiction and technology: a man who thinks in simian terms ("Code Monkey"), a mad scientist who falls in love with one of his captives ("Skullcrusher Mountain"), and the dangers of bacteria. Most of Coulton's recordings feature his singing over guitar, bass, and drums; some also feature the various other instruments Coulton plays, including [[accordion]], harmonica, [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[ukulele]], [[zendrum]] and [[glockenspiel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3964-best-interview-ever-talking-with-jonathan-coulton.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923154345/http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3964-best-interview-ever-talking-with-jonathan-coulton.html|url-status=dead|title=Best interview ever – Talking with Jonathan Coulton|archive-date=September 23, 2009|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

Coulton's debut album, ''Smoking Monkey'', was released in November 2003.

Several early podcasters discovered and made regular use of Coulton's music, notably [[Adam Curry]] of the ''[[Daily Source Code]]'' and ''The Wizards of Technology''.<ref name="How I Did It">{{cite web | url = http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2007/05/18/how-i-did-it/ | title = How I Did It }}</ref> In April 2006, he lent his voice to one such podcast, ''The Spoilers'', in which he and hosts Rick Yaeger and Bill Douthett provided a 2-hour fan commentary for ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref name="Spoilers Podcast">{{cite web | url = http://www.zarban.com/?p=293 | title = The Spoilers Podcast | access-date = June 27, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130124020103/http://www.zarban.com/?p=293 | archive-date = January 24, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name="I Ruined Raiders">{{cite web | url = http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/04/30/i-ruined-raiders/ | title = I Ruined Raiders }}</ref>

He was the Contributing Troubadour at ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, whose September 2005 issue was accompanied by a five-song set by Coulton called ''Our Bodies, Ourselves, Our Cybernetic Arms''.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-08/future-body-soundtrack "The Future of The Body: The Soundtrack"] (accessed on June 23, 2008), ''Popular Science''</ref> He was also the Musical Director for ''The Little Gray Book Lectures''.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6603466 "Witty Tunes Are Jonathan Coulton's <nowiki>'Thing'</nowiki>"] (accessed ) on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''</ref>

=== ''Thing a Week'' albums (2005-2006) ===
From September 16, 2005, to September 30, 2006, Coulton ran "Thing a Week", during which he recorded 52 musical pieces, one per week, in an effort to push his creative envelope via a "forced-march approach to writing and recording"; to prove to himself that he could produce creative output to a deadline; and to see whether a professional artist could use the Internet and distribution via [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] to support himself. Rare topical songs include 2005's "W's Duty", which samples President [[George W. Bush]], and 2006's "Tom Cruise Crazy." In a September 2006 interview, he said of the experiment, "In some parts of the country, I'd be making a decent living".<ref name="QuickStop">{{cite web | url = http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1757 | title = Quick Stop Interview: Jonathan Coulton | date = September 28, 2006 | publisher = View Askew Productions | access-date = February 19, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070430165709/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1757 | archive-date = April 30, 2007 }}</ref> In a February 25, 2008, interview with [[This Week in Tech]], he said that he made more money in 2007 than he did in his last year of working as a programmer, 40% of it from digital downloads and 40% from merchandise and performances.<ref name="TWiT">{{cite web | url = http://twit.tv/133 | title = TWiT 133: Jonathan Coulton&nbsp;— Functional And Elegant | format = MP3 | date = February 25, 2008 | publisher = TWiT.tv | access-date = June 8, 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513040748/http://twit.tv/133 | archive-date = May 13, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2006, Coulton began touring with comedy duo [[Paul and Storm]]. Coulton initially opened the concerts, but as his popularity grew, he began headlining.

==="Still Alive" and album hiatus (2007-2008)===
Coulton wrote and performed a song titled "[[Still Alive (song)|Still Alive]]" for the ending credits of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s 2007 video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', with vocals by [[Ellen McLain]]. On April 1, 2008, Harmonix made this track available as free downloadable content for the game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Kohler|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/rock-band-get-1.html |title=Rock Band Gets 'Still Alive' Tomorrow, Free|publisher=Blog.wired.com |date= March 31, 2008|access-date=May 31, 2010}}</ref> A version with Coulton's vocals was also included on the ''[[Orange Box#Soundtrack|Orange Box Original Soundtrack]]'',<ref name="Valve Store">{{cite web|author=Valve |url=http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_TOBSoundtrack.html |title=Orange Box Original Soundtrack |publisher=Store.valvesoftware.com |access-date=May 31, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313192458/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_TOBSoundtrack.html |archive-date = March 13, 2008}}</ref> in addition to the one heard at the end of the game. "Re: Your Brains" made an appearance as an easter egg in ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rns71ot8GVg | title = LFD2 Easter Egg | date = October 17, 2009 | access-date = May 22, 2011 }}</ref> "Still Alive" has been called "the most influential game music".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/20/influential-game-music/ | title = Most Influential Game Music | date = February 20, 2011 | access-date = February 21, 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110223013014/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/20/influential-game-music/ | archive-date = February 23, 2011 }}</ref> In 2011, Coulton followed up the success of "Still Alive" with a new song at the end of ''[[Portal 2]]'', "Want You Gone". He also wrote the ''Portal''-themed song "You Wouldn't Know" for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.

Coulton is also known for original pieces such as "[[Code Monkey (song)|Code Monkey]]", which was featured on [[Slashdot]]<ref name="Slashdot">{{cite web | url = http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/23/159227 | title = Code Monkey Like Fritos | date = April 23, 2006 | publisher = slashdot.com | access-date = October 22, 2007 }}</ref> on April 23, 2006, and linked from the webcomic ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]''.<ref name="PennyArcade">{{cite web | url = https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2006/09/04/prinny-please | title = Prinny Please

His work has been featured on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''. ''[[Good Morning Silicon Valley]]'' featured a link to a video set to his song "Re: Your Brains".

Coulton accompanied [[John Hodgman]] on his "700 Hobo Names" promotional track for Hodgman's book ''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'' as the guitarist (he was credited as "Jonathan William Coulton, the Colchester Kid"). Coulton also can be heard throughout the audiobook version of the same book, playing the theme song to the book, playing [[incidental music]], and bantering with Hodgman, who reads the audio version of his work. Hodgman has also mentioned Coulton on ''[[The Daily Show]]'': a Jonathan Coulton of [[Colchester, Connecticut]], was Hodgman's pick to win an essay contest on overpowering Iraqi resistance to American invasion.<ref name="ComedyCentral">{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115091&title=essay-contest | title = Essay Contest |work=Daily Show: Hodgman | publisher = Comedy Central | access-date = February 27, 2008 }}</ref> Coulton wrote and performed "the winning entry", a song about dropping snakes from airplanes. Coulton appeared on the tour for Hodgman's second book, ''[[More Information Than You Require]]''.

Coulton composed the title music for the show ''[[Mystery Diagnosis]]'', and also has contributed other songs under "The Little Gray Book Lectures", a series of audio releases from John Hodgman.

===''The Aftermath'' and ''Artificial Heart'' (2009-2012)===
Coulton had been working on his follow-up to the ''Thing a Week'' albums, tentatively titled ''The Aftermath''. He said the title was an umbrella term for unreleased tracks recorded after ''Thing a Week''. "The Aftermath" was then released in 2009.

A DVD & CD of a concert performed February 22, 2008, at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco, entitled ''[[Best. Concert. Ever.]]'' was released in 2009. At the concert, Coulton played "Still Alive" along with guest "musicians" and geek/celebrities [[Leo Laporte]], [[Merlin Mann]] and [[Veronica Belmont]].<ref name="2/22/08 Concert info">{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/index.php/San_Francisco%2C_CA:_2008-02-22 |title=2/22/08 Concert info |publisher=Jonathancoulton.com |access-date=May 31, 2010}}</ref> Coulton also opened for [[They Might Be Giants]] for a few shows of their March 2010 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theymightbegiants.com/news/jonathan-coulton-to-open-shows-for-tmbg/ |title=Jonathan Coulton to open shows for TMBG! |publisher=They Might Be Giants |access-date=September 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211125334/http://www.theymightbegiants.com/news/jonathan-coulton-to-open-shows-for-tmbg/ |archive-date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref> He toured with them again in February 2012.

As a result, a number of [[music videos]] have been created using his songs, including such [[machinima]] as the [[ILL Clan]]'s video for "Code Monkey" and a [[kinetic typography]] video for the song "Shop Vac".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceparanoids.net/2010/12/shopvac/ |title=Shop Vac (kinetic typography animation) |publisher=Jarrett Heather |date=December 1, 2010 |access-date=January 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdFbG7CH?url=http://spaceparanoids.net/2010/12/shopvac/ |archive-date=September 12, 2012 }}</ref>

In May 2011, Coulton was interviewed on [[NPR]]'s popular economics-related program ''[[Planet Money]]''. He disclosed that he makes about $500,000 a year from his music despite lacking a record label contract. He expressed gratitude towards his fans for his surprise success, the degree of which he called "absurd". In a broader discussion of whether or not the internet is good for musicians, Coulton answered in the affirmative, while journalist Frannie Kelley described his success as a "fluke," comparing it to the unexpected popularity of the [[Snuggie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/05/14/136279162/an-internet-rock-star-tells-all|title=An Internet Rock Star Tells All : Planet Money|date=May 13, 2011|publisher=NPR|access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref> Coulton posted a [[tongue-in-cheek]] response on his blog about the comparison, saying "to which I say: snarkity snark snark!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2011/05/23/on-snuggies-and-business-models/|title=Jonathan Coulton|date=May 23, 2011|publisher=Jonathan Coulton|access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref>

===''Glee'' dispute===
One of Coulton's best-known works is his 2005 light-acoustic [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] hit song "[[Baby Got Back]]". Coulton wrote a new melody for his cover version of the song. Coulton's altered cover version was itself covered, but without permission (including his original line "Johnny C's in trouble"), by the American TV series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2013/01/18/baby-got-back-and-glee/|title=Baby Got Back and Glee – Jonathan Coulton|website=www.jonathancoulton.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/jonathan-coulton-glee-song/|title=Jonathan Coulton Explains How Glee Ripped Off His Cover Song – And Why He's Not Alone|last=Hudson|first=Laura|date=January 25, 2013|work=Wired}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/26/showbiz/glee-coulton-song-copyright/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Singer alleges 'Glee' ripped off his cover song - CNN.com|date=January 26, 2013|work=CNN}}</ref> Like Coulton's other work, he released his cover version of the song under a [[Creative Commons 3.0 Share Alike license|Creative Commons 3.0]] license, which requires users to attribute the work to him, and forbids all commercial use of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Studies/Jonathan_Coulton|title=Case Studies/Jonathan Coulton – Creative Commons|website=wiki.creativecommons.org|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> The show's lawyers contended that they were within their legal rights, and that Coulton should be happy for the exposure,{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} though Coulton received no acknowledgement or credit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2013/01/18/169706944/ive-heard-that-somewhere-glee-covers-baby-got-back-and-it-sounds-familiar|title=I've Heard That Somewhere: 'Glee' Covers 'Baby Got Back,' And It Sounds ...

Instead, Coulton released the single "Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)", a "cover of Glee's cover of my cover of Sir Mix-a-Lot's song, which is to say it's EXACTLY THE SAME as my original version." Coulton said he would donate the proceeds from all sales until the end of February 2013 to two ''Glee''-related charities: The VH1 [[Save the Music Foundation]], and The [[It Gets Better Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2013/01/26/baby-got-back-glee-style/|title=Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee) – Jonathan Coulton|website=www.jonathancoulton.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref>
