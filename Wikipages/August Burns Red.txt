For example, their track "Spirit Breaker" features Luhrs reading a letter. However, since ''Phantom Anthem'', Luhrs has used clean vocals in some songs, most notably "Coordinates" and "Lighthouse", the latter from their recent album ''Guardians'' featuring a clean-singing chorus. Clean vocals first made an appearance in the band's music in the form of a guest appearance by [[A Day to Remember]]'s [[Jeremy McKinnon]] on "Ghosts", the fifth track from their 2015 album ''Found in Far Away Places''.

While the group has stated that they don't mind being classified as metalcore, Brubaker has grown a distaste for many of the genre's bands: "I feel like anyone who can pick up and play a guitar and learn to play a metalcore riff and any drummer who can learn to play a thrash beat over a breakdown is doing it. It's almost become very formulaic, and metal to me was never a formulaic genre."<ref name="ABR Revolver interview"/> Musically, the group has incorporated instrumentals such as the cello and the violin while also featuring song elements such as [[classical music]] inspired interludes, pushing the boundaries of what is considered 'metalcore'.<ref name=altpress/> Many of their songs do not contain choruses, unlike other bands in the metalcore scene.<ref name="The New Fury">{{cite web|title=August Burns Red on New Album, New Label and Getting Older|url=http://thenewfury.com/wordpress/august-burns-red-on-new-album-new-label-and-getting-older/|work=thenewfury.com|publisher=The New Fury|access-date=July 17, 2017}}</ref>

=== Band name ===
August Burns Red members have been asked about the origin of their band name on many occasions and have given numerous different stories.<ref name="allmusic"/> The most popular story behind the name is an incident involving Jon Hershey, the band's original vocalist, when he dated a woman named August who burned his dog Redd alive in his dog house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2007/05/15/august-burns-red-interview-may-9th-2007/ |title=August Burns Red Interview - May 9th, 2007 |publisher=Driven Far Off |date=May 15, 2007 |access-date=April 21, 2012}}</ref>

However, it was later revealed in a radio interview that this meaning (along with others) was simply a comical story created by the members and that there is no actual meaning behind the band name. Drummer Matt Greiner stated in the interview that "we just came up with the name to come up with a name."<ref>{{cite web|last=McEnroe|first=Colin|title=Colin McEnroe Show: The Hardcore Side Of Christian Rock|url=http://www.yourpublicmedia.org/content/wnpr/colin-mcenroe-show-hardcore-side-christian-rock|work=yourpublicmedia.org|publisher=[[Colin McEnroe|Colin McEnroe Show]]|access-date=February 1, 2012|archive-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020174745/http://www.yourpublicmedia.org/content/wnpr/colin-mcenroe-show-hardcore-side-christian-rock|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Christianity===
For a significant part of the band's history, August Burns Red has widely been considered a Christian band.<ref name="cm bio"/> JB Brubaker mentioned in an interview with [[online magazine]] ''Shout!'', that "Christianity is a religion, not a style of music" and he would "rather just let the music speak for itself.", and that he would rather let Christianity shine through the band's lyrics.<ref name="shout">{{cite web|url=http://www.a-pathetic.net/zine/archives/506 |title=Interview @ SHOUT! Music Webzine |publisher=A-pathetic.net |date=January 27, 2012 |access-date=April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216065533/http://www.a-pathetic.net/zine/archives/506 |archive-date=December 16, 2010 }}</ref> Brent Rambler commented on the fact that "It is important to us that people know that we are indeed Christians... without having us stand up there and ram it down people's throats."<ref name="jesusfreak">{{cite web |url = http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/CDreviews/ThrillSeeker.asp |title = August Burns Red, "Thrill Seeker" Review |publisher = JesusFreakHideout.com |date = August 29, 2005 |access-date =June 13, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704130457/http://jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/ThrillSeeker.asp| archive-date= July 4, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

JB Brubaker responded to a 2015 interview question about the band's reaction to being labeled as a Christian metal band by explaining that the presence of Christianity varies in each of the members' lives, but then says, "We decided years ago that we were not going to be an 
'evangelical band.' We're not onstage to bring people to God, that's not our purpose up there. Our number one purpose in ABR is to entertain."<ref name="The New Fury"/> In a 2014 interview, Jake Luhrs responded to a similar question by saying, "No, we are not a Christian band because, in my eyes, and I'm a believer in Jesus Christ...that doesn't mean because all of us are Christians we are now a Christian band."<ref>{{cite web|title=August Burns Red Vocalist Says They're 'Not a Ministry' Christian Band Who's 'Soul Purpose' is to Preach; Lets Music Speak Truth|url=http://www.breathecast.com/articles/august-burns-red-vocalist-ministry-christian-band-whos-soul-purpose-21692/|work=BreatheCast|publisher=BreatheCast|access-date=July 17, 2017}}</ref>

Since the members of the band are Christian, their beliefs are sometimes reflected in their writing and lyrics. However, these lyrics aren't meant to be religious but rather, positive and in songs such as "Fault Line", for the band's fans. Brent Rambler said in a 2016 interview, "We don't preach from stage, and we made the active choice that this band is about music, and being a positive influence. Since a lot of people correlate Christianity for positivity, that label has stuck with us."<ref>{{cite web|title=Band Interview: August Burns Red|url=https://damnationmagazine.com/2016/03/07/band-interview-august-burns-red/|work=Damnation Magazine|publisher=Damnation Magazine|access-date=July 17, 2017}}</ref>
Recently some of the members have stated in interviews that not all of the band are Christian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: JB Brubaker of August Burns Red|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1097436/august-burns-red-jb-brubaker/|work=killyourstereo.com|publisher=killyourstereo.com|access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref> They have said that they now just hope to spread positive messages in their music and lyrics, whether they are perceived as spreading a Christian message or not.<ref>{{cite web|title=August Burns Red: "We don't want to alienate anybody, it's not right"|url=http://www.punktastic.com/radar/august-burns-red-we-dont-want-to-alienate-anybody-its-not-right/|work=Punktastic|publisher=Punktastic|access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref> In a 2019 podcast, Matt Greiner stated that the band decided to drop their Christian label in 2012, after disputes within the band over what kind of message they were trying to spread, and whether their main intention was to make music or to spread a Christian message. Although the decision initially was met with disapproval by Greiner and Luhrs,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brothers of Merit - Faith, Brotherhood, and August Burns Red with Matt Greiner: Episode 06|url=https://www.buzzsprout.com/240515/939610-faith-brotherhood-and-august-burns-red-with-matt-greiner-episode-06|work=Brothers of Merit|publisher=buzzsprout.com|date=February 3, 2019}}</ref> members of the band continue to state that August Burns Red is not a Christian band.
