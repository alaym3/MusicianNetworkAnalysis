==Film scoring==

===1978–2000===
Shore's first film score was to the low budget thriller ''[[I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses]]'' (1978), followed by [[David Cronenberg]]'s first major film, ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979).<ref name="Greiving2016"/> He would go on to score all of Cronenberg's subsequent films, with the exception of ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]]. The first film he scored that was not directed by Cronenberg was [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985). Following that, he scored ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), again directed by Cronenberg. Two years later, he composed the score to ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988), directed by [[Penny Marshall]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]]. He then scored two more of David Cronenberg's films: ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' (1988) and ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' (1991).

During 1991, Shore composed the score for the highly acclaimed film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', starring [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], and directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]. He received his first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nomination for the score. The film became the third (and most recent) to win the five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Shore is the only living composer to have scored a "Top Five" Oscar-winning film.

During 1993, he composed the scores for ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'' (another collaboration with Cronenberg), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (his second collaboration with Jonathan Demme), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]. The latter two films were highly successful, ''Philadelphia'' winning [[Tom Hanks]] his first Oscar.

Shore scored another three films in 1994: ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', and ''[[Nobody's Fool (1994 film)|Nobody's Fool]]''. ''Ed Wood'' is notable for being one of the three films directed by Tim Burton that did not feature a score by [[Danny Elfman]].

Shore continued to score numerous films from 1995 to 2001, including two [[David Fincher]] films, ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (1997), and ''[[The Truth About Cats and Dogs]]'' (1996), directed by [[Michael Lehmann]]; he also collaborated on two films with Cronenberg, along with Tom Hanks' directorial debut, ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''. He scored [[Kevin Smith|Kevin Smith’s]]  [[Dogma (film)|Dogma]] (1999).  Shore also composed the score of the 2000 film ''[[The Cell]]''.

===2001–2006===
[[File:Howard Shore.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Shore at a press conference for ''The Lord of the Rings'' in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, 2003]]
Major success came in 2001 with his score to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the first film in the highly acclaimed ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]''. The news that Shore would score the trilogy surprised some, since he was primarily associated with dark, ominous films and had never scored an epic of this scale. However, the score was hugely successful and won Shore his first Oscar, as well as a Grammy Award, and garnered Shore nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA. The music editor on the trilogy was [[Suzana Peric]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Post Magazine - WOMEN IN FILM TO HONOR MUSIC EDITOR SUZANA PERIC|url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Press-Center/Daily-News/2007/WOMEN-IN-FILM-TO-HONOR-MUSIC-EDITOR-SUZANA-PERIC.aspx|access-date=2020-08-09|website=www.postmagazine.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hamill|first=Denis|title=ON THE RIGHT (SOUND)TRACK CROATIAN NATIVE SUZANA PERIC HAS CUT OUT A CAREER HERE AS A MOVIE MUSIC EDITOR|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sound-track-croatian-native-suzana-peric-cut-career-movie-music-editor-article-1.759344|access-date=2020-08-09|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref>  An excerpt from ''The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm'' was used in a teaser for 2013's [[Superman]] film, ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Theme from The Lord of the Rings Featured in 'Man of Steel' Teasers|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/07/21/59555-theme-from-the-lord-of-the-rings-featured-in-man-of-steel-teasers/|work=TheOneRing.net|access-date=September 19, 2013|date=July 21, 2012}}</ref> 

The following year, Shore composed the scores to ''[[Panic Room]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (replacing [[Elmer Bernstein]]), and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', the second film in the trilogy. (The latter two films were both nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].) Initially, Shore's score for ''The Two Towers'' was going to be deemed ineligible for submission to the Academy, due to a new rule that disallowed the submission of scores which contained themes from previous work. However, the implementation of this rule change was subsequently postponed, meaning the score remained eligible.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|title='Two Towers' score remains eligible, the academy says|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/18/entertainment/et-burlingame18|access-date=September 19, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 18, 2003}}</ref> Ultimately, ''The Two Towers'' score did not receive an Academy Award nomination; Shore did, however, receive a BAFTA nomination for ''Gangs of New York''.

In 2003, he composed the score for the final film in ''The Lord of the Rings trilogy'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. The film was the most successful film in the trilogy and the most successful of the year. Shore won his second Oscar for Best Original Score, as well as a third for Best Original Song for "[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]", which he shared with [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Annie Lennox]]. Shore also won his first Golden Globe, his third and fourth Grammy (the fourth for Best Song), and was nominated for a third BAFTA. The scores of ''The Lord of the Rings'', performed primarily by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], became one of the most successful film scores ever written and the biggest success in Shore's career. The score has been repeatedly<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34748803|title = Lord of the Rings voted 'best movie soundtrack'|work = BBC News|date = November 7, 2015}}</ref> voted to be the best film score, and the review site Filmtracks named Shore's score "arguably the most respected and impressive trilogy of music of all time: Howard Shore's massive work for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/phantom_menace.html|title = Filmtracks: Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (John Williams)}}</ref>

In 2004, Shore again collaborated with Martin Scorsese, scoring his epic film ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', this time with the [[Brussels Philharmonic]].<ref>{{cite journal|title='Alfie,' 'Aviator' and 'Ray' Rack Up Awards|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 29, 2005|volume=117|issue=5|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|access-date=January 7, 2018|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> He won a second Golden Globe for the score, becoming the third composer to have won consecutive Golden Globes in the Original Score category. He also received his sixth Grammy nomination, and his fifth BAFTA nomination.

He collaborated again with David Cronenberg in 2005 to score ''[[A History of Violence]]'', starring [[Viggo Mortensen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Howard Shore Scores 'A History of Violence'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4950229|access-date=January 7, 2018|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 9, 2005}}</ref> The film was a success and received two Oscar nominations. In 2006, he collaborated for the fourth time with Martin Scorsese, this time to score ''[[The Departed]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Debruge|first1=Peter|title=The Departed|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/awards/the-departed-1117954097/|access-date=January 7, 2018|work=Variety|date=November 16, 2006}}</ref> The film was highly successful and won four Oscars, including a long-awaited win for Scorsese, and Best Picture.

Although Shore was originally commissioned to compose the soundtrack for ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', he was later replaced by [[James Newton Howard]] due to "differing creative aspirations for the score" on his and the filmmakers' parts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shore leaves Jackson's King Kong|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/18/news1|access-date=January 7, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 18, 2005}}</ref> This was a mutual agreement between himself and [[Peter Jackson]]. Despite this, Shore has a cameo near the end of the film as the [[conducting|conductor]] of the [[orchestra]] in the theater, performing portions of [[Max Steiner]]'s score to the [[King Kong (1933 film)|original 1933 version]] of the film.

===2007–present===
In 2007, Shore composed the music for ''[[Soul of the Ultimate Nation]]'', an online multiplayer video game. The soundtrack is notable for being the first video game soundtrack to feature [[Lydia Kavina]] on the [[theremin]]. During 2007 he also composed the scores for ''[[The Last Mimzy]]'' and ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', the latter of which includes a section that has been performed in concert as Shore's ''Concertino for violin solo and chamber orchestra''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jqmv4 ''Radio 3 Live in Concert''], program called "BBC Concert Orchestra - London on Film" (broadcast June 11, 2012 on [[BBC Radio 3]])</ref> ''Eastern Promises'' was another collaboration with David Cronenberg and earned Shore his fourth Golden Globe nomination. In 2008, he scored ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'', starring Meryl Streep and directed by [[John Patrick Shanley]]. The film was a success, earning five Oscar nominations.

In 2010, Shore composed the score to ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse|Eclipse]]'', the third installment in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|''Twilight'' film series]], following [[Carter Burwell]] and [[Alexandre Desplat]], who scored the first and second films, respectively. He also replaced [[John Corigliano]] to score ''[[Edge of Darkness (2010 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'', starring [[Mel Gibson]].

Shore's 2011 projects were ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', continuing his long-term collaboration with director David Cronenberg. He also composed the score to [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'', his fifth collaboration with the director, which earned him a sixth Golden Globe nomination and fourth Oscar nomination.<ref name="Symkus2017"/>

He also composed the score to [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' film series.<ref name="musicoflotr1">{{cite news|title=Why NZ Matters |url=http://www.musicoflotr.com/2010/10/why-nz-matters.html|access-date=November 1, 2010|date=October 27, 2010|first=Doug|last=Adams|work=The Music of The Lord of the Rings Films}}</ref>

Since 2004, he has toured the world [[conducting]] local [[orchestra]]s in the performance of his new [[symphony|symphonic]] arrangement of his highly acclaimed ''[[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series|Lord of the Rings]]'' scores. The new work is entitled ''The Lord of the Rings: Symphony in Six Movements''.

The concert presentation of the symphony also includes projected still images of sketches by John Howe and Alan Lee relating the music being performed to scenes from the films.
