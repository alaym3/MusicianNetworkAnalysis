==History==
The band formed in 2009. Since then, they have signed to A389 Recordings and [[Profound Lore Records]], releasing three full-length albums. Their first album, titled ''Roots of Earth Are Consuming My Home'', was released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full of Hell – 'Roots Of Earth Are Consuming My Home' (full album stream)|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/08/full_of_hell_--.html|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|access-date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> Their second album, titled ''[[Rudiments of Mutilation]]'' was released in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Consterdine|first1=John|title=Full Of Hell streaming 'Rudiments Of Mutilation'|url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/streams/full-of-hell-rudiments-of-mutilation-stream/|publisher=Terrorizer|access-date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> Their [[Full of Hell & Merzbow|third album]], a collaboration with Japanese noise artist [[Merzbow]], was released in 2014.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Pessaro|first1=Fred|title=Old Souls with Piercing Noise: Stream the New Full of Hell / Merzbow Collaboration|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/full-of-hell-gordian-stream|magazine=Vice|access-date=December 18, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, original bassist Brandon Brown left the band. He was replaced by Sam DiGristine of Jarhead Fertilizer—an associated act that also features Brown, as well as drummer Dave Bland.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Dylan Walker and Spencer Hazard follow a [[straight edge]] lifestyle, while Bland is the only vegan.<ref name="qanda">{{cite web|url=https://theacidawakening.wordpress.com/2016/02/21/qa-spencer-hazard-of-full-of-hell/|title=Q&A: SPENCER HAZARD of Full Of Hell|date=February 21, 2016|first=Tom|last=LaSala|publisher=The Acid Awakening|access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullofhell.com/post/28982176242/are-you-straight-edgevegan|title=Anonymous asked:Are you straight edge/vegan?|publisher=Fullofhell.com|date=August 8, 2012|access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref>

On January 8, 2016, Full of Hell released a four-song EP titled ''[[Amber Mote in the Black Vault]]'' through Bad Teeth Recordings. The release featured three original tracks and a cover of [[Melvins]]' track "Oven," originally released on their 1989 album ''[[Ozma (album)|Ozma]]''.<ref name="noisey1">{{cite web| last = Kelly| first = Kim| title = Listen to Full of Hell Lay Waste to the Melvins' Deep Cut 'Oven'| work = [[Noisey]]| publisher = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]| date = December 8, 2015| url = http://noisey.vice.com/blog/full-of-hell-melvins-cover| access-date = January 7, 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160122192853/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/full-of-hell-melvins-cover| archive-date = January 22, 2016| url-status = dead}}</ref> Describing their reasoning for selecting this track, the band explained: "We had been wanting to cover a Melvins song for years, and 'Oven' had always been one of our top choices. We've always been very inspired by the Melvins on every level—a totally unique and uncompromising band that has always worked their asses off. They are a band that's undefinable but always recognizable. Totally brilliant. With past covers that we've done, we've always deviated from the source material, but this time we chose to stick close to the original sound and tempo."<ref name="noisey1"/>

Full of Hell began plotting to follow up ''Full of Hell & Merzbow'' with another collaborative album with [[avant-garde metal]] band [[The Body (band)|The Body]] after a successful 2015 tour together.<ref name="quietus1">{{cite web| last = Cool| first = Toby| title = Meaningless Pain: An Interview With Full Of Hell| work = [[The Quietus]]| date = March 18, 2015| url = http://thequietus.com/articles/17448-full-of-hell-interview| access-date = May 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="exclaim1">{{cite web| last = Adams| first = Gregory| title = Full of Hell and The Body Team Up for Collaborative Album| work = [[Exclaim!]]| date = January 7, 2015| url = http://exclaim.ca/music/article/full_of_hell_and_the_body_team-up_for_one_day_you_will_ache_like_i_ache| access-date = January 7, 2015}}</ref> The two acts expected to head into the studio together to record an album without previously writing any material.<ref name="quietus1"/> Titled ''[[One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache]]'', the collaboration album was released on March 25, 2016 through [[Neurot Recordings]]<ref name="exclaim1"/>—a label founded by members of [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Tribes of Neurot]].
