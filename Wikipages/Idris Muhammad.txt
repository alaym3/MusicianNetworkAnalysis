At just 14 Muhammad began his professional career by performing with [[The Hawketts]] on their iconic recording “[[Mardi Gras Mambo]]”. Two years later, in 1956, he played drums on [[Fats Domino|Fats Domino's]] recording of "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]".<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|date=October 2014|title=Idris Muhammad|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1555328645|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|volume=209|pages=119|id={{ProQuest|1555328645}}|via=Proquest}}</ref>

After being introduced by [[Joe Jones (singer)|Joe Jones]], Muhammad began touring with [[Sam Cooke]]. Later he played with [[Jerry Butler]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] in Chicago, working largely in [[Rhythm and blues|R'n'B]], before moving to New York City in the mid-1960s.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Kunian|first=David|date=Winter 2016|title=The Power of Soul: Remembering drummer Idris Muhammed's versatile, funkified and oft-sampled body of work|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:PUqLkex70sQJ:https://64parishes.org/the-power-of-soul+&cd=6&hl=ja&ct=clnk&gl=jp|journal=64 Parishes}}</ref><ref name="Independent" /> In New York, Muhammad became embedded in the jazz scene playing with [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Horace Silver]], [[Lou Donaldson]] and [[Betty Carter]]. He also played in the [[Apollo Theatre (42nd Street)|Apollo Theatre's]] house band. In 1967, he accepted a job in the orchestra for the initial off-Broadway production of [[Hair (musical)|''Hair'']] and stayed with the production when it moved to Broadway.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="NYT" />

During this time, Muhammad was also in the [[Prestige Records|Prestige label’s]] house band and made over 150 recordings for the Prestige and [[CTI Records|CTI]] labels among others.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Idris Muhammad - DRUMMERWORLD|url=https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Idris_Muhammad.html|access-date=2021-07-24|website=www.drummerworld.com}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> He recorded with artists such as Lou Donaldson and [[Charles Earland]] who had begun merging jazz with sounds from funk, soul and rock. Muhammad also appeared as a sideman with artists such as [[Gene Ammons]], [[Nat Adderley]], and [[George Benson]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> [[Rudy Van Gelder]] often worked with Muhammad and had a special relationship with him. The producer greatly assisted with fine tuning Muhammad's recorded drum sound.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Independent" />

After four years with ''Hair'', Muhammad left the production to tour with [[Roberta Flack]] whom he worked with for much of the next decade.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

Muhammad’s first recording as a leader, ''[[Black Rhythm Revolution!]]'', was released by Prestige in 1970 and was followed by ''[[Peace and Rhythm]]'' in 1971. Both of these albums explored a range of styles and traditions found in jazz and New Orleans rhythms.<ref name="Independent" /> Subsequent albums released on the [[CTI Records|Kudu]] imprint, ''[[Power of Soul (album)|Power of Soul]]'', ''[[House of the Rising Sun (album)|House of the Rising Sun]]'', and ''[[Turn This Mutha Out]],'' took a turn towards funk.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="NYT" /> These albums have subsequently become favourites of funk enthusiasts and have been heavily sampled by hip-hop artists.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="NYT" />

Towards the end of the 1970s, Muhammad joined [[Johnny Griffin|Johnny Griffin's]] band and also spent time playing with [[Pharoah Sanders]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music (4 ed.)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199726363|editor-last=Larkin|editor-first=Colin}}</ref>

By the 1980s, Muhammad had moved to Europe. He continued to regularly play and record, collaborating with the likes of [[Ahmad Jamal]], [[Chico Freeman]] and [[Sonny Rollins]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" />

In 2011 he moved back to New Orleans. He died of kidney failure in 2014, aged 74, and was buried according to [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial traditions]].<ref name="NYT" /><ref name="Independent" /><ref name=":3" />

==Personal life==
He changed his name to Idris Muhammad in the 1960s upon his conversion to [[Islam]]. Speaking of his name change, he later noted in an interview with Modern Drummer magazine, "One guy told me that if I changed my name, I was going to have a problem because no one would know that Leo Morris and Idris Muhammad were the same guy...But I thought, well, if I stay the same person, then people will know it’s me. And it worked like that. Everybody knew right away that it was me, because of my style of playing.”<ref name="moderndrummer1"/>

Muhammad was an endorser of [[Istanbul Agop Cymbals]].<ref>[https://memphisdrumshop.com/cymbals/mycymbal/istanbul-agop/cymbal-series/idris-muhammad/ "Istanbul Agop 22" Signature Idris Muhammad Ride Cymbal"], Memphis Drum Shop.</ref>

In 1966, he married [[Dolores "LaLa" Brooks]], a former member of [[the Crystals]]. She converted to [[Islam]] with him and went for a time by the name Sakinah Muhammad. They separated in 1999. Together, they had two sons and two daughters, and he had one daughter from a previous marriage to Gracie Lee Edwards.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|last1=Chinen|first1=Nate|title=Idris Muhammad, Drummer Whose Beat Still Echoes, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/arts/music/idris-muhammad-drummer-whose-beat-still-echoes-dies-at-74.html?_r=0|access-date= April 27, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 8, 2014}}</ref>
