'''Yuzu''' (''Citrus junos'', from Japanese {{lang|ja|柚子}} or {{lang|ja|ユズ}}) is a [[citrus]] [[fruit]] and plant in the family [[Rutaceae]] of [[East Asian]] origin. Yuzu has been cultivated mainly in East Asia, though recently also in [[Australia]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].<ref>[https://www.jetro.go.jp/agriportal/pickup/yuzu.html Japan External Trade Organization (日本貿易振興機構 JETRO ジェトロ)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108231740/https://www.jetro.go.jp/agriportal/pickup/yuzu.html|date=2021-01-08}}.</ref>

It is believed to have originated in central China as an [[F1 hybrid]] of the ''mangshanyeju'' subspecies of [[mandarin orange]] and the [[ichang papeda]].<ref name=Wu2021>{{cite journal |title=Diversification of mandarin citrus by hybrid speciation and apomixis |last1=Wu |first1=Guohong Albert |last2=Sugimoto |first2=Chikatoshi |last3=Kinjo |first3=Hideyasu |last4=Asama |first4=Chika |last5=Mitsube |first5=Fumimasa |last6=Talon |first6=Manuel |last7=Gmitter |first7=Grederick G, Jr |last8=Rokhsar |first8=Daniel S |journal=Nature Communications |date=2021 |volume=12 |page=4377 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-24653-0 |doi-access=free}} and Supplement</ref> The yuzu is called '''yuja''' (from Korean {{lang|ko|유자}}) in [[Korean cuisine]]. Both Japanese ''yuzu'' and Korean ''yuja'' are borrowings of the kanji/hanja '''yòuzi''' ({{lang|zh|柚子}}), though this Chinese word now refers to the [[pomelo]] due to [[semantic shift]].
{{TOC limit|4}}

== Description ==
This fruit looks somewhat like a small [[grapefruit]] with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. ''Yuzu'' fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between {{cvt|5.5|cm}} and {{cvt|7.5|cm}} in diameter, but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to {{cvt|10|cm}} or larger).

Yuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns. Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], resembling those of the related [[kaffir lime]] and ichang [[Papeda (citrus)|papeda]], and are heavily scented.

Yuzu closely resembles [[sudachi]] (''Citrus sudachi'', a [[Japanese citrus]] from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu–mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.

== Cultivation ==
The yuzu originated and grows wild in central China and Tibet region. It was introduced to Japan and Korea during the [[Tang dynasty]], and  is still cultivated there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yuzu ichandrin (papeda hybrid). ''Citrus junos'' Sieb. ex Tanaka.

== Varieties and similar fruits ==
In [[Japan]], an ornamental version of yuzu called {{nihongo|''hana yuzu''|花柚子, 花ゆず|}} "flower yuzu" is also grown for its flowers rather than its fruit. A sweet variety of yuzu known as the ''yuko'', only present in Japan, became severely endangered during the 1970s and 1980s; a major attempt has been made to revive this varietal in southern Japan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kurokawa|first=Yoko|date=January 7, 2009 |title=Vol. 11: The ''Yuko'', a Native Japanese Citrus|url=http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/series/japanese-traditional-foods/vol.-11-the-yuko-a-native-japanese-citrus|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523230837/http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/series/japanese-traditional-foods/vol.-11-the-yuko-a-native-japanese-citrus|archive-date=May 23, 2009|series=Japanese Traditional Foods|publisher=Tokyo Foundation}}</ref> Another variety of yuzu in Japan, with knobby skin, is called {{nihongo|''shishi yuzu''|獅子柚子||literally "lion yuzu"}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.nifty.com/special03/12/03/img/078_8.jpg|title=photo|access-date=2007-02-04|archive-date=2007-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224051648/http://portal.nifty.com/special03/12/03/img/078_8.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Dangyuja]], a Korean citrus fruit from [[Jeju Island]], is often considered a type of yuzu due to its similar shape and flavour, but it is genetically a variety of [[pomelo]].

===== Japan =====
[[File:Yuzuvinegar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|A bottle of yuzu vinegar]]

Yuzu's domestic production is about 27,000 [[ton]]s (2016).<ref>[https://www.jetro.go.jp/agriportal/pickup/yuzu.html Japan External Trade Organization (日本貿易振興機構 JETRO ジェトロ)] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108231740/https://www.jetro.go.jp/agriportal/pickup/yuzu.html|date=2021-01-08}} Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (農林水産省) 2016 Survey</ref> Though rarely eaten as a fruit, yuzu is a common ingredient in [[Japanese cuisine]], where the aromatic [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] (outer rind) as well as juice are used much in the same way that [[lemon]]s are used in other cuisines. The yuzu's flavour is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with overtones of [[mandarin orange]].

It is an integral ingredient (along with [[sudachi]], [[daidai]], and other similar citrus fruits) in the citrus-based sauce [[ponzu]], and yuzu [[vinegar]] is also produced. Yuzu is often combined with honey to make {{lang|ja-Latn|yuzu hachimitsu}} ({{lang|ja|柚子蜂蜜}}) — a kind of syrup that is used to make yuzu tea ({{lang|ja|柚子茶}}), or as an ingredient in alcoholic drinks such as the yuzu sour ({{lang|ja|柚子サワー}}).<ref>{{cite web|author=5分|url=http://www.kikkoman.co.jp/homecook/search/recipe.php?numb=00003764|title=柚子サワー &#124; ホームクッキング【キッコーマン】|publisher=Kikkoman.co.jp|access-date=2012-03-04 |archive-date=2012-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305185800/http://www.kikkoman.co.jp/homecook/search/recipe.php?numb=00003764|url-status=live}}</ref> {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Yuzukoshō|Yuzu kosho]]}} (also {{lang|ja-Latn|yuzukosho}}, literally "yuzu and pepper"), is a spicy Japanese sauce made from green or yellow yuzu zest, green or red [[chili pepper]]s, and salt.

=====Yuzu baths=====
{{main|Yuzu bath}}
Yuzu is also known for its characteristically strong aroma, and the oil from its skin is marketed as a fragrance. In Japan, bathing with yuzu on [[Winter solstice|Tōji]], the [[winter solstice]], is a custom that dates to at least the early 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Emi|first=Doi|date=December 21, 2017|title=Soaking and Seasoning: The Aromatic Pleasures of "Yuzu" |url=https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b06004/|url-status=live|access-date=December 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219130045/https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b06004/|archive-date=February 19, 2019|quote=Yuzuyu dates from the Edo period (1603–1868) and may have been partially inspired by a form of Japanese wordplay called goroawase — the characters for "winter solstice" (冬至) and "hot-spring cure" (湯治) can both be read as tōji.}}</ref><ref name="kokugo-yuzuyu">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Kokugo Daijiten|title=Yuzuyu|url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|access-date=2012-02-28|year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan|location=Tokyo|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|archive-date=August 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name="nipponika">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika)|title=Yuzu|url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|access-date=2012-05-22|year=2012|publisher=Shogakukan|location=Tokyo|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|archive-date=August 25, 2007}}</ref> Whole yuzu fruits are floated in the hot water of the bath, sometimes enclosed in a cloth bag, releasing their aroma.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru daijisen|title=Yuzuyu|url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|access-date=2012-05-22|year=2012|publisher=Shogakukan|location=Tokyo|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|archive-date=August 25, 2007}}</ref> The fruit may also be cut in half, allowing the citrus juice to mingle with the bathwater. The yuzu bath, known commonly as ''yuzu yu'' (柚子湯), but also as ''yuzu buro'' (柚子風呂), is said to guard against colds, treat the roughness of skin,<ref name="kokugo-yuzuyu" /> warm the body, and relax the mind.

=====Use as wood=====
The body of the ''[[taepyeongso]]'', a Korean traditional oboe, close to the Chinese [[Suona]] or the [[Zurna]], is often made from jujube, mulberry or yuzu wood.
