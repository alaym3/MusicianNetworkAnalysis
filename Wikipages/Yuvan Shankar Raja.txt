== Early life ==
Yuvan Shankar Raja is the third and youngest child of musician and film composer [[Ilaiyaraaja]]. He is the younger brother of music director [[Karthik Raja]] and playback singer-music director [[Bhavatharini]]. Yuvan once confessed that his brother Karthik Raja was more talented than him, but he did not get a successful break into the music business since he did not get a "good team to work with".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/cp/2008/11/07/stories/2008110750070300.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108173754/http://www.hindu.com/cp/2008/11/07/stories/2008110750070300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 November 2012|title=On a creative trip|access-date=4 April 2009|location=Chennai, India|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 November 2008}}</ref> His father as well as his siblings have sung many songs under his direction.

== Career ==

=== Film score and soundtracks ===

==== Early years (1997–2000) ====
In 1996, following his mother's suggestion to take up music as a profession, Yuvan Shankar Raja started composing tunes for an album.<ref name="Yuvan Shankar Raja's Profile">{{cite web|title=Yuvan Shankar Raja's Profile|url=http://www.ssmusic.tv/artist_profile.php?Opt=1&Language=&artId=20071100001|publisher=S S Music|access-date=5 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623092856/http://www.ssmusic.tv/artist_profile.php?Opt=1&Language=&artId=20071100001|archive-date=23 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[T. Siva]], the producer of the Tamil language film ''[[Aravindhan]]'', after hearing some of the tunes, asked him to compose a [[trailer music]] score. As Siva was impressed by the music, he gave Yuvan Shankar the assignment to compose the entire film score, including a soundtrack for that film.<ref name="Yuvan Shankar Raja's Profile" /> After consulting and getting consent from his parents, he accepted the offer; his music career started. His entry into the Tamil film and music industry had happened at age 16, thus he became one of the youngest composers ever in the industry, which he says, was "purely accidental".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfmpage.com/forum/archives/20550.03.13.03.html|title=YSR in London|publisher=tfmpage.com|access-date=4 April 2009|archive-date=10 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210173131/http://tfmpage.com/forum/archives/20550.03.13.03.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

However, both the soundtrack album as well as the film itself failed to attract audiences and do well, and Yuvan Shankar Raja's following projects ''[[Velai]]'' (1998) and ''[[Kalyana Galatta]]'' (1998) were not successful either; his compositions for these films did not receive good reviews or responses,<ref name="Masterpieces of Ilayaraja">{{cite web|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/enter/review/ilayaraja.html|title=Masterpieces of Ilayaraja|publisher=nilacharal.com|access-date=4 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetradiocity.com/musicopedia/music_director.php?Director=Yuvan%20Shankar%20Raja&conid=3288|title=Yuvan Shankar Raja &#124; Music Directors &#124; Music Composers|date=31 August 1979|publisher=Planetradiocity.com|access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref> with one reviewer labelling the music and background score in the latter as "cacophony" and "poor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Reviews/articles/KalyaaNa_Galaattaa_8242.html|title=KalyaaNa Galaattaa: Movie Review|publisher=Indolink.com|access-date=20 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718214603/http://indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Reviews/articles/KalyaaNa_Galaattaa_8242.html|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The failures of his first projects meant that he was not offered any film projects and assignments subsequently.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/22/stories/2003102200060100.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110173902/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/22/stories/2003102200060100.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2003|title=Generation NEXT|date=22 October 2003|work=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai, India}}</ref> During this time of struggle, he was approached and assigned by director [[Vasanth]] to compose the music for his film ''[[Poovellam Kettuppar]]'' (1999).

==== Rise to prominence (2001–2003) ====
<!-- Thanks to this film's enormous success, he eventually broke into the Tamil music scene as offers were pouring in subsequently. He was mainly approached by many young new directors. -->In 2001, he had three album releases, the first being ''Thulluvadho Ilamai'', collaborating with [[Selvaraghavan]] for the first time. The film was directed by [[Kasthuri Raja]], but his son Selvaraghavan wrote the script and worked with Yuvan Shankar Raja for the film's soundtrack album. The soundtrack album of ''Thulluvadho Ilamai'' particularly appealed to the younger generation. The film itself, marking the debut of Selvaraghavan's brother [[Dhanush]], released one year later and became a [[sleeper hit]] at the Chennai box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanjilonline.com/music/kadhalkondaen_rev.asp |title=Kadhal Kondaen Music Review |publisher=NanjilOnline.com |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thiraipadam.com/cgi-bin/movie_review.pl?id=408&user_name=bbalaji&review_lang=english&lang=english |title=Kadhal Konden&nbsp;– Tamil Movie Review |publisher=Thiraipadam.com |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref> This was followed by [[Bala (director)|Bala's]] ''[[Nandha]]'' (2001), for which he received rave reviews.<ref name="Masterpieces of Ilayaraja" /> He then gained notice by churning out "youthful music" in the college-life based ''[[April Maadhathil]]'' (2002), the [[romantic comedy]] films ''[[Kadhal Samrajyam]]'' (2002) (The film was never released theatrically, the soundtrack was released in 2002) and ''[[Mounam Pesiyadhe]]'' (2002), [[Ameer Sultan|Ameer's]] directorial debut film, and the [[love triangle|triangular love story]] ''[[Punnagai Poove]]'' (2002), in which he also made his on-screen debut, appearing in some scenes and one song sequence.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090121084859/http://archives.chennaionline.com/interviews/yuvan.asp]</ref> At the same time, he made his [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu]] debut with ''[[Seshu]]'' and ''[[Malli Malli Chudali]]'' and also composed for the Tamil films ''[[Junior Senior (2002 film)|Junior Senior]]'' and ''[[Pop Carn (2003 film)|Pop Carn]]'', starring Malayalam actors [[Mammootty]] and [[Mohanlal]], respectively, though all of which performed poorly at the box office.

==== Recent work (2013–Present) ====

In 2013, hit movies such as ''[[Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga]]'' and ''[[Aarambam]]'', which included also successful soundtracks released.
The soundtrack of the coming-of-age movie ''[[Thanga Meenkal]]'' fetched him positive reviews.

In 2014, nine movies, featuring Yuvan's music were released, two of them non-Tamil movies; the Telugu film ''[[Govindudu Andarivadele]]'' and the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film ''[[Raja Natwarlal]]'', which marked Yuvan's [[Bollywood]] debut. While ''Govindudu Andarivadele'' became one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2014, ''Raja Natwarlal'' however, was a box office flop. The other releases that year, which included ''[[Thirudan Police]]'', ''[[Anjaan (2014 film)|Anjaan]]'' and ''[[Poojai]]'' proved to be commercially successful, whereas ''[[Vanavarayan Vallavarayan]]'' released with positive reviews from critics. In ''[[Vadacurry]]'', he has done only one song in the album. ''[[Vai Raja Vai]]'' released in 2015, whereas the visuals of ''[[Idam Porul Eval]]'' remain unreleased.

As of August 2011, he has sung over 80 songs, mostly his own compositions, and several times he recorded for his father Ilaiyaraaja and his brother [[Karthik Raja]].

==== Non-cinematic output ====
Aside from scoring film music and soundtracks, he also produces personal music albums from time to time.

== Music style and impact ==
He has explored various genres,<ref name="Yuvan Unplugged" /> and experimented with new sounds. Yuvan Shankar Raja has not learnt [[Indian classical music]],<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/profile.php?id=111214778&cid=2409 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924205629/http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/profile.php?id=111214778&cid=2409 |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Welcome To |publisher=Sify |date=31 August 1979 |access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref> although he has used complex [[swara]] patterns and [[carnatic rāga]]s in several films, including ''[[Nandha]]'' and ''[[Thulluvadho Ilamai]]''. Critics have noted that Yuvan Shankar Raja's music has a "youthful character to it",<ref name="ReferenceB" /> with his compositions in particular appealing to the younger generation.

Yuvan Shankar Raja started the "era of [[remix]]es"; "Aasai Nooru Vagai" from ''Kurumbu'' (2004) is considered as the first remix in a Tamil film, following which several composers began remixing Tamil film songs from the 1970s and 80s. He has experimented with the fusion of old songs with his own original compositions, mixing and incorporating parts of them into his songs, e.g., "Theepidikka" from ''Arinthum Ariyamalum'' (2005) and "Enga Area" from ''Pudhupettai'' (2005). In 2010, he and his friend and fellow actor Silambarasan released the song "Evan Di Unna Pethan" from the film ''Vaanam'' (2011) as a single, which generated the trend of releasing single tracks from film soundtracks in Tamil cinema several months prior to the actual release,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2701259.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Showbitz&nbsp;– Moving to direction | date=9 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/74555.html |title=Hit mantra of soup boys |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=25 November 2011 |access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref> although the first single in Tamil cinema had been released in 2001 already.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/25/stories/2002102501150300.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031014020945/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/25/stories/2002102501150300.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 October 2003 |title=Fame on a platter |date=25 October 2002 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref>
