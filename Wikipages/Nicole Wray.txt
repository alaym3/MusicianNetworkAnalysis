In 1998, her debut album ''[[Make It Hot]]'' was released.

The third single, "Eyes Better Not Wander", peaked at number 71 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/1999-06-19/r-b-hip-hop-songs "Eyes Better Not Wander"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', June 19, 1999.</ref> Later that year, Wray would sing the hook to "[[All n My Grill]]" on Missy Elliott's platinum certified second album, ''[[Da Real World]]''.

In July 2001, Wray released "I'm Lookin{{'"}}, the first single from her planned second album ''Elektric Blue''.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/#/news/articles/1442121/03232001/nicole.jhtml "Missy Elliott, Redman on Nicole's album Elektric Blue"], Shaheem Reid, [[MTV News]], March 23, 2001.</ref> "I'm Lookin{{'"}} peaked at number 66 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2001-09-01/r-b-hip-hop-songs "I'm Lookin'" (Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart)], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', September 1, 2001.</ref> but the album would eventually be shelved.

After amicably parting with The Goldmind, Wray was sought after to feature vocals on various albums and soundtracks. She would go on to sign a new album deal and under the guidance of [[Damon Dash]] was featured on [[Cam'ron]]'s gold certified 2004 release, ''[[Purple Haze (album)|Purple Haze]]''.

Later that year she released the single, "If I Was Your Girlfriend" from her scheduled [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] debut and sophomore studio set ''LoveChild''.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/wray_nicole/artist.jhtml#bio Nicole Wray|Main]. MTV. Retrieved: June 10, 2009.</ref> Though garnering some buzz, there ultimately was not enough push to release the album. After the temporary halt of Roc-A-Fella, ''LoveChild'' would suffer the same fate as its predecessor.

Wray moved through the Dame Dash Music Group, and also Channel 7 Records, garnering several guest vocal appearances.

Still maintaining her work relationship with Damon Dash, Wray joined [[The Black Keys]] rock/hip-hop collective [[Blakroc]], and was a major vocal contributor to the group's self-titled November 2009 debut.  Wray was then enlisted to add her background vocals on The Black Keys' seventh studio LP, ''[[Brothers (The Black Keys album)|Brothers]]'', which was released in May 2010.

In 2010, she appeared on [[Kid Cudi]]'s second album ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'' on the song "The End", alongside [[Chip tha Ripper]] and [[GLC (rapper)|GLC]].

In 2012, Wray teamed up with fellow soulstress [[Terri Walker]] to form retro-soul duo Lady.  They were signed to [[Truth and Soul Records]] and their self-titled debut album was released on March 5, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/nicole-wray-and-terri-walker-unite-to-form-lady|title=Nicole Wray and Terri Walker Unite to Form Lady|date=10 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Lady/dp/B00AX20BAE/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1465585011&sr=1-1&keywords=lady|title=Lady|date=5 March 2013|via=Amazon}}</ref>
