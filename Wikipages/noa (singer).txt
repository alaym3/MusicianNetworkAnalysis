==Music career==
[[File:Noa performs.jpg|thumb|Noa performs at the Zappa Club, Herzeliya, October 2018]]
Noa has performed in a variety of locations around the world, including [[Carnegie Hall]] and [[Avery Fisher Hall]] in New York City, [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris, Rome's [[Colosseum]], [[Barbican Arts Centre|The Barbican]] in London, [[Zellerbach Auditorium]] in Berkeley, California, the [[Ravinia Festival]] in Chicago, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in the Netherlands, the [[Stockholm Water Festival]] in Sweden and [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] in [[Barcelona]]. 

Noa has recorded songs in English, Hebrew, [[Yemenite Hebrew]], Spanish, Neapolitan, French, Italian, Sardinian, Galician, and Arabic. Noa and Gil Dor have had various ensembles since their early days as an acoustic duet. Noa and Dor's ensembles vary from album to album, ranging from collaborations with musicians such as: [[Zohar Fresco]], [[Steve Rodby]], [[Solis String Quartet]], [[Hila Carni]] and symphonic orchestras around the world. Noa's music is influenced by the singer-songwriters of the 60s such as [[Paul Simon]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and [[James Taylor]]. These musical and lyrical sensibilities, combined with Noa's Yemenite roots and Dor's background in [[jazz]], classical rock, have created Noa and Dor's unique sound audible through hundreds of songs written and performed by the duo. Noa plays percussion, guitar and piano. 
[[File:Noa and Gil Dor perform.jpg|thumb|Noa performs with Gil Dor at the Performance Arts Center, Tel Aviv, March 2019]]

In 1994, Noa performed ''[[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]]'' with English lyrics she wrote for a live audience of 100,000 and a TV audience of millions at the closing event of the [[International Year of the Family]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], Rome, Italy, witnessed by [[Pope John Paul II]].

Noa and Dor have performed on numerous occasions with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]. They recorded an album during a live performance at Tel Aviv's Mann Auditorium in 1997. Over the years they have collaborated with symphonic orchestras from Lille, Messina, Parma, Murcia, and Florence. In September 2003, Noa performed an orchestral piece entitled ''L'isola della Luce'' (after the Greek island on which it was performed) which was written by [[Nicola Piovani]] especially for her. The work was commissioned by the [[Cultural Olympics Committee]] in Athens. In May 2004, the duo performed with the Israeli rhythm and dance troupe [[Be by Mayumana|Mayumana]] between the two final games of the [[Euroleague]] [[basketball]] championship.
