'''Vanessa Brown''' (born 24 October 1983), known professionally as '''VV Brown''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[indie pop]] singer-songwriter, model and record producer.

==Career==
===Early life and career===
Vanessa Brown was born in [[Northampton]], England. She is the eldest of six siblings; her mother is Jamaican and her father is Puerto Rican.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/31/food-drink-nutrition//|first=John|last=Briffa|date=31 January 2010|title=What’s in your basket, VV Brown?|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

She attended [[Overstone Park School]] near Northampton, which her parents own and work in. She then went to Kingsthorpe Upper School, now Kingsthorpe Community College, and sat her A-levels a year early. She achieved four A-grades and received offers to study law at five universities including [[Oxford University|Oxford]] but declined them to pursue a music career.

While at school and college she declined three offers of a record deal, including one from rapper [[P. Diddy]]'s label [[Bad Boy Records]], to focus on her studies.

Brown studied violin until the age of nine but gave up to focus on piano, vocals and trumpet, which she found easier. She completed her grade 8 trumpet examination aged 16 and played in jazz bands until the age of 21. Her childhood musical idols were jazz artists like [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. She is also a lifelong hip-hop fan and was nicknamed "VV" by her peers as an MC at her middle school.

===2002–06: ''Back to the Music''===
Aged 18, Brown attended an open audition for the [[VH1]] Divas concert and was stopped outside the venue by an executive from London Records, who offered her a development deal. This ended a year later, at which point she was offered deals by [[Polydor]] in the UK and A&M Records in the US. She left both in 2006 after releasing one single and a promotional EP called ''Back to the Music''.

===2007–09: ''Travelling like the Light''===
Brown moved back to London and began performing in bars and clubs around the city. She was rediscovered by executive Darcus Beese and signed to Island Records. She recorded her debut album ''[[Travelling Like the Light]]'' between 2007 and 2008.

Brown said that most of the album's lyrics on the album, including those from its four singles ''[[Crying Blood]]'', ''[[Leave!]]'', ''Game Over'' and ''[[Shark in the Water]]'', were about a failed affair she endured.<ref name="Levine">Levine, Nick.

Retrieved on 2010-02-15.</ref> "Shark in the Water" charted in the British, French and US charts, receiving gold status in the US and France in 2009, and sold over 1.5 million records to date.

===2011–15: ''Lollipops & Politics'' cancellation, ''Samson & Delilah'' and ''Glitch''===
In 2011, prior to the mastering of Brown's second album ''[[Lollipops & Politics]]'', a free preview mixtape called ''The Playground'' was released through [[SoundCloud]].

Brown announced that the first single from ''Lollipops & Politics'' would be called "Children", featuring Chiddy of [[Chiddy Bang]]. This was released on iTunes in America on 20 September that year.<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a340338/vv-brown-confirms-new-single-children-teases-album-details.html |title=VV Brown confirms new single 'Children', teases album details - Music News |work=Digital Spy |date=14 September 2011 |access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref> On 4 October, Brown confirmed the title of the album and released the full track list, saying it would be released early in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6033982/vv-brown-lollipops-politics |title=VV Brown Titles New Album 'Lollipops & Politics', Reveals Tracklist &#124; Music News, Reviews, and Gossip on |publisher=Idolator.com |date=4 October 2011 |access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref>However, the release was postponed until 2013, and then called off completely; Brown posted on her Facebook account that she "didn't feel it was right as an artist".

A track called ''10 Ft. Tall'', which was to be included on ''Lollipops & Politics'', was released as a non-album single.
