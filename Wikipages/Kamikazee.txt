'''Kamikazee''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2000. The band is composed of Jay Contreras (lead vocals), Jomal Linao (guitar and vocals), Led Tuyay (guitar), Puto Astete (bass) and Bords Burdeos (drums).

Fans and critics have described the band's music as a mix of [[pop punk]] and [[hardcore punk]].

In August 2015, the band had temporarily reunited after a brief hiatus announced earlier in January 2015 and in the beginning of 2016, the band officially entered an indefinite hiatus. They played their farewell concert on December 10, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]]. Later, the band makes reunion gigs and tours since 2017.<ref name="Rappler">[http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/concerts/115683-kamikazee-huling-sayaw-farewell-concert-photos IN PHOTOS: Kamikazee says goodbye with 'Huling Sayaw' concert for fans - ''Rappler''.]</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years===
The band is composed of five members who met at the College of Fine Arts of the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines, Diliman]]. Kamikazee's early gigs were mostly on-campus events in UP Diliman like the annual UP Fair. Before they were signed to a major label, they went by the name ''"Kamikazee Cornflakes"'', eventually shortening the name to ''"Kamikazee"''. Their early shows included performances of the songs "Mmm Sarap", "Tsinelas", a cover of singer [[Ariel Rivera]]'s "Sana Kahit Minsan", and [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]''.

Their live performances have since been known for using expletives, sexually suggestive dances, and references to genitalia. Despite such antics, their music incorporates many elements of modern rock music, such as pop-punk, grunge and NU-metal, on some of their songs. Band drummer Bords Burdeos was also recognized for his drumwork, which according to fans and critics, added extra flair to the band's songs.

Kamikazee released their first studio album in 2002. The album's carrier single was a heavy cover version of Britney Spears' "Lucky". Other notable songs include "Girlfriend", "Ung Tagalog",  "Tsinelas" and their cover of [[Ariel Rivera]]'s "Sana Kahit Minsan". In 2005, the band released "Chiksilog" as part of the Ragnarok MMORPG compilation album ''Rok On!''.

===''Maharot'' and mainstream success===
In 2006, they released their second album, "''Maharot''". The carrier single of the album was "Narda", which is about the fictional Filipina super hero [[Darna]]. "Narda" was a popular hit in 2006, and gained constant radio airplay in the same year, eventually becoming the band's signature song. The song was inspired by [[GMA Network]]'s 2005 primetime show ''[[Darna (2005 TV series)|Darna]]'' which starred [[Angel Locsin]]. Later in 2009, it was used for [[GMA Network]]'s primetime show ''[[Darna (2009 TV series)|Darna]]'' with [[Marian Rivera]] playing the title role. The band also borrowed from other genres of music in composing their songs for the album, as evidenced by the metal-inspired sound of the tracks "Sobrang Init" and "KKK", the pop-punk styling of the songs "Director's Cut" and "Martyr Nyebera" (spoof or pun name of balladeer [[Martin Nievera]]) and the reggae-sounding feel of "Petix". ''Maharot'' was recognized for its sound, and further propelled the band to mainstream success.

The band maintains close ties with another popular Filipino band, [[Parokya ni Edgar]] (PNE). PNE frontman [[Chito Miranda]] met the band members in college. In concert events with both bands on the bill, one band's singer would occasionally jam with the other band. During Parokya ni Edgar's live sessions, Contreras frequently joined Miranda in performing songs such as "Okatokat", "Chikinini" and "The Yes Yes Show." In 2005, Contreras provided back-up vocals for PNE's hit song "The Order Taker" while co-member Linao provided lead guitar. In turn, [[Kaye Abad]], Miranda's then-girlfriend, provided back-up vocals for Kamikazee's song "Martyr Nyebera". Contreras later married Kaye Abad's sister, Sarah, on February 12, 2009 at Paco Park.

In December 2008 when Kamikazee was set to perform at the Dubai Festival City in [[Dubai, United Arab Emirates]] as part of an international tour, guitarist Led Tuyay was arrested at the airport upon their arrival after a [[cannabis]] residue was found in his luggage. Tuyay was detained and deported back to Manila in January 2009.<ref>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/led-zeppelin-remains-jailed-in-dubai 'Led Zeppelin' remains jailed in Dubai - ''The National UAE''.]</ref><ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/146407/showbiz/kamikazee-lead-guitarist-deported-from-uae ‘Kamikazee’ lead guitarist deported from UAE - ''GMA News Online''.]</ref>

===''Long Time Noisy'' and ''Romantico''===
Kamikazee's 3rd Album "''[[Long Time Noisy]]''" took the band three years to put together as the band balanced out their tough schedules. The album was recorded at Tower of Doom Studios with producer Eric Perlas. "Unang Tikim," one of the album's singles, was used in the TV Ad of [[RC Cola]] in 2011. The album's writing style and music retained elements from their previous work, mainly in song structure and subject matter such as everyday life, drug use, and personal experiences.

Kamikazee's fourth & recent album,  "''[[Romantico (Kamikazee album)|Romantico]]''" was released after being in production for 3 years.  The album contained the singles "Halik" & "Huling Sayaw" with RNB singer [[Kyla (Filipino singer)|Kyla]] on guest vocals. "Romantico" was well-received, despite minor criticism from some fans regarding the change of musical style in the album.

===15th anniversary and indefinite hiatus===
The band announced on January 25, 2015 that they would disband at the end of the year to pursue individual interests, although clarified that it was not a break up but merely a hiatus on band activities. The band told fans that they would surely see the band again in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/81897-kamikazee-band-announce-break-up |title=Kamikazee to break up after 2015 |date=January 25, 2015 |website=[[Rappler]] |access-date=January 25, 2014}}</ref>

In August 2015 after a brief hiatus, the band performed a series of live performances dubbed as "Kamikazee XV" which marks their 15th anniversary in the [[Music of the Philippines|OPM industry]]. Kamikazee held their last gig at the 12 Monkeys Music Hall & Pub in [[Makati]] as part of the "Kamikazee XV" concert series entitled ''Kamikazee Huling Sayaw'' (translated to Kamikazee The Last Dance) with [[Parokya ni Edgar]]'s [[Chito Miranda]] as special guest. The band announced that they will formally enter into hiatus starting 2016.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/09/29/15/look-chito-jay-share-emotional-moment-during-gig LOOK: Chito, Jay share emotional moment during gig - ''ABS-CBN News''.]</ref> Their ''Huling Sayaw'' farewell concert was held at [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on December 10 which features other local bands and most notably singer [[Kyla (Filipino singer)|Kyla]].<ref name="Rappler" />
