In a 2016 interview with [[Consequence of Sound]], Ó Cíosóig explained how the musical composition differed from his and Hope's other bands, "It’s not that our other bands have restrictions, but there's a certain sound in those bands. Hope and I have a sound, but it's always changing and morphing into different things while still carrying a similar thread."<ref>{{cite web|title=COS review|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/11/album-review-hope-sandoval-and-the-warm-inventions-until-the-hunter/|website=Consequence of Sound}}</ref>
