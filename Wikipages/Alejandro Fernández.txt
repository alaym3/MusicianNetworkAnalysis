''"Romanticism is something that will never die"'', declared Alejandro Fernández, explaining his choice of songs on ''A Corazón Abierto'', his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. ''"I'm super, ultra passionate. We're releasing an album that's an x-ray of myself. That's why it's titled "A Corazón Abierto" ("In Open Heart"). It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that"''. The album released the singles: "¿Que voy a hacer con mi amor?", "Qué lastima", "Me dediqué a perderte" and the smash hit "Canta corazón".<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
