On tour in 2019, Mitski began incorporating choreography into her live performances inspired by [[Butoh]], a form of dance theater developed in post-war Japan, in which "performers draw on chaotic internal emotions but depict them with precise, repetitive gestures." The approach reflected her wish to "give audiences something new" on her second headlining tour since ''Be the Cowboy''<nowiki/>'s release, as well as a desire "to develop her own, idiosyncratic ways of maintaining a grip on an audience," since she'd learned "that the jumping around onstage, getting everyone pumped up, doesn’t come naturally to me."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Talbot |first1=Margaret |title=On the Road with Mitski |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/on-the-road-with-mitski |access-date=31 August 2020 |work=The New Yorker |issue=July 8 & 15, 2019 |date=8 July 2019 |ref=mitskinewyorker |archive-date=July 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703121841/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/on-the-road-with-mitski |url-status=live }}</ref> Mitski worked with performance artist Monica Mirabile to devise the tour's "highly stylized, sometimes unsettling" movements.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Horn |first1=Olivia |title=Mitski Shows Off Her Moves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html |access-date=31 August 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=20 August 2020 |ref=mitskinytimes |archive-date=August 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827222444/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Austin City Limits |title=Mitski on Austin City Limits "Happy" |url=https://vimeo.com/383851196 |website=Vimeo |date=January 9, 2020 |access-date=31 August 2020 |ref=mitskiACL |archive-date=October 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030035621/https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198177684781 |url-status=live }}</ref> Butoh influenced choreography was also used in her music video for “Working for the Knife”.<ref>{{Citation|title=Mitski – Working for the Knife (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYbXt4_r9Pw|language=en|access-date=2021-11-08}}</ref>

===2020–present: ''This Is Where We Fall'' and ''Laurel Hell''===
On October 29, 2020, it was announced that Mitski will provide the soundtrack to the graphic novel ''This Is Where We Fall''. The [[space western|sci-fi western]] story written by Chris Miskiewicz and Vincent Kings "unpacks themes of theology, death, and the after-life". Of the project, Mitski said "It was exciting to make a soundtrack for a comic book, It allowed me to work outside of my usual songwriting form and try to approach it like a score, but without any of the cues that come with working alongside a moving image, which ended up being both freeing and challenging. I hope the end result helps to immerse you in the story!"<ref>{{cite web|last=Droke|first=Carolyn|date=October 27, 2020|title=Mitski Is Recording A Soundtrack To An Upcoming Graphic Novel|url=https://uproxx.com/indie/mitski-graphic-novel-soundtrack-this-is-where-we-fall/|website=Uproxx|accessdate=March 5, 2021}}</ref> A [[country music|country]] song called "The Baddy Man" was released as the first preview from the soundtrack on March 5, 2021. Z2 Comics released the album on [[Cassette tape|cassette]] with the standard hardcover novel on May 5, 2021. A limited edition deluxe vinyl was also released.

==Personal life==
