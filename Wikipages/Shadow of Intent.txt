The band's name is a reference to a ship in the Halo series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Halo Wiki Shadow of Intent |url=https://www.halopedia.org/Shadow_of_Intent |website=Halopedia |accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref> They are not signed to a label and have released their albums independently. They have released three studio albums to date, along with two [[instrumental]] versions of previous releases. Their fourth studio album entitled "Elegy" is set to release independently on January 14th, 2022.

== History ==
===Formation (2013)===
Shadow of Intent was formed in 2013 in [[Connecticut]] by vocalist Ben Duerr and guitarist Chris Wiseman. They met playing in separate bands at a local concert. The group was initially formed as a [[studio band|studio project]]. They were inspired by [[Halo (franchise)|Halo]] and the name "Shadow of Intent" came from a ship in the game series bearing the same name. Duerr describes himself as a Halo nerd and stated that their music follows the storyline of the Halo novels.

=== ''Inferi Sententia'' and ''Primordial'' (2014–2016) ===
The group released their EP ''Inferi Sententia'' on July 18, 2014 and debut album ''Primordial'' on January 10, 2016. The tracks on both albums were produced via homemade recordings. All of the tracks on ''Inferi Sententia'' were re-recorded and featured on ''Primordial''. The drum tracks are programmed on both releases. Keyboard and orchestral [[Sampling (music)|samples]] are also present on these releases.

Duerr was responsible solely for writing and performing the lead vocals during the production process while Wiseman was responsible for all of the remaining songwriting.

=== New Members, ''Reclaimer'', and ''The Instrumentals'' (2016–2017) ===
On September 19, 2016 they announced the addition of Matt Kohanowski on drums, marking the end of the group's time as a two-man project. On March 31, 2017 they announced the addition of new members Federico Zuccarelli on guitar and Keith Kohlhepp on bass. This brought the total members of the group to five.

On April 28, 2017 Shadow of Intent released ''Reclaimer'', their first album without programmed drum tracks and the first album to feature a unique player on each instrument. It reached #4 on the iTunes metal chart at debut. It was described by ''MetalSucks'' as "nothing short of a triumph of symphonic deathcore".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boozeman |first1=Phil |title=Video Premiere: Shadow of Intent, "Barren and Breathless Macrocosm" (ft.

The band released ''The Instrumentals'' on October 20, 2017. The album contained instrumental versions of all of the songs from both of the preceding albums.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kendrick |first1=Monica |title=Deathcore Wizards Shadow of Intent Shred With or Without Vocals |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/deathcore-wizards-shadow-of-intent-shred-with-or-without-vocals/Content?oid=76967698 |website=Reader |date=January 10, 2020 |publisher=Chicago Reader |accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref> 

===''Melancholy'' and ''Elegy'' (2018–Present) ===

In December 2017, Shadow of Intent began touring with their now four-man lineup. They played their first live shows at the Webster Theater in Hartford CT<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/shadow-of-intent/2017/webster-theater-hartford-ct-4be07f56.html|title = Shadow of Intent Setlist at Webster Theater, Hartford|website = setlist.fm}}</ref> and at the Gramercy Theater in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/shadow-of-intent/2017/the-gramercy-theatre-new-york-ny-7be1828c.html|title=Shadow of Intent Setlist at the Gramercy Theatre, New York|website=setlist.fm}}</ref>

On March 30, 2018, they released their first single 'Underneath a Sullen Moon'. This was the first track which was not Halo-themed and their second released track which did not begin with the word 'The.' The band went on their first major tour in the Spring of 2018 supporting Carnifex on their Chaos & Carnage tour headliner. Oceano, Winds of Plague, Archspire, Spite, Widowmaker and Buried Above Ground accompanied Shadow of Intent on this tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/carnifex-oceano-and-winds-of-plague-join-forces-for-chaos-and-carnage-tour/|title = CARNIFEX, OCEANO and WINDS OF PLAGUE Join Forces for 'Chaos and Carnage' Tour|date = January 29, 2018}}</ref> In the Summer of 2018, the band toured alongside Whitechapel, The Black Dahlia Murder, Fleshgod Apocalypse, and Aversions Crown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalblade.com/us/news/the-black-dahlia-murder-and-whitechapel-to-co-headline-usa-tour/|title=The Black Dahlia Murder and Whitechapel to co-headline USA tour with Fleshgod Apocalypse, Aversions Crown, Shadow of Intent &#124; Metal Blade Records}}</ref> 

On December 14, 2018, the group announced that Anthony Barone would be joining the group as their drummer.

On August 16, 2019 Shadow of Intent released ''Melancholy'' which included a remastered version of the aforementioned single as one of the tracks on the album. Francesco Ferrini of Fleshgod Apocalypse contributed to the orchestral work on this album. ''Melancholy'' has been described as a concept album depicting mass suicides orchestrated by a demonic goddess.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boozeman |first1=Phil |title=Album Review: Shadow of Intent's Melancholy Achieves Perfection in Death |url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/08/09/album-review-shadow-of-intents-melancholy-achieves-perfection-in-death/ |website=MetalSucks |date=August 9, 2019 |publisher=MetalSucks |accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref> This album marked a departure from writing strictly Halo-themed music. An instrumental version of ''Melancholy'' was also released on November 22, 2019.

In the Winter of 2020, the band performed on their first major headlining tour throughout the United States accompanied by Inferi, Signs of the Swarm, and Brand of Sacrifice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalcastle.net/shadow-of-intent-are-pleased-to-announce-2020-north-american-tour-dates/|title = Shadow of Intent are Pleased to Announce 2020 North American Tour Dates|date = November 23, 2019}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==

Shadow of Intent's symphonic style has been compared to [[Fleshgod Apocalypse]], Ovid's Withering, and [[Dimmu Borgir]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boozeman |first1=Phil |title=The New Shadow of Intent Album Will Sexually Excite You |url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2017/05/03/the-new-shadow-of-intent-album-will-sexually-excite-you/?fbclid=IwAR2kXaI9Lv0JRIrQbzvupaj1d4CbPvfzQc0rbJI_fd4STgpBqm5LRYXx3Gk |website=MetalSucks |date=May 3, 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref> Their stylistic development has been described as incorporating [[blackened death metal]] and [[progressive metal]] elements in their ''Melancholy'' release.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Welsh |first1=Connor |title=REVIEW: SHADOW OF INTENT – MELANCHOLY [2019] |url=http://new-transcendence.com/review-shadow-intent-melancholy-2019/?fbclid=IwAR3P0wWRohniSfHKDz5ONAh4N1GPCdHej9ipUSTtk0IrgbMWf0gsPJdWrRY |website=New Transcendence |date=August 7, 2019 |accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref> The group has demonstrated a penchant for instrumentals, not only releasing instrumental versions of all of their albums, but also including at least one instrumental track on nearly every album release (The Aftermath in Jat-Krula track from Primordial features a minor vocal part despite being mostly instrumental).
