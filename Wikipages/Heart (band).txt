'''Heart''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1967 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as The Army. Two years later, they changed their name to Hocus Pocus, then they changed their name again to White Heart a year later, and eventually changed the name a final time to Heart in 1973. By the mid-1970s, original members [[Roger Fisher (guitarist)|Roger Fisher]] (guitar) and Steve Fossen (bass guitar) had been joined by sisters [[Ann Wilson]] (lead vocals and flute) and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]] (rhythm guitar, backing and occasional lead vocals), Michael Derosier (drums), and Howard Leese (guitar and keyboards) to form the lineup for the band's initial mid- to late-1970s success period.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |author=Sam Carlson |url=http://pnwbands.com/heart.html |title=Heart, 50s, 60s & 70s Rock Bands of the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Pnwbands.com |date=March 13, 2011 |access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>  These core members were included in the band's 2013 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/heart-on-their-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-induction-we-werent-sure-it-was-real-97862/|title=Heart on Their Hall of Fame Induction: 'We Weren't Sure It Was Real'|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

They frequently played [[Bothell High School]], [[Inglemoor High School]], and [[Shorecrest High School]], as well as many taverns and club venues. In 1969, the band went through line-up changes (Gary Ziegelman—former lead singer of Buffalo Clancy—on lead vocals, Roger on guitar, Steve on bass, James Cirrello on guitar, Ron Rudge on drums, and Ken Hansen on percussion) and took on a new name, Hocus Pocus.<ref name=Sfossen /> The name White Heart came from a discussion Roger Fisher's brother Mike Fisher had with Michael Munro, who had come up with the name White Hart (without the "e", a reference to [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[Tales from the White Hart]]'') for a band with Toby Cyr on lead guitar. Fisher asked and received permission to use the name for the Army, added the "e", and the Army became White Heart. For a brief time in 1970, this line-up shortened its name to Heart and dropped "White". Founding member Roger Fisher's birthday is [[Valentine's Day]] (and the band would release their debut album in the US on that day, as well).  The band subsequently went through more personnel changes. In 1971, White Heart consisted of Steve Fossen, Roger Fisher, David Belzer (keys), and Jeff Johnson (drums).<ref name="auto1"/> The band eventually stuck to the name Heart, which has been their name since 1973.

Mike Fisher, Roger's brother, was set to be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the army. Nancy Wilson has stated that when he did not report for duty, his home was raided, he slipped out a rear window, escaped to Canada, and became a [[Vietnam War]] "[[Draft evasion|draft dodger]]".<ref name=believer07>Kelly, Maura.

In 1977, Mushroom Records ran a full-page advertisement showing the bare-shouldered Wilson sisters (as on the ''Dreamboat Annie'' album cover) with the suggestive caption, "It was only our first time!"<ref name="Brown2008"/> In an interview that appeared in the July 28, 1977 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the sisters cited this advertisement as a key reason for their decision to leave Mushroom Records.
