=== 2021: ''Instead of Dreaming'' and ''The Path of the Clouds'' ===
In February 2021, she released the single "Sleepwalk & Lonely People", and in May 2021 the compilation album ''Instead of Dreaming''. 

Nadler released her ninth solo album, ''The Path of the Clouds'' on October 29, 2021.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2021-10-29|title=Marissa Nadler – 'The Path of the Clouds' review: a haunting sonic departure|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/marissa-nadler-the-path-of-the-clouds-review-3082620|access-date=2021-11-15|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref> ''NME'' gave the album a positive review, writing, "This is a departure for Nadler in a number of ways, with more sophisticated production, unusual storytelling, and a firm look ahead to her future as an artist (more piano, more power vocally)."<ref name=":1" /> ''Pitchfork'' awarded the album a score of 7.5, comparing the album favourably to the true crime genre that inspired it: "The thrills of ''The Path of the Clouds'' are far richer than most true crime fiction, but like the best examples of the genre, it leaves you breathless."
