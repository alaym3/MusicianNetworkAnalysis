==History==
In 1990, Sam Coomes, Janet Weiss, and Brad Pedinov formed the band Motorgoat. The band released two self-released cassettes and one 7" single before dissolving in 1993. Coomes and Weiss then began recording as a [[duet (music)|duo]] in 1993 under the name Quasi. They played with various additional musicians in early live appearances, but eventually settled on playing live as a duo as well. They self-recorded and self-released a [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and a [[CD]] in 1993. They recorded ''[[R&B Transmogrification]]'' in the Portland band [[Pond (American band)|Pond's]] basement recording studio and released it on [[Up Records]] in 1997. They released two more albums with Up: ''[[Featuring "Birds"]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Field Studies (album)|Field Studies]]'' in 1999; both albums were recorded at Jackpot! Studios in [[Portland, Oregon]].

In 1998 and 1999, they toured the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan opening for and serving as the backup band for [[Elliott Smith]] (with whom [[Sam Coomes|Coomes]] had played in [[Heatmiser]]) as well as touring on their own in the U.S. and Europe.  In 2001, they home-recorded ''[[The Sword of God (album)|The Sword of God]]'' and released it on [[Touch and Go Records|Touch & Go]]. They released ''[[Hot Shit!]]'' in 2003 and ''[[When the Going Gets Dark]]'' in 2006, both on Touch & Go in the U.S. and [[Domino Recording Company]] in Europe. In 2009, the band signed with [[Kill Rock Stars]] to release their next record.

Although Coomes and Weiss remain busy with other bands, Quasi tours fairly regularly. In 2007, they toured the U.S. with Touch & Go labelmates [[Ted Leo and the Pharmacists]]. Just prior to that tour, Quasi announced that bassist Joanna Bolme, who had toured with Quasi in 2006 and plays with Weiss in [[Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks]], was a permanent member of the band.<ref name=BolmeJoins /> Bolme performed on Quasi's 2010 full-length ''[[American Gong]]'' and continued to tour with them through the first half of 2011. In June 2011, Quasi posted an update on their official Facebook page, announcing that they would be returning to their original two-piece lineup for "the foreseeable future" and thanking Bolme for her time with the band.<ref name=BolmeLeaves />

In addition to her work in the Jicks, Weiss was the primary drummer for the group [[Sleater-Kinney]], and has recently played with [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and [[Wild Flag]], while Coomes has been working with Pink Mountain and on his solo project, Blues Goblins.  He has also played with [[Jandek]], and has appeared on several [[Built to Spill]] albums.

The group seemed to have reactivated in 2020 with one-off releases via Bandcamp.
