'''Loose Ends''' are a British [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] band that had several [[hit record]]s throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. The [[trio (music)|trio]] was formed in London in 1980, initially comprising vocalist and guitarist Carl McIntosh, vocalist Jane Eugene, and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] player, Steve Nichol.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|last1=Wynn|first1=Ron|title=Artist Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/loose-ends-mn0000827760/biography|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=8 November 2020}}</ref> The latter two left the group in 1989, bringing an end to the band's most successful phase.

==Career==
Loose End signed with [[Virgin Records]] in 1981 under the name 'Loose End'.<ref name="soul">{{cite web|title=Loose Ends Page |url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Loose%20Ends.html|website=Soulwalking.co.uk|accessdate=8 November 2020}}</ref> Some of their debut material was written for them by [[Chris Amoo]] and [[Eddie Amoo]], who had achieved [[UK Singles Chart]] success of their own in the 1970s, with their group [[The Real Thing (soul group)|The Real Thing]].<ref name="soul"/> The trio changed its name to Loose Ends in 1983 and continued to record for Virgin. They were distributed in the United States by [[MCA Records]].<ref name="soul"/>

The group was founded by Steve Nichol after he left the London [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. Nichol went on to tour with [[The Jam]] in 1982 as a trumpet, trombone and keyboard player. Together the trio achieved their first success with "[[Hangin' on a String (Contemplating)]]" in 1985, which reached No. 13 in the UK [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

At this time, Carl McIntosh also arranged and played on a number of tracks from [[Five Star]]'s debut album including the single "[[Let Me Be The One (Five Star song)|Let Me Be The One]]" which reached number two in the same listings later in 1986. Subsequent falling sales saw the threesome notch up their final [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] hit in 1988 with "Watching You (Watching Me)."

The group's line-up changed in 1990<ref name="Allmusic"/> due to differences in its proposed musical direction. Eugene and Nichol decided to leave, and were replaced by Linda Carriere and Sunay Suleyman. ''[[Look How Long]]''<ref name="Allmusic"/> turned out to be the final studio album released under the Loose Ends name, and featured their final hit single, "[[Don't Be a Fool]]" (1990).<ref name="soul"/> McIntosh himself went on to work behind the recording desk with the new members and has continued to do that to date. He has since produced several artists' work, most notably that of [[Caron Wheeler]], Ruth Joy and Kwesi.<ref name="Allmusic"/>

==Today==
During 2015, Carl was interviewed by Daniel Falconer of the celebrity Female magazine, '''Female First''' to speak about his top 10 career moments.<ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Falconer |url=https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/features/loose-ends-carl-mcintosh-top-career-moments-894077.html |title=Carl McIntosh talks about his top 10 career moments| publisher = Female First | accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Also in the same year he participated in a charity fundraising event in Glasgow, Scotland in aid of supporting Gambia.<ref>{{cite news|first=Victoria |last=Brenan |url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/13306228.singer-supports-glasgow-fundraisers/ |title=Singer supports Glasgow fundraisers| publisher = The Glasgow Evening Times Newspaper | accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> In 2016, leading Toronto newspaper [[Now_(newspaper)|Now]] interviewed Loose Ends, Carl Mcintosh on how he was seen as being responsible for introduced Toronto to UK soul music in the 80s and 90s.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ruyan |last=Patrick |url=https://nowtoronto.com/how-loose-ends-introduced-toronto-to-uk-soul-in-the-80s-and-90s |title=How Loose Ends introduced Toronto to UK soul music in the 80s and 90s| publisher = Now Toronto Newspaper | accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref> In 2017 Carl McIntosh was asked by [[Red Bull Music Academy]] Melbourne, Australia to speak on how he previously produced Loose Ends songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/carl-mcintosh-tying-up-some-loose-ends/|title=Tying Up Some Loose Ends with Carl McIntosh, Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao| language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref> During 2020, former [[BBC Radio 1]] and now [[Smooth Radio (2014)|Smooth Radio]] presenter [[Angie Greaves]] interviewed Loose Ends, Carl Mcintosh on how he continued with Loose Ends without the former members explaining how the group did not break up when two members left <ref>{{cite news|first=Angie |last=Greaves |url=https://angiegreaves.com/win-tickets-carl-mcintosh-loose-ends-gwen-dickey-sos-band/ |title=Angie Speaks to Carl McIntosh| publisher = Angie Greaves | accessdate=21 November 2020}}</ref>

Soon after Carl McIntosh was asked by [[Roland Corporation]] music to discuss and demonstrate how he produced the drum programming using the legendary [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine for the hit song [[Hangin' on a String (Contemplating)]].
