He compared the situation to Kiss, noting how the visuals and music are part of one whole.<ref name="RadioRock2"/>

On his twentieth birthday, Valo created the [[HIM (Finnish band)#Image|heartagram]], which would eventually become the symbol for HIM.<ref name="Wiki"/> A combination of a heart and a [[pentagram]], it is meant to represent the juxtaposition of "the soft and the hard, the male and the female, the [[yin and yang|yin and the yang]]". Musically, the heart is represents the softer side of HIM, while the pentagram conveys the heavier elements of its sound.<ref name="SheerHeart">{{cite magazine |last=Wilding |first=Philip |date=April 2013 |title=Sheer Heartagram |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/him-ville-valo-heartagram-interview |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] presents: HIM - Tears On Tape (Official Fanpack Magazine) |pages=75{{ndash}}77 |publisher=Future plc |location=London, England |access-date=8 September 2021 |via=Louder}}</ref> Valo has called the heartagram his greatest creation.<ref name="Wiki"/> He noted in 2013: "There are a lot of people who have heartagram tattoos now. [[Kat Von D]] has one, [[Steve-O]] has a dickagram, which is like a heartagram but ends with a dick. It's started to have a life of its own: there are a lot of people who have them who don't actually know what it was, don't relate it to the band, and in that sense, I consider that to be my greatest achievement. So it'll be nice to have it on my tombstone. And it'll be nice to see where it's going to go next."<ref name="SheerHeart"/>
