'''Avantasia''' is a German [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[rock opera|metal opera]] project created by [[Tobias Sammet]], vocalist of the band [[Edguy]]. It has been characterized as a rock opera, as it features the contributions of various vocalists and musicians and it consists of concept albums.

Conceived in 1999 as studio-only, two-album project,<ref name="facefacts">{{cite web |title=THE METAL OPERA - album facts |url=https://www.facebook.com/avantasia/posts/255984195886577 |website=Avantasia's official page |publisher=[[Facebook]] |access-date=27 February 2021 |date=22 January 2021}}</ref> Avantasia has since released six other studio albums and has toured the world multiple times. It can be divided into four periods of activity. The first, 1999–2002, saw the release of a self-titled single and the full-length albums ''[[The Metal Opera]]'' and ''[[The Metal Opera Part II]]''. The second, 2006–2011, consists of the EPs ''[[Lost in Space Part I & II]]'' and The Wicked Trilogy, composed of the albums ''[[The Scarecrow (album)|The Scarecrow]]'', ''[[The Wicked Symphony]]'' and ''[[Angel of Babylon]]''. The third, 2013–2016, includes the albums ''[[The Mystery of Time]]'' and ''[[Ghostlights]]''. The fourth period began with the release of the ''[[Moonglow (album)|Moonglow]]'' album in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Avantasia/2787/ |title=Avantasia reviews, music, news |publisher=sputnikmusic |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref>

==History==
===The Metal Operas (1999–2002)===
In Spring 1999, during  Edguy's 'Theater of Salvation' tour, [[Tobias Sammet]] began to outline his ideas for a [[rock opera|metal opera]] [[concept album]] featuring a number of guest musicians. When the tour finished, he began collaborating with metal vocalists like [[Michael Kiske]], [[Andre Matos]], [[Kai Hansen]], [[Rob Rock]], [[David Defeis]], [[Sharon den Adel]], [[Bob Catley]] and [[Oliver Hartmann]] to record the project. At this stage the core band consisted of four members, Sammet on keyboards, [[Henjo Richter]] on guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass and Alex Holzwarth on drums. In 2001, a [[Avantasia (single)|self-titled single]] and the first full-length album, ''[[The Metal Opera]]'', were released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/review.php?revid=84 |title=Avantasia - The Metal Opera Review |publisher=The Metal Crypt |date=2001-07-16 |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref> The project went on hiatus after the release of ''[[The Metal Opera Part II]]'' in September 2002.

===The Wicked Trilogy (2006–2011)===
At the end of 2006, Sammet confirmed the rumours of a third Avantasia album, due for release in 2008. Two [[Extended play|EP]]s named ''[[Lost in Space Part I]]'' and ''[[Lost in Space Part II|Part II]]'' were released on 19 November 2007, while the full-length album, ''[[The Scarecrow (album)|The Scarecrow]]'', was released on 25 January 2008. ''The Scarecrow'' marked the first chapter of "[[The Scarecrow (story)|The Wicked Trilogy]]" concept and was also the first of many Avantasia releases to feature [[Sascha Paeth]] on the role of main guitarist and producer.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://new-transcendence.com/interview-tobias-sammet-edguy/|title = Interview: Tobias Sammet from Edguy|date = 31 March 2014|website = new-transcendence.com/|last = Sinister|first = Barely}}</ref> The album included guest performances by drummer [[Eric Singer]], guitarists [[Henjo Richter]] and [[Rudolf Schenker]] and singers [[Jørn Lande]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Bob Catley]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Roy Khan]], [[Amanda Somerville]] and [[Oliver Hartmann]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Avantasia-The-Scarecrow/release/1814993 Listing] of ''The Scarecrow'' album on Discogs.com, (accessed 16 March 2015).</ref>

After the release of ''The Scarecrow'', Tobias Sammet was invited to perform a headlining show at [[Wacken Open Air]], an offer that producer/guitarist Sascha Paeth convinced him to accept. That led to 13 shows between 5 July and 13 August. The shows at [[Masters of Rock (festival)|Masters of Rock]] and [[Wacken Open Air]] were recorded and the live [[DVD]] [[The Flying Opera]], based on the [[footage]], was released in March 2011. The line-up for the short tour consisted of Tobias Sammet, Andre Matos, Jørn Lande, Kai Hansen, Bob Catley, Amanda Somerville, Cloudy Yang, Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Robert Hunecke, Miro and [[Felix Bohnke]] (Edguy).

[[File:Avantasia 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Avantasia live in [[Stockholm]] (Sweden) in 2010]]
In November 2009, Sammet announced that he was recording two new albums, ''[[The Wicked Symphony]]'' and ''[[Angel of Babylon]]'', to be released on 3 April 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130495 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - AVANTASIA: New Album Titles Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=2009-11-19 |access-date=2011-09-02}}</ref> The concept of the albums was a continuation of The Scarecrow story and these three albums together are often referred to as "The Wicked Trilogy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=322686963566 |title=Avantasia Book - The Wicked Trilogy |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref> The special guests included drummers [[Eric Singer]], [[Alex Holzwarth]] and [[Felix Bohnke]], guitarists [[Bruce Kulick]] and [[Oliver Hartmann]], keyboardist [[Jens Johansson]] and vocalists [[Jørn Lande]], [[Russell Allen]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Bob Catley]], [[Klaus Meine]], [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]], [[Jon Oliva]], [[Andre Matos]], Cloudy Yang and Ralf Zdiarstek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1252800484&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2& |title=Avantasia :: Official Web |publisher=Tobias Sammet |date=2009-09-12 |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref> ''The Scarecrow'', ''The Wicked Symphony'' and ''Angel of Babylon'' have scored high positions in various international music charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/biography.php |title=Avantasia :: Official Web |publisher=Tobias Sammet |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref>

A 12 show tour of Europe, South America and Asia took place during December 2010, with the exception of one concert at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in August 2011. The concerts lasted for almost three hours and many of them were sold out days before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/index.php?start_from=4&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=& |title=Avantasia :: Official Web |publisher=Tobias Sammet |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref> The ensemble was almost the same as on The Scarecrow Tour in 2008, with two changes. Andre Matos was replaced by ex-[[Helloween]] and current [[Unisonic (band)|Unisonic]] singer [[Michael Kiske]] (with [[Kai Hansen]] also participating on this tour, there were a lot of instances when the two ex-Helloween members shared the same stage) and the fact that Cloudy Yang was not part of the line-up.

Both tours were closely documented by [[Amanda Somerville]] on her [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|author=amandasomerville |url=https://www.youtube.com/amandasomerville |title=Channel of user amandasomerville |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-03-16 |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref> The videos show various interesting backstage moments such as rehearsals, cancelled flights, or the ensemble travelling by a regular train.

===''The Mystery of Time'' (2012–2014)===
[[File:Avantasia-live2013.jpg|thumb|left|Avantasia live in [[São Paulo]] (Brazil) in 2013]]
In August 2012, Sammet announced that "I didn‘t foresee how much I need Avantasia when I decided to finish this chapter of my life in 2011. After the worldwide success of the latest studio releases, an arena world tour that was sold out pretty much everywhere, collaborations with childhood heroes...I 'knew' that I had said everything I could possibly say in the name of Avantasia. But that's not what Avantasia is all about. I wanna create more great music, I wanna create more fantasy-worlds, the bigger and the more epic, the better. And listening to the material that I have created for this forthcoming chapter in the history of Avantasia, I know there is no way I am not going to do it! I have got the feeling and the certainty, that this is absolutely meant to happen and to be."<ref>{{cite web |author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/188136 |title=> News > AVANTASIA - New Epic In The Making |publisher=Bravewords.com |access-date=2013-09-26 |archive-date=27 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927102950/http://www.bravewords.com/news/188136 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During December 2012 it was revealed on Sammet's Avantasia website that the new album would be called ''[[The Mystery of Time]]'' and was due for release on 30 March 2013. ''The Mystery of Time'' marked the beginning of a new concept and was the first Avantasia release to feature the [[Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg|German Film Orchestra Babelsberg]]. The album included guest performances by drummer [[Russell Gilbrook]], guitarists [[Bruce Kulick]], [[Oliver Hartmann]] and [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen]], while the guest vocalists were [[Joe Lynn Turner]], [[Biff Byford]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Pretty Maids|Ronnie Atkins]], [[Eric Martin (musician)|Eric Martin]], [[Bob Catley]] and Cloudy Yang.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tobias Sammet :: Avantasia :: Official Web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/index.php|access-date=2012-08-08|date=2012-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musikreviews.de/artikel/Avantasia-The-Mystery-Of-Time-Listening-Session-62/ |title=Avantasia - The Mystery Of Time - Listening Session - Kolumne bei Musikreviews.de - Metal, Progressive und Rock |publisher=Musikreviews.de |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref> ''The Mystery Of Time'' scored high positions in several international music charts and even enabled the project to enter the US [[Top Heatseekers|Billboard]] charts for the very first time.<ref>{{cite web|author=EvilG |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2013/05/10/avantasia-the-mystery-of-time-debuts-at-9-on-billboard-heat-seekers-chart-33-on-hard-rock/ |title=Avantasia "The Mystery of Time" debuts at #9 on Billboard "Heat Seekers" chart, #33 on "Hard Rock" |publisher=Metal-rules.com |date=2013-05-10 |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref>

Avantasia's second biggest world tour took place between April and August 2013. The tour consisted of 30 concerts and included 7 headlining [[music festival|festival]] appearances in Europe, one festival performance in Canada and three hour long shows in South America, Japan, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Holland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/tour.php |title=Avantasia :: Official Web |publisher=Tobias Sammet |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powermetal.de/content/artikel/show-AVANTASIA__Interview_mit_Tobias_Sammet,7919-1.html |title=Artikel &#124; AVANTASIA: Interview mit Tobias Sammet |publisher=Powermetal.De |date=2013-02-13 |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref> The line-up for the tour consisted of vocalists Tobias Sammet, Michael Kiske, Ronnie Atkins, Eric Martin, Bob Catley, Thomas Rettke, Amanda Somerville and musicians Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Miro, Andre Neygenfind and Felix Bohnke.

[[File:Sammet & Kiske live 2013.jpg|thumb|Avantasia live in [[São Paulo]] (Brazil) in 2013]]
According to Sammet: "I wanna put on the biggest thing you have ever seen, I wanna bring more vocalists, play longer shows, and just make it a giant Rock Opera. I love to headline festivals, you run over people in 90 minutes and kick ass. But I also like to do our own Avantasia indoor tour because we can make it much more Avantasia oriented and play almost three hours...It will be huge."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/index.php?start_from=32&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=& |title=Avantasia :: Official Web |publisher=Tobias Sammet |access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref>

With two shows remaining at the end of the tour, Sammet held a press conference in which he announced that Avantasia would perform a headline performance at [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken Open Air Festival]] in 2014. He also indicated that this would be a farewell performance as no further Avantasia activities were planned for the near future:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/index.php|title=Avantasia to headline Wacken Open Air 2014}}</ref>

{{cquote|''There won't be any further Avantasia activities, it'll be just a single show. I may be back with an idea and go for it somewhere in the distant future, I won't say farewell is forever this time, but I have no clue as to when and where and who would be able to join us and what it would sound and look like, if we'd ever do this again in a couple of years. So, get your tickets for Wacken 2014 cause it'll be your last chance to catch us, if not forever at least for some years. See you, T''}}

===''Ghostlights'' (2014–2018)===
[[File:Avantasia2016.jpg|thumb|left|Avantasia live in [[Madrid]] (Spain) in 2016]]
In a May 2014 interview regarding Edguy's then latest release ''[[Space Police: Defenders of the Crown]]'', Sammet said that ''The Mystery of Time'' hinted at a possible sequel.<ref name=100%>{{cite web|first1=Shane|last1=Pinnegar|title=Interview – Tobias Sammet|url=http://magazine.100percentrock.com/interviews/201405/53400|work=100% Rock Magazine|access-date=21 May 2014|date=14 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521061951/http://magazine.100percentrock.com/interviews/201405/53400|archive-date=2014-05-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> 
The new album, entitled ''[[Ghostlights]]'', was released on 29 January 2016 and featured guest performances by guitarists [[Bruce Kulick]] and [[Oliver Hartmann]], while the guest vocalists were [[Jørn Lande]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Dee Snider]], [[Geoff Tate]], [[Marko Hietala]], [[Pretty Maids|Ronnie Atkins]], [[Sharon den Adel]], [[Bob Catley]], Robert Mason and Herbie Langhans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/4088681.71066.avantasia-more-details-on-raquo-ghostlights-laquo.html|title=AVANTASIA - more details on "Ghostlights"! - Nuclear Blast}}</ref> Ghostlights scored the highest positions of any Avantasia release in several international music charts and even enabled Avantasia to enter the US Billboard charts for the second time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/tobias-sammets-avantasia-enter-charts-in-17-countries-on-3-continents-with-ghostlights|title=Tobias Sammet's AVANTASIA Enter Charts In 17 Countries On 3 Continents With Ghostlights|work=bravewords.com}}</ref>

The "biggest world tour so far" took place between March and August 2016. According to Avantasia's website it consisted of approximately 40 concerts in Europe, North America, South America, Canada, Japan, Russia and Scandinavia. With the exclusion of 8 headlining European summer [[music festival|festival]] performances, each concert lasted for over three hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/tour.php|title=Tobias Sammet :: Avantasia :: Official Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/avantasia/photos/pcb.10153787137658889/10153787136608889/?type=3&theater|title=Avantasia - We want your review - see below!But first:... - Facebook}}</ref> The ensemble was almost the same as on the previous tour with the addition of Jørn Lande and Herbie Langhans. As he did after announcing the 2014 Wacken performance, Sammet once again suggested that the Ghostlights World Tour might be the project's last activity in a long time:<ref name="MSF">{{cite web|last1=Booth|first1=Alison|title=Interview With Tobias Sammet, Avantasia: "It's gonna be the last time in a very long time"|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2016/01/21/interview-with-tobias-sammet-avantasia-its-gonna-be-the-last-time-in-a-very-long-time/|website=Metal Shock Finland|access-date=7 February 2016|date=21 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="MGMM">{{cite web|last1=Schwarzkopf|first1=Thomas|title=Exclusive Interview with Tobias Sammet (Avantasia, Edguy)|url=http://myglobalmind.com/2016/01/27/exclusive-interview-with-tobias-sammet-avantasia-edguy/|website=Myglobalmind Magazine|access-date=7 February 2016|date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

After the completion of the tour, Avantasia headlined both Wacken Open Air and Barcelona Rockfest during the summer of  2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobiassammet.com/eng/|title=Tobias Sammet :: Avantasia :: Official Web}}</ref>

===''Moonglow'' (2018–present)===
In March 2018, Sammet posted a picture on his Facebook announcing he had begun the creative process regarding the eighth Avantasia album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/avantasia/photos/a.10151031238933889/10155810617093889/?type=3|title=Avantasia|website=Facebook.com}}</ref>

On 10 October Nuclear Blast officially announced the new album ''[[Moonglow (album)|Moonglow]]'' would be released on 15 February 2019, and would feature guest vocals by [[Jørn Lande]], [[Bob Catley]], [[Eric Martin (musician)|Eric Martin]], [[Pretty Maids|Ronnie Atkins]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Geoff Tate]], [[Candice Night]], [[Hansi Kürsch]] and [[Mille Petrozza]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/5632377.71066.avantasia-to-release-new-album-quot-moonglow-quot.html|title=AVANTASIA - to release new album "Moonglow"!|date=2018-10-12|work=Nuclear Blast|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Subsequently, the album was accompanied by the ''Moonglow World Tour'' ''2019'' consisting of 29 concerts across Europe, Australia, and the United States and South America taking place between March and June 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/5406894.71066.avantasia-moonglow-world-tour-2019.html|title=AVANTASIA - Germany's most successful symphonic rock event will be touring the world in 2019 with its new album MOONGLOW!|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref>
