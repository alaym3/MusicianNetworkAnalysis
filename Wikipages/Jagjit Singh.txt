'''Jagjit Singh''', born '''Jagmohan Singh Dhiman''' (8 February 1941&nbsp;– 10 October 2011), popularly known as '''"The Ghazal King"''' or '''"King of Ghazals"''', was an Indian composer, singer and musician. He composed and sang in numerous languages and is credited for the revival and popularity of ghazal, an Indian classical art form, by choosing poetry that was relevant to the masses and composing them in a way that laid more emphasis on the meaning of words and melody evoked by them. In terms of Indian Classical music, his style of composing and ''Gayaki'' (singing) is considered as ''Bol-pradhan'', one that lays emphasis on words. He highlighted this in his music for films such as ''[[Prem Geet]]'' (1981), ''[[Arth (film)|Arth]] (1982) ,'' and ''Saath Saath'' (1982), and TV serials ''[[Mirza Ghalib (TV series)|Mirza Ghalib]]'' (1988) and ''[[Kahkashan]]'' (1991). Singh is considered to be the most successful ghazal singer and composer of all time in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. With a career spanning five decades and many albums, the range and breadth of his work has been regarded as genre-defining.

Singh's 1987 album, ''Beyond Time'', was the first digitally recorded release in India.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mathur|first=Asharani|title=Beyond time : the ageless music of Jagjit Singh|year=2002|publisher=Habitat Arts|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8190156301|author2=Mathur, edited by AshaRani }}</ref> He was regarded as one of India's most influential artists. With sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] and other leading figures of [[Indian classical music]] and [[Indian literature|literature]], Singh voiced his concerns over politicisation of arts and culture in India and lack of support experienced by the practitioners of India's traditional art forms, particularly [[Indian folk music|folk]] artists and musicians. He lent active support to several philanthropic endeavours such as the library at [[St. Mary's School, Mumbai]], [[Bombay Hospital]], [[Child Rights and You|CRY]], [[Save the Children]] and ALMA.

Singh was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2003 and in February 2014, the government released a set of two postal stamps in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=PM Manmohan Singh releases Stamp to Honor Jagjit Singh|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/pm-manmohan-singh-releases-stamp-to-honor-jagjit-singh/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|access-date=8 February 2014}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
[[File:Shahid Kabir with Jagjit Singh and his son, Sameer Kabeer.jpg|thumb|Jagjit Singh (middle) with poet [[Shahid Kabir]] and his son, Sameer Kabeer]]
Jagjit Singh Dhiman was born at [[Sri Ganganagar]], [[Rajasthan]], India (then [[Bikaner State]]).<ref name=TOI20021110/> into a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Ramgarhia]] [[Sikh]] family. His father, Sardar Amar Singh Dhiman, was a surveyor with the government's Public Works' Department and hailed from village Dalla in [[Ropar district]] of [[Punjab]].

Educated initially at Khalsa High School and Government College in Sri Ganganagar, Singh obtained an arts degree from [[DAV College]], [[Jalandhar]].<ref name=Guardian20111025 /> There, he began his professional career in 1961 by undertaking singing and composing assignments at [[All India Radio]]'s (AIR) Jalandhar station.<ref name=TOI20021110/> Later, he studied to obtain a post-graduate degree in history from [[Kurukshetra University]] in [[Haryana]]. Throughout this time, and as a consequence of a natural talent that was spotted by his father, Singh learned music initially from a visually impaired master of Indian classical music, ''Pandit Chagan Lal Sharma'' and later from ''Ustad Jamal Khan'' of [[Maihar gharana]], who taught and trained him in all the prominent styles of [[Hindustani Classical]] vocal tradition such as [[Khayal]], [[Dhrupad]], [[Thumri]] and others. Throughout his teenage years, he performed on stage and composed music. Although his father, who was a government employee, had hoped that he would become an engineer,<ref name=Guardian20111025>{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=Jagjit Singh obituary |first=Asjad |last=Nazir |date=25 October 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/25/jagjit-singh-obituary |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> Singh pursued his passion for music relentlessly. Like all parents in Indian middle-class families, his father aspired for him to become a bureaucrat. However, he also encouraged Singh and his siblings to learn music.<ref name=TOI20021110>{{cite news |last=Sawhney |first=Anubha |title=Unforgettable moments with Jagjit Singh|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/27885263.cms|access-date=11 January 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=10 November 2002}}</ref>

In March 1965, and without the knowledge of his family,<ref name=Guardian20111025 /> Singh moved to [[Bombay]], where there were many opportunities for music artists because of the [[Hindi]] film industry. He obtained work initially as a singer of advertising jingles and later progressed to [[playback singing]].<ref name=Independent20111013>{{cite news |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |title=Jagjit Singh: Singer hailed as the maestro of Indian ghazal |date=13 October 2011 |first=Ken |last=Hunt |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jagjit-singh-singer-hailed-as-the-maestro-of-indian-ghazal-2369631.html |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>

==Achievement==
[[File:Lata Mangeshkar Jagjit Singh still2.jpg|thumb|left| Singh with [[Lata Mangeshkar]] at the audio release of Saadgi]]
Singh was still struggling to make a living in 1967 when he met the Bengali-born [[Chitra Singh|Chitra Dutta]].<ref name=Guardian20111025 /> She divorced her husband and married Singh in December 1969.<ref name=TOI20021110 /> Following the birth of their son, Vivek, the couple performed as a singing duo but it was not until the 1977 release of the album ''The Unforgettable'' that they found significant, and surprising, success. In the interval, the primary difficulty for them had been that the ghazal music genre was dominated by Muslim artists<ref name=Guardian20111025 /> and especially those from Pakistan.<ref name=BBC />

''The Unforgettable'', which was the couple's first [[LP album|LP]],<ref name=TOI20021110 /> was an unconventional recording and it turned them into stars. The song "Baat Niklegi" from the album achieved great popularity for the Singhs.<ref name="tele">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8820731/Jagjit-Singh.html | title=Jagjit Singh | work=The Telegraph | access-date=1 March 2012 | date=11 October 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' described it in 2011 as "ground-breaking&nbsp;... it became a transformative, before-and-after milestone in the history of Indian popular and ghazals music. It remains that." Using modern arrangements, it consists of ten tracks that include two on which they sang as a duo and the remainder equally split between Jagjit and Chitra singing the lead. ''The Independent'' further noted that "This format of solo and duet performances from the first commercially successful husband-and-wife team in Indian popular music proved astonishingly successful."<ref name=Independent20111013 /> Jagjit explained that "I was determined to polish up the genre and make it more acceptable to modern tastes, so chose simple poems and set them to simple tunes. I also introduced western instrumentation to make them livelier." Thereafter, the couple worked both on solo and joint musical projects and performed concerts worldwide. There was success from involvement with the film industry and they amassed considerable wealth,.<ref name=Guardian20111025 /><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Indian singer Jagjit Singh dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15236222|access-date=11 January 2012|publisher=BBC |date=10 October 2011}}</ref>

Among their subsequent duo recordings of the 1970s were ''[[Shiv Kumar Batalvi]]&nbsp;– Birha da Sultan'' (1978), ''Live in Concert at Wembley'' (1979) and ''Come Alive'' (1979). Of those released in the 1980s, "The Latest" by [[Sudarshan Faakir]] was the best selling album with his lifetime hit "Woh Kagaz ki Kashti...Woh Baarish ka Paani". It was the first album by the duo with poetry of only one Poet. ''Ecstasies'' (1984) has also been described as "one of their finest".<ref name=Independent20111013 /> The joint projects ceased in 1990 when their 20-year-old son, Vivek, died in a road accident. Chitra felt unable to sing following these events. Monica, Chitra's daughter from her first marriage, committed suicide in 2009.<ref name=Guardian20111025 /><ref name=Independent20111013 />

Although Jagjit continued to work and to have success after Chitra withdrew from public life he, too, was affected by the death of Vivek. ''[[The Guardian]]'' notes that he "suffered from deep depression and his anguish was often evident in his live performances." Aside from occupying himself with solo projects, which he performed in several languages,<ref name=BBC /> he collaborated with [[Lata Mangeshkar]] on an album titled ''[[Sajda]]'', an [[Urdu]] word meaning "prostration".<ref name=Guardian20111025 /><ref name=Independent20111013 />

Singh's work in film<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/world/9297270.Tributes_to_Jagjit_Singh/ | title=Tributes to Jagjit Singh | work=Asian Image | date=10 October 2011 | access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> encompassed playback singing for productions such as ''[[Arth (film)|Arth]]'', ''Saath Saath'' and ''[[Premgeet]]''. He composed all of the songs for the latter, as well as for the TV serial ''[[Mirza Ghalib (1988 TV series)|Mirza Ghalib]]'' that was based on the life of the eponymous poet, [[Ghalib|Mirza Ghalib]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

On 10 May 2007, in the presence of numerous political and diplomatic luminaries at an event held in the Central Hall of the [[Parliament of India]], Jagjit Singh rendered [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah Zafar's]] famous ghazal ''Lagta nahin hai dil mera'' to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Vyas|first=Neena|title=Small streams of protest swelled into national movement to regain freedom, says Kalam |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/05/11/stories/2007051106991200.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015120835/http://hindu.com/2007/05/11/stories/2007051106991200.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 October 2007 |access-date=11 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=11 May 2007}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1990, Vivek (Jagjit Singh and Chitra's son) died in a road accident at the age of 18. This came as a profound shock to Jagjit and Chitra Singh. They gave up music for a full year after the death. At the end of that period, Jagjit returned slowly to music, but Chitra announced her retirement and declared that she would not sing or record any more songs.

==Death==
Singh turned 70 in February 2011. To celebrate his 70th birthday he committed 70 concerts in different parts of the world. He toured the UK, Singapore, Mauritius, inter alias, in 2011 and was due to perform with [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]] in Mumbai<ref name=Guardian20111025 /> but suffered a [[brain haemorrhage]] on 23 September 2011. He was in coma for over two weeks and died on 10 October at [[Lilavati Hospital]], in Mumbai. He was cremated the following day at Chandanwadi Crematorium near Marine Lines in Mumbai.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9887412 | title=Jagjit Singh, famous Indian singer, dies at age 70 | work=The Guardian | access-date=1 March 2012 | date=23 January 2008}}</ref>
