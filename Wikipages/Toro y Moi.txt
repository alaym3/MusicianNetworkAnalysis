'''Chaz Bear''' (born '''Chazwick Bradley Bundick''' on November 7, 1986), known professionally as '''Toro y Moi''', is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and graphic designer. His music has taken on many forms since he began recording, but he is often identified with the rise of the [[chillwave]] movement in 2010 and 2011.<ref name="CoS2009">{{cite web |last=Kivel |first=Adam |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/04/album-review-toro-y-moi-june-2009/ |title=Album Review: Toro Y Moi – ''June 2009'' |publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=April 20, 2012 |access-date=August 14, 2012}}</ref> His stage name is a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] expression consisting of the Spanish words ''toro'' and ''y'' (meaning "bull" and "and", respectively) and the French word ''moi'' (meaning "me").<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Shaffer |first=Claire |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/blood-orange-toro-y-moi-dark-handsome-video-904575/ |title=Watch Blood Orange, Toro y Moi's Serene Video for 'Dark & Handsome'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |year=2019 |access-date=November 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Langham |first=Matt |url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/toro-y-moi-june-2009 |title=Toro Y Moi – June 2009 |website=[[musicOMH]] |year=2012 |access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref>

Bundick graduated from the [[University of South Carolina]] in spring of 2009 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[graphic design]].

==Career==
===2010: ''Causers of This''===
In mid-2009, Bear was signed to [[Carpark Records]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Breihan |first=Tom |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35870-news-in-brief-atmosphere-mt-st-helens-vietnam-band-toro-y-moi-jersey-live/ |title=News in Brief: Atmosphere, Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band, Toro y Moi, Jersey Live |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=July 13, 2009 |access-date=August 14, 2012}}</ref> on which he released his debut Toro y Moi full-length album ''[[Causers of This]]'' in January 2010. On ''Causers of This'', Bear experimented with sampling and production techniques using the [[digital audio workstation]] [[Reason (software)|Reason]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Shawn |last=Reynaldo |url=http://www.xlr8r.com/gear/2013/01/in-the-studio-toro-y-moi/ |title=In the Studio: Toro Y Moi |date=January 21, 2013 |publisher=XLR8R.com |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> The album garnered comparisons to the "chillwave" subgenre; however, Bear stated that he never classified his music as such. Bear refers to the album's subject matter as "personal," calling it a "break-up album."<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40809-toro-y-moi-talks-new-album-underneath-the-pine/ |title=Toro Y Moi Talks New Album, Underneath the Pine &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork.com |date=November 23, 2010 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> Tours supporting [[Ruby Suns]], [[Caribou (musician)|Caribou]], and [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]] followed the album's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20385-what-for/|title=Toro Y Moi: What For? : Album Review|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

===2011: ''Underneath the Pine'' and ''Freaking Out'' EP===
Bear's second album, ''[[Underneath the Pine]]'', was released on February 22, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dombal |first=Ryan |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40774-toro-y-moi-announces-sophomore-album/ |title=Toro Y Moi Announces Sophomore Album |publisher=Pitchfork |date=November 19, 2010 |access-date=August 14, 2012}}</ref> The album was recorded at Bear's home between tours while supporting ''Causers of This''. ''Underneath the Pine'' marked a stylistic departure from the previous album in that it was made up of all live instrumentation and contained no samples. Bear cites horror movie soundtracks, [[space disco]], and film composers [[Piero Umiliani]] and [[François de Roubaix]] as inspiration for the album's sound.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Further, Bear states that "...what influenced ''Underneath the Pine'' was finding stuff that I wanted to sample for ''Causers''. A lot of the things I sampled for ''Causers'' ended up being the main musical inspiration for ''Underneath the Pine.''"<ref>{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Sundermann |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/toro-y-moi/toro-y-moi-interview/56224/ |title=Toro Y Moi: 'I just constantly like to make stuff' : Interview &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=September 21, 2011 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with the website At the Sinema, he suggested that he had moved beyond the chillwave genre: "All that stuff is really good music, like Ernest Green (Washed Out) and Neon Indian. I'm a big fan of all of that, but I think [chillwave] was just a small little period where we all were, coincidentally."<ref>{{cite web |last=Katoch |first=Karan |url=http://atthesinema.co.uk/?p=3085 |title=An interview with Toro Y Moi |publisher=At the Sinema |date=December 5, 2010 |access-date=February 1, 2013}}</ref>

On September 13, 2011, Toro y Moi released an EP titled ''Freaking Out'', featuring a cover of "[[Saturday Love]]" by [[Cherrelle]] and [[Alexander O'Neal]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/43164-toro-y-moi-is-freaking-out-on-new-ep/ |title=Toro Y Moi Is ''Freaking Out'' on New EP |publisher=Pitchfork |date=July 13, 2011 |access-date=August 14, 2012}}</ref> The EP's sound was heavily influenced by 80's [[Boogie (genre)|Boogie]] and R&B.

The band was chosen by [[Caribou (musician)|Caribou]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP Nightmare Before Christmas]] festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/nightmare2011.php |title=On Sale Now!

===2012–2013: ''Anything in Return''===
In January 2013, Bear released his third Toro y Moi studio album, ''[[Anything in Return]]'', which he described as having a 90's dance and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound. According to him, the album was "influenced by lots of different types of [[house music|house]], from [[deep house]] to [[2-step garage|two-step]] [...] The chords ['Harm in Change' and 'Say That'] use—that's just something I've been a fan of for a while. I really wanted to mess around with those kinds of elements and revisit what I did on ''Causers of This'', but make those elements a little bit better and more apparent."<ref>{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/toro_y_moi-pop_redemption |title=Toro y Moi |work=[[Exclaim!]] |date=February 2013 |access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref> The album was called "highly indebted to the late sacrosanct hip-hop producer [[J Dilla]]" by the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=McIntire |first=George |url=http://www.sfbg.com/2013/02/26/just-chill |title=Just chill |work=[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |date=February 26, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2013}}</ref> Bear stated that he wanted to combine the electronic production of his first record with the elements of traditional instrumentation of his second album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/toro_y_moi-pop_redemption |title=Toro y Moi |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=February 8, 2013 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

===2014–2015: ''What For?'' and ''Samantha'' mixtape===
Bear released ''[[What For? (album)|What For?]]'', his fourth studio album as Toro y Moi, on April 7, 2015, on Carpark Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/58125-toro-y-moi-announces-new-album-what-for-shares-empty-nesters/ |title=Toro Y Moi Announces New Album What For?, Shares "Empty Nesters" &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork.com |date=January 19, 2015 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> The album marked a further departure in sound from previous releases with a guitar-based rock sound, drawing inspiration from artists such as Big Star, Talking Heads, Todd Rundgren, Tim Maia, and Cortex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2015/01/20/listen-toro-y-mois-new-disco-groovy-empty-nesters|title=Listen: Toro Y Moi's New Disco-Groovy "Empty Nesters"|first=Emma|last=Silvers|website=sfweekly.com|access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

Later that year, Bear released the hip hop influenced mixtape ''[[Samantha (album)|Samantha]]'' via a Dropbox link. The free, 20-track mixtape features collaborations with [[Washed Out]], [[Rome Fortune]] and [[Nosaj Thing]], among others.

===2016–2017: ''Live from Trona'' and ''Boo Boo''===
In April 2016, Bear traveled with his touring band to the Mojave Desert to film a live concert film and album. The concert, which had no audience, was filmed in a single day among the Trona Pinnacles. The band added Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Brijean Murphy on congas, and were joined by The Mattson 2 to play the song "JBS".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.carparkrecords.com/products/574512-cak117-toro-y-moi-live-from-trona|title=Carpark Records: Toro y Moi "Live from Trona"|website=Carpark Records|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref> Bear shared with [[The Fader]] that the film was inspired by [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''Live At Pompeii'', which featured a live performance without an audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2016/09/14/toro-y-moi-live-from-trona-concert-film-chaz-bundick|title=The Story Behind Toro y Moi's "Live from Trona" Concert Film|website=The Fader|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

The film, directed by Harry Israelson, premiered online in August 2016. The live recording was released as a double LP by Carpark Records in August as well.

The studio album follow up to ''[[What For? (album)|What For?]]'', ''[[Boo Boo (album)|Boo Boo]]'', was released on July 7, 2017, by Carpark Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73359-toro-y-moi-announces-new-album-boo-boo-shares-video-for-new-song-watch/|title=Toro Y Moi Announces New Album *Boo Boo*, Shares Video for New Song: Watch - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref> In creating ''Boo Boo'', Bear was influenced by an eclectic mix of [[Daft Punk]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[Travis Scott]], and [[Oneohtrix Point Never]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Toro Y Moi Shares His New Boo Boo|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/1275733-new-music-toro-y-moi-shares-new-boo-boo|website=Crave Online|access-date=July 23, 2017}}</ref> ''Boo Boo'' moved back towards a more R&B, electronic sound, diverging from the live instrumentation of ''What For?''.

===2018–present: ''Outer Peace'' and ''Soul Trash'' mixtape===
Bear released the sixth Toro y Moi album, ''[[Outer Peace]]'', on January 18, 2019, on Carpark Records. ''Outer Peace'' is arguably the most pop-influenced Toro y Moi album to date. Tracks like "Ordinary Pleasure" and "Freelance" showcase the continued funk, disco, and house influence that is woven through the entire Toro y Moi discography. On First Listen with [[NPR]] in January 2019, Bear explained a bit about the album title, stating that "usually the peace is within, so to have peace on the outside is the challenge. I kind of just wanted to call that out."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2019/01/music-news-prior-to-the-release-of-its-new-album-next-week-toro-y-moi-is-streaming-its-new-album-outer-peacein-full-now-via.html|title=TORO Y MOI SHARES NEW ALBUM, OUTER PEACE, VIA NPR'S FIRST LISTEN|website=Music News Net|access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>

A week after the release of ''Outer Peace'' and while on tour supporting the album, Bear shared a Dropbox link to a cassette bounce of his newest mixtape, ''Soul Trash''. In October 2019, an updated version of ''Soul Trash'' was released on streaming platforms. The official release was accompanied by a psychedelic short film directed by Bay Area artist Laneya Billingsley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/10/29/toro-y-moi-short-film-soul-trash|title=Watch Toro y Moi's short film Soul Trash|website=The Fader|access-date=December 1, 2020}}</ref>

In late 2019, Bear started working with [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] on the drum and bass-inspired track "[[The Difference (Flume and Toro y Moi song)|The Difference]]", which was released on March 11, 2020.<ref name = "flume">{{cite web |last=Maicki |first=Salvatore |url=https://www.thefader.com/2020/03/11/flume-toro-y-moi-the-difference-new-album-2020 |title=Flume on his new Toro y Moi collaboration, 'The Difference' |website=[[The Fader]] |year=2020 |access-date=December 7, 2020}}</ref> The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording for 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/toro-y-moi/287539 |title=Grammy Award Results for Toro y Moi |website=[[Grammy.com]] |year=2020 |access-date=December 7, 2020}}</ref>
