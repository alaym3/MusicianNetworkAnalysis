'''Converge''' is an American <!-- this genre is sourced in the musical style section of the text --> [[hardcore punk]] band formed by vocalist [[Jacob Bannon]] and guitarist [[Kurt Ballou]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alarm-magazine.com/2013/interview-salem-metalcore-vets-converge-send-home-the-guests-for-an-explosive-new-album/amp/|title=Interview: Salem metalcore vets Converge send home the guests for an explosive new album|publisher=Alarm magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name="BBC AWLWLB2223">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mg4z|title=Converge - All We Love We Leave Behind Review|publisher=[[BBC]]|quote=Though they're now in their third decade as a group, Massachusetts metalcore pioneers Converge find themselves as influential as ever.|access-date=February 23, 2016|author=Rauf, Raziq}}</ref> During the recording of their seminal fourth album ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]'', the group became a four-piece with the departure of guitarist [[Aaron Dalbec]] and the addition of bassist [[Nate Newton (musician)|Nate Newton]] and drummer [[Ben Koller]]. This lineup has remained intact since. They have released nine studio albums, three live albums, and numerous EPs. The band's sound is rooted in hardcore and also features frequent influences from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. They are considered pioneers of [[metalcore]] as well as its subgenre [[mathcore]].<ref name=":2" />

Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. According to [[AllMusic]], they are "regarded as one of the most original and innovative bands to emerge from the [[Punk rock|punk]] underground."<ref name=":2">Stacia Proefrock. [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/converge-p290887/biography Converge Biography]. [[AllMusic]]</ref> Their popularity rose with the release of ''Jane Doe'', which was ranked as the best album of the decade by [[Sputnikmusic]], the best album of 2001 by [[Terrorizer (magazine)|''Terrorizer'']] and later as the 61st-best metal album of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm#2001|title=Rocklist.net....Terrorizer Magazine.....|website=www.rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-w486923/converge-jane-doe-2001-w486965|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> Subsequently, Converge moved from [[Equal Vision Records]] to the considerably larger label [[Epitaph Records]] and their records gradually became more elaborate and expensive to produce. Special releases have traditionally been handled by [[Deathwish Inc.]], established by Bannon in 1999. The band's ninth studio album, ''[[The Dusk in Us]]'', was released in November 2017 through Deathwish and Epitaph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epitaph.com/artists/Converge/release/the-dusk-in-us|title=About The Dusk In Us By Converge {{!}} Epitaph|website=epitaph.com|language=en|access-date=November 3, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

=== Early years and ''Halo in a Haystack'' (1990–1994) ===
Converge was formed in the winter of 1990 by Bannon and Ballou, they were later joined by high school friends Jeff Feinberg and Damon Bellorado in 1991.<ref name=":04">{{Cite web|url=https://jacobbannon-com.myshopify.com/pages/about-us|title=ABOUT|website=Jacobbannon.com|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> They started by playing covers of [[hardcore punk]], [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] songs. The band soon graduated to playing live performances in mid-1991, after recording some demos on a [[Multitrack recording|4-track recorder]]. The band started writing and playing what they consider "relevant" music in 1994.<ref name=":04" />

In 1994 the band became a five piece when Aaron Dalbec was recruited as a second guitarist. Later in the year Converge released their debut album, ''[[Halo in a Haystack]]'', released through Earthmaker Records. This was only released as a vinyl record and was limited to 1000 copies. The album has not been reprinted since its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Converge-Halo-In-A-Haystack/release/2493108|title=Converge - Halo In A Haystack|website=Discogs|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref> The record was funded by Bannon through money he saved up from working at a [[nursing home]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/music/jacob-bannon-on-the-accessibility-of-converges-music-were-not-made-for-first-level-listeners-5673267|title=Jacob Bannon on the accessibility of Converge's music: "We're not made for first-level listeners"|last=Murphy|first=Tom|date=December 8, 2011|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Converge f3596455.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kurt Ballou]] in 2007]]
In 1995 Converge released their first [[compilation album]], ''[[Caring and Killing]]''. The album featured tracks from the band's early work from the years 1991 to 1994. The album was originally released as a European exclusive through Lost & Found Records.<ref name="archived discog223222">{{cite web|url=http://www.convergecult.com/window.php?iii=4&lll=discography|title=Discography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020222450/http://www.convergecult.com/window.php?iii=4&lll=discography|url-status=dead|work=Converge's Official Website|archive-date=October 20, 2006|access-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref> However, Converge became dissatisfied with the way the label was handling the release and overcharging fans for their hard-to-find older songs. The album was re-released through [[Hydra Head Records]] on November 17, 1997 in America to "make an overpriced release obsolete".<ref name="liner notes222">{{cite AV media notes|title=Caring and Killing|title-link=Caring and Killing|others=Converge|year=1997|type=booklet|publisher=[[Hydra Head Records]]|id=HH666-07|location=[[New Mexico]]}}</ref>

In 1996 Converge released a four-song [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Petitioning the Empty Sky]].'' It was released through [[Ferret Music]], and was one of the earliest releases through the newly-formed label. Later that same year the record was re-released with four additional new tracks. Two years later, the record was reissued through Converge's new label [[Equal Vision Records]] on January 20, 1998. This version contained the previous eight tracks as well as three newly added live tracks, recorded during a radio broadcast. Due to the addition of the new tracks, fans and sources consider this to be Converge's second studio album, while the band considers it a compilation album because it is a collection of songs recorded at different times.<ref name=":1223222">{{Cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=339255|title=Decibel Magazine: Converge|date=February 11, 2010|access-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211214154/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=339255|archive-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref>

In early 1997 the band's original bassist, Feinburg, left the band, and was replaced with [[Stephen Brodsky]]. Also that year, the band signed to Equal Vision Records.<ref name=":223222">{{Cite web|url=http://www.convergecult.com/main.php?iframe=news|title=CONVERGECULT.COM|date=January 4, 2003|access-date=October 30, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030104205430/http://www.convergecult.com/main.php?iframe=news|archive-date=January 4, 2003}}</ref> On December 22, 1997, recording for the band's third studio album ''[[When Forever Comes Crashing]]'' began at Ballou's [[Kurt Ballou#GodCity Studio|GodCity Studio]]; it finished on January 3, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Converge-When-Forever-Comes-Crashing/release/1025350|title=Converge - When Forever Comes Crashing|website=Discogs|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref> On April 14, 1998 Converge released ''When Forever Comes Crashing'' through Equal Vision.

In 1998, Brodsky left the band and was replaced by Newton, who initially joined the band as a part-time member while he was still active in another band, [[Jesuit (band)|Jesuit]]. Jesuit later disbanded in 1999, allowing Newton to make Converge his main focus. In early 1999, the original drummer Bellorado left the band and was quickly replaced with John DiGiorgio,<ref name=":022222">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/6698/Converge|title=Converge - Interview|access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref> who also left the band in the same year. Koller joined Converge in late 1999, replacing DiGiorgio.<ref name=":022222" /> Ballou selected Koller to temporarily fill in while Converge searched for a more permanent replacement for Bellorado, as he was familiar with his work in previous bands, Force Fed Glass and Blue/Green Heart, a band that Ballou and Koller played in together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.effection.net/clients/iodine/bands/bg_heart.html|title=Iodine Recordings: Blue/Green Heart|website=www.effection.net|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/86-ben-koller|title=Sick Drummer Magazine {{!}} Ben Koller|last=Administrator|website=www.sickdrummermagazine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032501/http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/86-ben-koller|archive-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> After working well with the band during some local shows in Boston, Converge made him an official member.<ref name=":12222222">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/converge-mn0000123363/biography|title=Converge {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/86-ben-koller.html|title=Sick Drummer Magazine {{!}} Ben Koller|last=Administrator|website=www.sickdrummermagazine.com|access-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827173959/http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/86-ben-koller.html|archive-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Newton and Koller remain in the band to this day.

The band was reported to take part in a [[Metallica]] tribute split series titled ''[[Crush 'Em All Vol. 1|Crush 'Em All]]'' with [[Today Is the Day]] for [[Undecided Records]] in 2000 but the release fell through.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|date=May 13, 2002|title=A brief interview with Steve Austin from Today Is the Day|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/revpermin/interviewtitd.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231054107/http://www.angelfire.com/rant/revpermin/interviewtitd.html|archive-date=December 31, 2014|access-date=March 29, 2021|website=Revpermint}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=April 25, 2001|title=News|url=http://undecidedrecords.com/news.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010501232405/http://undecidedrecords.com/news.html|archive-date=May 1, 2001|access-date=February 21, 2021|website=Undecided Records}}</ref> In mid-2000 Converge self-released a three-track demo record titled ''Jane Doe Demos''.<ref name="archived discog223222"/> This was released on tour and was limited to 100 copies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} It contained unreleased demo versions of "Bitter & Then Some" and "Thaw" from their upcoming album ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]''. Converge entered the studio to begin recording in the summer of 2001.

On September 4, 2001, Converge released their fourth studio album, ''Jane Doe''. It was met with immediate critical acclaim, with critics praising its poetic lyrics, dynamic range, ferocity and production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-brilliance-behind-converges-unintelligible-lyrics|title=The Brilliance Behind Converge's Unintelligible Lyrics {{!}} NOISEY|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1594-jane-doe/|title=Converge: Jane Doe Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2009/06/30/5-converge-jane-doe/|title=#5: CONVERGE - JANE DOE|date=June 30, 2009|website=MetalSucks|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref> The album was a commercial success in comparison to Converge's previous outings, and both the band and the album have developed a cult following since its release.

It is the band's first studio album to feature Newton and Koller, and the last to feature Dalbec, who was asked to leave the band due to his devotion to his side project [[Bane (band)|Bane]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/features/interviews/4/Converge-interview|title=Converge interview {{!}} Lambgoat|website=lambgoat.com|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Converge's first tour in support of ''Jane Doe'' was in September 2001 with [[Drowningman]] and Playing Enemy,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/858/Converge-and-Drowningman-to-tour|title=Converge & Drowningman to tour|access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> however Drowningman later dropped out of the tour to work on a new album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/889/Drowningman-off-Converge-tour|title=Drowningman off Converge tour|access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref>

In 2002 a music video was released for the track/tracks "Concubine/Fault and Fracture" from the album ''Jane Doe''; the music video was directed by Zach Merck.<ref name=":223222"/>

On January 28, 2003 Converge released their second compilation album, ''[[Unloved and Weeded Out]]''. The album was originally released as a three track EP in 1995.<ref name=":1223222"/> The 2003 album version contains all three tracks from the 1995 EP but in total features 14 tracks, some of which were previously released rarities while others were previously unreleased.

On February 25, 2003 Converge released their first official [[DVD]], ''The Long Road Home''. It is modeled after band home videos such as [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Cliff 'Em All]]''.<ref name=":02222222">{{Cite web|url=http://store.deathwishinc.com/product/DW17.html|title=Deathwish Estore: Converge "Long Road Home" 2XDVD|website=store.deathwishinc.com|access-date=July 9, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628180258/http://store.deathwishinc.com/product/DW17.html|archive-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref> [[Deathwish Inc.|Deathwish Inc]] describes the DVD as a "two disc collection that is as energetic and exciting as the moments the release captures".<ref name=":02222222" /> The DVD also comes with a bonus disk that included three full live sets from the band.

=== ''You Fail Me'' and ''No Heroes'' (2004–2007) ===
In early 2004 the band announced that they were signing to Epitaph Records, having previously been signed to Equal Vision. Bannon stated, "We are confident as artists and genuinely happy about the move. We are part of a diverse, quality roster with Epitaph, rich in both history and integrity. We've struggled for years looking for a supportive label to call home and after a decade we have found it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/2989/Converge-signs-w--Epitaph-Records|title=Converge signs w/ Epitaph Records|access-date=July 14, 2016}}</ref>

Converge began writing for ''[[You Fail Me]]'' after they recorded ''Jane Doe''; they wrote on the road during sound checks of shows.<ref name=":22222222">{{Cite web|url=http://epitaph.com/news/article/rocksound-talks-new-cd-with-jake-bannon-of-converge|title=Rocksound talks new CD with Jake Bannon of Converge!|last=Records|first=Epitaph|date=April 26, 2004|access-date=August 12, 2016}}</ref> Converge entered the studio to begin recording in March 2004 mainly at GodCity Studio. On September 20, 2004 Converge released their fifth studio album, ''You Fail Me''. It was the band's first to chart commercially, reaching number 171 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=":1542">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/299623/converge/chart|title=Converge - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

On February 14, 2005 a music video was released for the track "Eagles Become Vultures", directed by Zach Merck.<ref>{{Citation|title=Converge {{!}} Eagles Become Vultures {{!}} Music Video {{!}} MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/converge/42842/eagles-become-vultures.jhtml#artist=250136|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> Converge's first tour in support of ''You Fail Me'' started in September 2004 with [[Cave In]] and [[Between the Buried and Me]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/3542/Converge-Cave-In-and-BTBAM-tour|title=Converge, Cave In, and BTBAM tour|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>

In 2005 Equal Vision reissued ''Petitioning the Empty Sky'' and ''When Forever Comes Crashing''. These reissues gave the albums one new bonus track each; ''Petitioning the Empty Sky'' received an alternate version of the song "Love as Arson" and ''When Forever Comes Crashing'' received a demo version of the song "Bitter and Then Some". These reissues also came with new album artwork by [[Aaron Turner]] of [[Isis (band)|Isis]]. Ballou said in an interview that he wanted to remix and remaster the albums because the quality of Converge's recordings had improved so much that the original recordings were "becoming distracting".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/interview/kurt-ballou.htm|title=Kurt Ballou - Interview - Stylus Magazine|website=www.stylusmagazine.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> These reissues became the standard versions of these albums.

In early July 2006 Converge's official website announced the title of their upcoming album, ''[[No Heroes]]'', as well as the meaning behind it: "These days, cowards outnumber the heroes, and the begging souls outweigh the calloused hands of the hardest of workers. Both in life and in art, the lack of passion is sickening, and the lust for complacency is poisonous. This album is the artistic antithesis of that sinking world; a thorn in the side of their beast. It's for those who move mountains one day at a time. It's for those who truly understand sacrifice. In our world of enemies, we will walk alone..."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.convergecult.com/window.php?iii=2&lll=news|title=CONVERGECULT.COM|date=July 21, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721205830/http://www.convergecult.com/window.php?iii=2&lll=news|archive-date=July 21, 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

On October 24, 2006 Converge released their sixth studio album, ''No Heroes''. This was the first Converge album to be self-produced by Ballou with no input from other producers, at his own GodCity Studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/convege-kurt-ballou-you-fail-me|title=Converge Guitarist/Producer Kurt Ballou Explains Why He Remixed 'You Fail Me' {{!}} NOISEY|access-date=July 23, 2016}}</ref>

In November 2008 Converge began writing ''[[Axe to Fall]]''. Following a short tour in March 2009 with [[Ceremony (punk band)|Ceremony]], [[Coliseum (band)|Coliseum]], [[Pulling Teeth (band)|Pulling Teeth]] and [[Rise and Fall (band)|Rise and Fall]], Converge entered the studio to begin recording in May 2009. During this short tour, the band debuted a few new songs live, and footage could be seen online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2009/03/31/new-converge-songs-new-converge-songs-new-converge-songs/|title=NEW CONVERGE SONGS!

The album was produced by Ballou, at GodCity Studio. In August 2009, two months prior to the release of ''Axe to Fall'', Converge made the opening track, "Dark Horse", available for [[Streaming media|streaming]] and as a free download. It was noted for being one of the few tracks lacking guest musicians, and was met with a very positive reaction from reviewers. The title track was also made available for free download in September 2009. The entire album was available for streaming on Converge's [[MySpace]] page one week before the official release date. On October 14, 2009, a music video was released for the title track of the album, directed by Craig Murray.<ref>{{Citation|last=EpitaphRecords|title=Converge - Axe To Fall|date=October 14, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jjBinzryFY|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

On October 20, 2009 Converge released their seventh studio album, ''Axe to Fall''. On November 7, the "Axe to Fall" video debuted on [[MTV2|MTV2's]] heavy metal music program, ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=49991|title=Tonight's Headbangers Ball Line-Up Details|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

Converge started writing and playing what they consider "relevant" music in 1994. At that time they started incorporating influences like [[Starkweather (band)|Starkweather]],<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobbannon.com/pages/about-us|title=ABOUT|website=Jacobbannon.com|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> [[The Accüsed]],<ref name=":3" /> [[Rorschach (band)|Rorschach]],<ref name=":3" /> [[Born Against]],<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywzqbw/rank-your-records-converge-jacob-bannon|title=Rank Your Records: Converge's Jacob Bannon Reflects on the Seminal Hardcore Band's Eight Albums|website=Noisey|language=en-us|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Moss Icon]],<ref name=":4" /> [[Universal Order of Armageddon]],<ref name=":4" /> [[Heroin (band)|Heroin]],<ref name=":4" /> and [[Mohinder (band)|Mohinder]]<ref name=":4" /> into their approach.

In a 2012 interview, Bannon told Jonny Cohn of ''[[The Aquarian Weekly|The Aquarian]]'' that the band "don’t really look to any outside influences all that much anymore. We kind of haven’t for a long time. We have been a band for over two decades. We’re more introverted. We’re used to writing and creating in our own little bubble. We love and appreciate all different kinds of music and at times you can hear little subtle things come out but for the most part, they’re just an extension and exploration of things that we’ve done in the past."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2012/11/07/an-interview-with-converge-getting-straight-to-the-point/|title=An Interview with Converge: Getting Straight To The Point|website=The Aquarian|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

Kurt Ballou has produced (and co-produced) the majority of Converge's albums at his own GodCity Studio. He has always been involved in the production of Converge's albums, but it was not until their 2006 album, ''No Heroes'', that he was involved in the entire recording and mixing process.<ref name=":1322"/> This became the standard for Converge releases afterwards. One reason Ballou claimed to get into the studio side of music was to have "maximum control over our music".

Scott Butterworth of Noisey has described Bannon's vocals "as just another sonic element—more percussive and tonal than lyrical—allowing listeners to develop an emotional understanding of the material even without a precise knowledge of the words."<ref name=":0222">{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/the-brilliance-behind-converges-unintelligible-lyrics|title=The Brilliance Behind Converge's Unintelligible Lyrics - Noisey|website=Noisey|language=en-us|access-date=November 20, 2016}}</ref> Sammy O'Hagar of [[MetalSucks|Metalsucks]] stated Bannon's vocals "[are] as much a part of Converge's uniqueness as is Ballou's nimble riffing".<ref name=":12322">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2009/10/15/jacob-bannon-of-converge-the-metalsucks-interview/|title=JACOB BANNON OF CONVERGE: THE METALSUCKS INTERVIEW|date=October 15, 2009|website=MetalSucks|access-date=November 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Artwork ===
Bannon has designed all of Converge's artwork since their 1996 release, ''Petitioning the Empty Sky''. Although reissues of older albums have had artwork done by Aaron Turner such as the 2005 reissues of ''Petitioning the Empty Sky'' and ''When Forever Comes Crashing'', Bannon still took part in the design process of these reissues. In an interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', Bannon shared his art process, saying, "When I work I usually start out with a sketch of some kind, either in my process book or on a scrap of paper," he explains. "I also did this with the ''Jane Doe'' album. By doing that, I work through ideas, write about them, and force them to evolve into something more refined. Process is extremely important for me--it allows me to have a log of my ideas, whether they're successful or not. That said, I sketched the basic cover and started building it in layers, using acrylic, ink, and spray paint. Because of the nature of the work and the need for flexibility in the imagery, I decided to build it in physical layers and scan certain elements for future use."<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/interview-converges-jake-bannon-on-legendary-jane-doe-album-artwork.html|title=Interview: Converge's Jake Bannon on Legendary 'Jane Doe' Album Artwork|date=September 4, 2014|work=Revolvermag|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

==Collaborations==
Converge have collaborated with numerous musicians throughout their work such as members of [[Cave In]], [[The Hope Conspiracy]], [[Genghis Tron]], [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Disfear]]. Most of these bands are featured on the band's collaborative album ''[[Axe to Fall]]''. However, with the exception of ''Axe to Fall,'' Converge tend not to include many guests on their albums, and the guests that are included have minor roles such as backing vocals. The band have also worked with [[Tomas Lindberg]] (of [[At the Gates]], [[Skitsystem]], The Great Deceiver, and Disfear),<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/05/23/go-pound-for-pound-with-converge/|title=Go Pound for Pound with Converge|date=May 23, 2013|website=MetalSucks|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> [[Aaron Turner]] (of [[Isis (band)|Isis]] and [[Old Man Gloom]]),<ref name=":1" /> and [[The Hope Conspiracy|Kevin Baker]] (of [[All Pigs Must Die (band)|All Pigs Must Die]] and The Hope Conspiracy),<ref name=":1" /> all of whom provided vocals for a cover of [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]]'s "Wolverine Blues" performed by Converge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/51719/media-converge-pound-for-pound-the-wolverine-blues-sessions|title=Music: Converge: 'Pound for Pound: The Wolverine Blues Sessions'|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>

After touring together in 2004, every member of Cave In and Converge entered Ballou's GodCity Studio to lay the foundation for what was intended to become a full-length collaborative album between the two bands. Tentatively dubbed the "Verge-In" sessions (an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgamation]] of the bands' names), the project was described as sounding "like this freaky mix of ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''-era [[Metallica]] meets [[Mars Volta]] meets the [[Allman Brothers]]."<ref name="noisecreep-vergein22">{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/cave-in-and-converge-collaboration-sees-light-of-day-on-axe-to/|title=Cave In and Converge Collaboration Sees Light of Day on 'Axe to Fall'|last=Teitelman|first=Bram|date=December 3, 2009|work=[[Noisecreep]]|access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref> Due to both groups growing busier with their primary bands, as well as creative differences, the project eventually fizzled out.<ref name="noisecreep-vergein22" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/11/18/interview-with-adam-mcgrath-cave-in-according-to-cave-in/|title=Interview with Adam McGrath: Cave In According To Cave In|last=Slevin|first=Patrick|date=November 18, 2009|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref> Brodsky described the sessions as being a "bigger project than anyone had anticipated taking on...

Cave In and Converge members have collaborated numerous times, Brodsky had been the bassist of Converge from 1997 to 1998. Ballou produced Cave In's first two records, ''[[Beyond Hypothermia (album)|Beyond Hypothermia]]'' and ''[[Until Your Heart Stops]].'' Koller became a temporary drummer for Cave In during their support tour of their fourth studio album, ''[[Perfect Pitch Black]]''.
