'''Soft Cell''' are <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, UK English treats collective groups plural. Please do not change "were" to "was". --> an English [[synthpop]] duo who came to prominence in the early 1980s. The duo consisted of vocalist [[Marc Almond]] and instrumentalist [[David Ball (electronic musician)|David Ball]]. The band are primarily known for their 1981 hit version of "[[Tainted Love]]" and their platinum-selling debut album ''[[Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/Search.aspx |title=Certified Awards Search |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |date=15 November 1982 |access-date=30 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/non-stop-erotic-cabaret-r49694/review |title=Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret – Soft Cell |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, Soft Cell had twelve top 40 hits,<ref name=occ>{{cite web|title=Soft Cell - Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19156/soft-cell/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref> including "Tainted Love" (number 1), "[[Torch (song)|Torch]]" (number 2), "[[Say Hello, Wave Goodbye]]", "[[What (song)|What]]" (both number 3), and "[[Bedsitter (song)|Bedsitter]]" (number 4). They also had four top 20 albums between 1981 and 1984.<ref name="occ"/> In 1984, the duo split; however, they reformed in 2001 to tour and release a new album. They held a reunion concert in London on 30 September 2018, stating it would be their last live UK performance as a duo but that they may still perform abroad and record together.

==History==
===''Mutant Moments'' and "Memorabilia"===
[[File:Soft Cell Rainbow Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque honouring Soft Cell at Leeds Beckett University (formerly Leeds Polytechnic)]]
Soft Cell was initiated during 1977 after Almond and Ball met at [[Leeds Beckett University|Leeds Polytechnic]]. Their initial efforts at recording resulted that year in an EP titled ''[[Mutant Moments]]'' which was funded by a loan of £2,000 from Dave Ball's mother and made with a simple 2-track recorder.<ref name="book">Almond, Marc (1999). ''Tainted Life''. London: Sidgwick&nbsp;&amp; Jackson. {{ISBN|9780330372015}}.{{page needed|date=January 2018}}</ref>

Soft Cell's next recording, "The Girl with the Patent Leather Face", appeared as a contribution to the ''[[Some Bizzare Album]]'', which featured bands such as [[Depeche Mode]], [[The The]], and [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]]. The duo ultimately signed to the Some Bizzare label, backed by [[Phonogram Records]]. Their first single, "A Man Could Get Lost" b/w "Memorabilia" on 7" and "Memorabilia" b/w "Persuasion" on 12", was produced by [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] who founded [[Mute Records]]. While "Memorabilia" was a success in nightclubs, Soft Cell would remain essentially unknown until their next release.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==="Tainted Love"===
{{see also|Tainted Love}}
After the chart failure of "Memorabilia", [[Phonogram Records]] allowed Soft Cell to record a second and final single in an attempt to score a chart success. The band opted to record a cover version of "Tainted Love", an obscure 1965 [[northern soul]] track originally released by [[Gloria Jones]] (the girlfriend of [[Marc Bolan]] at the time of his death) and written by [[Ed Cobb]] of [[The Four Preps]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Released in 1981, Soft Cell's "Tainted Love" was a No.&nbsp;1 hit in 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it was the second best selling single  of 1981<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-50-best-selling-songs-of-1981__32604/|title=The Official Top 50 best-selling songs of 1981|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref><ref name="UK Chart"/> after selling 1.05 million copies (a total which increased to 1.35 million copies by of August 2017).<ref name="UK Chart">{{cite news|url= http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/official-charts-flashback-1981-soft-cell-tainted-love__20296/|title=Official Charts Flashback 1981: Soft Cell - Tainted Love|last=Copsey|first=Rob|website=Officialcharts.com|date=August 31, 2017|access-date=August 31, 2017}}</ref> 

In 1982, "Tainted Love" became a No.&nbsp;8 single in the United States and went on to set a [[Guinness World Record]] at the time for the longest consecutive stay (43 weeks) on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The song's popularity developed slowly, needing 19 weeks to enter the US Top 40. The A-side of the [[12-inch single]] of "Tainted Love" actually featured a two-song medley, with "Tainted Love" blending into the [[Motown]] classic "[[Where Did Our Love Go]]" (originally recorded by [[the Supremes]] in 1964).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''===
The duo's first album, ''[[Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret]]'', hit UK No.&nbsp;5 and further explored the now-trademark Soft Cell themes of squalor and sleaze. "Seedy Films" talks of long nights in [[pornography|porno]] cinemas, while "Frustration" and "Secret Life" deal with the boredom and hypocrisy associated with suburban life. A companion video titled ''[[Soft Cell's: Non-Stop Exotic Video Show|Non-Stop Exotic Video Show]]'' was released alongside the album and featured videos directed by [[Tim Pope]]. The video generated some controversy in Britain, mainly due to a scandal involved with the "Sex Dwarf" clip. The original version of the music video was confiscated by police and censored before it was even released.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

''[[Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret]]'' garnered two additional hits: "[[Bedsitter (song)|Bedsitter]]" dealt with the loneliness and lifestyle of a young man having recently left home to live in a [[bedsit]] while partying hard. "Bedsitter" reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1981. The song was highly acclaimed in a retrospective review by [[AllMusic]] journalist Ned Raggett who wrote that it "ranks as one of the best, most realistic portrayals of urban life recorded."<ref>{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/bedsitter-mt0026800785 |title=Bedsitter – Soft Cell &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=25 July 2014}}</ref> The final single on the album, the ballad "[[Say Hello, Wave Goodbye]]", peaked at No. 3 in February 1982 and was subsequently covered by David Gray nearly 20 years later when his version reached No. 26 in the UK.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

During 1982, the duo spent most of their time recording and relaxing in New York City, where they met a woman named Cindy Ecstasy whom Almond would later confirm was his drug supplier (it was Cindy Ecstasy who introduced them to the new nightclub drug of the same name). Soon after "Say Hello Wave Goodbye" dropped out of the chart, Soft Cell released a brand new song: [[Torch (song)|"Torch"]], a love song which was to prove the closest the band ever got to having a No. 1 hit with one of their own songs. The song entered straight into the Top 20 and peaked at No. 2.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts |website=Everyhit.com |date=16 March 2000 |access-date=25 July 2014}}</ref>

The duo released their second album entitled ''[[Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing]]'', a 6-track mini album containing remixes of older material along with their new hit single, "What!". This was a cover of the 1965 song by [[Melinda Marx]]. It was later covered in 1968 by [[Judy Street]], whose version became extremely popular on the Northern Soul scene. Almond later admitted that the album was recorded and mixed under the influence of [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]].<ref>Interview with Marc Almond BBC TV programme 'Young Guns Go for It'</ref>{{better source needed|date=November 2019}} "What!" placed at No. 101 in the US Charts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdose.com/lost-in-the-80s-soft-cell-what/ |title=Lost in the '80s: Soft Cell, "What!" |publisher=Popdose |date=4 November 2008 |access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref> but was a major hit in the UK and reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in August of that year.<ref name="test"/>

===Decline and dissolution===
By 1983, fame and nearly constant drug use were having a bad effect on the duo. Marc Almond also formed the group [[Marc and the Mambas]], featuring collaborations with [[The The]]'s [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] and future Almond collaborator Annie Hogan, as an [[Spin-off (media)|offshoot]] to experiment out of the glare of the Soft Cell spotlight. Soft Cell's third album release, appropriately titled ''[[The Art of Falling Apart]]'', was a Top 5 hit in the UK but the singles were only modest successes. The first single "Where The Heart Is" only reached 21, while the double A-side "Numbers"/"Barriers" peaked at 25. "Numbers" also generated controversy due to references in the song to the drug [[methamphetamine|speed]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In September 1983, the duo released a new single "Soul Inside", which returned them to the UK Top 20, but by early 1984 the duo had amicably decided to end Soft Cell. They played farewell concerts at [[Hammersmith Palais]] in January, and released one final album called ''[[This Last Night in Sodom]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;12) in March. Headed by the duo's final single "Down in the Subway" (UK No.&nbsp;24), the album departed from its predecessors by featuring more live drums and guitars than previous albums.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Reunions===
Almond and Ball reunited as Soft Cell in 2001 with a series of live dates. They performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London during March 2001. A mini-tour followed later in the year. The track "God Shaped Hole" featured on the [[Some Bizzare]] compilation titled ''[[I'd Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone's Listening]]'', released during 2001. A new Soft Cell album, ''[[Cruelty Without Beauty]]'', was released during late 2002, followed by a European tour and a small US tour during early 2003. The second single from the album, a cover of [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]{{'}} "The Night", reached No.&nbsp;39 in the UK. Soft Cell had considered recording "The Night" in place of "Tainted Love" during 1981, though keyboardist David Ball stated in a 2003 interview with the BBC, "I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981]."{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In November 2008, the band released a remix album entitled ''Heat''. The album included Soft Cell tracks remixed by such acts as [[Paul Dakeyne]], [[The Grid]], [[Manhattan Clique]], [[Cicada]], [[Richard X]], [[Ladytron]], [[Manhattan Clique|MHC]], [[Atomizer (band)|Atomizer]], [[Mark Moore]], [[Spektrum (band)|Spektrum]], [[The Dark Poets]] and many more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25539_0_2_0_C |title=Soft Cell remix album in the pipeline |website=Side-line.com |access-date=25 July 2014}}</ref>

In February 2018, Soft Cell announced that they would reunite for one last UK reunion concert. On 21 August 2018, Almond revealed on the [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 that Soft Cell were releasing two new tracks ahead of the concert: "Northern Lights" and "Guilty (Cos I Say You Are)".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/soft-cell-release-first-new-single/|title=Soft Cell release first new single in 17 years|date=2018-08-21|newspaper=[[Gay Star News]]|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref> Entitled "Say Hello, Wave Goodbye", the reunion concert took place at the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] in London on 30 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2019/01/review-soft-cell-the-o2-london-live/|title=Review: Soft Cell, The O2, London live|website=Classicpopmag.com|date=17 January 2019}}</ref> It was stated this was their final live UK show as a duo, but that they may still perform abroad and record material together.

In 2019 Ball said a new Soft Cell album was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/9292/Soft-Cell-Interview-with-Dave-Ball|title=Soft Cell - Interview with Dave Ball|first=John|last=Clarkson|date=14 June 2019|quote=“We are working on a new record, and we have signed to BMG, and there will be a new album, but I think that more what we are going to do now is more recording based.”|website=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> In May 2019, a new book 'To Show You, I've Been There' was released, which came with a vinyl copy of the ''[[Magick Mutants|Magick Mutants EP]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.softcell.co.uk/announcing-the-limited-edition-magick-mutants-vinyl-ep-to-accompany-soft-cells-to-show-you-ive-been-there-book/|title=Announcing the limited-edition 'Magick Mutants' vinyl EP To accompany Soft Cell's 'To Show You I've Been There' book – Soft Cell (Marc Almond & David Ball)|website=Softcell.co.uk|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> a sequel to their debut ''Mutant Moments'' EP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.softcell.co.uk/say-hello-wave-goodbye-the-o2-london-london-film-premiere/|title='Say Hello Wave Goodbye: The O2 London' – London Film Premiere – Soft Cell (Marc Almond & David Ball)|website=Softcell.co.uk|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> For June 2020, the ''Mutant Moments'' EP is to have its first official release.

In July 2021, the duo announced that their new album would be called ''Happiness Not Included'' and would feature tracks such as "Heart Like Chernobyl",
"Light Sleepers" and "Nostalgia Machine".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/soft-cell-announce-happiness-not-included-first-new-album-in-20-years/|title = Soft Cell Announce *Happiness Not Included, First New Album in 20 Years|website=Pitchfork.com|date = 28 July 2021}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2021/07/happiness-not-included-soft-cell/|title = Happiness Not Included: Soft Cell announce new album|website=Classicpopmag.com|date = 29 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/soft-cell-announce-first-new-album-in-20-years-happiness-not-included-3005301|title=Soft Cell announce first new album in 20 years, '*Happiness Not Included'|website=Nme.com|date=28 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.softcell.co.uk/happiness-not-included/|title = *Happiness Not Included|website=Softcell.co.uk}}</ref> The album is due to be released in Spring 2022, 20 years after their last studio album release.
