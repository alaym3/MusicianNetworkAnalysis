==Career==
===Early life and bands===
Crosbie was raised in 'The Valley',<ref name=hitT15/> a residential area of the [[Castlemilk]] district of [[Glasgow]].<ref name=leap/> He has stated that as a child he listened to his mother's music cassettes including albums by [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[The Beatles]].<ref name=cult/><ref name="rising">{{cite news|url=http://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgows-rising-star-set-for-13696504|title=Who is Gerry Cinnamon? TRNSMT announce Glasgow's rising star will be joining 2018 lineup|last=Dalziel|first=Magdalene |publisher=Glasgow Live|date=14 December 2017|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> He has also stated that he was a fan of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]],<ref name=cult/><ref name=hiding/> as well as [[The La's]]. He also has a particular admiration for the work of [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=cult/><ref name=hiding/>

Having experienced problems in the local area and in school as a young teenager, he spent some time living in London with the father of a friend; finding himself with little to do "apart from watch cricket or play guitar",<ref name=stvT15/><ref name=hiding/> he became proficient in the instrument (as well as the harmonica).<ref name=problem/> On returning to Scotland he began writing songs, with his growing interest in creating and performing music proving a distraction in his attempts to hold down jobs in various industries over several years.<ref name=stvT15/><ref name=problem/>

While performing a solo gig at a college he met aspiring producer Chris Marshall,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.linkedin.com/in/chris-marshall-19692481|title=Chris Marshall profile|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> a neighbour from Castlemilk.<ref name=exposure>{{cite news|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/22149-exposure-the-cinnamons/|title=Exposure: The Cinnamons|last=Barber|first=Ross|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=17 November 2009|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> They began collaborating on a casual basis with Marshall arranging the songs and Crosbie the lyricist, and eventually formed a [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] band, ''The Cinnamons'', along with Lori Duncan, Dave Bass and Gav Hunter;<ref name=exposure/> with Gerry as [[frontman]], they released a five-song [[Extended play|EP]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecinnamons.bandcamp.com/releases|title=The Cinnamons – 5 Songs|publisher=[[Bandcamp]]|date=29 November 2010|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> Crosbie subsequently adopted the Cinnamon name as a solo performer and his later catalogue contains some compositions from the era, such as ''Sometimes''.<ref name=barras/>

An [[Open mic]] night in a bar on [[Sauchiehall Street]] in central Glasgow gave him an opportunity to perform his songs, and the event became increasingly popular.<ref name=problem/>

===Rise in popularity and live shows===
In 2014, having sold-out gigs at small venues purely through [[word of mouth]] and [[social media]],<ref name=fame>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/castlemilk-star-gerry-cinnamon-who-5575978|title=Castlemilk star Gerry Cinnamon who shot to fame with pro-independence song Hope Over Fear is looking forward to new single release|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=24 April 2015|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> he was invited to write and perform a song at a rally event in [[George Square]] ahead of the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]].<ref name=fame/><ref name=stvT15/> The song, ''Hope Over Fear'', which was released as a single, introduced him to a wider audience – however he has stated that he had no desire to become a figurehead for the [[Yes Scotland|Yes campaign]].<ref name=stvT15/><ref name=hiding/>

In November, without being signed to a record label, he headlined a sold-out show at Glasgow's [[O2 ABC Glasgow]], the promotion of which had consisted of a single message on his Facebook profile;<ref name=ahead/><ref name=electric/><ref name=cult/> he later admitted he was so disorganised that he had not even prepared a [[set list]] for the performance.<ref name=cult/> In December, he supported [[Ocean Colour Scene]] in their show at the [[SSE Hydro]].<ref name=cult>{{cite news|url=http://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/gerry-cinnamon-meet-castlemilk-singer-12232157|title=Gerry Cinnamon – meet the Castlemilk singer with the biggest cult following in Scotland|last=McQuade|first=Christopher|publisher=Glasgow Live|date=25 November 2016|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

A few days before playing his Barrowland gigs, Cinnamon spoke out against operators of [[Ticket resale#United Kingdom|ticket scalping websites]], after discovering they had purchased gig tickets at face value and then offered them for sale on their sites to desperate fans at hugely inflated prices.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/castlemilk-singer-gerry-cinnamon-hit-6071226|title=Glasgow singer Gerry Cinnamon outraged at ticket touts after seeing prices for his gig rocket|last=Ferguson|first=John|newspaper=Daily Record|date=21 December 2017|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

===2018: Touring===
The early months of 2018 were dominated by a sold-out Scottish tour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/gerry-cinnamon-hints-uk-tour-14305179|title=Gerry Cinnamon hints at UK tour after Scottish dates sell out in three minutes|last=Dalziel|first=Magdalene|date=18 February 2018 |work=glasgowlive|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> followed by several dates across Britain and Ireland, with the vast majority of the tickets once more sold out well in advance and some gigs moved to higher capacity venues due to the demand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/gerry-cinnamons-uk-ireland-shows-14474267|title=Gerry Cinnamon's UK and Ireland shows sold out in minutes|last=O'Neill |first=Christina |publisher=Glasgow Live|date=29 March 2018|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> During one performance in [[Inverness]], he briefly stopped playing to confront a member of the audience who had thrown a drink onto the stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16154771.WATCH__Glasgow_singer_Gerry_Cinnamon_s_fury_as_fan_throws_pint_on_stage/|title=Glasgow singer Gerry Cinnamon's fury as fan throws pint|last=McArthur |first=Maxine |work=Evening Times|date=12 April 2018|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>

On 28 June 2018, two days before the event, the organisers of TRNSMT announced that Cinnamon's performance at the festival had been moved to a later, higher profile time slot (benefitting from [[J Hus]]'s cancellation).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/rapper-j-hus-pulls-out-12813064|title=Rapper J-Hus pulls out of TRNSMT over alleged knife crime|last=Glencross |first=Nina |work=Daily Record|date=28 June 2018|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-44674372|title=TRNSMT: Glasgow hero Gerry Cinnamon fills in for J Hus tickets hoovered up|work=[[BBC News]] |date=1 July 2018|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref> He was also booked to play at the RiZE Festival (the replacement of the long-running [[V Festival]]) and the [[Tartan Heart Festival]] (Belladrum) during August 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/Gerry-Cinnamon-to-play-Belladrum-Festival/38812/amp.html|title=Gerry Cinnamon to play Belladrum Festival|publisher=[[Skiddle]] |date=9 July 2018|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref>

Some complained to Cinnamon via social media about the prices of tickets available on resale sites, leading him to respond publicly "If you think I want some corporate goon reselling my ticks for 10x the asking price you've lost it. If you think I'm somehow involved or can stop it when the biggest bands in the world can't do anything about it then you're misinformed at best".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/gerry-cinnamon-tells-fans-cant-12870782|title=Gerry Cinnamon tells fans he can't stop touts after Glasgow gig tickets hoovered up|work=Daily Record|date=7 July 2018|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref> Further December 2018 shows in Dundee, Aberdeen and Kilmarnock were later announced which again sold out in seconds.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Views on the music industry==
He has encouraged aspiring artists to believe in themselves despite a lack of expensive backing,<ref name=leap/><ref name=problem/> and expressed a scathing distaste for the nature of music industry marketing and excessive hyping of inferior quality artists,<ref name=stvT15/><ref name=ahead/><ref name=hiding/> stating in 2016:''{{quote|"The only reason I'm in this game is because it's full of imposters ruining music and my very existence annoys them and it pleases me. If you're a working class musician hearing this or reading it and you respect the art of song writing more than the art of pretending then you have a responsibility to get involved. There's a war on for real music and if you're sound and can write decent tunes then you're on the front line whether you like it or not."<ref name=cult/><ref name=rising/>}}''
