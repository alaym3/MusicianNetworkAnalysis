'''Yellow Magic Orchestra''' ('''YMO''') is a Japanese [[electronic music]] band formed in Tokyo in 1978 by [[Haruomi Hosono]] (bass, keyboards, vocals), [[Yukihiro Takahashi]] (drums, lead vocals) and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] (keyboards, vocals).<ref name="allmusic_ymo">{{AllMusic|artist|p5886|Yellow Magic Orchestra|access-date=June 3, 2009}}</ref> The group is considered influential and innovative in the field of popular electronic music.<ref name="allmusic_ymo"/><ref name="fidelity_1993"/> They were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[music sequencer|sequencers]], [[drum machine]]s, computers, and [[Digital audio|digital recording]] technology,<ref name="allmusic_ymo"/><ref name="sarasota"/><ref name="clashmusic"/> and effectively anticipated the "[[electropop]] boom" of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sakamoto hears music's sounds, not its styles|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|author=J.

YMO was initially conceived by Hosono as a one-off exploration of computerized [[exotica]] and parody of [[orientalism|Western conceptions]] of the [[orient]]. The three members were veterans of the [[music industry]] before coming together as YMO, and were inspired by eclectic sources, including the electronic music of [[Isao Tomita]] and [[Kraftwerk]], [[Music of Japan|Japanese traditional music]], [[arcade game]]s, [[funk]] music, and the [[disco]] productions of [[Giorgio Moroder]]. They released the surprise global hit "[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game]]" in 1978, reaching the UK Top 20 and selling 400,000 copies in the US.  For their early recordings and performances, the band was often accompanied by programmer [[Hideki Matsutake]].<ref name="sound_147"/> The group would release several albums before pausing their activity in 1984. They have briefly reunited several times in subsequent decades.

==History==

===1976–1978: Early years and formation===
Prior to the group's formation, Sakamoto had been experimenting with [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic music equipment]] at the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]], which he entered in 1970, including synthesizers such as the [[Buchla]], [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], and [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]].<ref name="dayal_interview">{{cite web|last=Dayal|first=Gheeta|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra|url=http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/blog/archives/00000615.htm|work=Groove|publisher=The Original Soundtrack|access-date=June 17, 2011|date=2006-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002224518/http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/blog/archives/00000615.htm|archive-date=October 2, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The group leader Haruomi Hosono had been using an [[Ace Tone]] [[rhythm machine]] since early in his career in the early 1970s.<ref name="wire2017">{{cite journal |title=The Primer:Yellow Magic Orchestra |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |date=October 2017 |issue=404 |page=38 |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/59878/page/38}}</ref> Following the break-up of his band [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]] in 1972, Hosono became involved in the recording of several early [[electronic rock]] records, including [[Yōsui Inoue]]'s [[Folk rock|folk]] [[pop rock]] album ''[[Kōri no Sekai]]'' (1973) and [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s [[Progressive rock|progressive]] [[psychedelic rock]] album ''Benzaiten'' (1974), both of which utilized synthesizers, electric guitars, electric bass, and in the latter, [[electronic drum]]s, and [[Drum machine|rhythm machines]].<ref>{{Discogs release|2509617|井上陽水 – 氷の世界}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://www.discogs.com/%E4%BA%95%E4%B8%8A%E9%99%BD%E6%B0%B4-%E6%B0%B7%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C/release/2509617 Translation])</ref><ref>{{Discogs release|1303605|Osamu Kitajima – Benzaiten}}</ref> Also around the same time, the band's future "fourth member" [[Hideki Matsutake]] was the assistant for the internationally successful electronic musician [[Isao Tomita]]. Much of the methods and techniques developed by both Tomita and Matsutake during the early 1970s would later be employed by Yellow Magic Orchestra.<ref name="sound_147"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Isao Tomita: Moog reverie|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1586|publisher=[[Resident Advisor]]|access-date=17 July 2012|date=13 July 2012}}</ref>

Sakamoto first worked with Hosono as a member of his live band in 1976, while [[Yukihiro Takahashi]] recruited Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the [[Sadistic Mika Band]]. Hosono invited both to work on his [[exotica]]-flavoured album ''[[Paraiso (Haruomi Hosono album)|Paraiso]]'', which included [[Electronic music|electronic songs]] produced using various electronic equipment. The band was named "Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band" as a satire of Japan's obsession with [[black magic]] at the time,<ref name="guardian_ymo"/> and in late 1977 they began recording ''Paraiso'', which was released in 1978.<ref name="discogs_paraiso">{{Discogs release|1188801|Harry Hosono And The Yellow Magic Band – Paraiso}}</ref> The three worked together again for the 1978 album ''Pacific'', which included an early version of the song "Cosmic Surfin".<ref>{{Discogs release|2561274|Pacific}}</ref> Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside [[Hideki Matsutake]] in early 1978 for Hosono's experimental "electro-exotica" [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] album ''Cochin Moon'', which fused electronic music with [[Music of India|Indian music]], including an early "synth [[raga]]" song "Hum Ghar Sajan".<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|author=Dominique Leone|date=July 19, 2005|title=Hosono & Yokoo: Cochin Moon|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref> The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, ''[[Thousand Knives|The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'', experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and [[traditional Japanese music]] in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto's songs, "Thousand Knives", in the album.<ref>{{Discogs release|325757|Ryuichi Sakamoto – Thousand Knives Of}}</ref> ''Thousand Knives'' was also notable for its early use of the [[microprocessor]]-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer]] [[music sequencer]], with Matsutake as its [[Programming (music)|music programmer]] for the album.<ref name="knives_cd">{{Discogs release|1156483|Ryuichi Sakamoto – Thousand Knives Of (CD)}}</ref><ref name=Tanaka2014/>

While Sakamoto was working on ''Thousand Knives'', Hosono began formulating the idea of an instrumental disco band which could have the potential to reach success in non-Japanese-language territories, and invited [[Tasuo Hayashi]] of [[Haruomi Hosono|Tin Pan Alley]] and Hiroshi Sato of Uncle Buck as participants, but they declined.<ref name=Tanaka2014>{{cite web|last1=Tanaka|first1=Yuji|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra: The Pre-MIDI Technology Behind Their Anthems|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/yellow-magic-orchestra-gear|publisher=[[Red Bull Music Academy]]|date=November 11, 2014}}</ref> Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi eventually collaborated again to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra and they began recording their self-titled album at a [[Shibaura]] studio in July 1978.<ref name="discogs_ymo_lp"/> The band was initially conceived as a one-off studio project by Hosono, the other two members being recruited session musicians—the idea was to produce an album fusing orientalist [[exotica]] with modern electronics, as a [[subversion]] of [[Orientalism]] and [[exoticization]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===1978–1983: National and international success===

The band's 1978 self-titled album ''[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'' was successful and the studio project grew into a fully fledged touring band and career for its three members. The album featured the use of computer technology (along with synthesizers) which, according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', allowed the group to create a new sound that was not possible until then.<ref name="billboard_1979">{{citation|title=Artists and producers strive for inroads overseas|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 26, 1979|volume=91|issue=20|issn=0006-2510|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_iQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT61}}</ref> Following the release of the album ''Yellow Magic Orchestra'', a live date at the Roppongi Pit Inn was seen by executives of A&M Records of the USA who were in the process of setting up a partnership deal with Alfa Records. This led to the YMO being offered an international deal, at which point (early 1979) the three members decided the group would be given priority over their solo careers. The most popular international hit from the album was "Firecracker", which would be released as a single the following year and again as "Computer Game", which became a success in the United States and Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Following an advertising deal with [[Fujifilm|Fuji Cassette]], the group sparked a boom in the popularity of electronic pop music, called "[[synthpop|technopop]]" in Japan,<ref name="guardian_ymo">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica – and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=The Guardian |location=UK|access-date=May 25, 2011|date=July 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name="sarasota">{{cite journal|title=Computer rock music gaining fans|journal=[[Sarasota Journal]]|date=August 18, 1980|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7s4mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h44EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4481,2128223|access-date=May 25, 2011|page=8}}</ref> where they had an effect similar to that of [[the Beatles]] and [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] in 1960s Britain.<ref name="guardian_ymo"/> For some time, YMO was the most popular band in Japan.<ref name="guardian_ymo"/> Successful solo act [[Akiko Yano]] (later married to Sakamoto) joined the band for its live performances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but did not participate in the studio recordings.

Making abundant use of new synthesizers, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[music sequencer|sequencers]], [[drum machine]]s, computers and digital recording technology as it became available, as well as utilizing [[cyberpunk]]-ish lyrics sung mostly in English, they extended their popularity and influence beyond Japan.<ref name="allmusic_ymo"/><ref name="sarasota"/><ref name="clashmusic">{{cite web|title=Senor Coconut|author=Paul Sullivan|work=clashmusic.com|date=September 1, 2007|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/senor-coconut|access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref>

Their second album ''[[Solid State Survivor]]'', released in 1979, was YMO's pinnacle recording in Japan, winning the 1980 Best Album Award in the [[Japan Record Awards]]. It featured English lyrics by [[Chris Mosdell]], whose sci-fi themes often depicted a human condition alienated by dystopic futures, much like the emerging [[cyberpunk]] movement in fiction at that time. One of the album's major singles, and one of the band's biggest international hits, was "[[Behind the Mask (Yellow Magic Orchestra song)|Behind the Mask]]", which YMO had first produced in 1978 for a [[Seiko]] [[Quartz clock|quartz]] [[wristwatch]] commercial,<ref name="discogs_ucymo">{{cite web|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra: UC YMO|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Yellow-Magic-Orchestra-UC-YMO/release/1282322|access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> and then for ''Solid State Survivor'' with lyrics penned by [[Chris Mosdell]].

===1984–1993: Breakup and brief reunion===
The band had paused their group activities by 1984. After the release of their musical motion picture ''Propaganda'', the three members had returned to their solo careers. They were careful to avoid saying they had "split up", preferring to use the Japanese phrase meaning {{Nihongo|"spreading out"|散開|sankai}}, and the trio continued to play on each other's recordings and made guest appearances at live shows. Takahashi, in particular, would play the band's material in his concerts. Meanwhile, Sakamoto would gain international success for his work as a solo artist, actor, and [[film composer]],<ref name="billboard_1996">{{citation|title=Q&A With Ryuichi Sakamoto: Pop Pioneer And Producer And Award-Winning Soundtrack Composer|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 31, 1996|volume=108|issue=35|issn=0006-2510|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA72}}</ref> winning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] awards.<ref name="boston_1998"/>

===2002–present: Post-breakup and reformation===
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}

The early 2000s saw Hosono and Takahashi reunited in a project called [[Sketch Show (band)|Sketch Show]]. On a number of occasions Ryuichi Sakamoto has joined in on Sketch Show performances and recording sessions. He later proposed they rename the group Human Audio Sponge when he participates. Barcelona performance at Sonar festival and Wild Sketch Show DVDs chronicle these reunions, and include a tongue-in-cheek Japanese text-only history of the group that spans to 2036.

The band have reunited in 2007 for an advertising campaign for [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] Lager which lampooned their longevity and charted No.1 on various Japanese digital download charts (including [[iTunes Store]] chart) with the song "Rydeen 79/07", released on Sakamoto's new label [[Avex Trax|commmons]]. Recently performing live as Human Audio Sponge; Hosono, Sakamoto, and Takahashi did a live performance together as Yellow Magic Orchestra for the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]], [[Live Earth concert, Kyoto|Kyoto, event]] on July 7, 2007, which raised money and awareness of a "climate in crisis".

In August 2007, the band once again reformed, taking the name HASYMO or HAS/YMO, combining the names of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their first single under this name, "Rescue", was written for the film [[Appleseed EX Machina]]. They released a new two song single titled "The City of Light/Tokyo Town Pages" on August 6, 2008. HASYMO played two live concerts in Europe in the summer of 2008, one at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London on June 15, as part of the [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] festival of music curated by [[Massive Attack]] and another in [[Gijón]], Spain, on the 19th. Although the primary YMO members (Yukihiro Takahashi, Haruomi Hosono, and Ryuichi Sakamoto) are effectively known as HASYMO and played both these concerts, these concerts were billed simply as "YMO" but featured only 4 YMO songs in each concert while the rest of the concert featured Sketch Show, HASYMO music and member's solo works.

In August 2009, the band played the World Happiness festival in Japan, featuring many Japanese artists. The band closed the night, and confirmed that "Yellow Magic Orchestra" is their official name, dropping the HASYMO title.

==Musical style and development==

While their contemporaries in [[Düsseldorf]], and later Detroit, were using synthesizer technology to create bleak [[dystopia]]n music, YMO introduced a more "joyous and liberating" approach to electronic music. According to Sakamoto, they were "tired" of Japanese musicians imitating [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Music of the United States|American music]] at the time and so they wanted to "make something very original from Japan."<ref name="sfweekly_interview"/> Kraftwerk was particularly an influence on Sakamoto, who heard the band in the mid-1970s and later introduced them to his fellow band members.<ref name="sfweekly_interview"/> They were impressed with Kraftwerk's "very formalized" style but wanted to avoid imitating their "very German" approach. He described Kraftwerk's music as "theoretical, very focused, simple and minimal and strong".<ref name="geeta_disco">{{cite web|author=Geeta Dayal|publisher=The Original Soundtrack|access-date=June 3, 2011|title='Studio 84': Digging into the History of Disco in India|date=August 29, 2010|url=http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/2010/08/studio-84-the-history-of-disco-in-india/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728094952/http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/2010/08/studio-84-the-history-of-disco-in-india/|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Their alternative template for electronic pop was less [[Minimalistic music|minimalistic]], made more varying use of synthesizer lines, introduced "fun-loving and breezy" sounds,<ref name="bogdanov_565">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All music guide to electronica: the definitive guide to electronic music|year=2001|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Backbeat Books]]|isbn=0-87930-628-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJNXLSBlL7IC&pg=PT516|edition=4th|page=565}}</ref> and placed a strong emphasis on [[melody]]<ref name="sfweekly_interview"/> in contrast to Kraftwerk's statuesque "robot pop".<ref>{{allMusic|id=p4706|label=Kraftwerk}}</ref>
