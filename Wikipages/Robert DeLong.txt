== Music career ==
DeLong started as a drummer for [[indie rock]] bands<ref name=leveled /> but added more electronic elements to his compositions following his exposure to their use at [[rave]]s.<ref name=ascap /> DeLong is notable for using video-game peripherals, such as a [[Wii remote]] and a [[joystick]], connected to a [[MIDI]] interface, to modify his sound. He cites as influences [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Modest Mouse]], Dreamers, and [[Boards of Canada]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmj.com/feature/robert-delong-going-global/|title=Robert DeLong: Going Global|first=Nick|last=Neyland|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=2 March 2013|publisher=CMJ}}</ref> He released his first full-length album, ''Just Movement'', on [[Glassnote Records]] on 5 February 2013.  His sound has been described by ''Wired'' Magazine as a merger of "electronic dance music, alt rock, and vocals into tracks that are poppy enough to make you move but dissonant enough to be interesting."<ref>{{cite news|last=Capps|first=Rob|title=Robert DeLong Knows the Cheat Code to Make You Dance|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/03/robert-delong-music-gaming/|accessdate=20 March 2013|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=15 March 2013}}</ref> At live performances, facepaint is offered to fans; volunteer local artists organized and led by DeLong's longtime partner, visual artist Heidi Callaway, do the actual facepainting. Facepaint is a regular fixture of DeLong's performances and creates a sense of community amongst fans.  His equipment and clothing feature an orange "X" logo; this same logo, or a variant of it, is often painted on his face and those in attendance.<ref name=digilove />
