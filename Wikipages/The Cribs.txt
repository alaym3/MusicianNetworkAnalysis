'''The Cribs''' are a [[English people|British]] [[indie rock]] band originally from [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]] that formed in 2001. The band consists of twins [[Gary Jarman|Gary]] and [[Ryan Jarman]] and their younger brother [[Ross Jarman]]. They were subsequently joined by ex-[[The Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] who was a formal member of the group from 2008 until 2011.

The band, who first became active on the concert circuit in 2002, were initially tied to other like-minded UK bands of that time, most notably [[The Libertines]], by a British music press that were looking for a 'British rearguard' to the wave of popular US alternative rock bands of the time. They had outgrown this tag by the time of the commercial success of their third LP. In 2008, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine described the band as "The biggest cult band in the UK".

In 2012, the band's 10th anniversary year, they were honoured with the ''Spirit of Independence'' award at the annual [[Q Awards]]. Several months later, they received the ''Outstanding Contribution to Music'' award at the annual [[NME Awards]].

As of 2017, their last 4 albums have charted in the UK Top 10.

==History==
===Formation and early years (2001–2003)===
The Cribs were formed in late 2001 as a recording project for the three brothers. After recording a demo and garnering label interest, the band started playing live around this time, at venues like the [[Brudenell Social Club]] in Leeds, and "squats and warehouse parties" with artists such as [[Calvin Johnston]], [[Subway Sect]], [[Herman Dune]], and [[Ballboy (band)|Ballboy]]. They also released a split 7" single on Leeds based garage/riot grrrl/punk label [[Squirrel Records]] during this period with former Shove/Boyskout member Jen Schande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squirrelrecords.co.uk/artists/ |title=Squirrel Records official site |publisher=Squirrelrecords.co.uk |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Limited to 300 copies on blue vinyl the record is now a rarity that sells for upwards of $150 on eBay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/160681606965 |title=THE CRIBS / JEN SCHANDE 7" vinyl single – Baby Don't Sweat / You and I (2003) |publisher=eBay |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> According to [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] magazine, 'On the strength of one demo, the rush to find the UK Strokes saw the three-piece fielding calls from major labels, pluggers and label managers' in 2002.<ref name=mojooct>[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]], EMAP publishing, October 2009 – pages 44–49, article 'State of Independence' by Lois Wilson</ref> After several high-profile support slots, the band signed to the fledgling independent label [[Wichita Recordings]] in 2003 "we thought (they) were great because they sounded a bit like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and had a big hook. We went to see them at the Metro on Oxford Street and completely fell in love with them. They seemed like such an obvious pop band. Every song sounded like a single" – Mark Bowen, Wichita Recordings.<ref name="Ten Years of Wichita Recordings">{{cite news|author=Mark Bowen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/08/ten-years-wichita-recordings |title=Ten Years of Wichita Recordings |work=The Guardian|date= 9 July 2010|access-date=8 February 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

===''The Cribs'' (2004)===
After signing with Wichita Recordings, the band began re-recording many of the songs from the original demo, as well as several new tracks for what would be their debut record. Sessions began in [[London]] with [[Chicago]] based [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] musician [[Bobby Conn]] producing, after the band had supported him on some UK dates and impressed him "They had this cassette demo they had recorded on a boom-box, I suggested overdubs, they were too kitchen-sink for overdubs. I tried handclaps, they were 'not sure about handclaps'. It was all 'Keep it real'" – Bobby Conn.<ref name=mojooct /> Then sessions moved to [[Toe Rag Studios]] in Hackney with the band self-producing. The album was completed in 7 days, live to 8-track tape, with Ed Deegan engineering.

Released on 8 March 2004, the album found early supporters in the [[NME]], who commented on its "supreme pop melodies", and referred to it as "lo-fi, hi fun" giving it an 8/10 review.<ref>[[NME]] Magazine, IPC Media, 8 March 2004 – Album reviews section, by Tim Jonze</ref> [[Lo-fi]] would be a term that would follow the band around for the next few years, and something that became synonymous with the group. Again, from the NME in 2011: "Recorded in a week, it's the definition of indie lo-fi. But not willful indie lo-fi; the scratches, clangs and gawwumps all heard here are genuinely the product of the trio's shoestring methods rather than the usual contrived fuzz that bands spend ages poring over beaten up eight-tracks to achieve".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&p=11565&title=the_cribs_rank_the_albums&more=1&c=1 |title=The Cribs:Rank The Albums |work=NME|date=9 December 2009 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Radio 1 DJ [[Steve Lamacq]] was also an early champion. Lois Wilson of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine described the album in 2009 as "intelligent lyrics on a background of clipped guitars and tumbling drums, with nods to [[The Strokes]], [[Beat Happening]], and [[C86 (album)|C86]]'s inept charm"<ref name=mojooct />
Three singles were released from the album – the limited edition 7" only "Another Number"/"Baby Don't Sweat" in November 2003, followed by first single proper "You Were Always the One", which climbed to No.&nbsp;2 in the indie charts. "What About Me" was the third and final single from the album, again making the indie top 10. The Cribs toured extensively throughout 2004 and into 2005, both as headliners as well as supporting artists like old friend [[Bobby Conn]], [[Death Cab For Cutie]] and [[The Libertines]]. Over the campaign they toured the UK and Ireland, [[Europe]], Japan, and the United States, as well as several significant international festival appearances such as [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], [[Summersonic]], [[T in the Park]] and [[Pukkelpop]] amongst others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2004 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2004 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143129/http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2004 |archive-date=11 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though only a moderate underground success at the time "Another Number" has gone on to become one of the band's most enduring 'hits' – seldom being left off the set-list and usually accompanied by a full crowd sing-along of the signature, repeated guitar riff.<ref name="Ten Years of Wichita Recordings"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJxMcBXr708 |title=YouTube footage of crowd sing-along |via=YouTube |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

===''The New Fellas'' (2005–2006)===
After concluding touring duties for the first record, the band were taken off the road to start writing the follow up. However, the Cribs decided they still wanted to tour and took to posting their phone numbers and email addresses on the internet, professing to play anywhere for fuel money and a crate of beer. This [[DIY]] approach is something the band and label now feel was a key factor in their success, as it helped nurture a very strong, passionate fanbase.<ref name="Ten Years of Wichita Recordings"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.live4ever.uk.com/2011/05/interview-review-the-cribs-on-their-first-gig-post-johnny-marr/ |title=The Cribs on their First Gig Post Johnny Marr |publisher=Live4ever.uk.com |date=25 May 2011 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

''[[The New Fellas]]'', the band's second album release, was recorded with [[Edwyn Collins]], the singer-songwriter and guitarist from Glasgow's influential [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] in [[London]] at his own West Heath Studios. Again, it was a comparatively unpolished record sonically, as both the producer Collins and the band themselves were achieving sounds similar to those heard on the Orange Juice records. This was, however, the intention and the reason the band and producer were put together. "They had definite ideas what they wanted the record to sound like...They had this work ethic, there was nothing spoiled about them – they were proper indie; everything done on a shoe-string and they just got on with it....they were tremendous" – Edwyn Collins.<ref name=mojooct /> One song, "Haunted", was even recorded on [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] beach on a whim, after hearing a [[Steve Martin]] ukulele duet recorded on a beach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gimmebadvibes.com/index.php?/tctd/interviews/ryan_jarman_answers_the_questions_of_doom |title=Ryan Jarman answers the Questions of Doom &#124; Bad Vibes |publisher=Gimmebadvibes.com |access-date=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311235320/http://gimmebadvibes.com/index.php?%2Ftctd%2Finterviews%2Fryan_jarman_answers_the_questions_of_doom |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first release from the record was the single "[[Hey Scenesters!]]" on 18 April 2005. It reached no. 27 in the UK charts, and started their run of 7 consecutive top 40 singles. The album followed on 20 June 2005 although it had leaked onto the internet several months prior to the official release date, hampering its first week sales. The record has however, gone on to be certified Silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]], and in a recent poll held by the [[NME]] was proved to be the overall fans favourite record.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The other singles released from the record were "[[Mirror Kissers]]", "Martell", and non-album track "[[You're Gonna Lose Us]]" (produced by [[Bernard Butler]]), which was paired with "The Wrong Way To Be" as a AA side.  The extensive New Fellas world tour took in several UK tours, Europe, United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Scandinavia, and their first trip to Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2005 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2005 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002105100/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2005 |archive-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2006 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2006 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002105223/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2006 |archive-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They appeared at numerous festivals at this time, including an appearance on the main stage at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] (becoming the first band to ever progress through all three stages in consecutive years), headlining the tent at [[T in the Park]], [[Fuji Rock]] festival in Japan as well as an extensive USA arena tour with [[Death Cab for Cutie]] and [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]. A European tour during this period with ex [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] man [[Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks]] would introduce Gary to his future wife [[Joanna Bolme]].

Shortly before their appearance at the [[Fuji Rock]] festival, the Cribs released a Japan-only mini album called ''Arigato Cockers'', made up of B-sides and rarities from both the first and second albums.

In their year-end issue, the NME made The New Fellas the No.&nbsp;11 album of the year, and Hey Scenesters a single of the year.<ref>[[NME]] Magazine, IPC Media, Year end list 2005. 3/12/05 – page 11(album), page 35(single)</ref>

===''Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever'' (2007–2008)===
At the conclusion of The New Fellas campaign, the Cribs signed a major label deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] – though they remained on Wichita in the UK at the bands insistence.  The subsequent album, ''[[Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever]]'' saw the band finally take steps to progress forth from their '[[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]' roots, being recorded in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada with [[Alex Kapranos]] of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] as producer. The band and producer had met during the US tour the bands did together with Death Cab for Cutie, and hit it off immediately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/05/17/the-cribs-find-a-home-with-franzs-alex-kapranos |title=The Cribs Find a Home with Alex Kapranos |publisher=Spinner.com |date=17 May 2007 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> The album was mixed by [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] ([[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Foo Fighters]]). They collaborated with [[Lee Ranaldo]] of [[Sonic Youth]] on the track "Be Safe" – Ranaldo contributing his [[spoken word]] poetry to the band's music.

Prior to the record's release the Cribs took in a run of small UK club dates to preview songs from the new record. This is documented in the first Cribs documentary ''Leave Too Neat''. The first cut from the album was the single '[[Men's Needs]]', released on 7 May. It proved to be the band's first breakthrough with mainstream radio and reached no. 17 in the UK charts, becoming their biggest hit to date. The accompanying video, filmed in [[Hollywood]] by director [[Diane Martel]] has achieved over 7 million [[YouTube]] views to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCNTYi9fHuo |title=YouTube video for 'Mens Needs' |via=YouTube |date=12 April 2007 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

The album was released on 21 May 2007, and entered the UK album charts at No.&nbsp;13.

Touring began at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] on 30 March for the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. The rest of 2007 and most of 2008 was spent on the road promoting the record, taking in extensive UK and European touring, several United States and Canada tours, Japan, and the band's first trip out to Mexico for a main stage appearance at the MX Beat Festival, as well as some later headline shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2007 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2007 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002105108/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2007 |archive-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name= gigs>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2008 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2008 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002104929/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2008 |archive-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During their US touring schedules they appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.

The second single to be released from the record was '[[Moving Pictures (The Cribs song)|Moving Pictures]]', again charting in the UK Top 40, and then later a 7" only release of "[[I'm a Realist]]". The latter was backed with a cover of [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] song "[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Bastards of Young]]", a band the Cribs cite as a large influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/08/the_cribs_-_new.html |title=The Cribs – new album, MP3, video & shows w/ Johnny Marr |publisher=BrooklynVegan.com |date=19 August 2009 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Another non-album single '[[Don't You Wanna Be Relevant? / Our Bovine Public|Don't You Wanna be Relevant?]]' was paired with album cut "Our Bovine Public" and again climbed to the UK top 40. There were numerous festival slots around this time including main stage slots at [[Lollapalooza]], [[T in the Park]], and [[V festival]], as well as returning to Fuji Rock, and a first time appearance at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] amongst others. In November 2007 the Cribs were invited by a re-formed [[The Sex Pistols]] to play with them for three nights at [[Brixton Academy]] in celebration of the 30-year anniversary of ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/daily-gossip/32534 |title=Sex Pistols welcome The Cribs on Tour |work=NME|date=15 November 2007 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> In December the band announced three intimate shows at their old haunt the Brudenell Social Club in aid of [[cystic fibrosis]] where they would play all three albums to date in sequence with secret unannounced support bands each night ([[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Kate Nash]], and [[Kaiser Chiefs]] respectively). This was documented for the band's second DVD, the 3 disc ''Live at the Brudenell Social Club''.
In the year-end issues "Men's Needs" was named third-best track of 2007 by NME<ref>[[NME]] Magazine, IPC Media, Year end list 2007. 15/12/07 page 37</ref> with the album coming in at No.&nbsp;9,<ref>[[NME]] Magazine, IPC Media, Year end list 2007. 15/12/07 – page 26</ref> Track of the Year 2007 by the Metro newspaper and making the annual 100 best tracks list in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the USA.

2008 began with the Cribs being nominated for 4 awards at the annual [[NME awards]] ceremony (Best British Band, Best Live Band, Best Track and Hero of the Year for [[Ryan Jarman]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme-awards/33925 |title=Shockwaves NME Awards 2008:All The Nominations |work=NME|date=30 January 2008 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Through this they were asked to headline the annual [[NME Awards Tour]], which they undertook through January and February featuring some of the band's largest headline shows up to that point and culminating in a show at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|o2 Arena]] in London. They also made a live appearance at the Awards ceremony itself, playing new single '[[I'm a Realist]]' and a cover of '[[Panic (The Smiths song)|Panic]]' by the Smiths, featuring their new guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] (of the aforementioned band), who had been guesting with them throughout the tour.
Another USA tour followed this, and then some more festival appearances including main stage slots at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2008|Isle of Wight Festival]], [[Rockness]], [[Primavera Festival]], [[Fuji Rock]] and [[Sziget Festival|Sziget]], as well as a headline appearance on the [[John Peel]] Stage at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], and headlining the second stage at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].<ref name=gigs />

In April 2018, the album was certified Gold in the UK by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] for sales over 100,000, becoming the first album certified Gold by the [[BRIT Awards]].

===''Ignore the Ignorant'' (2009–2010)===
After a chance meeting with [[Johnny Marr]] (at the time a member of [[Modest Mouse]]) in [[Portland, OR]] the Cribs and Johnny became close friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/02721-johnny-marr-the-jarman-brothers-interview-the-cribs-the-smiths-and-the-trouble-with-indie |title=Johnny Marr & The Jarmans: The Cribs, The Smiths and the Trouble With Indie |publisher=The Quietus |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Once Modest Mouse completed touring duties for their record, the Cribs and Johnny started to hang around and jam together – "It's been going well and it would be shame to cut it short, the original intention was to be doing an EP" the band told [[BBC 6 Music]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=40401 |title=The Cribs and Johnny Marr to Release an Album? |publisher=Gigwise.com |date=30 January 2008 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> However it was later announced that they would be working on an album together and that Johnny had joined as a full-time member of the group.

Much of the remainder of 2008 was spent writing new material in [[Portland, OR]], [[Manchester]] and [[Wakefield]], followed by a short UK tour taking in [[Glasgow ABC]], [[Bradford]] St. Georges Hall, two nights at [[Manchester Ritz]], and [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] in [[London]] to road-test some of the new songs before recording commenced. Studio time was booked for March 2009 in [[Los Angeles]] with veteran producer [[Nick Launay]] ([[Nick Cave]], [[Public Image Ltd.|PIL]], [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Nick_Launay_Interview.html |title=Interview with Nick Launay |publisher=HitQuarters |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> [[Ross Jarman]] performed most of the drum tracks for the recording with a broken wrist after a skateboard accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drummerszone.com/news/newsItem.php?type=1&n01ID=9422 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731100618/http://www.drummerszone.com/news/newsItem.php?type=1&n01ID=9422 |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Ross Jarman has Recorded Album with Broken Wrist |publisher=Drummerszone.com |access-date=8 February 2012 }}</ref> Promotion for the Ignore the Ignorant album came in the form of an intimate "alternative Leeds/Reading show" at HMV in Leeds. This was scheduled as the same weekend as the Reading Leeds festival. The band played several songs from their new album as well as some old favourites. Afterwards, Ryan Jarman could be seen browsing the CD's in HMV and being available for fans to meet him.

Preceded by the single '[[Cheat on Me]]', the album ''[[Ignore the Ignorant]]'' was released on 7 September 2009, and scored the Cribs their first UK Top Ten album. Released the same week that [[The Beatles]] re-issued their entire 13 LP back-catalogue, ''Ignore the Ignorant'' managed to out-sell all but two of them to chart at number 8, something the band described as "surreal". Touring began with a headline slot at the White Air festival in [[Brighton]] followed by a UK tour of large halls. The band then went on to tour Japan (including a show at [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] with [[Arctic Monkeys]]) then on to [[South Korea]] where they headlined the Grand Mint festival at the [[Olympic Park, Seoul]]. Next was a United States/Canada tour, as well as a European arena tour with [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] before the Cribs returned to the UK for their largest headline shows to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2009 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2009 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002104933/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2009 |archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref>

In December 2009, ''Ignore the Ignorant'' was placed at number 11 in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's "Albums of the Year", and at number 7 in ''[[The Fly (magazine)|The Fly]]'s'' "Albums of the Year". [[NME]] also placed it at No.&nbsp;30 in their end of year list,<ref>[[NME]] magazine, IPC Media, Year end list 2009. 12 December 2009 – page 27 (album) page 36 (single)</ref> as well as making "Cheat on Me" a track of the year. In Japan, ''Crossbeat'' magazine placed it at No.&nbsp;8 in its "Albums of 2009" list, whilst ''Music Magazine'' called it the No.&nbsp;1 album of 2009. Both magazines are leading publications in Japan. At the same time, ''[[The New Fellas]]'' was named an "Album of the Century" by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''.

2010 began with another extensive United States and Canada tour, before heading off for dates in Australia and New Zealand. Festival appearances including Glastonbury, Lollapalooza, Fuji Rock, Benecassim, Sziget and Pukkelpop amongst others followed. 
During this time the band were invited to support [[Aerosmith]] at two arena shows in Spain and France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2010 |title=The Cribs Official Gigography 2010 |publisher=Thecribs.com |access-date=8 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002104940/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2010 |archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref>
For [[Record Store Day]] 2010 the Cribs released "So Hot Now" as a split 7" single with Portland, OR band [[The Thermals]] on legendary riot grrrl label [[Kill Rock Stars]].
On 9 August 2010, [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]] announced during his show that he would be playing a brand new Cribs song that night. The very next day, '[[Housewife (single)|Housewife]]' was released officially on iTunes. No one, from music industry insiders to the band's fans, had any idea that a new single was being geared up until that moment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crackintheroad.com/music/2475-review-the-cribs-housewife/ |title=The Cribs:Housewife |publisher=Crackintheroad.com |date=12 August 2010 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> The cover art featured Ryan and Gary in [[drag (clothing)|drag]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thumbsforhire.co.uk/?p=2523/ |title=A Tale of Two Housewives |publisher=Thumbsforhire.co.uk |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Later that month the band appeared on the main stage once again at the Reading and Leeds festivals to close the album campaign. These would be Marr's last shows with the Cribs.

The Cribs announced the title of their fifth studio album as ''[[In the Belly of the Brazen Bull]]'' and its track-listing on 14 February 2012.

On 14 February, [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]] premiered the first taster from the album, '[[Chi-Town (single)|Chi-Town]]' on his radio show and played the song 3 times. During this time, both the band and the song title were trending on [[Twitter]]. Shortly after the announcement was made, the band embarked on a quick UK tour, to preview the new material and promote the upcoming single, slated for April. In March, the band headed out on a tour of the United States, concluding in April, and later that month released the first official single from the new album 'Come On, Be A No-One'. A European tour followed, and then a full-scale UK tour in May – kicking off with a performance at the 2012 [[Camden Crawl]]. It was during this tour that the band were introduced to [[Turner Prize]] winning artist [[Martin Creed]], who was acting as support band.<ref name="thecribs.com">{{cite web |url=http://thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2012 |title=Gigs |publisher=The Cribs |access-date=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212937/http://www.thecribs.com/gigs.php?year=2012 |archive-date=6 May 2014}}</ref> The album was released on 7 May 2012 and would provide the band with their second UK Top 10 record, charting at number 9.

On 7 February 2017 The Cribs announced a 10th anniversary tour in honour of their third album. The "Men's Needs, Women's Needs, FOREVER" tour was initially scheduled to consist of seven dates in large venues across the UK.

===''Night Network'' (2019–present)===
Following the release of their fourth consecutive UK top 10 album ''[[24-7 Rock Star Shit]]'', the band almost immediately parted company with their long time UK management and found themselves stuck in what Gary described as "legal morass", unable to record or release new music. This is because the band had belatedly discovered that the rights to the back catalogue from earlier in their career was owned by other parties thanks to various deals that they were unaware of. As a result, the band – who were now managing themselves – decided to focus on gaining ownership because there would be no point in signing a new deal, making a new record and touring as long as someone else owned their music.<ref name=Wright>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/09/18/the-renewed-fellas-the-cribs-september-2020-night-network-interview|title=The Renewed Fellas: The Cribs|first=Lisa|last=Wright|publisher=DIY|date=18 September 2020|access-date=19 September 2020}}</ref>

What followed was an eighteen month period of inactivity, resulting in 2019 being the only year since the band's inception in 2002 whereby the band did not play a live concert, following their final gig of the ''[[24-7 Rock Star Shit]]'' tour in Glasgow in September 2018.<ref>[https://twitter.com/thecribs/status/1211921030194708480?s=20] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>
 
In a position of uncertainty about how to continue beyond the already-booked gigs, following a show where The Cribs had supported [[Foo Fighters]] in Manchester at the Etihad Stadium in June 2018, [[Dave Grohl]] learned of the band's struggles and offered for the band to use his Studio 606.<ref>[http://crashrecords.co.uk/product/the-cribs-night-network-various-formats-pre-order/] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

Following the successful resolution of their back catalogue ownership, the band was set to sign a major label deal. But then it emerged that there was yet other people claiming ownership of their music, and so they had to go through another legal battle from September 2019 to February 2020 while working on the new album.<ref name=Wright />

During 2020, the band was active on Twitter to participate in [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]]' "Listening Parties", offering behind the scenes insight for their most commercially successful album ''[[Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever]]'' on 7 April <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/pages/replay/feed_14.html|title=Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever - The Cribs|website=Timstwitterlisteningparty.com|access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref> and due to the positive response, followed up with another listening party of fan favourite ''[[The New Fellas]]'' on 28 May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/pages/replay/feed_185.html|title=The New Fellas - The Cribs|website=Timstwitterlisteningparty.com|access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref>

On 8 June, the band announced on their social media pages, with four hours notice, their first live performance in nearly two years. This turned out to be a pre-recorded webcam broadcast of "Be Safe", featuring [[Lee Ranaldo]] performing his spoken word part, from their residences across the world (Ryan in [[Queens]], New York, Gary in [[Portland, Oregon]], Ross in [[Wakefield]] and Lee in [[Manhattan]], New York).<ref>[https://twitter.com/thecribs/status/1269887317726158848?s=20] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

On 12 August 2020, a day over three years since their last new material ''[[24-7 Rock Star Shit]]'', the band's social media profile pictures changed to a stylised test card. The following day on 13 August 2020, the band announced their return with a new song to be broadcast on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/thecribs/status/1293836175900368896?s=20] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref> The song turned out to be lead single "Running Into You" and subsequently the band announced new album ''[[Night Network (album)|Night Network]]'' to be released on 13 November 2020, along with artwork, tracklisting and a video for "Running Into You" starring [[Sam Riley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/08/the-cribs-night-network-album-running-into-you-single/|title=The Cribs announce new album Night Network, share "Running Into You": Stream|website=Consequenceofsound.net|date=13 August 2020|access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref>

Released into the UK COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, the band had all of their scheduled headline touring to support the album delayed. The album release was therefore celebrated with a socially distanced performance at Liverpools legendary [[Cavern Club]] on the 21st November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fab-the-cribs-announce-livestream-gig-from-liverpools-legendary-cavern-club-2809966|title=Fab: The Cribs announce livestream gig from Liverpool's legendary Cavern Club|date=5 November 2020}}</ref> This performance was streamed worldwide as a [[Pay-per-view|PPV]] via the Veeps platform.

On July 15, 2021, The Cribs released a cover of the [[Comet Gain]] song "Fingernailed For You" as part of the [[Kill Rock Stars]] label's 30th anniversary covers compilation "Stars Rock Kill (Rock Stars)".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-the-cribs-cover-of-comet-gains-finger-nailed-for-you-2994159|title = Listen to the Cribs' cover of Comet Gain's 'Finger-Nailed for You'|date = 15 July 2021}}</ref>

The fanzine also shares close links with fellow [[Wakefield]] independent music fans at ''Rhubarb Bomb'', in addition to ''Bonus Cupped'', a left-leaning, travel and [[Punk subculture|punk]] publication from [[Bristol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhubarbbomb.blogspot.co.uk/ |title=Rhubarb Bomb Fanzine |access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> Moreover, ''Kind Words from the Broken Hearted'' supports other forms of independent music, including [[Comet Gain]], [[Edwyn Collins]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] to name but three, welcoming diverse forms of the art but keen to eschew a celebratory tone that pervades contemporary [[music journalism]].
