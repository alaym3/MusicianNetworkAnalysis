The official YSL Records Instagram page created a large stir after announcing a project titled ''[[Slime Language]]'', which ended up being a compilation album by YSL Records. A phrase commonly mentioned in songs by YSL affiliates is "SLATT" (Slime Love All The Time). The acronym was created by YSL Records founder Young Thug, and was first used back in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/what-does-slatt-mean?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3f2df425d9099b93866a95634149c86ada8e0f07-1585970694-0-AX9sR9IUCbDnWZWZFn-nxzWWkLDFbn3M4E5mJwgnXpT8K5jUjwW6ZNSzkGbwdcveisojqTiZQv2H6FJd0_E-jh5lmadmudZMHnvh3SoFQ73Maq5R2Wl9lnh2LeXpg8DFFdrrxaEd0C13tUV5JPcBOtxtHmTe6kuVQYr1k4DP7OlJ7Qw4d2jN6oxQX_4xXgKAJE2S-R_-vNkvs3nH0wSYYoLa83lv6vHCbaEQ-l7-OqZ5JJ6iX5B2fw8uKoDqts1xJJNNcTPX3sCm77HT_xHCRAyBJ8mSRQgI5EyAiW1x63sqQ_H-AevzT8-IJmBnOJpC8lP_Ryb_SpVWdtJBJyBCq__ajHdO1PgiucFsfYvtarP-|title=What Does "Slatt" Mean?|website=genius.com}}</ref> CEO, Young Thug, also launched the "SPIDER" clothing brand on December 27, 2019, which has been co-signed by YSL affiliates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/12/29/young-thug-clothing-spider|title=Young Thug Launches Clothing Brand SPIDER|website=thefader.com}}</ref> Many artists on the record label grew up near Cleveland Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia like Lil Keed, Young Thug, and Cheat Code.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2013/05/08/gen-f-young-thug|title=GEN F: Young Thug|website=thefader.com}}</ref>
