To date, Anderson has released over forty albums, with his latest full length, ''[[Astronaut Meets Appleman]]'', released in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Record Label: Domino Records|url=http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/singles/07-05-13/that-might-well-be-it-darling/|publisher=Dominorecordsco.com|access-date=23 July 2014}}</ref> Anderson is also a member of Scottish-Canadian band [[The Burns Unit]]. In 2011, Anderson's collaborative album with [[Jon Hopkins]], ''[[Diamond Mine (King Creosote & Jon Hopkins album)|Diamond Mine]]'', was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] and the [[Scottish Album of the Year Award]]. ''Astronaut Meets Appleman'' was also longlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year Award.

==Musical career==
After having featured in Scottish bands Skuobhie Dubh Orchestra and Khartoum Heroes, in 1995 Kenny Anderson launched the [[Fence Collective|Fence]] record label and began recording albums under the name '''King Creosote'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/kingcreosotex12x09x06 |title=King Creosote – Interview |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref>

King Creosote was one of the original artists to contribute a t-shirt design for the [[Yellow Bird Project]] charity initiative, back in 2006. Anderson's design features an accordion, inscribed with the name "FENCE"; a reference to his DIY record label collective.<ref>{{cite news

Anderson founded Fence Records alongside [[The Pictish Trail|Johnny Lynch]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fencerecords.com/artists/the-pictish-trail/ |title=The Pictish Trail profile |access-date=16 October 2010 |publisher=Fence Records |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003102031/http://www.fencerecords.com/artists/the-pictish-trail/ |archive-date= 3 October 2010 }}</ref> but stepped back from day-to-day running of the label in 2010.

In recent years, Anderson has teamed up with [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]] who have co-released some of his albums. He also spent some time on [[Warner Music Group|Warner]] subsidiary, [[679 Artists|679]], which gave him major label backing for the first time. His increasing frustration with the music industry and how digital recordings are becoming throwaway commodities led him to release his material in small, vinyl only runs which were largely only available at concerts.

To this end, ''[[KC Rules OK]]'' was re-released in 2006 with different versions of some songs, and a version of the album called "Chorlton and the Wh'earlies" recorded with [[The Earlies]] was available with some purchases. ''[[Bombshell (King Creosote album)|Bombshell]]'' was released with an additional disc, a DVD film of King Creosote and friends on tour.

In the 2007 film ''[[Hallam Foe]]'' two of his songs, "The Someone Else" and "King Bubbles in Sand", were featured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/albums/11-12-07/hallam-foe--original-soundtrack/ |title=Domino &#124; Albums &#124; Hallam Foe – Original Soundtrack |publisher=Dominorecordco.com |access-date=31 December 2011}}</ref>

In late 2009, Anderson released a new studio album ''[[Flick the Vs]]'', and crafted a performance only album, entitled ''[[My Nth Bit of Strange in Umpteen Years]]''. Anderson also contributed to the ''[[Cold Seeds]]'' collaborative album along with Frances Donnelly of Animal Magic Tricks, and Neil Pennycook and Pete Harvey from [[Meursault (band)|Meursault]]; which was released on the Edinburgh-based [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Song, by Toad Records]]. Anderson, Donnelly and Pennycook all wrote songs for the project, which all four performers then recorded together; each singer often taking the lead vocal role on a song written by another of the artists. The album was given a special limited release at the [[Fence Records]] Homegame Festival in [[Anstruther]], Fife in March 2010, before a general release was announced for June 2010.

In 2011, Anderson attended the [[SxSW]] Music Festival and played a number of shows, two of which featured fellow Scottish attendees [[Kid Canaveral]] as his backing band. The same year, Anderson released ''[[Diamond Mine (King Creosote & Jon Hopkins album)|Diamond Mine]]'', a collaborative album with [[electronica]] composer [[Jon Hopkins]], to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]], with Anderson stating, "It feels like this is the beginning of something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums, oh my God! It means, I can still do this, it's not over."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jude Rogers | author-link = Jude Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/30/king-creosote-jon-hopkins-diamond-geezers |title=King Creosote and Jon Hopkins: Diamond geezers &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 30 August 2011|access-date=31 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> The duo subsequently released an EP, ''[[Honest Words]]''.

In 2013, Anderson released ''[[That Might Well Be It, Darling]]'', a full-band re-recording of his limited edition vinyl album ''[[That Might Be It, Darling]]''.

In 2014, Anderson created the soundtrack for a film about Scotland for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. ''[[From Scotland with Love]]'' is a poetic film exploring the history of the country, compiled entirely from archive footage with no commentary or narration. Speaking to The Guardian about the creative process, Anderson explained that the film was a long way from the typical "tartan, Highland Games, shortbread kind of tourist film". It was broadcast on [[BBC Scotland]] in June.<ref name="Stuart Aitken">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jun/23/king-creosote-scotland-film-commonwealth-games |title=No tartan, no shortbread – King Creosote portrays a different Scotland |date=23 June 2014|author=Stuart Aitken|work=guardian.co.uk }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Anderson's brothers are also musicians: Ian Anderson (known as Pip Dylan) and Gordon Anderson ([[Lone Pigeon]]) – who is lead singer and main songwriter with [[The Aliens (Scottish band)|The Aliens]]. The three frequently collaborate at live shows and on album releases. He also has a sister living in Australia.

Anderson lives in Fife. He has three daughters: two with his partner, Jenniffer Gordon (a.k.a. musician HMS Ginafore).<ref name="Stuart Aitken" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thumped.com/interviews/king-creosote-im-not-dead-yet.html |title=King Creosote – I'm Not Dead Yet |author=Siobhán Kane |date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830105447/http://thumped.com/interviews/king-creosote-im-not-dead-yet.html |archive-date=30 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://postcardfromfife.com/2013/11/21/king-creosote-interview-new-albums-life-in-fife-and-fence-records/|title=King Creosote interview: new albums, life in Fife and Fence Records|date=21 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085004/http://postcardfromfife.com/2013/11/21/king-creosote-interview-new-albums-life-in-fife-and-fence-records/|archive-date=29 November 2014}}</ref>
