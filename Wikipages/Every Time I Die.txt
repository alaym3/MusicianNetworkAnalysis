(Every Time I Die album)|Hot Damn!]]'' a "total gamechanger" for the genre.<ref name="altbest" /> [[AllMusic]] described their metalcore sound as mixing [[alternative metal]], [[Southern metal]] and [[screamo]].<ref name="amg" /> They have also experimented with [[mathcore]] and [[sludge metal]] at various points in their discography.<ref name="newnoise" /> They are strongly influenced by [[Southern rock]]; frontman [[Keith Buckley]] stated that "the grit of ... Southern rock bands is the one commonality that the band has. It's something we all appreciate and grew up on, in a sense; mainly because it was the type of music that made a coarse poetry out of nature."<ref name="punknews interview" /> Just as the band's sound is chaotic, sharp and manifold, their lyrics are crafted to be strange, [[sarcastic]], and [[sardonic]].<ref name="altbest" /><ref name="punknews interview" />
