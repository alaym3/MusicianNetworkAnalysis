'''3 Inches of Blood''' was a Canadian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in 1999 in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], last consisting of [[Cam Pipes]], Justin Hagberg, Shane Clark, and Ash Pearson, none of whom were original members of the band. They are marked by strong influences from the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement.

==Biography==

===Early years, and ''Battlecry Under a Wintersun''===
The group began when Jamie Hooper, Sunny Dhak, and Bobby Froese, along with Geoff Trawick and Rich Trawick filling in on drums and bass, got together to do a one-off reunion gig for an old group of theirs, but things went so well with writing new material in a traditional metal style that they decided to continue under a new moniker. Rich Trawick's roommate, [[Steve Bays]] (keyboard player for [[Hot Hot Heat]]), heard the demo of the band's first recording and suggested having his friend Cam Pipes overdub some clean vocals to it.<ref name="The Gauntlet">{{cite web|title=The Gauntlet-3 Inches of Blood Bio|publisher=The Gauntlet|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/1147/3-Inches-of-Blood.html|access-date=April 27, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428210454/http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/1147/3-Inches-of-Blood.html| archive-date= April 28, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="Metal Underground.com">{{cite web|title=Metal Underground.com-Interview With Cam Pipes of 3 Inches of Blood|author=darkstar|publisher=Metal Underground.com|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=21126|access-date=April 28, 2007|date=August 19, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070504091331/http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=21126| archive-date= May 4, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> Pipes overdubbed additional vocals to what became the band's first EP, ''[[Sect of the White Worm]],'' and became a permanent band member after the results proved to the rest of the band's liking.<ref name="Rock Eyez">{{cite web|title=Rock Eyez-Interview with Cam Pipes|author=Rademacher, Brian|publisher=Rock Eyez|url=http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-3_inches_of_blood.html|access-date=April 27, 2007|date=April 13, 2005| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611012754/http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-3_inches_of_blood.html| archive-date= June 11, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> Their debut album ''[[Battlecry Under a Wintersun]]'' was recorded in 2002 and released in cooperation with the Teenage Rampage and Fashion Before Function labels. It was later remastered and re-released by the band under their own label, Minion Music. This album had moderate underground success in the Canadian market, ranking on national college radio charts and winning Metal Album of Year at the 2002 [[Canadian Independent Music Awards]]. The band garnered international exposure when its UK distribution label put them on as a support slot for a tour with platinum rock band [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]. This exposure garnered much critical attention and acclaim in the world of underground metal, and they were signed by major label subsidiary [[Roadrunner Records]] in 2004.

===''Advance and Vanquish''===
[[File:3-inches-of-blood-cam.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Cam Pipes live on stage]]
In 2004, Geoff Trawick (original drummer) and brother Rich Trawick (original bass player) left the band following personal differences with the rest of the band and professional differences with Roadrunner Records. Matt Wood of Vancouver doom/sludge/noise band Goatsblood, and Brian Redman replaced them. Soon after, just after recording the band's second album ''Advance and Vanquish'', original guitarists Sunny Dhak and Bob Froese left the band and, with Mike Payette and Matt Wood (who is also an ex-3 Inches of Blood member and was replaced by [[Alexei Rodriguez]]), founded the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Pride Tiger]].<ref name="ChalkedUp">{{cite web|title=ChalkedUp: Work for the Party|author=Barrow, Michael| publisher=ChalkedUp|url=http://www.chalkedup.com/articles/view/97|access-date=April 27, 2007|date=July 10, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015234253/http://chalkedup.com/articles/view/97 |archive-date = October 15, 2007}}</ref>

Dhak and Froese were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a [[black metal]] band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track "Deadly Sinners" from ''[[Advance and Vanquish]]'' appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and in three video games (''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', ''[[Saints Row 2]]'', and ''[[Brütal Legend]]''). This created huge press hype for the band; their popularity skyrocketed and they earned a slot on the 2005 [[Road Rage Tour]] with bands like [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] and [[Chimaira]].

Also in 2005, Justin Hagberg recorded the guitars on the tracks "Dawn of a Golden Age" and "I Don't Wanna Be (A Superhero)" for ''[[Roadrunner United|Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions]]''. In October 2006, at the [[Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre Irvine|Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre]] in [[Irvine, California]], the band opened for [[Iron Maiden]] during the United States leg of their 2006 ''[[A Matter Of Life And Death Tour|A Matter of Life and Death World Tour]].''

===''Fire Up the Blades''===
The band wrote their entire third studio album in [[Tacoma, Washington]] and performed their new songs at various places in Washington. By December 2006, they were recording at Vancouver's [[Armoury Studios]], and announced that it would be titled ''[[Fire Up the Blades]]'', with [[Joey Jordison]], drummer of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] as producer.<ref name="Blabbermouth.net-3 INCHES OF BLOOD Begins Recording New Album">{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth.net-3 INCHES OF BLOOD Begins Recording New Album |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=61936 |access-date=April 27, 2007 |date=November 10, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005758/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=61936 |archive-date=October 1, 2007 }}</ref> A demo of "Goatrider's Horde" which was recorded in Seattle in the spring of 2006 was made available for streaming on Roadrunner's official website, and a demo of "Night Marauders" appeared in the fifth ''Battle Metal'' [[compilation album]] released in issue 161 of the UK magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]''.

The band toured the United States during January and February 2007 in support of [[Cradle of Filth]] with [[The 69 Eyes]] and, in March, toured the UK with [[Biomechanical (band)|Biomechanical]]. On March 22, 2007, the band was confirmed to play the second stage at [[Ozzfest]].<ref name="Blabbermouth.net-OZZFEST 2007:3 INCHES OF BLOOD, DAATH Added To Second-Stage Lineup">{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth.net-OZZFEST 2007:3 INCHES OF BLOOD, DAATH Added To Second-Stage Lineup |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=69199 |access-date=April 27, 2007 |date=March 22, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000044/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=69199 |archive-date=October 1, 2007 }}</ref> On April 6, 2007, the band's website was completely redesigned. Prior to the release of ''Fire Up the Blades'', the band stressed that the album would be "darker, tighter and more dangerous" than their [[Advance and Vanquish|Roadrunner Records debut]].<ref name="Blabbermouth.net-3 INCHES OF BLOOD Working On 'Darker, Tighter And More Dangerous' New Album">{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth.net-3 INCHES OF BLOOD Working On 'Darker, Tighter And More Dangerous' New Album |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=63696 |access-date=April 27, 2007 |date=December 12, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235829/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=63696 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> "This album is heavily influenced by low quality [[beer]], [[bong]] rips and listening to [[black metal]] in the dark", says Hooper.

Harsh vocal duties were taken over by guitarist Justin Hagberg. Hooper did not perform with the band for the whole 2007-08 year. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

At the 2007 [[Hard Rock Hell]] festival in the UK, drummer Alexei Rodriguez got into a fight with [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] drummer [[Nigel Glockler]]. The fight left Glockler with broken glasses and a black eye; the security guards who intervened put Rodriguez in hospital with a broken elbow. 3 Inches of Blood fired Rodriguez, apologized for his behavior and replaced him with Ash Pearson (of Sound Of the Swarm & Just Cause).

===''Here Waits Thy Doom''===
[[File:3 inches of blood toronto.jpg|thumb|right|Toronto concert, 2013]]
In 2008, Jamie Hooper quit the band and did not perform on 3 Inches of Blood's fourth album ''[[Here Waits Thy Doom]]'', making it the first album from the band not to feature any original members. Harsh vocal duties were taken over by Hagberg.

The song "Beware The Preacher's Daughter" features all four members of fellow Canadian Metal band [[Bison B.C.]] (James Farwell, Dan And, Masa Anzai and Brad MacKinnon) singing gang vocals on the chorus.

3 Inches of Blood was featured in Rockstar's [[Mayhem Festival 2010]], and the band released a music video for the song "Silent Killer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-music-videos/new-video-3-inches-of-blood-silent-killer.html |title=New Video &#124;&#124; 3 Inches Of Blood- Silent Killer |publisher=Metalcallout.com |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

===''Long Live Heavy Metal''===
On March 26, 2012, the band released their final album, ''Long Live Heavy Metal'', in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Long-Heavy-Metal-Inches-Blood/dp/B00778F2YW |title=Long Live Heavy Metal: Amazon.ca: Music |publisher=Amazon.ca |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

===Breakup===
On June 2, 2015, the band announced it would be disbanding following two final shows, which took place on November 7 and 8 at the [[Commodore Ballroom]] in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/3-inches-of-blood-to-disband/ | title=3 INCHES OF BLOOD To Disband | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=June 2, 2015 | access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>
