'''Mercyful Fate''' is a Danish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Copenhagen]], formed in 1981 by vocalist [[King Diamond]] and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by [[progressive rock]] and [[hard rock]], and with lyrics dealing with [[Satan]] and the [[occult]], Mercyful Fate were part of the [[Black metal#First wave|first wave of black metal]] in the early to mid-1980s, along with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heavymusichq.com/essential-black-metal-albums/|title=Essential Black Metal Albums|website=Heavy Music Headquarters|access-date=February 7, 2021}}</ref> Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Mercyful Fate has also been acknowledged as a prominent influence on the subsequent heavy metal scene of 1980s and 1990s, including [[thrash metal]] bands like [[Metallica]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/Band%20History.htm |title=The History of Metallica |publisher=Metallicaworld.co.uk |access-date=6 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605102501/http://metallicaworld.co.uk/Band%20History.htm |archive-date=5 June 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Slayer]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/slayers-kerry-king-my-10-favorite-metal-albums-197333/|title=Slayer's Kerry King: My 10 Favorite Metal Albums|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 14, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Testament (band)|Testament]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/news/testaments-chuck-billy-says-new-record-has-some-mercyful-fate-black-metal-influences|title=TESTAMENT's Chuck Billy Says New Record Has Some MERCYFUL FATE & Black Metal Influences|website=Metal Injection|date=September 30, 2019|access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Exodus Family Tree — The Metal|url=https://www.givememetal.com/thrashmetaltrees/exodus-family-tree|website=givememetal.com|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> and [[Kreator]],<ref>{{cite web|title=KREATOR Frontman: 'I Try Not To Sound Like Anyone Else'|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kreator-frontman-i-try-not-to-sound-like-anyone-else/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> and [[death metal]] bands such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/chuck-schuldiner-lust-life|title=Chuck Schuldiner: Lust for Life|website=[[Guitar World]]|date=May 13, 2009|access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Morbid Angel]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathmetal.org/article/the-craft-of-metal-2-abominations-of-desolation/|title=The Craft of Metal #2: Abominations of Desolation|website=deathmetal.org|date=August 9, 2018|access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Donald Tardy (Obituary) interview|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/donald_tardy_obituary.htm|website=metal-temple.com|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> and [[Cannibal Corpse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CANNIBAL CORPSE's GEORGE 'CORPSEGRINDER' FISHER: Why I Love MERCYFUL FATE's 'Don't Break The Oath'|url=https://metaladdicts.com/corpsegrinder-why-i-love-mercyful-fates-dont-break-the-oath/|website=metaladdicts.com|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref>

Since its inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate has released seven studio albums, two [[extended play]]s, and four [[Compilation album|compilation]]s. After several line-up changes and self-made demos, they released their [[Mercyful Fate (EP)|self-titled EP]] in 1982, with the line-up of [[King Diamond]] (vocals), Hank Shermann (lead and rhythm guitars), Michael Denner (rhythm and lead guitars), [[Timi Hansen]] (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up the group recorded their first two studio albums (1983's ''[[Melissa (Mercyful Fate album)|Melissa]]'' and 1984's ''[[Don't Break the Oath]]''); in spite of their reputation as one of the most acclaimed bands of the European heavy metal scene of the 1980s, Mercyful Fate became the subject of controversy due to its Satantic imagery, and one of their songs "Into the Coven" (from ''Melissa'') later gained notoriety for appearing as one of the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]]'s "Filthy Fifteen" list of objectionable songs.<ref name="PMRC">{{cite web|title=The 'Worst' Lyrics From the Satanic Panic's 'Filthy 15'|url=https://loudwire.com/worst-lyrics-satanic-panic-filthy-15/|website=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=June 26, 2021}}</ref>

After disbanding in 1985 due to musical differences, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited in 1992 to record the album ''[[In the Shadows (album)|In the Shadows]]'', which was released the following year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Mercyful Fate went on hiatus in 1999, but had reunited on occasion during the 2000s. On August 1, 2019, it was announced that Mercyful Fate were reuniting on a full-time basis, with plans to tour<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ekstrabladet.dk/musik/dkmusiknyt/legendarisk-dansk-band-vender-tilbage/7734075|title=Legendarisk dansk band vender tilbage|first=Rådhuspladsen 37 1785 København V.

==Style and legacy==
Mercyful Fate were a part of the [[Black metal|first wave of black metal]], along with other groups, such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], and [[Hellhammer]].<ref name=sam>{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}</ref> Many of these groups helped establish the style upon which future black metal artists would later build.<ref name=sam/> Unlike the other first-wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from [[progressive rock]],<ref name=rhi1>Götz Kühnemund: ''A History of Horror''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 282, November 2010, p. 20-27.</ref> epic 1970s [[hard rock]],<ref name=szt/> and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about [[Satanism]] and the [[occult]]<ref name="Melissa Review"/><ref name="Don't Break the Oath Review"/> and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous [[corpse paint]],<ref name="metalstrom">{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/article.php?article_id=66 |title=On the Role of Clothing Styles In The Development of Metal – Part I |publisher=Metalstorm.ee |date=July 5, 2005 | access-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref> Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal,<ref name="Melissa Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r12968 |title=Mercyful Fate: ''Melissa'' - Review |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Don't Break the Oath Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r12969 |title=Mercyful Fate: ''Don't Break the Oath'' - Review |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 9, 2012}}</ref> although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands.<ref name=szt/>

Various musicians have cited Mercyful Fate as an influence. [[Kerry King]], the guitarist for the [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], has stated, that he and [[Jeff Hanneman]] were big fans of Mercyful Fate when Slayer recorded the album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'', so much so that the album was very influenced by Mercyful Fate.<ref name="Metal Hammer">{{cite web | title = Kerry King interviewed by Metal Hammer.| publisher = YouTube| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLGIw2KXm0&list=FLOb0w15YR6aG-n_TxKIZg9Q&index=88&feature=plpp_video| access-date = December 8, 2012 }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=October 2020}} Fellow thrash metal band Metallica recorded a medley of Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 ''Garage Inc.'' cover album.
