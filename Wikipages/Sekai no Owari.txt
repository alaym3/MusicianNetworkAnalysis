==History==

===2007–2009: Formation and indie debut===
Fukase and Saori knew each other since kindergarten and met Nakajin in primary school. Together the three began a cover band at an early age while still in high school inspired by senior professional bands such as [[Bump of Chicken]]. Later, they met DJ Love who was added to original line-up as a DJ, replacing Fukase who was meant to take on the concept of a clown, and Fukase became the lead vocalist while Nakajin and Saori became the guitarist and pianist of the band, respectively. Starting out as an indie band, they performed their first live concert at their own-made [[live house]] "Club Earth" with 15 people attending.<ref name="mtviggy">{{cite web|title=MTV IGGY (English)|url=http://www.mtviggy.com/interviews/sekai-no-owari-says-the-end-is-near//en|publisher=mtviggy.com}}</ref> The band self-produced their first demo, ''Sekai no Owari'', with a limited edition of 1,000 copies. Fukase, vocalist, named the band ''Sekai no Owari'' because "Once you've experienced the bottom, you have to find a way to go up. So I named my band ''End of the World'' to create the strength [I needed] through the music."<ref name="mtviggy" />

=== 2010–2011: First album, Nippon Budokan and major label debut ===
Sekai no Owari released their first album ''Earth'' under the independent label Lastrum in 2010. The album reached number 15 in the [[Oricon]] Weekly Album charts and the band started to become popular in the Japanese indie scene.

The band started touring Japan with their first two tours "Heart the eartH Tour" and "One-Man fall tour" while simultaneously releasing their first double A-side single "Tenshi to Akuma/Fantasy", which peaked at number 8 on the Oricon Single charts. In August 2011, Sekai no Owari performed a solo concert at the [[Nippon Budokan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://natalie.mu/music/news/60122|title = (In Japanese) SEKAI NO OWARI wraps up first Budokan live to a starry sky|date = November 24, 2011|work = Natalie.mu }}</ref> and signed to the major label [[Toy's Factory]].

The band changed their original name '世界の終わり(Sekai no Owari)' to the romanized version Sekai no Owari.

After signing to Toy's Factory, Sekai no Owari released two singles in 2011. The singles titled "inori" and "Starlight Parade" reached number 13 and 16 respectively.

The second single "Death Disco" was released as a digital single only and reached number 20 in the Billboard Japan Hot 100.

In 2013, they performed their first-ever outdoor-live-event, "Fire and Forest Carnival" gathering a total of 60,000 people, their largest audience at that moment.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicman-net.com/artist/29795.html|title = (In Japanese) SEKAI NO OWARI's Fire and Forest Carnival a major success gathering over 60,000 people and arena tour announced|date = October 15, 2013|publisher = musicman.net}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Sekai no Owari started as an [[alternative rock]] band but later adopted concepts of [[J-pop]] and experimented with other genres. The band expressed their wish to "not to be thrown into any particular box..." and attempted to develop a diverse style.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.instagram.com/post/136684010862/160105-fukasesekainoowari|title = SEKAI NO OWARI: Old Stomping Grounds, New Beginnings|date= January 5, 2016}}</ref> The band's music ranges from [[electro-pop]] to [[jazz]], [[Rock (music)|rock]] and [[classical music]], merging them into a fantasy-inspired concept. 

Sekai no Owari performs internationally as “End of the World". They have a number of songs which are in English, in order to better reach an international audience. The band has stated in interviews that they feel a non-Japanese audience will not connect as well with Japanese (language) music, and so they try to write English language music from a different perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianpopweekly.com/27/post/2016/05/apw-exclusive-interview-the-story-of-sekai-no-owari-happiness-is-hard-fought.html|title=[APW Exclusive Interview] The story of SEKAI NO OWARI- Happiness is hard-fought|website=ASIAN POP WEEKLY|language=en|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>

He wrote and performed “Tonight” and 炎の戦士 ("''Honou no Senshi,” “Flame Warrior”''), from Sekai no Owari's second album, ''Entertainment'', as well as “Goodbye,” from their album ''Lip'', and “Doppelganger,” from their album ''Eye''. Nakajin also performed vocals on and wrote the lyrics for "Kaleidoscope," a B-side track from the 2020 single "silent." Sekai no Owari's 2021 album ''scent of memory'' also features a solo song from Nakajin, titled "Masayume."
