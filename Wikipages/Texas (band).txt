'''Texas''' are<!-- 'are' is correct British English. --> a Scottish [[pop rock]] band from [[Glasgow]]. They were founded in 1986 by [[Johnny McElhone]] (formerly of the bands [[Altered Images]] and [[Hipsway]]) and [[Sharleen Spiteri]] on lead vocals. Texas made their performing debut in March 1988 at the [[University of Dundee]]. They took their name from the 1984 [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.

The band released their debut album ''[[Southside (Texas album)|Southside]]'' in 1989, along with the debut single "[[I Don't Want a Lover]]", which was a top-ten hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and peaked within the top ten of the charts in many other European countries. ''Southside'' entered at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number 88 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in the United States, and sold over two million copies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/texas/i-dont-want-a-lover|title=ShieldSquare Captcha|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=23 October 2021}}</ref> Despite the success of ''Southside'', the follow-up albums ''[[Mothers Heaven]]'' (1991) and ''[[Ricks Road]]'' (1993) were less successful, peaking at number 32 and number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] respectively, but achieved moderate success on various European markets.

The band's fortunes changed in 1997 with the release of their ''[[White on Blonde]]'' album, which entered at the top of the UK albums chart and became their biggest seller. To date it has been certified six times platinum in the United Kingdom.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015932/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |date=24 September 2009 }}</ref> Follow up album ''[[The Hush]]'' (1999) was also successful, entering at the top of the UK albums chart and certified triple platinum. The band's ''[[The Greatest Hits (Texas album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, released in 2000, was another big-seller, again entering at the top of the UK albums chart, and certified six times platinum. Texas would go on to release a further two studio albums, ''[[Careful What You Wish For (Texas album)|Careful What You Wish For]]'' in 2003, and ''[[Red Book (album)|Red Book]]'' in 2005, both of which were certified gold in the United Kingdom. After the release of ''Red Book'' and a tour to support the album's release, Texas went on hiatus. Lead singer Sharleen Spiteri launched a solo career, releasing her debut solo album, ''[[Melody (Sharleen Spiteri album)|Melody]]'', in 2008.

As of 2017, Texas's worldwide sales were 40 million records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mushroompromotions.com/bios/album-bio-texas-jump-on-board-liberator-music-bmg-out-friday-21-april-2017/ |title=ALBUM BIO: TEXAS – JUMP ON BOARD [LIBERATOR MUSIC/BMG] (OUT FRIDAY 21 APRIL 2017) |website=Mushroompromotions.com |date=31 March 2017 |access-date=7 April 2017}}</ref> and they have had thirteen top-ten singles on the UK singles chart and three number-one albums and eight UK top-ten albums on the UK albums chart.

==History==
===1989: ''Southside''===
{{Main|Southside (Texas album)}}
The band's debut single, "[[I Don't Want a Lover]]", was released in January 1989. It peaked at number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name=occ>{{cite web|title=Texas - Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30464/texas/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> and No. 77 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, as well as top-40 positions in various countries worldwide. The band released their debut album, ''[[Southside (Texas album)|Southside]]'', in March 1989, which peaked at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]. However, three further singles from the album all failed to make the UK top 40, with "[[Thrill Has Gone]]" reaching No. 60, "[[Everyday Now]]" faring little better at No. 44 (though reaching the Top 30 in France), and "[[Prayer for You]]" stalling at No. 73.<ref name="occ"/>

===1991–1992: ''Mothers Heaven''===
{{Main|Mothers Heaven}}

The band's second album, ''[[Mothers Heaven]]'', was released in September 1991. It was preceded by the single "[[Why Believe in You]]", but this failed to reach the UK top 40 stalling at No. 66 on the UK Singles Chart. This did not bode well for the album, which itself peaked at No. 32 in the UK. A second single, "[[In My Heart (Texas song)|In My Heart]]", fared worse and became Texas's lowest-charting single in the UK, reaching No. 74, making it their fifth single in a row to failed to break the top 40. A third single from the album, "[[Alone with You (Texas song)|Alone with You]]", was released in January 1992 and reached No. 32, giving them their second top-40 entry.

Ironically, immediately following the disappointing performance of the album and its singles, Texas released a new cover version of the [[Al Green]] classic "[[Tired of Being Alone]]" in April 1992. The single, which was not included on the album, was more successful and returned the band to the UK top 20, peaking at No. 19.

===1993–1994: ''Ricks Road''===
{{Main|Ricks Road}}

Texas released their third album, ''Ricks Road'' in November 1993. It was preceded by two more top-40 singles, "[[So Called Friend]]" (UK No. 30) and "[[You Owe It All to Me]]" (UK No. 39). The album peaked at No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The music video for "You Owe It All to Me" was directed by [[Dani Jacobs]], and was filmed in [[Arizona]] and features Spiteri and McErlaine filmed in the style of a road movie with the pair encountering another version of themselves along the way. A third single from the album, "[[So in Love with You (Texas song)|So In Love With You]]", reached No. 28 in the UK in February 1994.

===1997–1998: ''White on Blonde''===
{{Main|White on Blonde}}

Following an endorsement by then [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] presenter [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] on his [[Channel 4]] show ''[[TFI Friday]]'' in 1997, Texas came back to the music scene with the international hit "[[Say What You Want]]". The song was released internationally on 6 January 1997 and became the band's highest-peaking single to date on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No. 3 in its second week of release.<ref name="occ"/> In February, Texas released their fourth album, ''[[White on Blonde]]'', which went on to become the band's most successful album to date. The album debuted at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and returned to the top spot again six months later. It remained in the UK top 75 for 91 weeks.<ref name="occ"/> A total of five singles were taken from the album, all of which were top-ten hits in the UK. "[[Halo (Texas song)|Halo]]", released in April 1997, peaked at No. 10, "[[Black Eyed Boy]]", released in July 1997, peaked at No. 5, and "[[Put Your Arms Around Me (Texas song)|Put Your Arms Around Me]]", released in November 1997, also peaked at No. 10.<ref name="occ"/> In 1998, the song was featured in the film ''[[Ever After: A Cinderella Story]]'', starring [[Drew Barrymore]]. The band then released a double A-sided single of "Insane" along with "Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)"—a new version of the first hit from the album but now with additional [[rap music|rap]] vocals from the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The single peaked at No. 4 in the UK.

''White on Blonde'' became the pinnacle of the band's success, and was certified 6 × Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 1.8 million copies. It was included in [[Q (magazine)|''Q'']] magazine's "50 Best Albums of 1997", and voted the 86th-best album of all time by ''Q'' readers in 1998.

In October 2000, Texas released their first compilation album, ''[[The Greatest Hits (Texas album)|The Greatest Hits]]''.

[[File:Texas0711.jpg|thumb|right|Texas performing live in July 2011]]
On 8 September 2009, bandmember Ally McErlaine was hospitalised after he collapsed with a massive brain aneurysm at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/texas/47273 |title=Texas guitar player Ally McErlaine in hospital after fall in London |work=NME|location=UK |date=12 September 2009 |access-date=17 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/texas-guitarist-critical-after-brain-haemorrhage_1115814 |title=Texas Guatarist in critical conditions after brain hemorrhage |website=Contactmusic.com |date=12 September 2009 |access-date=17 August 2011}}</ref> By February 2010, he was recovering well as reported by bandmate Spiteri in ''The Sunday Mail'': "Ally is the most stubborn person I have ever come across, and I think his sheer pigheadedness is the reason he's still here! When he asked what was happening with Texas, I said it was up to him. He told me he wanted to get back into the studio."

After McErlaine survived his collapse—which kills in 80% of cases—Texas reunited for the first time since 2005. The band embarked on a tour in 2011 and lead singer Spiteri appeared on ''[[Popstar to Operastar]]'' on 12 June 2011 singing a version of the band's hit "[[Say What You Want]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/2011/03/20/joy-for-sharleen-spiteri-as-texas-reunite-after-guitarist-wins-fight-for-life-86908-23003027/ |title=Joy for Sharleen Spiteri as Texas reunite after guitarist wins fight for life |publisher=The Daily Record |access-date=17 August 2011}}</ref> Prior to this, Texas had played at the Den Fynske Landsby Festival in [[Denmark]].

After the release of Texas's 2005 album ''[[Red Book (album)|Red Book]]'' the band members confirmed that they would enter a hiatus. Spiteri performed as guest vocalist on [[Rammstein]]'s "[[Rosenrot]]" album. She began work on her debut solo album, working with some of her former bandmates. She wrote the vast majority of the tracks on the album. She released her debut solo album ''[[Melody (Sharleen Spiteri album)|Melody]]'' on 14 July 2008 with "[[All the Times I Cried]]" serving as the album's lead single. The song charted at No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart. ''Melody'' was proven popular in the United Kingdom, debuting at a high No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart. In other European countries where Texas were popular like in Belgium, the album charted at No. 15 on the Belgium Flanders Chart and No. 13 on the Belgium Wallonia Chart. The song "[[Don't Keep Me Waiting]]" was released as a single in Switzerland only, in which it charted at No. 78 on the singles chart there. A further two singles were released worldwide, "[[Stop, I Don't Love You Anymore]]" and "[[It Was You]]" which were both unpopular in the United Kingdom, missing the UK Top 100, with "Stop, I Don't Love You Anymore" charting at No. 107 and "It Was You" at No. 178. By 2009, ''Melody'' has been certified Gold by the BPI (United Kingdom) with sales of over 100,000.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
