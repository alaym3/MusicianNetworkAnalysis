'''Dethklok''' is a fictional [[melodic death metal]] band featured in the [[Adult Swim]] animated television series ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.

The first official Dethklok album was released on September 25, 2007, entitled ''[[The Dethalbum]]''. The album debuted at number 21 on [[Billboard Magazine]]'s [[Billboard 200|Top 200]] list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=642&Itemid=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705003124/http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=642&Itemid=2|archive-date=July 5, 2009|url-status=dead|title=Dethalbum Debuts At No.&nbsp;21 On Billboard Top 200|date=October 9, 2007}}</ref> The band released ''[[Dethalbum II]]'' on September 29, 2009, and toured with [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], [[High on Fire]] and [[Converge (band)|Converge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dethklok-dethalbum-ii-first-week-sales-revealed|title='Dethalbum II' First-Week Sales Revealed|date=October 7, 2009|access-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Dethalbum III]]'', was released on October 16, 2012.<ref name= "Dethalbum3">{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/2012/08/18/exclusive/dethklok-to-release-dethalbum-iii-in-october-track-listing-revealed/|title= Dethklok To Release "Dethalbum III" In October, Track Listing Revealed |date= August 18, 2012 |publisher= ThePRP.com |author= wookubus |access-date= August 19, 2012}}</ref> [[The Doomstar Requiem|The soundtrack]] to the special episode, ''[[Metalocalypse: The Doomstar Requiem]]'' was released on October 29, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10151941288469804 |title=DETHKLOK's "METALOCALYPSE: the DOOMSTAR REQUIEM A KLOK OPERA" Airs Sunday, October 27th on Adult Swim |author= Adrenaline PR press |date= October 1, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>

A real band was set up in order to perform the band's music in live shows. Both bands were created by [[Brendon Small]] and [[Tommy Blacha]]. The music heard on Metalocalypse is performed by Brendon Small, with others needed for live concerts and albums. On August 25, 2017, Brendon Small released his second solo album, ''[[Brendon Small's Galaktikon II]]'', which is considered to serve as "a new Dethklok album", due to [[Adult Swim]] holding the rights to the band name.<ref name="Dethklok">{{cite web |url=http://teamrock.com/news/2016-08-02/dethklok-to-return-under-new-name-galakticon-2 |title=Dethklok to return under new name Galakticon 2 |date=August 2, 2016 |access-date= August 2, 2016 |author=Stef Lach |publisher=Team Rock }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/brendon-small-all-but-finished-making-dethklok-records/ |title=Brendon Small: 'I Think I'm All But Finished Making Dethklok Records' |date=May 25, 2016 |access-date=December 16, 2016}}</ref> However, after a five-year absence, the band returned to perform at Adult Swim Festival 2019.<ref>[https://www.revolvermag.com/music/dethklok-play-first-show-5-years-adult-swim-festival-2019 Dethklok to Play First Show in 5 Years at Adult Swim Festival 2019] Revolver Magazine.

The band is known for its satirical or parodic lyrical themes.

==Fictional background==
In the ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' series, Dethklok is depicted as the world's most popular and successful death metal band. The members of Dethklok reside in a colossal, fortress-like castle elevated high above ground called Mordhaus, which serves as their residence as well as their recording studio. Beyond their extremely wealthy financial status, they also oversee a massive personal organization of devoted workers known as Klokateers, who act as their personal servants, as well as their roadies, security personnel, and private military squadron. The band's fan base includes billions of [[Metal (music)|metal]] fanatics, who frequently endanger themselves to watch the band perform live, as their incredibly expensive shows are frequently held in dangerous locations, and include numerous hazards such as excessive pyrotechnics, aircraft, lasers, and giant bladed pendulums, with many shows concluding in multiple attendee deaths.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Curse of Dethklok |series=Metalocalypse |series-link=Metalocalypse |network=Adult Swim |date=August 6, 2006 |season=1 |number=1 |quote=Reporter:  They are called pain waivers.

Despite their otherworldly success, the members of Dethklok are often portrayed as incompetent at almost everything not related to their profession. The band struggles to perform everyday tasks, including shopping for groceries, preparing food, and maintaining proper social relationships. Throughout the series, they are often assisted by their manager and lawyer, Charles Foster Offdensen, who frequently attempts to prevent the band from making poor decisions. The band's actions and uncanny misfortune have caught the attention of an [[Illuminati]]-style council, known as [[List of Metalocalypse characters#The Tribunal|The Tribunal]]. The Tribunal is portrayed as Dethklok's antagonist throughout the series, and secretly monitors their actions in almost every episode. They describe Dethklok as the "world's greatest cultural force". The leader of The Tribunal (Mr. Salacia), however, frequently instructs the other members to allow Dethklok to do as they will.
==Band members==
===Fictional band members===

====Nathan Explosion====
*Voiced by: [[Brendon Small]]
Nathan Explosion is the frontman, lead vocalist and "[[lyricist|lyrical visionary]]" of Dethklok. Portrayed as a tall and stocky guy with long black hair, black nails, and green eyes, Nathan speaks with a [[death growl]] even when not singing. He did not speak a word until he was five years old and in high school excelled only in frog dissection and football. According to his dating profile, Nathan describes his ethnicity as "White/Native American". He was raised in [[New Port Richey, Florida]]. He is the lead songwriting force in Dethklok, and uses violent imagery or plot elements when writing and composing song material. Nathan is slightly more sensible than the rest of the band, and a great deal more emotionally stable, though he is still incompetent at most things in life such as the use of a grocery store or reading a cooking recipe. Despite this, he does seem to have some knowledge in specific areas, such as negotiating a contract, extensive knowledge of rock culture, and a proficiency in French. He attempts to get his GED in "Go Forth And Die", and only fails in part due to the band's influence, and in "Fatherklok" tells Murderface not to interfere with Skwisgaar's father issues. Nathan sometimes acts in a parental manner towards Toki, and in the first episode insisted that the band never drinks before a show (though they had all been drinking all day.)

In the episode "Fatherklok", it was revealed that Nathan enjoys an excellent relationship with his father. He does, however, find his parents embarrassing as they are normal parents and not "brutal" as seen in "Dethfam". A brief montage shows Nathan and his father fishing, racing go-karts, and playing [[Scrabble]]. He is the only member of the band who spends time with or likes his father, stating in the episode "Dethdad" he often drinks beer and goes hunting with his father regularly and would be very sad if his father died.

Small described Nathan as a "[[quarterback]]", in part to his contribution to his high school football team, and based his character's appearance and performance style on [[Cannibal Corpse]] vocalist [[George Fisher (musician)|George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher]].<ref name="EMinterview">{{cite web  |last=Robair |first=Gino |title =Metalocalypse Now |publisher=Electronic Musician  |date=February 1, 2008 |url=http://emusician.com/interviews/metalocalypse/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704110008/http://emusician.com/interviews/metalocalypse/index.html|archive-date=July 4, 2009|url-status=dead |access-date=July 15, 2008}}</ref>

====Skwisgaar Skwigelf====
*Voiced by: [[Brendon Small]]
Skwisgaar Skwigelf is Dethklok's lead guitarist. He is described as "a handsome guy who thinks he's the greatest thing in the world". Show creator Brendon Small compares Skwisgaar's attitude and technical playing style to [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].<ref name="EMinterview" /> He is tall and thin with long blond hair, a studded belt with a skull buckle, and blue eyes. He played a [[Gibson Explorer]] for the first three seasons, but recently switched to the Gibson "Thunderhorse" Explorer for the fourth. He often carries around his guitars even when not playing. He is often referred to as the fastest guitar player in the world. He is depicted as having extreme sexual prowess and a preference for plump or elderly women. Hailing from Sweden, Skwisgaar has a marked Swedish accent and often makes mistakes when conjugating verbs. He is responsible for the majority of the arrangement of Dethklok's songs, writing the guitar lines as well as Murderface's bass lines. Skwisgaar also typically discards and re-records the rhythm guitar (and the bass guitar parts) recorded by Toki Wartooth for Dethklok's albums and frequently belittles him for his guitar playing skills, although he does appear to share something of a codependent relationship with him.  This can be supported, as shown in The Doomstar Requiem during a flashback sequence in which the band holds auditions for a new rhythm guitarist.  Skwisgaar originally disapproved of the idea, wanting Dethklok to be a four-piece. During Toki's audition, Toki was still inferior to Skwisgaar as a guitarist, and the rest of Dethklok originally were about to dismiss him, but Skwisgaar admitted that no other guitarist had made him play as well as he did, and requested that Toki stay in the band.

====Toki Wartooth====
*Voiced by: [[Tommy Blacha]], [[Mike Keneally]] (singing voice in ''[[Metalocalypse: The Doomstar Requiem]]'')
Toki Wartooth is Dethklok's rhythm guitarist. He typically played a [[Gibson Flying V]], but has switched to the Brendon Small "Snow Falcon" V for the fourth season. A native of "an abandoned town near [[Lillehammer]]", Norway, he was forced to constantly perform manual labor by his abusive cultist parents. He has a distinct accent and often inappropriately pluralizes words, but refers to Pickles as "Pickle". Visually, he has a distinct [[Fu Manchu moustache]], long brown hair, and very pale blue eyes. He is also shown to be extremely physically fit, in stark contrast to the rest of his bandmates.

Toki is the only Dethklok member with no prior band experience, as well as the only one not with the band in its initial form, having been chosen to replace the violent and egomaniacal Magnus Hammersmith. Small explains Toki's relationship with Skwisgaar as "...Norwegian to Skwisgaar's Swedish, pompous attitude. And, again, a second-class citizen in the same band",<ref name="EMinterview" /> and compared his guitar playing style to that of [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="EMinterview" />

In contrast to the deep cynicism, grim outlook, promiscuity, and alcohol abuse of the other band members, Toki's character is generally childlike, innocent, and good-natured. He has a boyish bedroom complete with [[action figure]]s, stuffed animals, and wall posters, and a prominent hobby of his is building model planes. He is a Type 2 [[diabetic]] and requires [[insulin]] shots.

A recurring plot point is the death of people Toki grows fond of, including a guitar teacher and his father; the Tribunal has described him as an "angel of death".  Any living being that gets close to Toki (with the exception of Dr. Rockso, Charles and his bandmates) tends to die after a brief period of time.

====Pickles====
*Voiced by: [[Brendon Small]]
Pickles is Dethklok's drummer. He was raised in [[Tomahawk, Wisconsin]] and speaks with an [[Upper Midwest American English|Upper Midwestern accent]]. He refers to himself as "very Irish American" and has long red hair, styled into [[dreadlocks]] and a comb-over [[skullet]], and green eyes. He is depicted as having an average build with a strong propensity for drugs and alcohol abuse stemming from feelings of resentment towards his family. He comes off as the most socially-capable member of the band, able to grasp most concepts outside the scope of death metal that the other four cannot. In later seasons, this capacity often puts him at odds with Nathan, though ironically they are the only two the others can talk to on certain levels. Charles Offdensen refers to Nathan and Pickles as the "most responsible" members in the group, much to their disdain. Pickles is a multi-talented performer, whom IGN Magazine described as "the band's deepest thinker".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/02/dethklok-interview |title=Dethklok Interview |publisher=IGN |access-date=October 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628214259/http://music.ign.com/articles/843/843319p1.html |archive-date=June 28, 2011 }}</ref> Pickles is the former front-man of a group called Snakes 'n' Barrels, providing the vocals and performing as the lead guitarist.

Brendon Small used the voice of Pickles on ''[[The Dethalbum]]'' to sing the chorus of the song "Hatredcopter", as well as the entirety of "Kill You", a song by Snakes N' Barrels "covered" by Dethklok, which serves as a bonus track. Describing the character, Small said, "I thought the drummer should be able to do a bunch of stuff, like [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] in [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Even though it's not based on his personality, it's what he can do in the band and what parts of the songs he does contribute to."<ref name="EMinterview"/>

The original design of the character was changed to avoid his looking too much like [[Devin Townsend]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecultureshock.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=44 |title="Metalocalypse" Brendon and Tommy (2006) |publisher=The Culture Shock |date=September 21, 2006 |access-date=July 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216015919/http://www.thecultureshock.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=44|archive-date=February 16, 2012}}</ref>

====William Murderface====
*Voiced by: [[Tommy Blacha]]
<!-- Do not add GEEZER BUTLER information without providing a website as citation; blogs and forums will not be accepted.-->

William Murderface is Dethklok's bassist, who plays a [[Gibson Thunderbird|Gibson Thunderbird Studio 5-string]]. He has brown hair, green eyes, a heavy [[lateral lisp]] and a [[Diastema|gap in his front teeth]]. He has tattoos on the top and bottom parts of his abdomen, the top reading "Pobody's Nerfect", and the bottom saying "This Mess Is A Place". When he was a baby, Murderface's father killed his wife &ndash; Murderface's mother &ndash; with a chainsaw before turning it upon himself in front of Murderface in a grisly [[murder-suicide]] (Murderface believes this happened because he was ugly).  This left Murderface to be raised by his grandparents.

Murderface is "a self-hating bass player who's always trying to act like he's more important than he is", in part because his bass playing is usually mixed out completely.<ref name="EMinterview" /> Although Murderface's musical contribution is apparently totally unnecessary to the group's sound, Dethklok realizes when they expel him from the band in "[[List of Metalocalypse episodes|Dethsiduals]]" that he imposes a mentality of negativity and hatred upon the band that is crucial to their songwriting.

Brendon Small describes Murderface as "thin-skinned and incredibly sensitive and just wants to be accepted constantly but can't get that because he's such a dick and pushes people away".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-7111/2008-07-17-metalocalypse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201113744/http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-7111/2008-07-17-metalocalypse|title=Brendon Small does not really care if you're in on the joke|date=July 17, 2008|archive-date=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> He is sensitive about his weight and appearance, which his bandmates often obliviously exacerbate. Murderface's voice was originally achieved by Tommy Blacha putting paper towels inside his mouth when voicing the character, but he has since refined his technique to forgo the paper towels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emusician.com/interviews/metalocalypse_now_bonus/ |title=An interview with Metalocalypse co-creator, Brendon Small |publisher=Emusician.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825090651/http://www.emusician.com/interviews/metalocalypse_now_bonus/|archive-date=August 25, 2011|date=January 22, 2008 |access-date=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Magnus Hammersmith====
*Voiced by: [[Marc Maron]] (speaking) and [[Brendon Small]] (singing)

Magnus Hammersmith was the first rhythm guitarist of Dethklok, but was kicked out of the band very early for his violent behavior. He returns to antagonize and threaten the band several times.

In a February 2008 interview on California radio station [[Indie 103.1]] with [[Full Metal Jackie]], plans for a summer 2008 tour were announced. Brendon Small described the tour as being like "a Disney ride but with murder". Dethklok toured the US in June and early July with [[Chimaira]] and [[Soilent Green]]. In April 2008, 27 seven dates were announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=10590 |title=Dethklok, Chimaira, Soilent Green tour // News // Lambgoat |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date=April 11, 2008 |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

Dethklok performed at [[Heavy MTL]] on June 21, 2008. They then toured with Chimaira and Soilent Green during June and July 2008. During the June 5, 2008, show at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, an electrical fire broke out during Soilent Green's set. Attendees were hesitant to leave the building thinking that it was part of the show (in their fictional universe, Dethklok is infamous for causing disasters that result in deaths), which created a dangerous situation, but they soon realized that the fire was real and evacuated and the concert was rescheduled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/electrical-problems-force-dethklok-s-san-francisco-cancellation-photos-available |title=Electrical Problems Force DETHKLOK's San Francisco Cancellation; Photos Available|date=June 6, 2008 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=487710 |title=Electrical Problems Prompt Fillmore Evacuation|date=June 6, 2008 |publisher=Pollstar.com |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>
