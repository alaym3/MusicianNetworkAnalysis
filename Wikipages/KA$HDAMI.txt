== Early life ==
Wallace was born on December 16, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was raised by his parents. He gained early experience with music through his father, who owned a studio and worked in the industry.

His family moved to [[Maryland]] around this time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Best New Artists|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/best-new-artists-may-2021/|access-date=2021-11-26|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref> Wallace has a twin sister.<ref>{{Citation|title=Buzzing 16 Year Old Rapper KA$HDAMI Talks "Reparations" & "Kappin Up", Mexiko Dro, Since99|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGWZiSLN6pk|language=en|access-date=2021-11-26}}</ref>

== Career ==
Wallace started making music at the age of eight through the now-defunct video chat app ooVoo. At thirteen he bought a microphone and recorded on his mother's computer.<ref>{{Citation|title=KA$HDAMI on Buying House at 16, Losing Pi'erre Bourne's Beats, Mexikodro (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X753FcpE9Qc|language=en|access-date=2021-11-26}}</ref> He released the song "Kappin Up" and ''The Humor Tape'' in 2018, but became demotivated and took a break. Wallace returned when "Kappin Up" became popular on TikTok in 2020, with the help of a music video by [[WorldStarHipHop]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=III|first=Robby Seabrook|title=The Break Presents - Ka$hdami|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/kashdami-interview-the-break/|access-date=2021-11-26|website=XXL Mag|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=KA$HDAMI - "Kappin Up" (Official Music Video - WSHH Exclusive)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLLlcEsybl0|language=en|access-date=2021-11-26}}</ref>

With newfound motivation, Kashdami released the mixtapes #''KashDontMiss'' and ''16'' in 2020, which grew his online fanbase. In January 2021, his breakout single "Reparations!" released, which gained popularity on various platforms including TikTok and SoundCloud. His follow up single "Look N The Mirror!" did similarly well. Kashdami signed a deal with [[Republic Records]] in May.<ref>{{Cite web|last=III|first=Robby Seabrook|title=The Break Presents - Ka$hdami|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/kashdami-interview-the-break/|access-date=2021-11-26|website=XXL Mag|language=en}}</ref> Kashdami and fellow rapper BabySantana featured on the [[Lyrical Lemonade]] YouTube channel with their track "14".<ref>{{Citation|title=BabySantana & KA$HDAMI - 14 (Directed by Cole Bennett)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lubd7UtmBtE|language=en|access-date=2021-11-29}}</ref>
