==Early life==
McReynolds was born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], on September 17, 1989,<ref name="TW Birthday">{{cite web|title=Almost forgot ITS MY BIRTHDAY! #23|url=https://twitter.com/jonmcreynolds/status/247568786075553792|publisher=Twitter|first=Jonathan|last=McReynolds|access-date=March 17, 2015|date=September 16, 2012}}</ref> as Jonathan Caleb McReynolds.<ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web|title=I Love You Work ID No. 883470768 ISWC No. T9068932105 |url=https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx |publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |author=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |access-date=March 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306032310/https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx |archive-date=March 6, 2013 }} Work ID No. 883470768 {{ISWC|T9068932105}}</ref> He was raised by a single mother<ref name="EEW One">{{cite web |title=Gospel Singer Jonathan McReynolds Talks Growing Up Fatherless|url=http://www.empoweringeverydaywomen.com/Jonathan-McReynolds-talks-growing-up-fatherless.html|author=EEW Magazine|publisher=Empowering Everyday Women|access-date=March 17, 2015|date=March 6, 2014}}</ref> with love and support from his family, church members and his pastor at New Original Church of God in Christ. Known to be a very precocious kid, he learned to play the drums at five years old, the piano at eight, and showcased his talents weekly as a church musician. He was a reluctant singer, to say the least. However, in high school, he began to break out of his shell; eventually, sharing his talents with the public rather than singing alone in his living room.

He attended [[Whitney M. Young Magnet High School|Whitney Young Magnet High School]], where not only did he become known for his musical talents, but also learned how to record and produce music, as a member of the school's podcast initiative. Those skills would prove to be significant in college as he recorded his first songs including his first viral hit "No Gray" in his dorm room.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/5126463/|title=South Side gospel artist Jonathan McReynolds nominated for Grammy|date=February 8, 2019|website=ABC7 Chicago|language=en|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref>

==Music career==
His music career was started in 2012, with the release of ''Life Music'' on September 25, 2012, by [[Light Records]] and [[Entertainment One Music]].<ref name="AM First">{{cite web|title=Life Music : Jonathan McReynolds|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/life-music-mw0002411087|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 17, 2015|date=September 25, 2012}}</ref> This was his breakthrough released on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, and it placed at No. 98 on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] along with [[Top Gospel Albums|Gospel Albums]] at No. 3, and at No. 23 on the [[Independent Albums]] chart.<ref name="Billboard200"/><ref name="Gospel"/><ref name="Independent"/> His song "No Gray" was a viral smash that earned him TV appearances on BET's Celebration of Gospel and fans in India Arie and Nicki Minaj.<ref name=":0" />

McReynolds's second album ''[[Life Music: Stage Two]]'' was [[Grammy Award]] nominated, a [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Gospel Albums|Gospel]] No. 1 album for four weeks, and a [[GMA Dove Award]] winner. It featured [[Israel Houghton]], [[India Arie|India.Arie]] and Chantae Cann and his first top five gospel hit "Gotta Have You."<ref name=":0" /><ref name="AM First" /> Rating the album five stars for Journal of Gospel Music, Bob Marovich says, "''Life Music, Stage Two'' is the musical manifestation of his honest and spiritually grounded approach to dealing with the vicissitudes of daily life."<ref>Marovich, Bob (September 18, 2015). "Jonathan McReynolds â€“ Life Music: Stage Two". Journal of Gospel Music. Retrieved October 31, 2015.</ref> McReynolds brought on yet another popular R&B talent, [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]], on his EP ''Sessions'' (2016) This unannounced, surprise release reached the #1 on the [[iTunes]] Christian chart in one night.<ref name=":0" />

Jonathan's third album [[Make Room (album)|''Make Room'']] was Jonathan's biggest success yet, earning him eight [[Stellar Awards]] and two [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It also debuted No. 1 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Gospel Albums|Gospel]] charts. ''Make Room'' touted his first No. 1 radio hit "Not Lucky, I'm Loved" and the huge viral smash "Cycles." This album garnered public support from stars of different cultures and genres like [[Justin Bieber]], [[Kandi Burruss]], and millions of listeners around the world.<ref name=":0" /> This project gave strong evidence to Kirk Franklin's claim that Jonathan is, in fact, "the future of Gospel Music." In March 2018, he broke major ground for gospel, when his one hour TV special "Make Room" aired multiple times on [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TVOne]]. He was also the first in his genre to form a major partnership with [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]. If all that was not enough, McReynolds just missed the bestseller list with his book "Make Room: Finding Where Faith Fits" that he released in the fall of 2018.<ref name=":0" />

In June 2019, Jonathan co-stars as a judge with Kirk Franklin, Kelly Price and Erica Campbell, on Season 9 of [[Sunday Best (American TV series)|BET's Sunday Best]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/shows/sunday-best/news/2019/4/jonathan-mcreynolds-kelly-price-added-as-judges-for-the-return-of-sunday-best.html?cid=facebook|title=Jonathan McReynolds, Kelly Price Added As Judges For The Return Of 'Sunday Best'|website=BET.com|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> In 2020 he released ''People,'' an EP with "Moving On," the 2021 Grammy winner for Best Gospel Performance/Song.

In August 2021, McReynolds earned his fourth straight Gospel Airplay No. 1 with "Grace."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9610879/jonathan-mcreynolds-grace-gospel-airplay/|title=Jonathan McReynolds Earns Record Fourth Straight Gospel Airplay No. 1 With 'Grace'|first=Jim|last=Asker|website=Billboard|date=August 5, 2021|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 2016, McReynolds established Elihu Nation, his non-profit that is geared to "celebrate, promote, and work to create young seekers and models of wisdom." It has organized several events aimed at Christian scholarship and self-help and has awarded at least $30,000 in college scholarships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elihunation.org/|title=Elihu Nation|website=www.elihunation.org|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref>

Somehow, between touring, recording and TV appearances, Jonathan has taught for five years at his alma mater [[Columbia College Chicago]] in the music department. His contribution to society outside of music is important to him.<ref name=":0" /> In addition to completing his Bachelors' Degree in Music at Columbia College, he earned a Masters degree in Biblical Studies from Moody Theological Seminary in 2015.

In 2018, McReynolds was admitted into [[Mensa International|Mensa]], an international society for high IQ individuals and became an honorary member of [[Alpha Nu Omega|Alpha Nu Omega, Inc.]], an international christian fraternity.<ref name=":0" />
