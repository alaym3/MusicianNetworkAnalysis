In April 2015, Malphurs announced that he was running for president, despite the fact he was below the constitutionally required age of 35, as he was only 30 by the time of the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. His platform included legalizing marijuana, raising the [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum hourly wage to $15]], and creating better trade opportunities for school students. His other proposals included banning dogs from restaurants and making it illegal for people with shoe sizes above 13 to walk on the street. He also seemed to be dismissive of Congress, and had an anti-war stance. Former professional wrestler [[Ric Flair]] was his running mate.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/watch-ric-flair-and-waka-flocka-flame-jump-into-presidential-race-111627/ Rollingstone]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/21/politics/waka-flocka-flame-for-president-election/index.html|title = Rapper Waka Flocka Flame blazes new 2016 trail &#124; CNN Politics|date = April 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6538885/waka-flocka-flame-presidential-race-2016-pro-pot|title = Decision 2016: Waka Flocka Flame Enters Presidential Race with Decisive Pro-Pot Platform}}</ref>

{{cquote|After that situation I detoxed for like seven days. I changed my diet. I became 85% [[vegan]]. I just felt like I had to cleanse myself... I've been through that before, so to me that's willpower because if I sit there and mope, a lot of things could go bad. That boy had a lot of stress on him. It's a lot of things that go on behind doors that people don't know about... like it's a lot of stress that come with this game. The strong survive. The family is good, though. Life goes on. That's the motto for me, life goes on. If my eyes ain't closed and I'm not breathing, I'm not hurting.<ref>{{cite web |author=Andres Tardio |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/m/index.php?s=news&id=27206 |title=Waka Flocka Flame Details Coping With Brother Kayo Redd's Passing &#124; HipHopDX Mobile |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=January 24, 2014 |access-date=April 23, 2015 |archive-date=April 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418122911/http://www.hiphopdx.com/m/index.php?s=news&id=27206 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/waka-flocka-talks-about-life-after-his-late-brother-kayo-redd-news.9048.html |title=Waka Flocka Talks About Life After His Late Brother, Kayo Redd |date=January 24, 2014 |publisher=Hotnewhiphop.com |access-date=April 23, 2015 |archive-date=February 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211033809/http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/waka-flocka-talks-about-life-after-his-late-brother-kayo-redd-news.9048.html |url-status=live }}</ref>}}
