'''Martha Denise Munizzi''' (born February 26, 1968) is an American [[Christian music]] singer, songwriter, author, and pastor.

==Early years==
A native of central Florida, Martha Munizzi was born into a Christian musical family. The daughter of evangelists, Martha and her twin sister [[Mary Alessi]] were born in [[Lakeland, Florida]] and grew up traveling and ministering through music with her family. She began performing at age 8, touring the country with her family in concerts and crusades around the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Martha, Mary, and their older sister Marvelyne were born with their parents' talent for music and became a part of the traveling family group as kids. The family settled in [[Orlando, Florida]] when Mary and Martha were 12, so that the children could attend formal, public school.

At age 16, Mary, Martha and Marveline (age 18) helped form a praise and worship band at the urging of a church friend. That group evolved into ''Testament'' and became popular enough to travel around the state of Florida performing in churches and at conferences and other events.

One year after completing high school (1986), Martha married Dan Munizzi, who was a keyboard and bass player in the band ''Testament''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Martha Munizzi | url=http://marthamunizzi.com/bio.php | publisher=Marha Munizzi.com | accessdate=4 May 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507151004/http://marthamunizzi.com/bio.php | archive-date=7 May 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1993 she and Dan became the music directors and founding members of a new, fledgling church in [[Orlando, Florida]] initially leading a congregation of 250 and a choir of about 30 people that eventually grew in 8 years into a 5000-member congregation and a 200-member music team.  They remained there until 2001.

She led worship at [[Lakewood Church]] while [[Cindy Cruse-Ratcliff]] was on maternity leave.<ref>{{cite news|first=Lakewood|last=Church|url=http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_153_hour_500k.wvx|title=Lakewood Church Worship Service On-line Viewable Service # 153|publisher=Lakewood Church|accessdate=2007-02-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224600/http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_153_hour_500k.wvx|archive-date=2007-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lakewood|last=Church|url=http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_154_hour_500k.wvx|title=Lakewood Church Worship Service On-line Viewable Service # 154|publisher=Lakewood Church|accessdate=2007-02-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181536/http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_154_hour_500k.wvx|archive-date=2007-09-30}}</ref>
