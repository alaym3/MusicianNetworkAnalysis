'''Throbbing Gristle''' were an English music and [[visual arts]] group formed in 1975 in [[Kingston upon Hull]] by [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]], [[Peter Christopherson]], and [[Chris Carter (British musician)|Chris Carter]]. They are widely regarded as pioneers of [[industrial music]]. Evolving from the experimental [[performance art]] group [[COUM Transmissions]], Throbbing Gristle made their public debut in October 1976 on COUM exhibition ''Prostitution'', and released their debut single "[[United/Zyklon B Zombie]]" and debut album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'' the following year. Lyrical themes mainly revolved around [[mysticism]], extremist political ideologies, sexuality, dark or underground aspects of society, and idiosyncratic manipulation of language.

The band released several subsequent studio and live albums—including ''[[D.o.A: The Third and Final Report of Throbbing Gristle]]'' (1978), ''[[20 Jazz Funk Greats]]'' (1979), and ''[[Heathen Earth]]'' (1980)—on their own record label [[Industrial Records]], building a reputation with their [[transgressive art|transgressive]] and confrontational aesthetics; they included the extensive use of disturbing visual imagery (such as ironic [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] symbolism and [[pornography]]), as well as that of sound manipulation (noise and pre-recorded tape-based [[sampling (music)|samples]]) influenced by works of [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]].

Throbbing Gristle dissolved in 1981 due to interpersonal differences; the individual members went on to participate in other projects, such as [[Psychic TV]], [[Coil (band)|Coil]], and [[Chris & Cosey]]. The band was reformed in 2004, and released three more studio albums—''[[TG Now]]'' (2004), ''[[Part Two (Throbbing Gristle album)|Part Two]]'' (2007), and ''[[The Third Mind Movements]]'' (2009)—before disbanding again after P-Orridge's departure and Christopherson's death in Autumn 2010. P-Orridge later died in March 2020. The band's final studio project, a cover version of the 1970 [[Nico]] album ''[[Desertshore]]'' titled ''[[The Desertshore Installation]]'', was released in 2012 under the moniker X-TG.

=== First era: 1976–1981 ===

Throbbing Gristle evolved from the performance art group [[COUM Transmissions]], formed in Kingston upon Hull by a group of performers centred on [[Genesis P-Orridge]] and [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]]. The last known performance of COUM Transmissions—''Prostitution'', an exhibition held in October 1976 at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]]—was also the public debut of Throbbing Gristle.<ref>{{harvnb|Savage|1992|pp=250–253}}; {{harvnb|Reynolds|2005|pp=228–229}}</ref>

Throbbing Gristle's confrontational live performances and use of often disturbing imagery, including pornography and photographs of Nazi [[concentration camp]]s, gave the group a reputation as notorious. The group always maintained that their mission was to challenge and explore the darker and obsessive sides of the human condition rather than to make attractive music. Throbbing Gristle made extensive use of pre-recorded tape-based [[sampling (music)|samples]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/thresholdhouse/blog/186224635 |title=Equipment, And My Little Part of History by Sleazy on MySpace |last=Christopherson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Christopherson |date=29 October 2006 |website=[[MySpace]] |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> and special effects to produce a distinctive, highly distorted background, usually accompanied by lyrics or spoken-word performances by Cosey Fanni Tutti or Genesis P-Orridge. Though they asserted they wanted to provoke their audience into thinking for themselves rather than pushing any specific agenda (as evidenced by the song "Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think" on ''[[Heathen Earth]]''), Throbbing Gristle frequently associated with the [[anarchopunk|anarchist punk]] scene. They appeared in the [[fanzine]] ''Toxic Grafity'', with a condensation of their own propaganda parody series, Industrial News.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09407F.html |title=Crass Discography (''Toxic Graffiti'') |website=Transmissions from Southern |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970506142103/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09407F.html |archive-date=6 May 1997 |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

In 1977, they released their debut single "[[United/Zyklon B Zombie|United / Zyklon B Zombie]]", followed by the album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]''. Although pressed in a limited initial run of 786 copies on the band's [[Industrial Records]] label, it was re-released on [[Mute Records]] due to high demand; however, this later release was reversed with all tracks playing backwards and in reverse order. This was followed by a series of albums, singles and live performances over a four-year period.

In 1981, Michael Sheppard, concert promoter and founder of [[Transparency (record label)|Transparency Record]] label brought Throbbing Gristle to Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/musicians-remember-the-late-michael-sheppard-las-champion-of-the-weird-6739588|title=Musicians Remember the Late Michael Sheppard, L.A.'s Champion of the Weird|last=Cotner|first=David|date=2016-03-22|work=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> On 29 May 1981, Throbbing Gristle performed at the [[Kezar Pavilion]] in San Francisco in what turned out the group's last performance until 2004; Throbbing Gristle announced their dissolution on 23 June 1981, mailing out postcards declaring that their "mission is terminated".{{sfn|Ford|1996|p=38}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/the-wire-magazine-2003-01-cbz/page/n57|last=Hollings|first=Ken|date=January 2003|title=Throbbing Gristle, ''TG24: 24 Hours of Throbbing Gristle''|department=Soundcheck / Reviews|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=227|pages=58–59|via=the Internet Archive|access-date=4 June 2020}}</ref> In a 1987 interview, Cosey Fanni Tutti attributed the band's split to that between her and P-Orridge saying, "TG broke up because me and Gen broke up."{{sfn|Neal|1987|p=216}}

Genesis P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form [[Psychic TV]], and Cosey Fanni Tutti and Carter continued to record together under the names of [[Chris and Cosey]], [[Carter Tutti]] and Creative Technology Institute. Christopherson participated in Psychic TV's first releases, and later joined [[John Balance]] in the latter project [[Coil (band)|Coil]]. Meanwhile, Gen (now known as Genesis Breyer P-Orridge) subsequently formed [[Thee Majesty]] and [[Psychic TV|PTV3]] with the help of his wife [[Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge|Jacqueline "Jaye" Breyer]].

=== Second era: 2004–2010 ===

In 2004, Throbbing Gristle briefly reunited to record and release the limited album ''[[TG Now]]''. On 2 April 2007, TG released the album ''[[Part Two (Throbbing Gristle album)|Part Two]]'', which the group had finished recording in Berlin. It was originally set to be released by Mute Records in September 2006 but was delayed for unknown reasons.

In March 2007, Side-Line announced ''Part Two''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final release date, adding that a string of special live events would take place in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=21321_0_2_0_C |title=Throbbing Gristle Announce Special Live Events to Celebrate First New Album in Over 25 Years – Throbbing Gristle News at side-line.com |date=14 March 2007 |work=Side-Line |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

The group performed a re-interpretation of their debut album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'' twice in 2008 to mark 30 years since its original release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com.au/2008/12/thirty-second-annual-report-limited.html |title=Throbbing Gristle: • ''Thirty-Second Annual Report'' • |date=12 January 2008 |website=Throbbing Gristle |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> The performance in Paris on 6 June was issued as a limited edition framed vinyl set titled ''The Thirty-Second Annual Report'', limited to 777 copies (as the group claim the original was, but other sources claim that there were 785).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/ir0002.php?site=tg08 |title=Throbbing Gristle, "''The Second Annual Report'' Of" |website=Brainwashed |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

Throbbing Gristle worked to record an album based on their interpretation of [[Nico]]'s album ''[[Desertshore]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/news/ |title=News :: Throbbing Gristle Store Shop |website=Greedbag |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618094526/http://tg.greedbag.com/news/ |archive-date=18 June 2007 |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> The group issued the entirety of the recording sessions for this album as a limited edition twelve-CD set packaged in a custom CD wallet, ''[[The Desertshore Installation]]'', which sold out via mail order from the group's website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/the-desertshore-installation/ |title=Throbbing Gristle – ''The Desertshore Installation'' 12 CD Wallet :: Industrial Records Store |website=Greedbag |access-date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601162649/http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/the-desertshore-installation |archive-date=1 June 2013}}</ref>

In April 2009, Throbbing Gristle toured the United States, appearing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] and in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago. ''[[The Third Mind Movements]]'', a new release was made available at these shows, was edited from jams recorded during the ''Desertshore'' sessions.

A collaboration with [[Cerith Wyn Evans]] titled ''A=P=P=A=R=I=T=I=O=N'' was displayed at Tramway, Glasgow from 7 August to 27 September 2009. Throbbing Gristle contributed a multi-channel soundtrack that was played through sixteen hanging Audio Spotlight sound panels that Evans had incorporated into his sculpture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com.au/2009/10/tg-collaborationwith-cerith-wyn-evans.html |title=Throbbing Gristle • TG Collaboration with Cerith Wyn Evans • |date=10 January 2009 |website=Throbbing Gristle |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

In November 2009, Throbbing Gristle and [[Industrial Records]] released their version of the [[FM3#Buddha Machine|Buddha Machine]] titled Gristleism. It was designed by Throbbing Gristle and Christiaan Virant based on [[FM3]]'s design. Gristleism offers more loops and almost twice the frequency range of the Buddha Machine. The player comes in three colours: black, chrome and red.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/gristleism-the-badged-limited-ed/ |title=Throbbing Gristle – Gristleism – The Badged Limited-Edition|website=Greedbag |access-date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616221603/http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/gristleism-the-badged-limited-ed/ |archive-date=16 June 2013}}</ref>

On 29 October 2010, Throbbing Gristle announced on their website that Genesis P-Orridge had informed them that they were no longer willing to perform with Throbbing Gristle and would be returning to their home in New York. Chris Carter, Cosey and Christopherson finished the tour under the name X-TG.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

P-Orridge's website stated that they had not quit Throbbing Gristle and had just stopped participating on the current tour; it also said that an explanation would be released when all things were cleared up. However, on 24 November 2010, Christopherson died in his sleep at the age of 55, and the band subsequently dissolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inlog.org/2010/11/25/r-i-p-peter-sleazy-christopherson-throbbing-gristle-x-tg-1955-2010/ |title=R.I.P.

=== Third era: 2011–present ===

In 2011, [[Industrial Records]] had an official "re-activation", as TG's contract with [[Mute Records]] had expired. Because TG has disbanded following the death of Christopherson, the label's plan is to re-release the original TG albums (''[[The Second Annual Report]]'', ''[[D.o.A: The Third and Final Report]]'', ''[[20 Jazz Funk Greats]]'', ''[[Heathen Earth]]'' and ''[[Greatest Hits (Throbbing Gristle album)|Greatest Hits]]'') on the label. Originally intended to be released on 26 September 2011, they had to delay due to a Sony DADC warehouse fire in London. The plan changed to issue each album chronologically once per week starting on Halloween 2011 with ''The Second Annual Report'' and ending 28 November with ''Greatest Hits''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/tg-files/index.html |title=throbbing-gristle.com |website=throbbing-gristle.com |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

Industrial Records announced that a double album, titled ''Desertshore/The Final Report'', would be released on 26 November 2012. Chris and Cosey produced the album, with the participation of guest vocalists [[Anohni]] (from [[Antony and the Johnsons]]), [[Blixa Bargeld]] (from [[Einstürzende Neubauten]]), [[Marc Almond]] (from [[Soft Cell]]), film director [[Gaspar Noé]] and former pornography star [[Sasha Grey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/INDUSTRIALRECORDS/desertshore/desertshore.html |title=Industrial Records – Releasing 'Industrial Music for Industrial People' Since 1977 |website=throbbing-gristle.com |access-date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708202005/http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/INDUSTRIALRECORDS/desertshore/desertshore.html |archive-date=8 July 2013}}</ref>

A group decision had been made before Christopherson's death that the album would be recorded afresh because they were not satisfied with the ICA recordings. Christopherson had been the driving force behind the project and had been working on the record in Bangkok with [[Danny Hyde]], even getting custom instruments made to use for the album. "It was Sleazy's project, then Cosey and Sleazy's, then I came in on it", Carter said in an interview with ''[[The Quietus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06114-chris-cosey-throbbing-gristle-desertshore |title=Chris & Cosey Talk Plans to Finish TG's ''Desertshore'' |last=Turner |first=Luke |date=19 April 2011 |website=[[The Quietus]] |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> After Christopherson died, the ''Desertshore'' instruments were given to Carter and Cosey, and they began combining the recordings he had been making with the work they had done themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/chris-cosey/ |title=Chris & Cosey • Interview • Music Can Be Regarded as Art. <nowiki>|</nowiki> Art Can Be Regarded as Music. • Peek-a-Boo Music Magazine |last=Becu |first=Didier |date=18 June 2011 |website=Peek-a-Boo Music Magazine |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> They announced plans to debut the album live at [[AV Festival]] on 17 March 2012 accompanied by a screening of [[Philippe Garrel]]'s film ''The Inner Scar'' "for which ''Desertshore'' was the soundtrack and inspiration".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avfestival.co.uk/programme/2012/events-and-exhibitions/wishful-thinking |title=Wishful Thinking: In Remembrance of Peter Christopherson|website=AV Festival |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=did this happen?|date=September 2016}}

== Legacy ==
The band is widely viewed as having created the [[industrial music]] genre, along with contemporaries [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]].{{sfn|Savage|1992|p=587}} The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of [[Industrial Records]] by [[Genesis P-Orridge]] and [[Monte Cazazza]]; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'', they coined the slogan "industrial music for industrial people".<ref name="Kilpatrick, Nancy 2004, p. 86">{{cite book|author-link=Nancy Kilpatrick|last=Kilpatrick|first=Nancy|title=The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined|location=New York|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2004|isbn=0-312-30696-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312306960/page/86 86]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312306960/page/86}}</ref> The first wave of this music appeared with Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire.<ref>''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 42–49.</ref>
