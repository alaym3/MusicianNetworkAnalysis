'''Lee Ji-eun''' ({{korean|hangul=이지은}}; born May 16, 1993), known professionally as '''IU''' ({{Korean|hangul=아이유}}), is a South Korean singer-songwriter and actress. The name ''IU'' is a combination of 'I' and 'you' meaning "you and I become one through music."<ref>{{Cite web|title=[S톡] 이지은, '두드리면 그러면 열릴 것이다' ::|url=http://www.stardailynews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=291998|access-date=April 7, 2021|website=www.stardailynews.co.kr|language=ko|archive-date=April 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428165301/http://www.stardailynews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=291998|url-status=live}}</ref> She signed with [[Kakao M]] (formerly LOEN Entertainment, now [[Kakao Entertainment]]) in 2007 as a [[K-pop#Trainee system|trainee]] and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first mini album ''[[Lost and Found (IU EP)|Lost and Found]]'' (2008). Although her follow-up albums, ''[[Growing Up (IU album)|Growing Up]]'' and ''[[IU...IM]]'', brought mainstream success, it was after the release of "[[Good Day (IU song)|Good Day]]" ({{lang-ko|좋은 날}}), the lead single from her 2010 album ''[[Real (IU EP)|Real]]'', that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's [[Gaon Digital Chart]], and in 2019, it was ranked number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8544710/best-k-pop-songs-2010s-top-100|title=The 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s: Staff List|last=Billboard Staff|date=November 25, 2019|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|language=en|access-date=November 26, 2019|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603064348/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8544710/best-k-pop-songs-2010s-top-100|url-status=live}}</ref>
