'''The Hellacopters''' are a Swedish [[garage rock]] band that was formed in 1994 by [[Nicke Andersson]] (vocals and guitar), [[Dregen|Andreas Tyrone "Dregen" Svensson]] (guitar), [[Kenny Håkansson]] (bass) and [[Matz Robert Eriksson|Robert Eriksson]] (drums). Andersson (sometimes known as Nick Royale) had been the drummer for death metal band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and Dregen was taking a break from his full-time band [[Backyard Babies]]. Dregen and Eriksson had been roadies for Entombed, while Håkansson was a childhood friend of Andersson's. The Hellacopters were initially conceived as a side project for Andersson and Dregen, but it eventually became the main songwriting and performance vehicle for Andersson. The band, together with [[The Hives]], is considered one of the most important Swedish bands in the [[garage rock revival]] and one of the most influential rock bands in Sweden.<ref name="robert interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseyzine.com/articles/interview_hellacopters.html |publisher=Odysseyzine |title=An interview with Robert Eriksson of The Hellacopters |author=Ryan Sette |access-date=9 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000136/http://www.odysseyzine.com/articles/interview_hellacopters.html |archive-date=20 November 2008 }}</ref>

{{Main|Supershitty to the Max!}}
[[File:Backyard babies 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Original guitarist and founding member [[Dregen]] performing live]]
The band name was inspired by a magazine article discovered by Andersson and Dregen while on tour with Entombed in San Francisco. The article was about how the CIA was spying with helicopters on marijuana fields in Mexico and that the Mexicans called them "Hellacopters."<ref name="the hellacopters interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gang-bang.gr/issues/issue5/Hellacopters.htm |publisher=Gang-Bang.gr |title=The Hellacopters interview |access-date=9 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first Hellacopters rehearsal took place on 4 November 1994 as just a jam session, after two more rehearsals the band released their first single "Killing Allan"<ref name="stm">{{cite web|url = http://home.swipnet.se/slavetometal/netmag/intervju/HELLACOPTERS.htm|publisher = Slave to the Metal|title = Hellacopters – By the Grace of Nicke|author = Daniel Eriksson|access-date = 3 August 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604212027/http://home.swipnet.se/slavetometal/netmag/intervju/HELLACOPTERS.htm|archive-date = 4 June 2011|url-status = dead}}</ref> in January 1995 on their own label Psychout Records.<ref name="psychout">{{cite web|url = http://www.grunnenrocks.nl/label/p/psychoutrecords.htm |publisher = Grunnen Rocks|title = Psychout Records|access-date = 9 April 2009}}</ref>

After releasing their second single "1995," the Hellacopters were signed by White Jazz Records and they released their debut album ''[[Supershitty to the Max!]]'' in June 1996. The album was recorded all live in only 26 hours.<ref name="top ten" /><ref name="supershitty">{{cite AV media notes|title= Supershitty to the Max!|title-link= Supershitty to the Max!|others= The Hellacopters|year= 1996|type=CD booklet|publisher= White Jazz Records}}</ref> The band won a Swedish Grammy for the album.<ref name="kenny interview" /> Anders "Boba Fett" Lindström, guitarist of the Swedish rock band [[The Diamond Dogs]], was then recruited to play keyboards shortly before they supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their Scandinavian dates in June 1997.

=== ''Payin' the Dues'' and Dregen's departure ===
{{Main|Payin' the Dues}}
The band recorded their follow-up album ''[[Payin' the Dues]]'' in February 1997. The record barely managed to break into the top 20 in Sweden and the top 30s in Finland.<ref name="s charts" /> Andersson then left Entombed completely to concentrate full-time on the Hellacopters. A Swedish tour included a show at the second largest stage at the [[Hultsfred Festival]],<ref name="hultsfred">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockparty.se/festivalinfo/festivalhistorik/1997.aspx |publisher=Rockparty |title=Hultsfred 97 |access-date=9 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055854/http://www.rockparty.se/festivalinfo/festivalhistorik/1997.aspx |archive-date=19 June 2009 }}</ref> while the band famously played a secret gig backstage on a small makeshift stage.<ref>[[Goodnight Cleveland]] bonus material</ref> In 1998 the band toured Europe with [[Gluecifer]], with whom they recorded the split album ''Respect the Rock''. Soon after, [[Dregen]] left the band and returned to [[Backyard Babies]].

{{cquote|Simply because it was too much hassle playing in two bands at the same time. Fame is not everything y´know... Our time will come. Backyard Babies has been around since 1989. I love bands doing it for life. I sure miss the Hellacopters guys a lot sometimes though..|||Dregen|on his departure from the Hellacopters.}}

With Dregen's departure in the middle of an extensive tour, the band recruited guitarists Chuck Pounder and [[Mattias Hellberg]] for their tours of Scandinavia and U.S./Canada, respectively.<ref name="tour" /> While on tour in America the band also had the opportunity to jam with legendary Detroit rockers [[Scott Morgan (musician)|Scott Morgan]] of the [[Sonic's Rendezvous Band]] and [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] of the [[MC5]],<ref name="kenny interview" /> beginning long working relationships with both.

=== ''Grande Rock'' and Dahlqvist's debut ===
{{Main|Grande Rock}}
In September 1998 the band recorded their third album ''[[Grande Rock]]''. Due to the absence of a second guitarist, Lindström and Hellberg both contributed on guitar.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= Grande Rock|title-link= Grande Rock|others= The Hellacopters|year= 1998|type=CD booklet|publisher= White Jazz Records}}</ref> The album's 1970s classic rock sound<ref name="top ten">{{cite web|url=http://www.alarmpress.com/4639/music-interview/the-top-ten-hellacopters-songs/ |publisher=ALARM |title=The Top 10 Hellacopters Songs |author=Jamie Ludwig |access-date=9 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403072449/http://www.alarmpress.com/4639/music-interview/the-top-ten-hellacopters-songs/ |archive-date=3 April 2009 }}</ref> was a departure from their previous albums, which featured a louder Detroit punk rock and garage rock sound. One reason for this was that the band recorded the album in an older studio from the 1970s in the Swedish woods, where they learned from an older and more experienced [[recording engineer|engineer]] who knew how to create the vintage seventies sound the band desired.<ref name="kenny robban">{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmhV-c78eOs|publisher = BCN|title = The Hellacopters in BCN|author = Eric Palaudàries |access-date = 9 April 2009}}</ref>

{{cquote|The recording of ''Grande Rock'', it was so different [compared] to the other records we did, were we usually go into the studio record, go to a bar get drunk and then go to the studio next day. We actually went into the Swedish forest... There's this old hippie studio from the seventies up in the Swedish woods and there's this 50 year old guy that working there. He's been working with every sort of music from Swedish folk to [[Jimi Hendrix]]... So we figure well he was traveling with Swedish hippie bands in the seventies, he should have an idea how to create a genuine seventies rock sound. We took a few albums with us to the studio, showed the albums and he was all like, 'Yeah, I think this was the way they created the sound.' And not by the push of a button or a pedal or something, a box... The proper way of handcrafting, doing it probably the way they did do it back then...|||Kenny Håkansson|on the band's new sound.}}

''Grande Rock'' became the band's first album to break into the Swedish top ten, before dropping out of the list after one week.<ref name="s charts">{{cite web|url = http://www.swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=The+Hellacopters|publisher = Swedish Charts|title = The Hellacopters|access-date = 9 April 2009}}</ref> For the ensuing tour, the band considered recruiting an American guitarist but hired [[Robert Dahlqvist]].<ref name="strings" /> With Dahlqvist as a full-time replacement for [[Dregen]] the band set out on tour along with [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[The Nomads (Swedish band)|The Nomads]] and [[Powder Monkeys]].<ref name="tour">{{cite web|url=http://www.hellacopters.com/site/theshows.asp |publisher=Hellacopters.com |title=The Shows |access-date=12 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622065108/http://www.hellacopters.com/site/theshows.asp |archive-date=22 June 2009 }}</ref>

=== ''High Visibility'' with Chips Kiesbye ===
{{Main|High Visibility|Goodnight Cleveland}}
In 2000 the band headed back into the studio to record their first album with Robert Dahlqvist<ref name="top ten" /> who by then had earned the nickname "Strängen" or "Strings" due to all the strings he had broken during rehearsals.<ref name="thunder express" /> It was also their first time working with producer [[Chips Kiesbye]], who had worked with artists such as [[Sahara Hotnights]], [[Millencolin]], [[Thåström]], [[The Nomads (Swedish band)|The Nomads]], The Turpentines, his own band [[Sator (band)|Sator]], and many other Swedish rock bands. Kiesbye would become their producer of choice and he produced all of the band's subsequent studio albums. ''[[High Visibility]]'' spent twelve weeks on the Swedish charts<ref name="s charts" /> and was certified gold in that nation.<ref name="high gold">{{cite web|url=http://d12753932.u160.foretag.surftown.se/wp-content/uploads/ar-2001.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217100531/http://d12753932.u160.foretag.surftown.se/wp-content/uploads/ar-2001.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 December 2008 |publisher=Ifpi |title=Guldskivor 2001 |access-date=9 April 2009 }}</ref> The band set out on a Scandinavian and European tour in support of the album along with the then-unknown band [[The Hives]] as their opening act.<ref name="tour" /> ''High Visibility'' was later released in the United States and the band's tour was chronicled in the documentary ''[[Goodnight Cleveland]]''. The title is a reference to the mockumentary ''[[This Is Spınal Tap]]'' in which Derek Smalls yells "Hello Cleveland" to an unseen audience while the band tries to find their way onto the stage. Andersson adapted the phrase at the end of the band's show at the Agora Ballroom.

In early 2002, the band released their first compilation of non-album tracks ''[[Cream Of The Crap Vol. 1]]'', the [[Liner notes|CD's booklet]] contained one half of a poster designed by Andersson the second half of the poster was included in the [[Cream Of The Crap Vol. 2|second volume]] of the Cream of The Crap series.<ref name="stm" /> The band recorded 20 songs<ref name="stm" /> for their fifth album at [[Polar Music|Polar Studios]] in Stockholm,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellacopters.com/site/disco.asp?action=bythegrace |publisher=Hellacopters.com |title=By The Grace of God |access-date=3 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101002206/http://www.hellacopters.com/site/disco.asp?action=bythegrace |archive-date=1 January 2009 }}</ref> 13 of the 20 songs were included on ''[[By the Grace of God (album)|By the Grace of God]]''.

Nicke Andersson worked on his side project [[The Solution (band)|The Solution]] with [[Scott Morgan (musician)|Scott Morgan]], releasing the album ''[[Communicate!]]'' in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for [[The Cardigans]] album ''[[Long Gone Before Daylight]]''. Dahlqvist started a side project called Thunder Express, which was later renamed [[Dundertåget]], and also recorded the album ''Fula Gubben Hitler'' with Swedish singer/songwriter [[Stefan Sundström]]; Dahlqvist was pictured on the album's cover [[crucifixion|suspended on a cross]].<ref name="kors">{{cite web|url = http://www.kuriren.nu/arkiv/2004/07/20/Senaste+nytt+(NK)/1768113/Stor-h%F6stturn%E9-med-Stefan-Sundstr%F6m-.aspx|publisher = Norrbottens Kuriren|title = Stor höstturné med Stefan Sundström|access-date = 9 April 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dahlqvist also toured along with former Hellacopters member [[Mattias Hellberg]] in support of the album.

During the Hellacopters' break, the second compilation of non-album tracks ''[[Cream Of The Crap Vol. 2]]'' was released. The band claims they have enough material for a Vol. 3 and a Vol. 4, but there are no plans for more parts in the ''Cream of the Crap'' series.<ref name="robert interview" /> Eriksson and Lindstrom also did a small DJ tour in Italy before joining up with the rest of the band to record and release ''[[Rock & Roll Is Dead]]'' in 2005.

{{cquote|Again it's a cool title for a rock'n'roll album, it's got rock'n'roll and dead in it. It sounds pretty good to me, looks good in print.

The book, ''The Hellacopters, du kérosène dans les veines'' by Rudy Charis, was published by Camion Blanc and is due to be released in English in 2018.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} On 3 February 2017, former guitarist Robert Dahlqvist died at age 40. The band's distributor Sound Pollution stated that Dahlqvist died accidentally at home, having drowned in a bathtub following an epileptic seizure. At the time of his death, he had several concerts and appearances scheduled for the coming weeks, and had nearly completed recording a solo album under the pseudonym Strängen.<ref>[http://www.familjesidan.se/cases/robert-dahlqvist/funeral-notices Familjesidan – Funeral notices] {{in lang|sv}}</ref>

=== ''Supershitty to the Max!'' anniversary reunion ===
In April 2016, the band announced that their original lineup would be reuniting for the 20th anniversary of the release of their debut album, ''[[Supershitty to the Max!]]'', initially playing the 2016 [[Sweden Rock Festival]]. The band also announced the release of an exclusive 12-inch vinyl record, with two tracks ("My Mephistophelean Creed" and "Don't Stop Now") written during the ''Supershitty to the Max!'' sessions but recorded in 2016. The Hellacopters went on to play several international festivals in 2016 and 2017, such as the [[Roskilde Festival]], with ([[Hanoi Rocks]], [[New York Dolls]] and [[Michael Monroe]]) bass player [[Sami Yaffa]] replacing original member [[Kenny Håkansson]] for the 2017 shows.

== Musical style ==
Heavily influenced by early [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands such as [[MC5]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[The Stooges]] and [[The Heartbreakers]]<ref name="kenny interview" /> as well as bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Blue Cheer]] and [[Motörhead]]<ref name="stm" /> the band's debut album – ''[[Supershitty to the Max!]]'' – contained fast-paced songs and [[Distortion (music)|overdriven]] guitars.<ref name="top ten" /> While the band's second album – ''[[Payin' the Dues]]'' – was in similar style as their debut album it also displayed a tighter musicianship and songwriting technique as well as keyboards by Anders Lindström.<ref name="top ten" /> ''[[Grande Rock]]'' was the first studio album to be recorded without original guitarist [[Dregen]] and was a departure from the band's [[Music of Detroit#Rock and roll|Detroit rock]] influenced sound to a more [[Rock music#Mid to late 1970s|1970s rock]] sound.<ref name="top ten" /> The band continued to evolve their sound throughout their career, while Nicke Andersson claims that all of their music is based around three [[Chord (music)|chords]] and a [[Refrain|chorus]] the band had no interest in repeating themselves.<ref name="stm" /> On the band's later releases, Andersson's vocals incorporated [[soul (music)|soul]] influences from his and [[Scott Morgan (musician)|Scott Morgans]] side project [[The Solution (band)|The Solution]].<ref name="stm" /> The Hellacopters also recorded many [[cover version|cover songs]] throughout their career of songs from bands and artist such as [[Radio Birdman]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Nationalteatern]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Nomads (Swedish band)|The Nomads]], [[April Stevens]], [[Sonic's Rendezvous Band]], [[The Dictators]], [[Love (band)|Love]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellacopters.com/site/themusic.asp |publisher=hellacopters.com |title=The Music |access-date=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905084922/http://www.hellacopters.com/site/themusic.asp |archive-date=5 September 2009 }}</ref> However Andersson asserts that there is a difference between the music that inspires him and the music that has an influence on his music, Andersson has mentioned [[country music]] artist [[Guy Clark]] as an artist that inspires his songwriting without affecting the band's sound.<ref name="stm" />
