==Biography==
Known for its [[Afrocentrism]] and militant activism as member of the Blackwatch movement, X Clan soon gained fame for the controversy its music aroused, though commercial success was sporadic.<ref name="allmusic"/> X Clan's debut was ''[[To the East, Blackwards]]'' (1990), followed by ''[[Xodus]]'' (1992) and a temporary break-up. Both albums peaked at #11 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] [[record chart|chart]] in the United States.

Other artists who were affiliated with X Clan and Blackwatch include [[Lin Que|Isis]], Queen Mother Rage, and [[YZ (rapper)|YZ]]. X Clan's affiliates released a string of titles throughout the early 1990s: Professor X released a solo album titled ''Years of the 9, on the Blackhand Side'' in 1991 and a second solo album titled ''Puss N' Boots: The Struggle Continues'' in 1993; Queen Mother Rage released ''Vanglorious Law'' in 1991 (''vanglorious'' is a word that the group made up—not to be confused with “vainglorious”); Isis released ''Rebel Soul'' in 1990; and YZ released his debut ''Sons of The Father'' (noted for the song "Thinking of a Master Plan"), in 1989, followed by ''The Ghetto's Been Good to Me'' (which included his modest hit "Return of the Holy One") in 1993.  YZ became affiliated with the group after releasing his first album, and that Isis is also the MC known as [[Lin Que|Linque Ayoung]], who at one point was a member of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]-affiliated group [[Deadly Venoms]].

===Later projects===
In 1994 Brother J formed a new group, Dark Sun Riders, that released the full-length ''Seeds of Evolution'' in 1996. In 1995, long-time group member Sugar Shaft died from complications of AIDS. Brother J was an early and valued member of the worldwide Hip Hop organization called Ill Crew Universal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daveyd.com/fnvaprilnews.html |title=April '98 Hip Hop News |website=Daveyd.com |date=1998-04-21 |access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> X Clan reunited in the late 1990s but did not release any new material. Brother J assembled a new crew that he calls X Clan Millennium Cipher and released a [[Gramophone record|vinyl single]] for "The One/Blackwards Row" in 2004. Professor X died from complications of [[spinal meningitis]] on March 17, 2006.

A new X Clan album, titled ''[[Return from Mecca]]'' (originally titled ''The Trinity''), was released in 2007, featuring [[Damian "Jr Gong" Marley]], [[Chali 2na]] of [[Jurassic 5]], [[RBX]], [[KRS-One]], [[Daddy X]] of [[Kottonmouth Kings]], and [[Jacoby Shaddix]], lead vocalist of the rock band [[Papa Roach]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gudmundson|first=Darryl|title=X-Clan Preps New Album, Calls for Movie Boycott|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.4374/title.x-clan-preps-new-album-calls-for-movie-boycott|work=hiphopdx.com|access-date=March 18, 2013}}</ref> Also, [[Tech N9ne]] is featured on a hidden bonus track titled "Respect."

X Clan opened for [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s Tempest Tour and, in January 2009, released an album titled ''Mainstream Outlawz''.
