'''ZOEgirl''' was an American [[contemporary Christian music|Christian teen pop]] and [[pop rock]] band formed in 1999. The group comprised Chrissy Conway-Katina, [[Alisa Childers]] and Kristin Swinford-Schweain. They were signed to [[Sparrow Records]] from 1999 to 2006 and released their debut single "I Believe" in 2000.<ref name="TBMS">{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmason.com/photos.htm|title=The Brian Mason Show|author=Brian Mason|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906044234/http://www.brianmason.com/photos.htm|archive-date=September 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> This song and their self-titled debut album ''[[ZOEgirl (album)|ZOEgirl]]'' helped them become Sparrow's fastest selling artist of all time. ''[[With All of My Heart]]'', the lead single for ''[[Life (ZOEgirl album)|Life]]'', was the group's only No. 1 Christian [[contemporary hit radio]] (CHR) single and led to the group receiving a [[GMA Dove Award]] for [[New Artist of the Year (Dove Award)|New Artist of the Year]] in 2002. By the end of 2003, over one million albums from ZOEgirl were sold.

As a response to the musical trends of the time, ZOEgirl changed their format from teen pop to pop rock with the release of "[[You Get Me (song)|You Get Me]]" in 2003. Released as the lead single for their third album, ''[[Different Kind of Free]]'', this was their only No. 1 Christian [[adult contemporary]] (AC) single. It also peaked at No. 2 on CHR, making it the second-highest ZOEgirl song on that chart. The group's musical change and the growing [[Copyright infringement|digital piracy]] at the time led to slower sales of ZOEgirl's music. Their highly anticipated fourth and final studio album ''[[Room to Breathe (ZOEgirl album)|Room to Breathe]]'' earned the No. 1 spot on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers]] Album charts. It was ZOEgirl's least successful album in terms of US Christian radio airplay, with only "About You" and "Scream" released as singles and the latter being unsuccessful.

In 2006, ZOEgirl disbanded, and Kristin and Chrissy formed the group Colman Blue with Kelly Trontell, which split up in January 2010.

In 2011, the group reunited for a two-hour interview on The Brian Mason Show, suggesting that they may release a [[lullaby]] album in the future.<ref name="TBMS" />  On May 24, 2013, Chrissy registered the ZOEgirlMusic.com domain name with [[Go Daddy]].  The group confirmed that they have reunited to create the lullaby album, though nothing has materialized.

==History==
=== 1999: Making the group ===
Norman Miller, an artist manager for groups such as [[Avalon (American group)|Avalon]], said one day: "I see a need for a girls pop group." He knew [[Alisa Childers]] since 1977, when she was two years old, and "decided to build the [girl] group around her."  Together with Lynn Nichols, a writer and executive producer, they approached Kristin (Swinford) Schweain, who was then part of a jazz group.  Nichols said: "She [Alisa] had a real writing sensitivity. Then we heard Kristin sing and play the piano. She had a pure pop voice, and it was a really interesting mix with Alisa's more gritty style. Then we said, 'Let's just see what unfolds.'" Schweain felt that it was a difficult decision for her to choose between her jazz group and this new opportunity in a girl group: "I felt like I was betraying them [her previous group], but at the same time I felt a pull to ZOEgirl and felt led to meet Alisa." She ultimately decided to join the group.

They wanted a third member, so Kristin remembered that her friend had "a friend in Atlanta who was playing in a band and working with some musicians."  Nichols recalls: "It sounded kind of flaky, but I told Kristin to give her a call."  This girl from Atlanta was Chrissy (Conway) Katina, who was recently rejected by [[LaFace Records]]. Katina said: "My lawyer thought I was crazy for wanting to join a Christian group. He told me I’d never make any money."  Regardless, she chose to become the third member of the group, which has yet to be named.<ref name = "3OAK-CCM">[http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/zoegirl/features/three-of-a-kind/ ZOEgirl | Three of a Kind |CCM Magazine].  Written in 2003.  Retrieved on October 30, 2011.</ref>

=== 2000–2002: Pop years and "With All of My Heart" ===
{{Main|With All of My Heart}}
[[Image:ZOEgirl Meaning.gif|thumb|right|This graphic, found on early versions of ZOEgirl's website, explains the band name's meaning.]]
The girl group signed to [[Sparrow Records]] but needed a name.  Their original name was simply "ZOE", all in capital letters, their favourite from a list of possible names they have made.  However, there was already a trademark for this name, so they added the suffix "girl" in minuscule letters to form the name "ZOEgirl."<ref name = "3OAK-CCM" />  The name ZOEgirl comes from the Greek word ''zoe'', which, in Greek, means life.  Through their music, ZOEgirl talks about life in Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/ZoegirlLife.asp|title=''Life'' review|access-date=August 10, 2008|author=Shaun Stevenson|publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout}}</ref>

ZOEgirl's first, self-titled release was released on August 15, 2000.  Most of the songs talk about their relationship with God, although two of them are about fleeing a sinful lifestyle and were not released as singles.  "I Believe" and "Living For You" both obtained the No. 4 position on the Adult Contemporary (AC) chart, while "Anything Is Possible" obtained the No. 8 position on the contemporary hit radio (CHR) chart.  The album itself peaked at position No. 8 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers]] chart and sold over 350 000 copies by the end of 2003.<ref name = "3OAK-CCM" />

The single "[[With All of My Heart]]" was released on October 8, 2001 to promote the group's album, ''[[Life (ZOEgirl album)|Life]]''.  The song obtained the No. 1 position for 3 weeks on the CHR Charts, and the No. 3 position on the AC radio charts. ''Life'' was released on November 20, 2001 with better critical acclaim and sales compared to their debut album.<ref name = "C2day">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/reviews/2001/life.html|title=''Life'' review|publisher=Christian Music Today|author=Russ Breimeier|access-date=November 7, 2008}}</ref>  Over 120 000 copies of this album were sold during the first six weeks of its release, and nearly 370 000 copies were sold by the end of 2003.<ref name = "3OAK-CCM" />

=== 2003–2005: Transition to pop rock and "You Get Me" ===
{{See also|You Get Me (song)}}
After a drastic musical change from [[bubblegum pop]] to [[pop rock]], [[Different Kind of FREE]] was released.  This is the most critically acclaimed album from ZOEgirl, mainly due to its lead single "[[You Get Me (song)|You Get Me]]" and the [[Radio Disney]] single "Feel Alright".  Another factor leading to this album's success is the music video filmed for "You Get Me".  The girls then embarked on the FREE Experience Tour to promote the album with artists [[Superchick]] and [[Joy Williams (musician)|Joy Williams]].

ZOEgirl released their final album with Sparrow, ''[[Room to Breathe (ZOEgirl album)|Room to Breathe]]'', on January 1, 2005.  The album peaked at position 108 on the ''Billboard'' 200, and at position No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=zoegirl|chart=all}}|website=Billboard.com|access-date=November 2, 2008|title=Artist Chart History&nbsp;– ZOEgirl}}</ref> making this the highest charting ZOEgirl album to date.  However, its two singles were not as successful as the group's past hits. "About You" peaked at position No. 5 on the CHR charts and at No. 4 on the AC chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=May 6, 2018|title=Christian Music: Praise and Worship Songs Chart {{!}} Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/christian-songs/2005-07-09|access-date=March 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506142900/https://www.billboard.com/charts/christian-songs/2005-07-09|archive-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref>  "Scream" peaked at No. 40 on the AC charts and at No. 14 on the CHR charts.

The group's first [[greatest hits album]], ''[[With All of My Heart – The Greatest Hits]]'', was released on December 26, 2005.  Two new songs were added to the album: "Unchangeable" and "One Day".  "Unchangeable" was released as the album's lead single, peaking at No. 20 on CHR and No. 27 on AC.  "One Day" was not released as a single.

=== 2006: Disestablishment ===
On September 2006, by means of their now-defunct ZOEgirl fan club site, the group announced that they would quit writing and recording music as a group so that members could tend to their personal objectives.

* Chrissy Conway-Katina was recording for a solo album ''Beautiful Redemption'', though it was never released. In 2008, she formed a new group, COLMANblue, with Kelli Trontel and Kristin Schweain later joined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=342625193&blogID=429750437|title=Exciting News and a little quiz|author=ColmanBlue|access-date=October 16, 2008|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707045434/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=342625193&blogID=429750437|archive-date=July 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> They recorded and released "Hey (Not Worth the Worry)" in 2009.

=== 2011: Reunion ===
After more than four years of inactivity and separation, ZOEgirl reunited on February 27, 2011 for an interview on ''The Brian Mason Show''. The group made no plans to create music together, but says that it is still possible.<ref  name="TBMS" /> But {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, the group hasn't seem to be active and they appeared to have faded into obscurity since nothing has been announced since 2013.{{citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=The last reference was from 2011, not 2013}}
