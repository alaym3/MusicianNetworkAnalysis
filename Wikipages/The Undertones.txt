'''The Undertones''' are a [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland in 1974. From 1975 to 1983, the Undertones consisted of [[Feargal Sharkey]] (vocals), [[John O'Neill (guitarist)|John O'Neill]] (rhythm guitar, vocals), [[Damian O'Neill]] (lead guitar, vocals), [[Michael Bradley (musician)|Michael Bradley]] (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums).<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 55</ref> Much of the earlier Undertones material drew influence from [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music|new wave]]; the Undertones also incorporated elements of rock, [[glam rock]] and [[post-punk]] into material released after 1979, before citing [[soul music|soul]] and [[Motown Records|Motown]] as the influence for the material released upon their final album.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} pp. 207-208</ref> The Undertones released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983,<ref name="JohnPeel">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/u/undertones/ |title=Undertones |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=November 2006 |website=[[BBC Radio 1]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref> citing musical differences as the reason for the break up.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-undertones-mn0000920073/biography |title=The Undertones |last=Heibutzki |first=Ralph |author-link=Ralph Heibutzki |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=24 October 2003 |access-date=16 April 2012}}</ref>

Despite the backdrop of [[the Troubles]] in Derry and across Northern Ireland, the vast majority (though not all) of the material the Undertones released focused not upon the political climate,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21097523 |title=Teenage Kicks: The story of The Undertones |date=19 January 2013 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=BBC News |access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref> but upon issues such as adolescence, teenage [[angst]] and heartbreak.

==Formation and early gigs==
The Undertones formed in Derry, Northern Ireland in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |author=Andrew Quinn |url=http://www.derryjournal.com/what-s-on/arts-culture/the-sunday-interview-mickey-bradley-from-the-undertones-1-4726089 |title=The Sunday Interview - Mickey Bradley from The Undertones |newspaper=[[Derry Journal]] |date=27 January 2013 |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073533/http://www.derryjournal.com/what-s-on/arts-culture/the-sunday-interview-mickey-bradley-from-the-undertones-1-4726089 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band members were five friends from [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan]] and the [[Bogside]], who originally drew inspiration from such artists as [[the Beatles]], [[Small Faces]] and [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]].<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 6</ref> The band initially rehearsed cover versions at the home of the guitarists, brothers John and Vincent O'Neill, and in the shed of a neighbour.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Story of Teenage Kicks: How a Punk Classic was Born|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/04/the-undertones-teenage-kicks-michael-bradley-punk-classic|access-date=12 March 2019|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 March 2016}}</ref> (In early 1976, before the band had played gigs at any venues, Vincent O'Neill left the band;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_1.html/ |title=My Life As An Undertone : Part One |author=Michael Bradley |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> he was replaced by his younger brother Damian.)

Beginning in February 1976 the group, at this stage still unnamed, began playing gigs at various minor local venues, including schools, parish halls and [[Scout hall|Scout hut]]s, where the band's lead singer, Feargal Sharkey, was a local [[Scout leader]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_1.html/ |title=My Life As An Undertone : Part One |author=Michael Bradley |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-date=1 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192933/http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sharkey was also responsible for giving the band their first name: at the introduction to a gig at Saint Joseph's Secondary School in Derry on 16 March 1976,<ref name="theundertones.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.theundertones.com/__/Shows_1976-1983.html/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309140830/http://www.theundertones.com/__/Shows_1976-1983.html/ |archive-date=9 March 2009 }}</ref> Feargal Sharkey was asked the name of the band and quickly replied "The Hot Rods". At a later gig, Sharkey named the band "[[Little Feat]]": another name already used by another group.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 29</ref>

Later that year, drummer Billy Doherty proposed an alternate name for the group: The Undertones, which Doherty had discovered in his school history book.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_2.html// |title=My Life As An Undertone : Part Two |author=Michael Bradley |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-date=1 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192702/http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The other members of the band agreed to the proposal.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 37</ref>

With the arrival of punk rock in late 1976, the artistic focus of the band changed. Artists such as [[the Adverts]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Buzzcocks]] and, particularly, the [[Ramones]] became major influences on the Undertones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-punk-rock-singles-by-the-undertones-michael-bradley |title=The 10 Best Punk Rock Singles, by The Undertones' Michael Bradley |publisher=loudersound.com |access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref>

In addition to being a Scout leader, Feargal Sharkey worked as a television repairman and delivery man. The van which Sharkey drove in this employment was used by the Undertones to transport their equipment to and from various venues.<ref name="derryjournal1">{{cite news |author=Andrew Quinn Email |url=http://www.derryjournal.com/what-s-on/arts-culture/the-sunday-interview-mickey-bradley-from-the-undertones-1-4726089 |title=The Sunday Interview - Mickey Bradley from The Undertones |newspaper=[[Derry Journal]] |date=27 January 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073533/http://www.derryjournal.com/what-s-on/arts-culture/the-sunday-interview-mickey-bradley-from-the-undertones-1-4726089 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===The Casbah===
By 1977 the band were performing their own three-[[Chord (music)|chord]] [[pop punk]] material, which was performed alongside cover versions at concerts, primarily at the Casbah, where the band began to perform in February.{{refn|group=n|In 1986, Feargal Sharkey would estimate the maximum number of people the band ever played to at the Casbah was approximately 200 people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feargal Sharkey's Cycle of Survival|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118126936?|access-date=15 March 2019|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=22 June 1986}}</ref>}} The Undertones had occasionally earned money at venues where they had performed throughout 1976,<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 30</ref> but these gigs at the Casbah were the first performances for which the Undertones were paid on a regular basis, as performing at the Casbah earned the group up to [[£]]30 for each attendance fee.<ref name="auto">''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 41</ref>{{refn|group=n|By 1978, the Undertones would also perform live at other musical venues in Derry such as the Rock Club.

The gigs performed at the Casbah gave the Undertones increased confidence in their musical ability, and in June 1977 they performed concerts outside Derry for the first time, supporting a [[Dublin]] punk group named [[The Radiators from Space]].<ref name="auto"/>

In March 1978, the Undertones recorded a demo tape at [[Magee College|Magee University]] in Derry and sent copies of the tape to various record companies in the hope of securing a record deal, but only received official letters of rejection. The band had also sent a copy of their recordings to influential [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]], requesting he play the songs on his radio programme. Peel replied to the band, offering to pay for a recording session in [[Belfast]]. On 15 June 1978, the band recorded their debut four-song [[Extended play|EP]] "Teenage Kicks" on a budget of only £200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/feb/04/musicnews.northernireland |title=Snow Patrol give a lift to Belfast music plan |last=McDonald |first=Henry |date=4 February 2007 |work=The Observer |access-date=1 November 2009 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424023538/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/feb/04/musicnews.northernireland |archive-date=24 April 2010 }}</ref> The EP was engineered by Davy Shannon at Wizard Studios, Belfast, and was released on Belfast's [[Good Vibrations (record label)|Good Vibrations]] [[record label]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/undertones-teenage-kicks |title=Sound On Sound: The Undertones' Teenage Kicks |work=Sound On Sound |last=Buskin |first=Richard |date=1 April 2011|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|At the time of the recording of this EP, Feargal Sharkey had decided to leave the Undertones.

==Sire Records==
[[Seymour Stein]], the president of [[Sire Records]] – in London on business – heard John Peel play "Teenage Kicks" on BBC Radio 1 and became interested in the band. Stein sent a London-based representative named Paul McNally to Derry to discuss a record deal with the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_3.html// |title=My Life As An Undertone : Part Three |author=Michael Bradley |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-date=1 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191909/http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_3.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> McNally saw the band play live in what would ultimately prove to be their final performance at the Casbah on 29 September 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/Shows_1976-1983.html/ |title=Shows 1976-1983 |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-date=28 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128143423/http://www.theundertones.com/_/Shows_1976-1983.html/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following day, McNally convened with the Undertones to discuss a record contract. Three members of the band signed the proposed contract on this date, with the understanding that Feargal Sharkey and Michael Bradley would discuss negotiations to the contract with Seymour Stein in person in London.<ref>The Undertones: An Anthology sleeve notes, p. 10.</ref>

===Teenage Kicks (1978–1979)===
On 2 October 1978, Bradley and Sharkey agreed to an increased advance fee of £10,000 offered by Stein upon the recording contract and signed to Sire Records on a five-year contract. Sire Records subsequently obtained all rights to the material released upon the Teenage Kicks EP and the song was re-released as a standard vinyl single upon Sire's own label two weeks later.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 85</ref>

On 26 October, the Undertones performed "Teenage Kicks" live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. With help from Peel (who had also recorded and broadcast a ''[[Peel Session]]'' with the Undertones on the 16th), Teenage Kicks peaked at number 31 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] the following month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19781029/7501/ |title=Official Singles Chart Top 75 &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref>
  
In November 1978, the Undertones embarked on their first tour of the UK. This tour lasted until 16 December and saw the band appear as the supporting act for [[The Rezillos]] and [[John Otway]] in England and Wales in addition to headlining in three concerts in Belfast and Derry.<ref name="theundertones.com"/>

In January 1979, the Undertones recorded their [[The Undertones (album)|eponymous debut album]] at Eden Studios in [[Acton (London)|Acton, West London]], using [[Producer (music)|producer]] [[Roger Bechirian]], whom the band had worked with for the first time the previous December, when Bechirian had produced the band's second single, "Get Over You". Much of the material upon their first album had been performed regularly at the Casbah, and the band were able to record this album in the space of less than four weeks.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' p. 114</ref>

Following the release of "Get Over You" in February 1979, the Undertones' eponymous debut album was released in May. The primary lyrical concern of the songs focused upon youthful relationships and adolescence. Three further punk singles "[[Jimmy Jimmy (song)|Jimmy Jimmy]]", "[[Here Comes the Summer]]" and "[[You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It?)]]" were released between April and October 1979, each to critical acclaim. In September 1979,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19790926&id=nlsxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6402,3738796&hl=en] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> the Undertones toured the United States for the first time, supporting [[The Clash]] with eight concerts in six different States.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/Shows_1976-1983.html |title=Shows 1976-1983 |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref><ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} pp. 162-164</ref>

===Hypnotised (1980)===
Following the 'You Got My Number tour' of October 1979, the Undertones began recording the songs for their second album, ''[[Hypnotised (album)|Hypnotised]]'', at [[Wisseloord Studios]] in the Netherlands. The recording of the songs began in December. Ten songs were recorded before the band returned to Derry prior to Christmas to write and record further songs for the album. Three further songs were written during this break: "Tearproof", "More Songs About Chocolate and Girls" and "[[Wednesday Week]]".<ref>Sleeve notes for 2009 'Salvo-music' re-issue of Hypnotised album.</ref>

In January 1980, the production of ''Hypnotised'' was finished at [[Eden Studios]] in London, with the Undertones recording the three further songs written the previous December, plus two further songs—"Hypnotised" and a [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Under The Boardwalk]]"—which had been written that month. Following the completion of their second LP, the band embarked upon a two-week tour of Ireland before touring continental Europe for the first time in March.<ref name="theundertones.com"/>

On 28 March 1980, the Undertones released their sixth single, "[[My Perfect Cousin]]". The song, which had been written the previous summer by Damian O'Neill and Michael Bradley, reached number 9 in the UK charts and would subsequently prove to be the band's highest charting single in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connollyco.com/discography/undertones/index.html |title=The Undertones Discography |website=connollyco.com |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> The following month, on 21 April 1980, the band's second LP, ''Hypnotised'' was released. This album reached number 6 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], remaining in the Top 10 for one month. The same week the album was released, the Undertones embarked on their 'Humming tour', which saw the band play a total of 25 gigs across the UK between April and June.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shows 1976-1983|url=http://theundertones.com/_/Shows_1976-1983.html|publisher=theundertones.com|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref>

Less than two weeks after the completion of the 'Humming tour', the Undertones toured the United States for the second time; this time as the headlining band.<ref name="theundertones.com"/> "Wednesday Week"—the second single to be released from ''Hypnotised''—was released in July 1980. This single reached number 11 in the UK chart and remained in the [[Top 40]] for a total of seven weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/uk-top-40-singles-chart/19800727/750140/ |title=Official Singles Chart Top 40 &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref>

Between September and December 1980, the Undertones performed two further tours: the 'Disaster Tour (European Style)', which saw the band perform in continental Europe and—in December—the 'See No More' tour of the UK.<ref name="theundertones.com"/>

In terms of chart sales, the year 1980 was the Undertones' most successful year.<ref>''The Rough Guide to Rock'' p. 1121</ref> In a review by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine the same year, the Undertones were described as: "Possibly the best pop group in the English speaking world."<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 1980</ref>

==EMI==
===Positive Touch (1981–1982)===
In December 1980, the Undertones announced their intention to split from Sire Records as they were unhappy with the lack of promotion they were receiving outside of the UK, particularly in the US. Following negotiations, their manager, Andy Ferguson, succeeded in the band retaining ownership rights to the material released on Sire Records; Ferguson subsequently signed the group to [[EMI]] in March 1981.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} pp. 180-181</ref>

On 4 January 1981, the band began recording their third album, ''[[Positive Touch]]'', again at Wisseloord Studios,<ref name="derryjournal1"/><ref>Sleeve notes for 2009 Salvo re-release of ''Positive Touch'' p. 6</ref> and again with Roger Bechirian as producer. The band recorded a total of eight songs in five days before returning to Derry. Later the same month, the band returned to Wisseloord Studios to complete the recording of the LP. The songs on this album indicated a change in both musical and lyrical influences: although the songs remained largely guitar-oriented, the band had written songs which focused upon the [[Northern Irish Troubles|Troubles]] in Northern Ireland such as "Crisis of Mine", "You're Welcome" and the single "[[It's Going To Happen!]]", which preceded the release of the LP and was inspired by the 1980–81 [[1981 Irish hunger strike|Hunger Strike]]s. In addition, several songs upon the LP included instruments such as pianos, [[saxophones]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]] and [[brass instruments]], with two further songs ("Julie Ocean" and "It's Going To Happen!") drawing musical inspiration from contemporary artists [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] and [[Dexy's Midnight Runners]] respectively. The band themselves were content with the change of influences for ''Positive Touch'', which bassist Michael Bradley later described as a "natural progression" for the band,<ref>2000 Castle Music Positive Touch CD release sleeve notes</ref> adding that, at the time, consensus between the band members was that the songs upon the LP were their best yet.<ref>Sleeve notes for 2000 'Castle music' re-issue of Positive Touch album.</ref>

One month prior to the release of this third album, in April 1981, the Undertones embarked on their 'Positive Touch tour'; this tour saw the band perform a total of 36 gigs across the UK mainland in the space of less than two months.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

''Positive Touch'' was released in May 1981.

Following the conclusion of their 'Positive Touch tour' in June 1981, the Undertones released their second single of 1981, "Julie Ocean". The single – an extended recording of the 90-second album version – was produced by Hugh Jones and [[David Balfe|Dave Balfe]].
On 29 September 1981, the Undertones embarked on their biggest tour of [[Continental Europe]], which lasted until 20 October 1981 and saw the band perform a total of 19 concerts in six countries.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

1982 saw a lull in activity from the Undertones, who only performed live on a total of five occasions throughout the entire year. Two of these gigs were held in England, with three further live appearances held in the United States in August.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Much of the time the band spent together was devoted towards writing and recording songs for their next LP in their 8-track demo studio. Damian O'Neill, the Undertones' lead guitarist, later admitted: "We (had) definitely lost a bit of the spark. I don't know but I tend to think some of us got too [[Contentment|complacent]] sitting in our homes in Derry."<ref>Teenage Kicks, the story of The Undertones (1993)</ref> The Undertones released two studio singles, "Beautiful Friend" and "The Love Parade", in February and October; both of these singles failed to make an impact upon the UK charts.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} pp. 191-192</ref>

===The Sin of Pride (1983)===
In March 1983, the Undertones released their fourth album, ''[[The Sin of Pride]]''. This album, which drew inspiration from both soul and [[Motown]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Thom Jurek |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-sin-of-pride-mw0000110715/ |title=The Sin of Pride - The Undertones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref> was produced by [[Mike Hedges]], who had replaced Roger Bechirian as the Undertones' producer following the 1981 release of ''Positive Touch''. Feargal Sharkey is known to have stated he had worked harder upon this album than at any point in his singing career to date, and that he considers this album the finest the Undertones ever produced.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/look-sharp-19860605 |title=Feargal Sharkey: Look Sharp! |publisher=rollingstone.com |date=5 June 1986 |access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref> ''The Sin of Pride'' was met with critical acclaim upon release, and the Undertones performed several gigs in both Scotland and England to promote the release of this album;<ref name="theundertones.com"/> it reached number 43 in the UK chart.{{refn|group=n|On the subject of the poor sales of this album, Feargal Sharkey would recollect in 1986: "People still wanted us to rewrite [[The Undertones (album)|the first album]], and we weren't prepared to do that."<ref name="auto1"/>}}

| quote = "Certainly the Undertones were a completely different band by the time we made ''[[Positive Touch]]'' and the last album, ''[[The Sin of Pride]]'', which was an even bigger departure.

The Undertones released two further studio singles in 1983; their first single, "Got To Have You Back"—which was inspired by both [[ABC (band)|ABC]] and [[Smokey Robinson]]—was released in February and their second single, "Chain of Love", was released in May. Both failed to make any major impact on the UK chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOtx9nPM4ncC&pg=PA18 |title=SPIN |page=18 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= June 1986|access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref>

==Disbandment==
In April 1983, the Undertones embarked on their 'UK Sin of Pride tour' to promote their latest album.<ref name="theundertones.com"/> By this stage in their career, the band were acutely aware of the pressure they were under from EMI, who were unhappy with the lack of chart success of much of the material the band had released since the release of their ''Positive Touch'' LP.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 208</ref> In addition, internal tensions between various members of the band, in particular between Feargal Sharkey and John O'Neill, had deteriorated significantly. These factors led to Sharkey announcing his intentions to leave the Undertones during the 'European Tour 1983', which the group performed in May of that year.<ref>''Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone'' {{ISBN|978-1-78558-180-9}} p. 214</ref>{{refn|group=n|Sharkey announced his intentions to leave the Undertones on 16 May.}}

To fulfill agreed commitments, the Undertones remained together for a further two months, performing several gigs across continental Europe<ref name="ReferenceB"/> before disbanding in mid-1983,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_4.html// |title=My Life As An Undertone : Part Four |author=Michael Bradley |website=Theundertones.com |access-date=16 June 2016 |archive-date=15 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815090410/http://www.theundertones.com/_/My_Life_As_Part_4.html/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> with their final concert being played at [[Punchestown Racecourse]] in [[County Kildare]] in Ireland on 17 July.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Subsequent careers==
Following the disbandment of the Undertones in 1983, Feargal Sharkey was invited by [[Vince Clarke]] and [[Eric Radcliffe]] of the [[synthpop]] duet [[The Assembly]]<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|author=Michael Sutton |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-assembly-mn0000033095/biography |title=The Assembly &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> to provide lead vocals on the single "[[Never Never (The Assembly song)|Never Never]]," which was released by The Assembly in November 1983 and peaked at number 4 in the UK charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19831120/7501/ |title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref> Sharkey was never officially a member of The Assembly<ref name="AMG"/> and his vocal contribution to "Never Never" proved to be Sharkey's only recording with the band, who would only issue this one single before folding.<ref>''The Sound Of The Crowd: A Discography of the '80s'' {{ISBN|978-1-326-07358-9}}</ref>

Sharkey subsequently embarked upon a brief, but commercially successful solo career in the mid 1980s to early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Allan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/feargal-sharkey-mn0000163256/biography |title=Feargal Sharkey &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=13 August 1986 |access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/news/music/feargal-sharkey-age-siblings-wife-children-songs/|title=Who is Feargal Sharkey?

Two of the other band members, John O'Neill and Damian O'Neill, formed [[That Petrol Emotion]] in 1984.<ref>''The Rough Guide to Rock'' {{ISBN|978-1-85828457-6}} p. 1121</ref> That Petrol Emotion released a total of fifteen singles and six albums between 1985 and 1994.<ref>''British Hit Singles & Albums'' {{ISBN|1-904994-10-5}} p. 554</ref>

In the 1990s John O'Neill formed a trip hop group called [[Rare (Northern Irish band)|Rare]] under the stage name ''Seán Ó'Néill'' with vocalist Mary Gallagher. They only had one notable chart appearance and disbanded shortly after the release of their only album in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/42477|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210218044217/https://api.discogs.com/artists/42477|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 February 2021|title=Rare|website=Discogs|access-date=14 June 2019}}</ref>

The Undertones reformed in November 1999, initially to play concerts in Derry.
