'''Virgin Black''' is an Australian [[Gothic metal#Symphonic gothic metal|symphonic gothic]] and [[doom metal]] band.<ref name=EAHM>{{cite book|last1=Giffin|first1=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Heavy Metal|work=Dark Star|year=2015|pages=V|isbn=9780994320612|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=QK3JCQAAQBAJ|page=2296}}}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The band was signed to [[The End Records]] (for the [[United States]]) and [[Germany]]'s [[Massacre Records]] (for [[Europe]]), through which it released 4 albums and 1 EP. A fifth album, originally planned for release in 2006, was released independently in 2018. As of 2021, they are signed to Australian record label, Dark Escapes Music. Formed in 1995 in [[Adelaide]], they have achieved international acclaim during their career, receiving praise from such magazines as ''[[Orkus]]'', ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', ''[[Legacy (magazine)|Legacy]]''<!-- German magazine --> and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.<ref>Seward, Scott.

Having changed their line-up several times, Virgin Black currently consists of the founding members and main songwriters: Sesca Scaarba (formerly Samantha Escarbe) (guitar) and Rowan London (keyboard, vocals), with Grayh (bass) and Luke Faz (drums) joining in 2007. The group explains the meaning of its name as "the juxtaposition of purity and humanity's darkness".<ref name="AMG_VB">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p519943|pure_url=yes}} |title=Virgin Black |access-date=2008-03-25 |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

==History==
===Early days===
Virgin Black was originally formed in [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]] by [[guitar]]ist Sesca Scaarba, and [[vocals|vocalist]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]-player Rowan London. In 1995, Virgin Black recorded a four-track self-titled [[Virgin Black (album)|demo]] in a [[doom metal|doom/death]] style. Due to the rarity and demand for this recording, the band has speculated that it may be re-released at some point.  Their ''[[Trance (EP)|Trance]]'' EP was released in 1998, and the group began gaining international recognition with that recording.<ref name="AMG_VB"/> This EP was later included as part of a special limited edition (U.S. only) with the band's debut album, ''Sombre Romantic''.

===Record deal===

The group began recording their first full-length album ''[[Sombre Romantic]]'' in 1999.
The album displays an expansively cinematic, symphonic style with London contributing a diverse vocal style from shrieks and growls to soaring melodies and choral chants. On the strength of this self-released debut, Virgin Black signed to Germany's Massacre Records for Europe and also to the U.S. label The End. Both labels then released ''Sombre Romantic'' in their territories.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r571808|pure_url=yes}} |title=Virgin Black - Sombre Romantic |access-date=2008-03-25 |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

After completing their second album during 2002, Virgin Black played at Germany's [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] festival in 2003 and did a tour through the US west coast with [[Agalloch]] and Antimatter before returning to Australia and conducting a national tour. ''[[Elegant... and dying|Elegant... and Dying]]'' featured Escarbe contributing cello and guest musician Sonia Wilkie playing [[flute]]. It was released in November and a month later the band appeared at the [[Metal for the Brain]] festival in [[Canberra, Australia|Canberra]]. Early the following year, Virgin Black toured alongside [[Opeth]] in Australia, and later did a tour of the Australian east coast capitals with [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] [[black metal]] band [[Nazxul]] before making a start on their next recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r646419|pure_url=yes}} |title=Virgin Black - Elegant... and Dying |access-date=2008-03-25 |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

===''Requiem'' trilogy===
Virgin Black's next project began with London and Escarbe composing a series of scores for what was to become the three-volume ''Requiem'' set. On 10 March 2006, The End Records issued a press release explaining the upcoming releases. The first part of the trilogy, ''Requiem - Pianissimo'', is a strictly classically oriented album featuring the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], choral singing, and solo singers. ''[[Requiem - Mezzo Forte]]'' features music similar to the band's previous releases with the last part ''[[Requiem - Fortissimo]]''  primarily having a death/doom metal sound. The albums were recorded primarily as the duo of London and Escarbe over the course of almost two years, during which Rowan London suffered the death of his father. Originally designed to be released simultaneously in 2006, on 23 July, The Labels announced that the albums would instead be released during 2007 in a staggered time scale. The second part of the trilogy, ''Requiem - Mezzo Forte'' was issued first, on 3 April 2007.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1028122|pure_url=yes}} |title=Virgin Black - Requiem - Mezzo Forte |access-date=2008-03-25 |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

With a new line-up of Escarbe, London, Grayh on bass and drummer Luke Faz. Virgin Black played some Australian shows with [[Arcturus (band)|Arcturus]] in March and headlined the Elements of Rock Festival in [[Switzerland]] in April. Virgin Black announced a US tour for June and July 2007, and played shows on the east and west coast of the U.S. with To/Die/For and headlined shows in Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara.

The third part and the second installment in the ''Requiem'' trilogy, ''Requiem  - Fortissimo'' was released on 19 February 2008 by The End Records. The Massacre Records release date remains unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1311649|pure_url=yes}} |title=Virgin Black - Requiem - Fortissimo |access-date=2008-03-25 |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Virgin Black played with [[Amorphis]] and [[Samael (band)|Samael]] for a North American tour in fall 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=93224 |title=Virgin Black Amorphis, Leaves' Eyes, and Samael: North American Tour Dates Announced - Mar.&nbsp;19, 2008 |access-date=2008-03-25 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]}}</ref> Readers of the website ''Metal Storm'' voted ''Requiem Fortissimo'' for "the best doom metal album of 2008".<ref>[http://www.metalstorm.net/awards/archive.php?year=2008#cat82 The Best of Doom Metal]. Metal Storm</ref>

On 2 November 2012 it was announced on the band's official Facebook page that "...Virgin Black is still on an extended hiatus but preparing themselves for a return at some stage, and the release of Pianissimo when that happens", and went on to say that "...it might not be for some time yet, but thank you for your patience and continued enthusiasm for the band regardless".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/virginblackofficial |title=Virgin Black - Home |website=Facebook.com |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

On 4 September 2018, after 10 years of silence, the band posted the first two songs from their long-awaited ''Pianissimo'' release. The songs are titled ''Requiem Aeternum'' and ''Dies Irae'', with a total duration of 13:12. On 27 September 2018, the band speculated the date for the release of the complete album, scheduled for 30 November of that year, said in its official website that Virgin Black has broken ties with former record companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/virginblackofficial/posts/10155967535618512?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBhG45FWfy3x3OdUgsA23NB4_hzHVWhvndJPZQmMDrcDeRXmLquzNWveAX9lU1ILBDHTBgRI2ygHXtafGRva3hmHmg2D8dof2nzj0kGT-blTiDqR7xzWadlO6mK_MaQluqZCJArIf4zvXVkqTfgET3bX_4xTBtJC-AShUL-jR-UX-8GyNhtTio&__tn__=-R |title=Virgin Black - Artist: Virgin Black Album: Requiem |website=Facebook.com |date=2018-09-04 |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> In December 2018 the album appeared on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRpEnBGL6Xo |title=Virgin Black - Requiem - Pianissimo (2018) Full Album |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2018-12-04 |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

==Style and influence==
Virgin Black's sound combines elements of [[doom metal]] and [[classical music]]. A critic described their style as having influences of "[[dark wave]] with gothic atmosphere"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=1383 |title=IMPE.fi |website=Imperiumi.net |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> and "symphonic gothic-doom".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=6292 |title=IMPE.fi |website=Imperiumi.net |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> Virgin Black states that their influences include the British group [[My Dying Bride]], the American gothic metal band [[Saviour Machine]] and 19th century classical music. Their sound is typically sorrowful, representing mostly down-tempo arrangements. Rowan London employs various vocal styles including operatic, shrieking, death growls and melodramatic tenor and baritone singing, and the music often features choirs. Occasionally the lead guitarist Sesca Scaarba plays faster tremolo riffs typical of extreme metal, such as on "Drink the Midnight Hymn" from the debut album. Sometimes there are longer, mellow and emotional guitar solos such as on "Weep for Me". A great deal of variety can be found in their music. For instance, "Walk without Limbs" combines ominous [[cello]] with programmed drums for a softer [[darkwave]] style, the ''[[Requiem - Pianissimo]]'' album is entirely classical, whereas ''[[Requiem - Fortissimo]]'''s sound is firmly rooted in [[death/doom]] metal.
