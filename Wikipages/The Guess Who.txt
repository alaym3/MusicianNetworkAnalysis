'''The Guess Who''' are a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], best known for their [[blues rock]]<ref name="Miklitsch2012">{{cite book|author=Robert Miklitsch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOgUyPYw0KoC&pg=PA114|title=Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8187-5|page=114}}</ref> and [[psychedelic rock]]<ref name="SteinbergKehler2010">{{cite book|author1=Shirley R.

The band originated in 1962 and achieved an international hit single with a cover of "[[Shakin' All Over]]" in 1965 under the name Chad Allan and the Expressions. After changing their name to the Guess Who, they found their greatest success in the late 60s and early 70s, under the leadership of singer/keyboardist [[Burton Cummings]] and guitarist [[Randy Bachman]], with hit songs including "[[American Woman]]", "[[These Eyes]]", "[[No Time (Guess Who song)|No Time]]" and many others. 

During their most successful period, the Guess Who released eleven studio albums, all of which reached the charts in Canada and the United States. They may be best known for their 1970 album ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'', which reached no. 1 in Canada and no. 9 in the United States, while five other albums reached the top ten in Canada. The Guess Who charted fourteen Top 40 singles in the United States and more than thirty in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Guess Who {{!}} Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-guess-who-mn0000061480|access-date=2021-02-27|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> 

The Guess Who was disbanded by Cummings in 1975, though bassist [[Jim Kale]] and/or drummer Garry Peterson have toured and recorded under the Guess Who name since 1977, frequently with no other original band members involved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Guess Who friends now bitter enemies|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/former-guess-who-friends-now-bitter-enemies-179778311.html|accessdate=October 5, 2021}}</ref>
==History==

===Origins (1958–1965)===
The origins of the Guess Who date back to 1958, when Winnipeg singer/guitarist [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]] formed a local rock band called Allan and the Silvertones.<ref name="Hoffmann2004">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffmann|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT992|date=November 12, 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-94949-2|pages=992–}}</ref> After several lineup changes, the band stabilized in 1962 under the name '''Chad Allan and the Reflections''', which included Allan and keyboardist Bob Ashley, plus future Guess Who mainstays [[Randy Bachman]] on guitar, [[Jim Kale]] on bass, and Garry Peterson on drums.<ref name="Hoffmann2004" />

The band released their first single, "[[Tribute to Buddy Holly#Chad Allan and the Reflections version|Tribute To Buddy Holly]]", on Canadian-American Records in 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22Tribute+to+Buddy+Holly%22+%22guess+who%22&pg=PA1567|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=2011-05-27|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=1567|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Guides (Firm)|first=Rough|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&q=%22Tribute+to+Buddy+Holly%22+%22guess+who%22&pg=RA1-PA1863|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|language=en}}</ref> They then signed with Quality Records and released several singles in 1963–64, which gained some regional notice around Winnipeg but made little impact in the rest of Canada. One single was mis-credited to Bob Ashley and the Reflections.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} 

In 1965, the group changed their name to '''Chad Allan and the Expressions''' after an American group called  [[The Reflections (Detroit band)|The Reflections]] released the hit single "[[(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet]]".<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref> They released the [[garage rock]] album ''[[Shakin' All Over (album)|Shakin' All Over]]'' in January 1965.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=style|id=garage-rock-ma0000004458|tab=albums|label=Garage Rock Album Highlights}}</ref> That album's single, a cover of "[[Shakin' All Over]]" by [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates]], was the band's first major hit, reaching no. 1 in Canada, no. 22 in the United States, and no. 27 in Australia.<ref name="Johnson2014">"American Woman". {{cite book|author=Chad Johnson|title=CliffsNotes to Guitar Songs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtYiBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15|date=January 1, 2014|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-1-4803-8467-5|pages=15–}}</ref><ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35">Einarson, John.''

After Quality Records revealed the band to be Chad Allan and the Expressions, disc jockeys continued to announce the group as Guess Who?, effectively forcing the band to accept the new name.<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35"/> They released their second album, ''[[Hey Ho (What You Do to Me!)]]'' in late 1965; it was credited to Chad Allan and the Expressions with "Guess Who?" displayed prominently on the cover.<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35" /> 

===Transitional years (1966–1968)===
Keyboardist Bob Ashley left the band in late 1965 due to the rigors of touring.<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35" /> He was replaced by 18 year-old [[Burton Cummings]], formerly of Winnipeg group the Deverons, who also took on lead vocal duties in conjunction with Chad Allan. Just a few months later, Allan departed; he returned to college and then became a media personality with the [[CBC Music|CBC]] .<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canadian Bands.com - Chad Allan & The Expressions|url=http://www.canadianbands.com/Chad%20Allan.html|access-date=2021-02-27|website=www.canadianbands.com}}</ref> This left Cummings as the sole lead singer.<ref name="Metzer2008">{{cite book|author=Greg Metzer|title=Rock Band Name Origins: The Stories of 240 Groups and Performers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is57BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA93|date=May 21, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3818-1|pages=93–}}</ref> With Allan departed, the "Chad Allan and the Expressions" subtitle was dropped from the band's releases, and they were billed solely as '''The Guess Who?'''. (The question mark would be dropped in 1968.) After Allan's departure in 1966, guitarist Bruce Decker, a former bandmate of Cummings in the Deverons, joined for a few months.<ref name="Buckley2003">{{cite book|author=Peter Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/n463 455]–}}</ref> The band then settled as a quartet with Cummings on vocals and keyboards, Bachman on guitar, Kale on bass, and Peterson on drums.<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35" /> This lineup released the album ''[[It's Time (The Guess Who album)|It's Time]]'' in the summer of 1966.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=shakin-all-over-hey-ho-its-time-mw0000318376|label=''Shakin' All Over/Hey Ho/It's Time''|accessdate=September 01, 2015}}</ref> Decker, despite being pictured on the cover of the album, did not participate in the recording.  Conversely, some contributions by Allan (recorded before he left the group) can be heard on the album, though he is not credited.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The band continued to release singles that were moderately successful in Canada, and "[[His Girl]]" entered the UK charts in 1967.<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=His+Girl+by+The+Guess+Who&id=72794 The Guess Who, "His Girl" United Kingdom Chart Position] Retrieved March 9, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.10048&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=98q6tcgku7546lsrfi3gr83pp7 The Guess Who, "His Girl" Canadian Chart Position] Retrieved March 9, 2015</ref> The band traveled to the United Kingdom to promote the single, but this was a financial mistake as the song quickly dropped off the charts. They were unable to book shows or obtain work visas while in the UK, and returned to Canada heavily in debt.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Later in 1967, the Guess Who were hired as the house band for the [[CBC radio]] show ''The Swingers,''<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/rewind/episode/2014/08/21/the-guess-who--canadas-first-supergroup-part-one/ The Guess Who – Canada's First Supergroup (Part One)] Rewind with Michael Enright.

After seeing the Guess Who on ''Let's Go'', record producer/sales executive [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]] contacted the band about participating in an advertising project for [[Coca-Cola]].<ref name="canuck" /> This project became a split album titled ''A Wild Pair'' with [[Ottawa]] band the Staccatos (soon to rename themselves [[Five Man Electrical Band]]). The album could only be purchased by mail order from Coca-Cola.<ref name="canuck" /> Richardson served as the Guess Who's producer until their classic-era dissolution in 1975,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Guess Who {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-guess-who-mn0000061480/biography|access-date=2021-02-27|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> and they were managed during that entire period by Don Hunter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwkEAAAAMBAJ&q=the+guess+who&pg=RA1-PA31 |title=Winnipeg's Don Hunter|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=September 29, 1973 |access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref>

===The beginning of the classic era (1968–1970)===

Richardson signed the Guess Who to his Nimbus 9 label and production company, and personally financed the recording of a new album in late 1968. They were also signed to [[RCA Records|RCA]] for distribution outside of Canada. The band transitioned from their original garage rock roots to a more mature [[Pop rock|pop-rock]] sound with [[Soul music|soul]] and [[jazz]] influences.<ref name="Miklitsch2012" /> ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' was released in early 1969 and achieved success in both Canada and the United States.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wheatfield Soul - The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wheatfield-soul-mw0000199923|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref> The single "[[These Eyes (song)|These Eyes]]" reached the top ten in the United States and became a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] with sales of more than one million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

For their next album, the band adopted more [[hard rock]] influences. ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' was released in January 1970 and became a substantial worldwide hit.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=American Woman - The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/american-woman-mw0000652826|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref> It was their first album to top the Canadian albums chart, and their first to reach the top ten on the American albums chart.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-woman-mw0000652826/awards The Guess Who, ''American Woman'' Chart Position] Retrieved March 17, 2015</ref> The [[American Woman|title track]] reached no. 1 in both countries<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top Singles - Volume 13, No. 12, May 9, 1970|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.3781&type=2&interval=20&PHPSESSID=m89iq841abagb37ld9c0fdc1f3|magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name="strong">{{cite book|author=Martin Charles Strong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyvXOydfVt8C&pg=PT912|title=The Great Rock Discography|publisher=Canongate|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84195-312-0|page=912}}</ref><ref name="AM">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-guess-who-p4412/charts-awards/billboard-singles|label=The Guess Who - Awards}}</ref> and was also a substantial hit in the United Kingdom.

===Personnel changes and continued success (1970–1975)===
While ''American Woman'' became a success in the early months of 1970, Bachman recorded an all-instrumental solo album titled ''Axe'' with Peterson on drums.<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35" /><ref>{{Citation|title=Axe - Randy Bachman {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/axe-mw0000746987|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref> The Guess Who began recording a follow up to ''American Woman'', completing seven tracks. (The tracks were withheld and were not released until 1976 under the title ''The Way They Were''.)<ref>{{Citation|title=The Way They Were - The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-way-they-were-mw0000462495|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref> Bachman then took a break from touring with the Guess Who due to illness, with American guitarist Bobby Sabellico filling in temporarily. Bachman played a final show with the band and then quit in May 1970; his relations with Cummings had deteriorated and his recent conversion to [[Mormonism]] caused dissatisfaction with the band's rock n' roll lifestyle.<ref name="Buckley2003" /> Bachman later formed the successful hard rock band [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bachman-turner-overdrive-mn0000062002/biography|access-date=2021-02-27|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref>

On July 17, 1970, the band was invited to perform at the [[White House]] for US President [[Richard Nixon]]'s family and guests, but they were asked not to play "American Woman" due to its apparent criticism of the United States.<ref name="Morsch2014" />

The expanded lineup quickly recorded the album ''[[Share the Land]]'', which was released in late 1970 and became another substantial hit in both Canada and the United States.<ref name=":1" /> Songs from the albums ''Wheatfield Soul'' through ''Share the Land'' were compiled for the album ''[[The Best of The Guess Who]]'', which became another successful release in both countries in 1971.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/music/the-guess-who/chart-history/billboard-200/song/316293 The Guess Who, ''The Best of The Guess Who''] Retrieved March 20, 2015</ref> 

The band's commercial fortunes and chart performance then declined in the United States, perhaps due to an inability to be taken seriously by the fans of album rock radio,<ref name=":2">{{Citation|title=Artificial Paradise - The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/artificial-paradise-mw0000840046|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref> though they remained very successful in their native Canada.

Shortly after the release of ''Rockin''', Leskiw suddenly left the band in the middle of a US tour after a disagreement with Cummings.<ref name="Buckley2003" /> Leskiw was replaced on short notice by guitarist/singer Donnie McDougall, a veteran of the Winnipeg rock scene who had most recently played with the [[Vancouver]]-based [[Mother Tucker's Yellow Duck]].<ref name="Einarson, John pp. 35" /> With McDougall on board, the band recorded the album ''[[Live at the Paramount (The Guess Who album)|Live at the Paramount]]'' at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Seattle]] in May 1972; it was released in August<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/the_guess_who/live_at_the_paramount/index.html |title=Live At The Paramount Review |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref> and included some songs that had not appeared on previous studio albums.<ref>{{Citation|title=Live at the Paramount - The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-paramount-mw0000654653|language=en|access-date=2021-02-27}}</ref>
