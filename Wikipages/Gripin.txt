'''Gripin''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Flu'') is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] rock band based in [[Istanbul]]. The members are Birol Namoğlu (vocals), Murat Başdoğan (guitar), Arda İnceoğlu (bass guitar), and İlker Baliç (drums).

== The beginning ==
They started as a cover band, playing in bars like ''Bronx'' in mid-'90s, and earned a cult following. Their wide repertoire not only included [[Britpop]], but also featured examples of American [[alternative rock]] and in some cases, [[Turkish rock]]. The band started off together in 1999 playing mostly cover tracks in Turkish bars and clubs. Soon, they managed to establish themselves as a name behind the music they covered.

== Hikayeler Anlatıldı ==
In the early 2000s, they started recording their own songs and released the album [[Hikayeler Anlatıldı]] (''Stories were Told'') in 2004, which was later released as a double album containing acoustic versions of the album's songs. Some of the singles featured in this album include "Karışmasın Kimseler" (''Don't Let Anyone Stand Between Us'') and "Elalem" (''Everybody'').

== Second album ==
The following album was self-titled and was released on February 26, 2007. The new album features duets with popular Turkish artists like [[Ferman Akgül]] from [[maNga (band)|maNga]], [[Pamela Spence]], and [[Emre Aydın]]. The producer of the album is [[Haluk Kurosman]], the successful producer of many young Turkish talents (like maNga, Emre Aydın, [[Vega (band)|Vega]], and [[Göksel]]). The band is managed by [[Hadi Elazzi]] of [[GRGDN]], the company Elazzi owns together with Kurosman.

Gripin's new single, entitled "Böyle Kahpedir Dünya" ''(This World is a Harlot)'' has become a huge hit with television and radio stations, having led the Top 10 chart of [[MTV Türkiye]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com.tr/charts.aspx?chartCode=TR_TOP10_SINGLE MTV Türkiye Top 10 Chart]</ref> The following single, "Sensiz Istanbul'a Düşmanım" (''I Hate Istanbul Without You'') – a duet with Emre Aydın – saw an equal amount of success in terms of its popularity in Turkey.

The band has recently won the prestigious [[Hürriyet]] Altın Kelebek Awards as Best Newcoming Band (see the [[Gripin#Awards|Awards section]]). To this day, the band continues to perform in clubs, concerts, and festivals.
