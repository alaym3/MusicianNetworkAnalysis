==Career==

=== Early career (2011–2016) ===
Starting in 2011, Ryan Beatty covered popular songs and posted them on his [[YouTube]] channel. The videos were highly viewed with his most popular song, a cover of [[Bruno Mars]]' "[[Marry You]]", gaining over 6 million views.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Marry You – Bruno Mars Cover By Ryan Beatty|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76JkBttksBk|via=Youtube}}</ref> He released his debut single "Every Little Thing" in November 2011, which reached #89 on the iTunes Pop Charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gossipgirl.alloyentertainment.com/ryan-beatty-interview-823132/|title=Exclusive: Get to Know Ryan Beatty|date=August 23, 2013|website=Gossip Girl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823162847/http://gossipgirl.alloyentertainment.com/ryan-beatty-interview-823132/|archive-date=August 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Ryan Seacrest]] premiered Beatty's debut music video "Every Little Thing" on February 2, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.j-14.com/posts/j-14-exclusive-q-a-with-ryan-beatty-5150|title=J-14 Exclusive Q&A with Ryan Beatty|date=February 3, 2012|website=J-14|language=en|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>

Beatty released his debut EP ''Because of You'' which premiered on [[Radio Disney]] on July 23, 2012<ref>{{cite AV media | title = Celebrity Take with Jake: Celebrity Take with Ryan Beatty| publisher = Radio Disney| date = July 23, 2013| url = http://video.disney.com/watch/celebrity-take-with-ryan-beatty-4c63d999fc503e44de3b2119| access-date = 2013-01-28}}</ref> and was released to the public exclusively on iTunes on July 24, 2012. Within 24 hours of its release, ''Because of You'' landed in the #1 spot on the US Pop Album Charts and #7 spot on the Top Album Charts.<ref name="studio10" /> In 2012 Beatty was chosen to be one of the faces of AT&T's national "It Can Wait" campaign to end texting and driving. The PSA, which urged fans to take the pledge not to text and drive, aired nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/7LRz/at-and-t-it-can-wait-ryan-beatty-takes-the-it-can-wait-pledge|title=AT&T It Can Wait TV Spot, 'Ryan Beatty Takes the It Can Wait Pledge'|website=iSpot.tv|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref> Ryan spent the summer of 2013 touring as one of the opening acts on [[Cody Simpson]]'s [[Paradise Tour (Cody Simpson)|Paradise Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calendar.denverpost.com/denver_co/events/show/321918263-cody-simpsons-paradise-tour-2013|title=Cody Simpson's Paradise Tour 2013|website=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716042858/http://calendar.denverpost.com/denver_co/events/show/321918263-cody-simpsons-paradise-tour-2013|archive-date=July 16, 2013|access-date=December 29, 2013}}</ref> His first headlining tour was scheduled for November 2013, but was postponed until 2014.

In subsequent interviews after the release of his debut album, ''Boy in Jeans'', in 2018, Beatty described this period somewhat negatively. He felt both creatively and emotionally constrained by his image as a "straight" teen heartthrob and the lack of input he was allowed when he was recording music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://notion.online/ryan-beatty/|title=Ryan Beatty|date=2018-12-19|website=Notion|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>

{{Blockquote
|text=I was just rolling with the punches and dealing with what I was given. Being young I was just really underestimated and I remember never really being taken seriously. I get it, I was like 16, 17 in these sessions, but at the same time I did feel like I had a sense of what I wanted to do or whatever. Back then I didn't feel like I could be myself in any way and the times that I did and I tried to have my own identity, I never felt that it was taken seriously. Can you imagine my entire late teenage years I was being perceived as somebody that I just absolutely wasn't and that's something I can never take back. I don't want this to sound like I regret anything, but it's really difficult.

=== Recent career (2016–present) ===
After being inactive for three years, Beatty began to return to recording music in 2016 with the release of his singles "Passion" and "Stay Gold."

In 2018, Beatty released his first studio album ''Boy In Jeans'' featuring singles "Bruise" and "Camo". He released music videos for almost every song on the album, with the exceptions of "Cupid", "Money", and "Speed".<ref>{{cite AV media |url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mFbvjLaw5CM3nvF29eWH7Ynv5OhRet01E|title=Boy in Jeans|via=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The first music video from the album for "Bruise" was directed by Brockhampton's [[Kevin Abstract]].<ref>{{cite AV media |title=BRUISE |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJezGUWDExE&list=OLAK5uy_mFbvjLaw5CM3nvF29eWH7Ynv5OhRet01E&index=5|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> That same year, he also collaborated with rapper [[Tyler, the Creator]] on his EP ''[[Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss' The Grinch]]'' and producer [[Benny Blanco]] on his album ''Friends Keep Secrets''. Additionally, he performed with [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]],'' alongside [[Jazmine Sullivan]] and [[serpentwithfeet]], singing backing vocals on an early version of the song "Tonya" which later appeared on their album ''[[Iridescence (album)|Iridescence]].'' His backing vocals were later cut from the final version of the song.

Through the end of 2019 into early 2020, Beatty began releasing the singles "Dark Circles", "Patchwork", and "Casino", each with their own accompanying music videos, in the lead up to the release of his second album. On January 31, 2020, Ryan Beatty released ''Dreaming of David.''

== Personal life ==
Beatty came out as gay in June 2016, at the age of 20, three weeks after the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]]. He uploaded an Instagram photo of a [[Gay liberation|Gay Power]] balloon on his Instagram account with the following caption: "proud to be a raging homosexual. it's taken 20 years of suffocating in the closet for me to become comfortable enough to say it, but now I can finally breathe. i did it!"<ref name="photo 2016-06-29">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BHN_DJwhEWx/|title=Instagram photo by @ryanbeatty • Jun 29, 2016 at 12:37am UTC|via=Instagram|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref>

In May 2020, Beatty expressed support for the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the wake of [[George Floyd protests|national outrage]] in response to the [[murder of George Floyd]] by Minnesota police officer [[Derek Chauvin]].
