Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed. He had 33 albums and singles that were certified Gold and Platinum in the U.S by the [[RIAA certification|RIAA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/?s=JOHN+DENVER|title=John Denver |website=RIAA}}</ref> with estimated sales of more than 33 million units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/ |title=John Denver, A Rocky Mountain High Concert |publisher=The Florida Theatre |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619040301/http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, disdain for city life, enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including [[country music]], the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], earning 12 [[Music recording certification|gold]] and four [[Music recording certification|platinum]] albums with his signature songs "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", "[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]", "[[Annie's Song]]", "[[Rocky Mountain High]]", "[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]]", "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]", and "[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]".

Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s, including the 1977 hit ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'', in which he starred alongside [[George Burns]]. He continued to record into the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues as well as lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to protest censorship in music. He lived in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] for much of his life, and he was known for his love of [[Colorado]]. In 1974, Denver was named [[poet laureate]] of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its two state songs in 2007, and West Virginia did the same for "Take Me Home, Country Roads" in 2014.

An avid pilot, Denver died at age 53 in a single-fatality crash while piloting a recently purchased light plane.

==Early life==
Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. was born on December 31, 1943, in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], to Captain (later [[lieutenant colonel|Lt Col]]) Henry John "Dutch" Deutschendorf Sr. (1920–1982),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/denver.html |title=Ancestry of John Denver compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner |publisher=Wargs.Com |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> a [[United States Army Air Forces]] pilot stationed at [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], and his wife, Erma Louise (née Swope; 1922–2010). Years later, as a major<ref name="hustler">{{YouTube | id=0jN6hx0LCfA | title=1961 B-58 Sets New Records}}</ref> in the [[United States Air Force]], Deutschendorf Sr. set three speed records in the [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] supersonic bomber and earned a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame.<ref name="hustler" /> He met and married his "Oklahoma Sweetheart".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordclick.com/john-denvers-genealogy-country-road-leads-to-oklahoma-not-colorado/|title=John Denver's Genealogy Road Leads to Oklahoma, Not Colorado|website=Recordclick.com|date=January 25, 2014|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Plett |first=Rowena |url=http://starj.com/direct/john_denver_had_mennonite_ancestors+1117denver+4a6f686e2044656e76657220686164204d656e6e6f6e69746520616e636573746f7273 |title=John Denver Had Mennonite Ancestors |work=Hillsboro Star-Journal |date=January 19, 2011 |access-date=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="JD">{{cite web |title=Biography – The World Family of John Denver |url=http://www.john-denver.org/default.asp?nc=1168&id=444 |access-date=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628051820/http://www.john-denver.org/default.asp?nc=1168&id=444 |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |date=June 28, 2006}}</ref>

In his 1994 autobiography, ''Take Me Home'', Denver described his life as the eldest son of a family shaped by a stern father who could not show his love for his children. Because Denver's father was in the military and his family moved often, it was difficult for him to make friends and fit in with other children of his own age. Constantly being the new kid was troubling for the introverted Denver, and he grew up always feeling as though he should be somewhere else, but never knowing where that 'right' place was.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020459/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 6, 2010 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=John Denver | date=October 14, 1997}}</ref> While the family was stationed at [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Denver was a member of the [[Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus]] for two years. He was content in Tucson, but his father was then transferred to [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where Denver disliked the racism of his segregated school.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMuu7GKGIi4C&pg=PT12 |page=12 |title=John Denver: Mother Nature's Son |last=Collis |first=John |publisher=Random House |date=2011 |isbn=9781780573304}}</ref> The family later moved to [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Fort Worth was a distressing experience for Denver, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father's car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708100625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=John Denver |via=Find Articles |access-date=May 9, 2011 |year=2002}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
At age 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother.<ref name="bio" /> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. He adopted the surname "Denver" after the capital of his favorite state, [[Colorado]]. He decided to change his name when [[Randy Sparks]], founder of [[the New Christy Minstrels]], suggested that 'Deutschendorf' would not fit comfortably on a [[Marquee (structure)|marquee]].<ref name="sparks" /> Denver attended [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and sang in a folk-music group, "The Alpine Trio", while studying architecture.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Ca-Fi/Denver-John.html |title=John Denver Biography |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=University |first=Texas Tech |year=1962 |title=La Ventana, vol. 037 |hdl=2346/48702}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=University |first=Texas Tech |year=1964 |title=La Ventana, vol. 039 |hdl=2346/48704}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. Denver dropped out of Texas Tech in 1963<ref name="bio" /> and moved to Los Angeles, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965, he joined [[The Chad Mitchell Trio]], replacing founder Chad Mitchell. After more personnel changes, the trio later became known as "Denver, Boise, and Johnson" (John Denver, David Boise, and [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]]).<ref name="bio" />

In 1969, Denver abandoned band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for [[RCA Records]], ''[[Rhymes & Reasons (John Denver album)|Rhymes & Reasons]]''. Two years earlier, he had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. It included a song he had written called "Babe, I Hate to Go", later renamed "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]". Denver made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas.<ref>[http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html Current Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205131958/http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html |date=December 5, 2010}}</ref> Producer [[Milt Okun]], who produced records for The Chad Mitchell Trio and the high-profile folk group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], had become Denver's producer as well. Okun brought the unreleased "Jet Plane" song to Peter, Paul and Mary. Their version of the song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ruhlman | first = William | title = Beginnings| work=Goldmine Magazine  | date = April 12, 1996 | url =http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/history/f-ruhlmann3.htm | access-date =January 24, 2010}}</ref> Denver's song also made it to No. 2 in the UK  in February 1970, having also made No. 1 on the US Cash Box chart in December 1969.

RCA did not actively promote ''Rhymes & Reasons'' with a tour, but Denver embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or coffeehouse to let him play, he distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> With his foot in the door as writer of "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]", he was often successful in gaining some promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues let him play for the 'door'; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract. He had also built a sizable and solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://johndenver.com/about/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=johndenver.com |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref>

Denver recorded two more albums in 1970, ''[[Take Me to Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Whose Garden Was This]]'', including a mix of songs he had written and cover versions of other artists' compositions.

===Career peak===

Denver's next album, ''[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]'' (1971), was a breakthrough for him in the United States, thanks in part to the single "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", which went to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, he scored his first Top Ten album with ''[[Rocky Mountain High (album)|Rocky Mountain High]]'', with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1973-02-17/hot-100 |title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs & The Hot 100 |work=Billboard  |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref> In 1974 and 1975, Denver experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four No. 1 songs ("[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]", "[[Annie's Song]]", "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]", and "[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]") and three No. 1 albums (''[[John Denver's Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Back Home Again (John Denver album)|Back Home Again]]'', and ''[[Windsong]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |title=Artist Biography – John Denver |publisher=Countrypolitan.com |date=October 12, 1997 |access-date=May 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221215317/http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |archive-date=February 21, 2001}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Denver's onstage appearance included long blond hair and wire-rimmed "granny" glasses. His embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer and appliqué artist Anna Zapp. Weintraub insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, "I've had no success in Britain&nbsp;... I mean ''none''".<ref>''John Denver: Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M. Martin, Pinnacle Books 1977</ref> In December 1976, Weintraub told Maureen Orth of ''Newsweek'': "I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people."

After appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver hosted his own variety and music specials, including several concerts from [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]]. His seasonal special, ''Rocky Mountain Christmas'', was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414458/trivia?item=tr0571467 |title=Rocky Mountain Christmas (1975) |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:John Denver 1975.JPG|thumb|upright|Denver's live concert television special ''An Evening With John Denver'' (1975)]]
His live concert special, ''An Evening with John Denver'', won the 1974–1975 [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Special, Comedy-Variety or Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0151551.html |title=1974–75 Emmy Awards |publisher=Infoplease.com |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref> When Denver ended his business relationship in 1982 because of Weintraub's focus on other projects,<ref>{{cite news |title=Producer Jerry Weintraub reflects on his career |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jerryweintraub/producer-jerry-weintraub-reflects-on-his-career-idUSTRE7A078O20111101 |work=Reuters |access-date=July 8, 2019 |date=November 1, 2011}}</ref> Weintraub threw Denver out of his office and accused him of [[Nazism]]. Denver later told Arthur Tobier, when the latter transcribed his autobiography,<ref>{{cite book |last1=John |first1=Denver |last2=Arthur |first2=Tobier |title=Take Me Home: An Autobiography |date=October 11, 1994 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Merchandise, LLC |isbn=0517595370 |edition=Second |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rivalswilliamgwi00quin}}</ref> "I'd bend my principles to support something he wanted of me. And of course, every time you bend your principles&nbsp;— whether because you don't want to worry about it, or because you're afraid to stand up for fear of what you might lose&nbsp;—  you sell your soul to the devil".<ref>''Take Me Home: An Autobiography'', John Denver and Arthur Tobier, Harmony Books, 1994.</ref>

Denver was also a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Denver and [[Jim Henson]] that spawned two television specials with [[the Muppets]], ''A Christmas Together'' and ''Rocky Mountain Holiday''. He also tried acting, appearing in "The Colorado Cattle Caper" episode of the ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' television movie in February 1974. He starred in the 1977 film ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' opposite [[George Burns]]. Denver hosted the [[Grammy Awards]] five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on multiple occasions. In 1975, he was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award. At the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year, [[Charlie Rich]], presented the award to his successor after he set fire to the envelope containing the official notification of the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76893/episode_featured_copy.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051946/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76893/episode_featured_copy.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |title=The Greatest : Features |publisher=Country Music Television |date=April 3, 1992 |access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref> Some speculated Rich was protesting the selection of a non-traditional country artist for the award, but Rich's son disputes that, saying his father was drunk, taking pain medication for a broken foot, and just trying to be funny. Denver's music was defended by country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who told Alanna Nash of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way&nbsp;... People forget how huge he was worldwide."

In 1977, Denver co-founded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Denver to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger. Denver wrote the song "I Want to Live" as the commission's theme song. In 1979, Denver performed "Rhymes & Reasons" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]]. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{cite web |author=thepiperchile |url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1979/description-unicef1.html |title=ABBA on TV – Music for UNICEF – A Gift of Song Concert |publisher=Abbaontv.com |access-date=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072734/http://www.abbaontv.com/1979/description-unicef1.html |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His father taught him to fly in the mid-1970s, which led to their reconciliation.<ref name="bio2" /> In 1980, Denver and his father, by then a [[lieutenant colonel]], co-hosted an award-winning television special, ''The Higher We Fly: The History of Flight''.<ref name="JD" /> It won the Osborn Award from the Aviation/Space Writers' Association, and was honored by the Houston Film Festival.<ref name="JD" />

===Political activism===
In the mid-1970s, Denver became outspoken in politics. He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song "[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]]", an ode to the eponymous exploration ship {{RV|Calypso}} used by [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1976, he campaigned for Carter, who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976 to promote [[sustainable living]]. His dismay at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.<ref name="bio2" />

During the 1980s, Denver was critical of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] and remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987.<ref name="bio2" /> Denver's criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad "Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)". In an open letter to the media, he wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Denver had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which he wrote in the midst of the [[1996 United States presidential election]], was one of the last he ever wrote.<ref name="bio2" /> Denver was also on the [[National Space Society]]'s board of governors for many years.

===Later years and humanitarian work===
Denver had a few more US Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and [[sustainability]] causes, focusing extensively on [[nature conservation]] projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed "What One Man Can Do") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. He also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). Denver had a keen interest in solutions to [[Malnutrition|world hunger]]. He visited Africa during the 1980s to witness firsthand the suffering caused by starvation and work with African leaders toward solutions.

From 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the yearly fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp's annual operating budget.<ref name="barb1">{{cite news |last1=Isenberg |first1=Barbara |title=Aspen Takes a Mellow Stance Towards John Denver's Gas Tank |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/493749518/? |access-date=December 18, 2018 |work=The Record |agency=Los Angeles Times News Service |date=August 20, 1979}}</ref> During the Aspen Valley Hospital's $1.7 million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.<ref name="barb1" />

In 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards. In the 1983 finale, Denver was joined on stage by folk music legend [[Joan Baez]], with whom he led an all-star version of "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Let the Sunshine In]]", joined by such diverse musical icons as [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[Donna Summer]], and [[Rick James]].

In 1984, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] president [[Roone Arledge]] asked Denver to compose and sing the theme song for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator, as skiing was another of his enthusiasms. He composed "The Gold and Beyond", and sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.<ref name="JD" />

In 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of "[[We Are the World]]", but was turned down. According to [[Ken Kragen]] (who helped to produce the song), Denver was turned down because many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. "I didn't agree with this assessment", Kragen said, but he reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/behind.htm |title=Harry Chapin  |publisher=Harrychapin.com |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

For Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental television program, ''In Partnership With Earth,'' with then-[[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[William K. Reilly]].

Due to his love of flying, he was attracted to [[NASA]] and became dedicated to America's work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the "Citizens in Space" program. In 1985 Denver received the [[NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal]] for "helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world", an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. Also in 1985, he passed NASA's rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen's trip on the [[Space Shuttle]] in 1986. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] with teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]] aboard, Denver dedicated his song "Flying for Me" to all astronauts, and continued to support NASA.<ref name="JD" /> He entered discussions with the Soviet space program about purchasing a flight aboard one of their rockets. The talks fell through after the price tag was rumored to be as high as $20 million.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mullane | first=R | title=Riding rockets : the outrageous tales of a space shuttle astronaut | publisher=Scribner | location=New York | year=2006 | isbn=0-7432-7682-5 | oclc=62118471}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:NOAA-Long-EZ.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A Long-EZ two-seater [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard plane]]]]
Denver died on the afternoon of October 12, 1997, when his light [[homebuilt aircraft]], a [[Rutan Long-EZ]] with [[Aircraft registration|registration number]] N555JD, crashed into [[Monterey Bay]] near [[Pacific Grove, California]], while making a series of [[touch-and-go landing]]s at the nearby [[Monterey Regional Airport|Monterey Peninsula Airport]].<ref name="AVW" /> He was the plane's only occupant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kligman |first1=David |title=John Denver dies in crash // Singer's experimental plane falls into ocean |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4413095.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=July 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610055804/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4413095.html |archive-date=June 10, 2014 |date=October 13, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockmine.com/Archive/Vault/DeaCert/Denver.html |title=Archive : Vault : Death Certificates: John Denver |publisher=Rockmine |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The official cause of death was [[blunt trauma|multiple blunt force trauma]] resulting from the crash.

Denver was a pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience. He had [[Pilot licensing and certification|pilot ratings]] for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider and instrument. He also held a [[type rating]] in his Learjet. He had recently purchased the Long-EZ aircraft, made by someone else from a kit,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/23/news/mn-62708|title=John Denver Plane Crash Inquiry Ends|agency=Associated Press|date=June 23, 1998|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and had taken a half-hour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before his accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/John-Denver-N555JD.htm |title=Denver's Long-EZ |publisher=Check-six.com |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.ntsb.gov">{{Cite press release|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/1999/990126.htm |title=NTSB Determines John Denver's Crash Caused by Poor Placement of Fuel Selector Handle Diverting His Attention During Flight|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) |access-date=December 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724010104/https://www.ntsb.gov/news/1999/990126.htm|archive-date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>

Denver was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash. In previous years, he had several arrests for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/John-Denver-dies-in-crash-3095382.php |title=John Denver dies in crash |date= October 13, 1997 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first1=Zachary |last1=Coile |first2=Emily |last2=Gurnon |first3=Larry D. |last3=Hatfield |access-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref> In 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the FAA learned that Denver had failed to maintain sobriety by not refraining entirely from [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and revoked his medical certification.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> The accident was not influenced by alcohol use; an autopsy found no sign of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body.<ref name="AVW" />

Post-accident investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

Before the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]], but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valves' positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was "less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying that he would be flying for about an hour.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a "pop" or "backfire" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.

In addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.

Upon the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor. Funeral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in [[Aurora, Colorado]], on October 17, 1997, officiated by Pastor Les Felker, a retired Air Force chaplain, after which Denver's remains were cremated and his ashes scattered in the Rocky Mountains. Further tributes were made at the following Grammy and [[Country Music Association]] Awards.

In 1998, Denver posthumously received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[World Folk Music Association]], which also established a new award in his honor.<ref name="noble">{{Cite book|title=Number #1 : the story of the original Highwaymen|last=Noble|first=Richard E.|publisher=Outskirts Press|year=2009|isbn=9781432738099|location=Denver|pages=265–267|oclc=426388468}}</ref>

On March 12, 2007, the [[Colorado Senate]] passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit "[[Rocky Mountain High]]" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, "[[Where the Columbines Grow]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm |title=Colorado State Song Rocky Mountain High composed by John Denver |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Representative [[Debbie Stafford]] that the song reflected drug use, most specifically in the line "friends around the campfire and everybody's high". Senator [[Bob Hagedorn]], who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as having nothing to do with drugs, but rather everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado's mountain vistas.

On September 24, 2007, the California Friends of John Denver and The Windstar Foundation unveiled a bronze plaque near the spot where his plane went down. The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved by Jeffrey Pine with Denver's name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially, the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of Denver's family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] of the singer's face and lines from his song "Windsong": "So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers.

To mark the 10th anniversary of Denver's death, his family released a set of previously unreleased recordings of his 1985 concert performances in the [[Soviet Union]].

On October 13, 2009, a DVD box set of previously unreleased concerts recorded throughout Denver's career was released by [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]. ''Around the World Live'' is a 5-disc DVD set featuring three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977, Japan in 1981, and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984 and performances at [[Farm Aid]] from 1985, 1987, and 1990. The final disc has two-hour-long documentaries made by Denver.

On April 21, 2011, Denver became the first inductee into the [[Colorado Music Hall of Fame]]. A benefit concert was held at Broomfield's [[1stBank Center]] and hosted by [[Olivia Newton-John]]. Other performers participating in the event included the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], and [[John Oates]].

He recorded three albums with the Trio, replacing Chad Mitchell as high tenor.<ref name="bio" /> Denver also wrote a number of songs that were covered by the group, such as his hits "For Bobbi", "Leaving on a Jet Plane", as well as "Deal with The Ladies" (later recorded on Denver's 1988 album, [[Higher Ground (John Denver album)]]) and "Stay With Me". The group Denver, Boise, and Johnson, which had evolved from The Chad Mitchell Trio, released a single before he moved on to a solo career.
