'''Fabrizio Tarducci''' (born 17 October 1976) , better known as '''Fabri Fibra''', is an [[Italians|Italian]] rapper. In his career he has sold more than 2.3 millions of certified copies.

== Biography ==
Tarducci was born in [[Senigallia]], [[Marche]]. He became interested in music from a young age; he wrote and performed his first piece when he was 17 years old.

In 1995 he recorded his first demo. He created the tandem [[Uomini di Mare]] with DJ Lato, beatmaker and deejay, and in 1996 they produced the underground CD ''[[Dei del mare quest'el gruv]]''. In 1999 Fabri and Lato produced and distributed the LP ''[[Sindrome di fine millennio]]'' ''("End of Millennium Syndrome")'', with collaborations from El Presidente (also known as Esa), [[Inoki]], Joe Cassano and his brother [[Nesli]].

Following his underground success, Fabri Fibra began performing around Italy. In 2000 he established his label and group [[Teste Mobili Records]] (Bobbing Head Records), and collaborated with various Italian rap groups, lending vocals as well as lyrics to the mixtape circuit.
In his career he has sold more than 2 millions of certified copies.

In 2013 he campaigned for [[Adidas Originals]], reinterpreting the song of the [[Run-DMC|Run DMC]] and dj [[A-Trak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hano.it/fabri-fibra-run-dmc-a-trak-adidas-original/|title=Unite all Originals feat.

== Solo career ==

=== ''Turbe Giovanili'' (2002) ===
In 2002 Fabri released his first solo album, titled ''[[Turbe giovanili]]'' ''(Juvenile Troubles)'', for which he wrote and recorded his lyrics under the production and arrangement of [[Neffa]]. A year later Fabri distributed ''Lato e Fabri Fibra'' which brought a close to the partnership with Lato and the Uomini di mare project with aky il grande.

[[Nesli]]'s ''Home'' and Fabri Fibra's ''[[Mr. Simpatia]]'' were released simultaneously on 1 September 2004.

=== ''Mr. Simpatia'' (2004) ===
Released in 2004, ''[[Mr. Simpatia]]'' ''(Mr. Niceness)'' is Fibra's second solo album. All the instrumental bases were made by his younger brother, the rapper Nesli Rice, with the exceptions of "Non Ti Invidio" ("I Don't Envy You") (made by Bassi Maestro) and the album's bonus track (by Bosca).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockol.it/recensione-2886/Fabri-Fibra-MR.-SIMPATIA |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317002823/http://www.rockol.it/recensione-2886/Fabri-Fibra-MR.-SIMPATIA |archive-date=2013-03-17 }}</ref>

The album cover shows Fibra's head lying on its side with a gruesome injury. ''Mr. Simpatia'' is an ironic title; the tracks' main themes are the Italian hip hop scene, contempt for society, relationships with girls, and Fibra's frustration about his job.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.hotmc.com/archivi/interviste/200412/fabrifibraintervistaamrsi.1337.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603042419/http://news.hotmc.com/archivi/interviste/200412/fabrifibraintervistaamrsi.1337.html |archive-date=2009-06-03 }}</ref>

=== ''Tradimento'' (2006) ===

[[File:Fabri Fibra Udine.jpg|thumb|right|Fabri Fibra Live in [[Udine]], in 2006]]
After splitting from his recording company contract at Vibrarecords, Fabri went underground and went unheard from for a year, until he resurfaced with a new deal at major recording company [[Universal Music]]. Under the production of Fish and brother [[Nesli]] Fabri created his most commercially and artistically successful album, ''[[Tradimento]]'' ("Betrayal"). His first single, released in Europe 4 April 2006, was "[[Applausi per Fibra]]" ("Applause for Fibra"). The single discussed Fibra's personal and life experiences overcome by Fabri himself, with a certain emphasis on self-praise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rapmaniacz.com/FabriInt.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305015811/http://www.rapmaniacz.com/FabriInt.htm |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}</ref>

Only a week after the official launch (6 June 2006) the album reached the number one spot in album sales. However it was criticized{{Who|date=August 2010}} for its use of expletives, indifference in its presentation of provocative themes, and its [[Misogyny|misogynist]] views of women, all of which were found across the album.

Following the success of "Applausi per Fibra", the second single, "[[Mal di Stomaco]]" ("Stomachache"), which gained instant infamy, most notably for the originality of its music video (a fabricated broadcast of SKY TG24 - a Satellite news station) that reports on the death of Fabri Fibra in a [[car accident]]. The authenticity is sealed with "live coverage" reports, interviews from famous stars such as [[Fernanda Lessa]], [[Éva Henger]], Jimmy Ghione, producer Fish, rapper Vacca and brother [[Nesli]]. The video ends with Fabri's body disappearing from the [[morgue]].

The last single is "[[Idee stupide]]" ("Stupid Ideas"), with a black and white video which, whilst not as original as the former video, uses a ''[[Rocky]]''-style montage that complements Fabri's underdog lyrics.

In 2010, ''Tradimento'' came second in a newspaper poll, making it the second most important album of the decade in Italy{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

=== ''Bugiardo'' (2008) ===

=== '' Chi Vuole Essere Fabri Fibra? '' (2009) ===
On 10 April 2009, Fibra released his fifth album, entitled [[Chi vuole essere Fabri Fibra?]] ''(Who Wants To Be Fabri Fibra?)'' He released two songs from the album, entitled "Incomprensioni" ("Incomprehension") (featuring Federico Zampaglione) and "Speak English", which discusses the cultural differences between Italy and [[England]]; the video for "Speak English" was shot in Brighton, where Fibra lived and worked for four years. A track off the album, entitled "Donna Famosa" ("Famous Woman"), is featured in the soundtrack of the ''[[FIFA 10]]'' football [[video game]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xl.repubblica.it/dettaglio/76608|title=XL Repubblica - Dettaglio articolo}}</ref>
