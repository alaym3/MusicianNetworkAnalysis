On April 27, 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that Five Finger Death Punch's record label [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] had filed a lawsuit against the band on April 21, 2016 for breaching their contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Five Finger Death Punch Sued By Label Over New Album, Greatest Hits|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7348340/five-finger-death-punch-sued-by-label-new-album-greatest-hits|work=Billboard|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> The basis of the claim cites that the band began working on a new album without Prospect Park's consent and will be working with [[Rise Records]]. In a recent interview, vocalist Ivan Moody has said he will be completing the current tour and leave the band at the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/shocking-revelations/ivan-moody-says-hes-leaving-five-finger-death-punch-in-first-interview-since-his-meltdown|title=Ivan Moody Says He's Leaving Five Finger Death Punch – Metal Injection|date=April 21, 2017|work=metalinjection.net|access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref> The next day however, an announcement was published on the official site of FFDP, where it was revealed, that rumors about Ivan's departure are false. According to the announcement, the vocalist plans to start a side project beside Five Finger Death Punch, which does not mean he has plans on leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivefingerdeathpunch.com/blogs/news/ivan-moody-sets-the-record-straight|title=Ivan Moody Sets The Record Straight – Five Finger Death Punch|date=April 22, 2017|website=fivefingerdeathpunch.com|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivefingerdeathpunchnews.com/2017/04/ivan-moody-issues-official-statement-following-reports-he-was-leaving-five-finger-death-punch.html|title=Ivan Moody issues official statement following reports he was leaving Five Finger Death Punch|website=Fivefingerdeathpunchnews.com|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref>

However, during a concert in the Netherlands, Moody did not show up to perform the first song, which was sung by [[Tommy Vext]], with Moody saying he was running "a little bit late". Vext also sang a second song during the set later in the evening while Moody walked off stage. During the show all of the members left the stage for long periods on several occasions, and Hook also threw his guitar down and walked offstage at one point. During the set, Moody said that "there is no other singer for Five Finger Death Punch", and then later said "This is my last show with Five Finger Death Punch" before making a slit-throat gesture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/71619/news-ivan-moody-calls-tilburg-his-last-show-in-five-finger-death-punch|title=News: Ivan Moody calls Tilburg his "last show" in Five Finger Death Punch!|website=Deadpress.co.uk|date=June 13, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> Bathory shortly after the show tweeted that the events that transpired were "not a publicity stunt."<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ZoltanBathory|first=Zoltan|last=Bathory|number=874454610941026306|date=13 June 2017|title=No dude not a publicity stunt.
