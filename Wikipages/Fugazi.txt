'''Fugazi''' ({{IPAc-en|f|u|ˈ|g|ɑː|z|i}}; {{Respell|foo|GAH|zee}}) is an American [[post-hardcore]] band that formed in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1986. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists [[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Guy Picciotto]], bassist [[Joe Lally]], and drummer [[Brendan Canty]]. They are noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice, and contempt for the music industry.

Fugazi has performed numerous worldwide tours and produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.<ref name="guitarworld"/> Highly influential on [[punk music|punk]] and [[alternative rock|alternative]] music, the band has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1989)===
After the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Minor Threat]] dissolved, MacKaye (vocals and [[guitar]]) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. He decided he wanted a project that was "like [[The Stooges]] with [[reggae]]", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's breakup. MacKaye recalled, "My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me."<ref>Azerrad, p. 384.</ref>

MacKaye recruited ex-[[Dag Nasty]] drummer [[Colin Sears]] and [[bass guitar]]ist Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Canty (earlier of [[Rites of Spring]]). One day, Picciotto, Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate, dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.<ref>Azerrad, p. 385.</ref>

After some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word "fugazi" from Mark Baker's ''Nam'', a compilation of stories of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, it there being a slang acronym for "Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]".<ref>Baker, p. 321.</ref>

The band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a [[Hype man|foil]] in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band [[Happy Go Licky]] broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, and he accepted.<ref>Azerrad, p. 386.</ref>

===''Fugazi EP'' & ''Margin Walker''&nbsp;– ''13 Songs'' (1988–1989)===
Fugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP ''[[Fugazi (EP)|Fugazi]]'' with producer [[Ted Niceley]] and producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] (who became a longtime collaborator), and shortly afterward embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.<ref>Azerrad, p. 396.</ref>

At the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. But the band was spent from touring and found the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as ''[[Margin Walker]]'' the next year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the ''[[13 Songs (Fugazi album)|13 Songs]]'' release in late 1989.<ref name="stillinrock.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/anachronique-fugazi-war-punk.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Anachronique : Fugazi (War Punk) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |access-date=2014-04-18}}</ref><ref>Azerrad, p. 398.</ref> Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.<ref name="Azerrad, p. 399">Azerrad, p. 399.</ref>

===''Repeater'' and ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' (1990–1992)===

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
With Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into [[Jam session|jamming]] and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as "Merchandise" and "Turnover", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.<ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002">^ a b c d Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". Guitar World. March 2002.</ref>

Released on April 19, 1990, through [[Dischord Records]], ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' did not initially reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts or become a commercial success. But the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind ''Repeater'', performing 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. Major labels began to court Fugazi, but the band stayed with Dischord. It was critically well received and featured an [[alternative rock]] sound that predated significant releases such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', which unexpectedly broke the genre into the mainstream.<ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002"/>

For Fugazi's second studio album, ''[[Steady Diet of Nothing]]'', released in July 1991, the band again asked [[Ted Niceley]] to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band decided to produce the record itself.<ref>Azerrad, p. 407.</ref> After the success of ''Repeater'' and its subsequent world tour, ''Steady Diet'' was highly anticipated. Six months before its release Dischord had more than 160,000 pre-orders for the album.<ref>*{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |year=2001 |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |location=New York |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=1-888451-44-0}} p. 304</ref>

===''In On the Kill Taker'' and ''Red Medicine'' (1993–1996)===
Fugazi recorded its third album, ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]'', in the fall of 1992 with [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago, but the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band rerecorded the album with Niceley and [[Don Zientara]]. With the breakthrough of alternative rock in the early 1990s, ''In on the Kill Taker''; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album charts, receiving critical praise from ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', ''[[TIME magazine]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and becoming the band's breakthrough album.<ref name="guitarworld" />

By the ''In on the Kill Taker'' tour, the group began to sell out large auditoriums and arenas and receive more lucrative major label offers. During its sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] in September 1993, music mogul and [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Ertegun]] met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegun offered the band "anything you want", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined.<ref>Freidman, p. 52.</ref> The organizers of [[Lollapalooza]] also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Norman|1993}}</ref>

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Fugazi began writing the material for ''[[Red Medicine]]'' in late 1994, after touring in support of ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]''. The band worked with Zientara but chose not to work with Niceley again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of ''In on the Kill Taker'' and instead worked to create an ambient sound that displayed greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties itself, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. ''Red Medicine'' took Fugazi a step further toward [[art rock]]. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.<ref name="guitarworld" /><ref>

===''End Hits'' and ''The Argument'' (1997–2002)===
After the grueling worldwide tour the band completed in support of ''Red Medicine'', Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow-up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with Zientara to begin recording what became ''[[End Hits]]'', with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release.<ref name="Morphizm">{{cite web | url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/fugaziguy.html| title=Guy Picciotto of Fugazi:The Argument (2001): Interview | work=Morphizm | publisher=Morphizm.com | access-date=2009-03-19 }}</ref> Released on April 28, 1998, the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. Critical reaction to ''End Hits'' was mixed. Many critics praised its heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.<ref name="Crane, Larry 1999">Crane, Larry.

Fugazi began work on ''[[The Argument]]'' in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member brought his own riffs and ideas to the band, jammed on them, and then began piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on the final versions.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|first=Chip|last=Chanko|year=2002|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/5840-fugazi/| title=Interviews:Fugazi|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|access-date=2009-03-19}}</ref> The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at [[Inner Ear Studios]] and Dischord House in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. The band once again worked with Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel.<ref name="Modern Drummer">Perlah, Jeff. (2005). [http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2004/05/brendan-canty/ Brendan Canty]. Modern Drummer Magazine.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.</ref> Canty told ''[[Modern Drummer]]'', "We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different cymbals, snares, and ways of miking."<ref name="Modern Drummer"/>

''The Argument'' was released by Dischord Records on October 16, 2001, along with the EP [[Furniture + 2]].  Arion Berger of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "bracing" and "intellectual"<ref>Berger, Arion. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-argument-20011113 Fugazi The Argument] Rollingstone.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.</ref> and Chris True of ''[[AllMusic]]'' "spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once", writing, "the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again." He also wrote that the album had "touched on strange new territory."<ref>{{cite web |website=AllMusic|title=The Argument - Fugazi {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r343128|first=Chris |last=True|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> By this point Fugazi was on tour less, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments. It performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002.<ref name="guitarworld">Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". ''Guitar World''. March 2002.</ref>

===Indefinite hiatus and reunion rumours (2003–present)===
Fugazi went on what it has called an "indefinite hiatus" after the conclusion of its 2002 UK tour following three sold-out nights at the [[London Forum]] on November 2–4, 2002.<ref>Freidman, p. 11.</ref> The hiatus was brought on by the band members' insistence on spending more time with their families and pursuing other professional projects.<ref>Freidman, p. 12.</ref>

Since Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating about a reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the [[Coachella Festival]]. While the band has confirmed that it has been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, it has so far declined the offers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/25590 |title=Brendan Canty discusses Fugazi hiatus, "Burn to Shine" and new projects |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref>

In March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has "been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it's not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://approachingoblivion.blogspot.com/2011/03/ian-mackaye-interview-minor-threat.html |title=Approaching Oblivion: Ian Mackaye Interview (Minor Threat, Fugazi, Dischord Records) |publisher=Approachingoblivion.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-22 |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref>

In November 2011, when asked by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001's ''[[The Argument]]'', Lally said, "''The Argument'' was a great record that we should try and top. It'll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we'd have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, reassociating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we'll just see."<ref name="Interview: Joe Lally"/>

In August 2014, Dischord announced an official release for ''[[First Demo]]'', an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/news/580/2014/8/fugazi-first-demo-out-this-winter|title=Fugazi "First Demo" Out November 18th|publisher=Dischord.com|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref> The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track "Merchandise."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1714496/fugazi-merchandise-demo/mp3s/|title=Fugazi – "Merchandise" (Demo) - Stereogum|work=Stereogum|date=27 October 2014|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref> The album was released on November 18, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/181/first-demo|title=Fugazi - First Demo|work=Dischord Records|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref>

MacKaye insisted in a 2017 interview that Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2003 hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.culturecreature.com/fugazi-reunion/ |title=Fugazi's still around--they just went underground |publisher=culturecreature.com |date=2017-01-19 |access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref> On March 21, 2018, in an interview on Vish Khanna's Kreative Kontrol podcast, Lally confirmed the band's irregular practice of casual get-togethers. He stated: “Yeah, when we’re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we'll play some music together.” Lally also stated that additional public performances or tours were unlikely: "There's so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.”

On February 13, 2019, ''[[Louder Sound]]'' asked Lally and Canty about the possibility of Fugazi returning, Lally responded “You never want to say never about anything, because how can you say that about the future? But there does seem to be a lack of time to allow it to happen, because the four of us would have to spend a lot of time together to figure out, 'Should we play old songs?' 'Who are we now?' 'What is it now?' We are not the kind of band to get together and just rehearse two hours of old songs to go out and play it, rake in the dough and come home.” Canty added, "If we got back together it would have to be from the spirit of creativity. It would be different if we got back together.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-messthetics-are-the-band-every-fugazi-fan-needs-in-their-life |title=The Messthetics are the band every Fugazi fan needs in their life |publisher=Loudersound.com |date=2019-02-13 |access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>

==Side projects and related work==
In the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo [[The Evens]] with drummer and singer [[Amy Farina]] (formerly of [[the Warmers]]).

In 2004, MacKaye produced the ''[[DC EP]]'' for [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]], which also featured Jerry Busher.

Canty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio [[Garland Of Hours]] alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with [[Mary Timony]]. Canty also appears on [[Bob Mould]]'s 2005 album ''[[Body of Song]]'' and on Mould's 2008 album ''[[District Line (album)|District Line]]'', and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD ''Circle of Friends''. He is currently working in the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on [[Dischord Records]].

Lally has released three solo albums, ''[[There to Here]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Is Underrated]]'' (2007), and ''[[Why Should I Get Used To It]]'' (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers [[Decahedron]]'s debut album ''Disconnection_Imminent'', as well as on a project with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarists [[John Frusciante]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], known as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].  The group has recorded two albums, ''[[Automatic Writing]]'' (2004) and ''[[AW II]]'' (2007).

Picciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]], and he has performed alongside members of [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] at the [[Jazz]] festival in [[Wels]], [[Austria]]. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two [[Vic Chesnutt]] albums, 2007's "[[North Star Deserter]] and 2009's ''[[At the Cut]]'' (co-producing the latter), for [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]] and performed live with Chesnutt and members of [[Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra]] and The Quavers in [[Jem Cohen]]'s program entitled, "Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009).  Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician [[Kathi Wilcox]] from the band [[Bikini Kill]] and [[The Frumpies]].

In July 2011, Minneapolis based record label [[Doomtree]] released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wugazis-13-chambers-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110713?asid=98b65563 |title=Wugazi's '13 Chambers': A Track-by-Track Breakdown |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2011|author=Joe Gross |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref> Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it's enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don't know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] festival and talk to them. But I'm afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work."<ref name="Interview: Joe Lally">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/joe-lally,64410/ |title=Interview: Joe Lally |publisher=The A.V.

In October 2012, Chris Lawhorn released ''Fugazi Edits''. The album includes 22 instrumental tracks, which sample 100 songs from Fugazi's discography.<ref name="Cool Hunting: Fugazi Edits">{{cite web |url=http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/fugazi-edits-by-chris-lawhorn.php |title=Fugazi Edits |publisher=Cool Hunting |date=2013-01-23 |access-date=2013-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119100035/http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/fugazi-edits-by-chris-lawhorn.php |archive-date=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As in other cases, the band had no involvement in the production.

==Live performances==
{{main|Fugazi Live Series}}
[[File:Fugazi guns - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Handmade tickets for a Fugazi concert from 2001 in Indianapolis, Indiana]]
Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 US states and all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via [[Dischord Records]]. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a "[[pay what you want]]" sliding scale option for each download between $1–100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series|title=Fugazi Live Series: A to Z|publisher=Dischord.com|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref> For $500 fans can also purchase an "All Access" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/arts/music/fugazi-live-series-a-post-punk-bands-archive-of-shows.html |title=Fugazi Rises Again, In Online Archive |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-11-25 |access-date=2011-11-28}}</ref>

While each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]] explained to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get." The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s, then eventually digital formats such as [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[CD-R]] and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Pearl Jam]], three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.<ref name="New York Times"/>

==Musical style==
Fugazi's style has been described as [[post-hardcore]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fugazi-mn0000798606/biography |title=Fugazi &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-04-18}}</ref> [[art punk]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/Fugazi_Nearly_Finished_Massive_Live_Archive_Project | title=Fugazi Nearly Finished Massive Live Archive Project | publisher=[[Exclaim!]] | date=July 19, 2010 | access-date=April 17, 2015 | author=Carlick, Stephen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/27321/in-on-the-killjoy | title=In on the Killjoy | publisher=[[Washington City Paper]] | date=October 17, 2003 | access-date=April 17, 2015 | author=Little, Michael}}</ref> [[alternative rock]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Farseth|first=Erik|author-link=Erik Farseth|date=2012|title=American Rock: Guitar Heroes, Punks, and Metalheads|isbn=9781512452853|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPilDQAAQBAJ&q=%22fugazi%22+%22alternative+rock%22&pg=PA41|access-date=January 18, 2017|quote=Fugazi's mixture of [[punk rock|punk]] guitars and [[funk]]y rhythms made it one of the most influential bands in alternative rock.}}</ref> and [[experimental rock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1133821/fugazi-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/redmedicine/ | title=Fugazi Albums From Worst To Best: Red Medicine | publisher=[[Stereogum]] | date=August 23, 2012 | access-date=April 17, 2015 | author=Toth, James Jackson}}</ref> Fugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the [[hardcore punk]] bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with [[funk]] and [[reggae]] beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained.<ref>Azerrad, p. 391–392.</ref>

Picciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's [[dub music|dub]]-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to MacKaye; employing a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to "cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam."<ref name="Azerrad, p. 399"/> Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them.<ref>Azerrad, p. 399–400.</ref> When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers.<ref name="guitarworld" /> ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No.&nbsp;86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.<ref name="Spin Magazine 100 Greatest Guitarists">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/spins-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time/?page=1 |title=SPIN's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Spin.com |access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref>

Generally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and [[anthem]]ic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able [[slogan]]s), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach.<ref name="guitarworld" /> Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, [[soul music|soul]] and [[noise rock|noise]] with an inventively syncopated [[rhythm section]]. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of "[[lead guitar|lead]]" and "[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[chord progression|progressions]] filtered through a hardcore punk lens.

Each of Fugazi's albums since ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' have featured an [[instrumental rock|instrumental]]. By the time of 1995's ''[[Red Medicine]]'' bassist [[Joe Lally]] also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an "unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements" such as "clattering [[musique concrète]] ... [[piano]] and [[sound effect]]s ... murky [[Dub music|dub]] and lancing [[clarinet]]" and "loose-limbed [[jam band|jammy]] [[funk]] ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers."<ref name="Fugazi">{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fugazi |title=Fugazi |publisher=TrouserPress.com |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref>

===Influences===

When questioned by ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist [[Ian MacKaye]] responded, "Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music." In a 2004 interview with Indonesian magazine ''Deathrockstar'', Picciotto named "D.C. groups" such as [[Bad Brains]] (" [...] who inspired all of us so much at the beginning [...]"), [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]] and [[Void (band)|Void]] as influences, in addition to [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] and [[The Beatles]], the latter of which all the members "share[d] a major love for". Despite this, he similarly conceded that "[i]ts [sic] impossible to narrow it down to one band or record because we didn’t just crib from one blueprint, we were grabbing ideas from all over the place and then filtering them through our own limited and personally shaped skills."<ref name=drs/>

==Business practices==
On their first tours, Fugazi worked out its [[Do it yourself|DIY]] ethic by trial and error. Their decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of [[simple living]]: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to [[price gouging]] a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.<ref name="punklives">Eric Brace. (August 1, 1993) [https://archive.today/20181005224001/http://www.oocities.org/drawcamp/wp93.htm PUNK LIVES! Washington's Fugazi Claims It's Just a Band. So Why Do So Many Kids Think It's God?] The Washington Post</ref> [[Everett True]] has said that MacKaye and Fugazi "had a mind-set that believed that any involvement with the system was corrupting and that you should create completely alternative structures outside".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Danny |title=Serving the Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain |date=2019}}</ref>

In later years, Fugazi was unable to negotiate ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions. Many times the band performed sold-out shows multiple consecutive nights at the same venue.<ref name="punklives" />

Fugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, "You find the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen."<ref>Azerrad, p. 391.</ref>

The group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted [[slam dancing]] and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] era. [[Michael Azerrad]] quotes Mackaye, "See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it ''freaks'' them out – 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'"<ref name="Azerrad, p. 392">Azerrad, p. 392.</ref> Azerrad writes, "[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye."<ref name="Azerrad, p. 392"/> Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).

During the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd.<ref>[http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133611/http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796 |date=March 6, 2010 }}</ref> in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye's financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to the ''Washington Post'' in a 1993 interview: "protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm&date=2009-10-25+21:05:41 |archive-date=October 25, 2009 }}</ref>
