'''USS''' ('''Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker''') is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[alternative rock]] musical duo from [[Toronto]],<ref name=MUCH>[http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/bio.asp?artist=2136 Artist bio on MuchMusic.com] Retrieved March 11, 2009</ref> Ontario, Canada. The band is composed of vocalist and guitarist Ashley Buchholz (aka Ash Boo-Schultz) and [[Turntablism|turntablist]]/[[hype man]]  [[Jason "Human Kebab" Parsons]].

The band's sound is a mixture of [[drum and bass]] beats, [[grunge]]-like guitar riffs, and [[2-step garage|2-step]] rhythms. "We like to call what we do the campfire after-party", Ash Buchholz has said; "It's like you're at [[Nirvana Unplugged]] but there's a drum and bass party and [[glow sticks]] all around you."<ref name=VICTORIA>[http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/arts/story.html?id=fcf6d938-5dd0-4345-ab8c-4cb27c41137b Carey, Steve, “Good old fashioned Victoria block party”, ''Victoria Times Colonist'', Aug 17, 2008] Retrieved March 11, 2009</ref> The duo split up in 2021.

== History ==
[[File:Ashley Buchholz UbiqSS.jpg|thumb|left|Ashley Buchholz of USS]]

===Formation and first release: 2004–08===
USS hails from the [[Greater Toronto Area]], Buchholz being from the city of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] and Parsons from the adjacent town of [[Stouffville, Ontario|Stouffville]].<ref name=YORK>[http://www.yorkregion.com/news/article/558261--band-needs-your-help Arbour, Ross, “Band needs your help”, ''yorkregion.com'', Oct 17, 2008] Retrieved June 4, 2011</ref> They met in 2004 while stocking the beer fridge and discussing music when they worked at a golf course.<ref name=VICTORIA/><ref name=YORK/><ref name=CRAVE>[http://www.cravefest.com/cravetv/?artist=Ubiquitous-Synergy-Seeker&tid=1016 Interview for Crave TV] Retrieved March 11, 2009</ref> The pair hit it off instantly.<ref name=SEE>[http://www.seemagazine.com/article/music/music-previews/vocab-junkies/ Paul, Andrew, "Vocab Junkies", ''See Magazine'', Aug 14, 2008] Retrieved March 11, 2009</ref> A few months later, Buchholz's sister was looking for someone to DJ at her upcoming wedding and Parsons was suggested for the job.<ref name=CRAVE/> According to Buchholz, "It was love at first [[Scratching|scratch]]", and he later moved into Parsons' parents' basement to begin experimenting musically.<ref name=CRAVE/>

The band's name came about when Buchholz sketched out a map of exactly who he wanted to be in life. At the top , he wrote, "Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker".<ref name=VICTORIA/> Although this title was to become the band's moniker, the duo says that the name is for everyone: "It's singular&nbsp;—&nbsp;it's the title of a characteristic, not the title of two guys", Buchholz said.<ref name=VICTORIA/>

By July 2008, the two began to perform live, and they released their first independent [[Extended play|EP]], ''Welding the C:/'' (pronounced "Welding the C Drive") later that same month.<ref name=MUCH/><ref name=VICTORIA/> The band then parted ways to pursue different avenues; Parsons travelled to [[Alberta]] to work on an [[Pipeline transport|oil pipeline]] and Buchholz went to the US on a [[pilgrimage]]. A friend of Parsons' later called him to say that Toronto radio station [[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]] had begun playing their first single, "Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole". The duo then returned to Toronto to shoot a video for the song, which was later added to the [[MuchMusic]] channel.<ref name=MUCH/><ref name=SEE/>

===''Questamation'': 2009–11===
In March 2009, USS released their first full-length album, ''[[Questamation]]'', through their independent label, Smashing World Records.<ref name=CHART>[http://www.chartattack.com/news/65437/uss-ready-to-be-ubiquitous-again "USS Ready To Be Ubiquitous Again"], ''ChartAttack'', January 27, 2009, Retrieved March 11, 2009</ref>  For the recording, the duo teamed up with Matthew Von Wagner ([[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]], [[Alpha Galates]]) for production and engineering, while Chris Davies and Charles Topping 'aided musically'.<ref name=CHART/> Music engineer [[Bob Ludwig]] was recruited to [[Master recording|master]] the original album in [[Portland, Maine]].<ref name=SEE/> James Black of Finger Eleven is featured playing guitar on "P.S. I Can Change".{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}
On March 14, they won the award for Favourite Group/Duo at the CMW Indie Awards in Toronto. During their performance, the duo lit up the stage with a high-energy set, complete with handstands and full-size cardboard cutouts of [[Barack Obama]] and [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>[http://ca.eonline.com/uberblog/b104593_canadian_music_week_uss_takes_fave.html "Canadian Music Week: USS Takes Fav Group At 2009 Indies].

In an interview with ''Eye Weekly'', Parsons elaborated on what the duo was working on:

<blockquote>It's amazing. We're working with [[Tawgs Salter]], who's done records with [[Lights (musician)|Lights]], [[The Midway State]], and [[Josh Groban]], and he's been helping us define what the new USS is, from a songwriting perspective. We're free to be quirky, acoustic, singer-songwriter, electronic turntable-based music, but in a bigger sounding format that has global aspirations. We've returned more to the minimal that we showed on our first EP, ''Welding The C:/'', but we're doing it with the right producer, to make it sound as big and powerful as we can be. At the start of the year we did a song with [[Ashley MacIsaac]], and we followed that with what's hopefully going to become our new EP.

''[[Approved (Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker album)|Approved]]'', the band's second EP, was released digitally worldwide on May 3, 2011, the day of the release party at Toronto's MOD Club and the kickoff date for the USS Approved Spring/Summer Cross-Canada tour.
