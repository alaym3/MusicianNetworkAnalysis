==History==

[[File:Eluveitie Cernunnos Fest 161207 01.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Eluveitie at Cernunnos Fest]]

=== Formation and Fear Dark Records contract (2002–2007) ===
After failing numerous attempts to form an actual band, [[Chrigel Glanzmann|Christian "Chrigel" Glanzmann]] created Eluveitie in the winter of 2002 as a studio project featuring various musicians on each track. The musicians had no obligations to the group but to record their parts in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Korovesis|first1=Alkis|title=Eluveitie interview (Chrigel Glanzmann)|url=http://noisefull.com/interviews/eluveitie-chrigel-glanzmann|website=Noisefull.com|access-date=12 May 2016|date=29 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506072713/http://noisefull.com/interviews/eluveitie-chrigel-glanzmann|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name of the band comes from graffiti found in [[Mantua]] around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vitali|first1=Daniele|last2=Kaenel|first2=Gilbert|title=Un Helvète chez les Étrusques vers 300 av. J.-C.|url=https://www.academia.edu/2242392|access-date=12 May 2016|pages=115–122|language=fr}}</ref> In [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan letters]], the inscription read "eluveitie", interpreted in the [[Etruscan language]] as "elvetios" ("The Swiss"). The inscription was probably a reference to the [[Helvetii]] people who lived in Mantua.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Giuseppe|first1=Sassatelli|title=Celti ed Etruschi nell'Etruria Padana e nell'Italia settentrionale, in "Ocnus" 11, 2003, pp. 231-257.|url=https://www.academia.edu/4847350|access-date=12 May 2016|language=it}}</ref>

October the following year saw the publication of the MCD ''[[Vên]]'' (Helvetian Gaulish for "wild joy"<ref>Interview with Chrigel Glanzmann [http://www.taste-of-black.ch/eluveitie_interview.htm taste-of-black.ch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707003652/http://www.taste-of-black.ch/eluveitie_interview.htm |date=7 July 2011}} Retrieved 24 February 2010</ref>). After Chrigel decided to make Eluveitie a real band instead of a studio project, he assembled nine other musicians, making it a full ten-piece band.

Shortly afterwards, the group performed its first shows, one including the Swiss metal festival Elements of Rock, and Eluveitie signed a contract with the Dutch record label Fear Dark, which released a re-recorded ''Vên'' in 2004. Other live performances were played, such as on some events of "Fear Dark Festivals", and even as support for the established international pagan–folk metal acts such as [[Korpiklaani]] and [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]]. (Chrigel sent the first MCD to Keith from Cruachan at this time for his opinion.) At this point, the band became full-time, and 6 of the 10 members left for various reasons, leaving Chrigel Glanzmann, [[Sevan Kirder]], Meri Tadić and Dide Marfurt to carry on with new members. They recruited six others, including Sevan Kirder's brother [[Rafi Kirder|Rafi]] to play bass.

A limited edition tribute album to the German–Icelandic band [[Falkenbach]] was published in 2006 to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The album included Eluveitie's cover song "Vanadis".

In the second quarter of 2006, the album entitled ''[[Spirit (Eluveitie album)|Spirit]]'' was published on Fear Dark. Although the official release date was 1 June 2006, it was made available on their first official 'tour' (a series of 'Fear Dark Festivals' in May 2006, playing alongside label mates Morphia (HOL)& Royal Anguish (USA), as well as Taketh (SWE)).

In 2006, After the release of the Spirit album, there was another change in the band's line-up. Sarah Wauquiez was replaced by [[Anna Murphy (musician)|Anna Murphy]] to play [[hurdy-gurdy]] and Linda Suter was removed, trimming the band down to eight members.

=== Nuclear Blast contract and ''Slania'' (2007–2012) ===
In November 2007, Eluveitie signed a contract with label Nuclear Blast. The new studio album ''[[Slania (album)|Slania]]'' (a girl's name that Chrigel saw on a 2500-year-old tombstone<ref name="metalist.co.il"/><ref>The stone in question appears to be the Davesco gravestone, see {{cite web|last1=Stifter|first1=David|title=TI·36.1 – Lexicon Leponticum|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/lexlep/wiki/TI·36.1|website=An Interactive Online Etymological Dictionary of Lepontic|publisher=University of Vienna|access-date=9 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730231925/http://www.univie.ac.at/lexlep/wiki/TI%C2%B736.1|archive-date=30 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>) was released on 15 February 2008.

== Characteristics ==
Eluveitie infuses traditional Celtic folk melodies with [[Gothenburg metal|Gothenburg]]-styled [[melodic death metal]]. Eluveitie uses traditional folk instruments in their music, such as [[Violin|fiddles]], [[tin whistle]]s and [[flute]]s, [[bagpipes]] and [[hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]]. The traditional folk tunes in their songs have been drawn from various sources, including traditional Irish reels. While many of their lyrics are in English, some are in the ancient extinct [[Gaulish language]]. In some instances, the two languages are intertwined throughout a song. All of the lyrics on their 2009 release ''[[Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion]]'' are in Gaulish (except the first song "Sacrapos – At First Glance"). Their lyrics are based on texts written in Gaulish such as prayers, invocations of the gods and other spirits.<ref>Transit Magazine, n°47, été 2009, Eluveitie, interview of Christian Glanzmann by Dave, p. 28</ref>
