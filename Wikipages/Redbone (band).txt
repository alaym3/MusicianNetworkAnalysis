'''Redbone''' is an American [[funk rock]] band founded in 1969 by brothers Pat and Lolly Vegas. All band members during their commercial peak were of [[Mexican American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] heritage, which was reflected in their songs, stage costumes, and album art. 

They reached the [[Top 40|Top 5]] on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1974 with their single, "[[Come and Get Your Love]]". The single went certified Gold selling over a million copies. It also made Redbone the first Native American band to reach the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the song reaching number 5.<ref>{{Cite web|date=3 August 2020|title=Watch surreal animated official video for Redbone's classic hit "Come and Get Your Love" - Music News - ABC News Radio|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2020/8/3/watch-surreal-animated-official-video-for-redbones-classic-h.html|access-date=2020-08-30|website=ABC Audio|language=en}}</ref> Redbone achieved hits with their singles "We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee", "[[The Witch Queen of New Orleans]]", "Wovoka", and "Maggie" in the United States, although these singles were more successful overseas. 

Pat has been the sole member of the band since Lolly's death in 2010.

==History==
Born in [[Coalinga, California]], near Fresno, brothers [[Pat Vegas|Patrick]] ([[bass guitar|bass]] and [[singing|vocals]]) and [[Lolly Vegas|Candido "Lolly" Vasquez-Vegas]] ([[guitar]] and vocals) moved to Los Angeles in 1959 and played for ten years in clubs under the name of Pat and Lolly Vegas. Pat won [[Coca-Cola]]'s first singing competition in 1958 at age 17. He also won a recording contract, which he put off to move to Los Angeles with Lolly. They performed at local clubs on [[Hollywood Boulevard|Hollywood]] and [[Sunset Boulevard]] (such as [[Gazzari's]]) while writing and playing on records by [[Tina Turner]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[James Brown]], [[Little Richard]], and [[Elvis]], among other legendary artists.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guerrero |first1=Mark |title=Cajun Funk with a Touch of Latin Soul |url=http://www.markguerrero.com/23.php |publisher=Mark Guerrero - Singer/Songwriter |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Honorees & Performers |url=https://nativeamericanmusicawards.com/galleries/52314/honorees-performers |publisher=Native American Music Association (NAMA) |access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Gary |title=Gary James' Interview with Pat Vegas of Redbone |url=http://www.classicbands.com/RedboneInterview.html |publisher=Classic Bands |access-date=23 February 2018}}</ref>

The word [[Redbone (ethnicity)|"redbone"]] is a [[Cajun]] term for a mixed-race person, which the band adopted to signify their mixed ancestry.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London, UK |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/349 349] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/349 }}</ref> The Vasquez-Vegas brothers were of [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], [[Shoshone]], and [[Mexicans|Mexican]] heritage.<ref name="themusicsover">{{cite web |url=http://themusicsover.com/tag/redbone/ |publisher=themusicsover.com ([[WordPress]] blog site) |title=Posts Tagged 'Redbone' |date=2010-03-04 |access-date=2014-03-08 }}</ref> The band often alluded to Cajun and [[New Orleans]] culture in their lyrics and performing style.

Before forming Redbone, Pat and Lolly released an album in the mid-1960s entitled ''Pat & Lolly Vegas at the Haunted House'' (Mercury MG 21059/SR 61059).<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r64556|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com discography]</ref> Of the twelve songs on the album, six were originals by the Vasquez-Vegas brothers which earned them some early success. Pat and Lolly also appeared on the '60s hit show [[Shindig!]] repeatedly, becoming regular performers. They also released several singles from 1961 to the mid-1960s, one titled "Robot Walk" / "Don't You Remember" (Apogee Records A-101), helping to make a name for themselves in their early years.

In 1967, [[P.J. Proby]] recorded his only Top-30 hit, "Niki Hoeky", written by [[Jim Ford]], Lolly Vegas, and Pat Vegas. The next year, [[Bobbie Gentry]] performed the Cajun-influenced song on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and included it on her smash-hit album,  [[Ode to Billie Joe (album)|''Ode to Billie Joe'']].  Pat Vegas also wrote songs for legendary names like [[Aretha Franklin]] amongst others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dyo_xZnvsA |title=Bobbie Gentry - Niki Hoeky |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0712997/|title=The Summer Brothers Smothers Show: Season 1, Episode 6

According to Pat Vegas, [[Jimi Hendrix]], himself part [[Cherokee]], inspired the musicians to form an all-Native American rock group. They signed as the band "Redbone" to [[Epic Records]] in 1969. The band then consisted of Pat Vegas, Lolly Vegas, [[Peter DePoe]] and Robert Anthony Avila, a Yaqui-Mexican American, better known by his stage name [[Tony Bellamy]]. Their debut album ''[[Redbone (album)|Redbone]]'' was released in 1970.<ref name="NAMA">{{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanmusicawards.com/nama-10 |title=NAMA 10  |work=nativeamericanmusicawards.com |publisher=[[Native American Music Awards]] |location=New York, NY |access-date=2014-03-08}}</ref>

Redbone played primarily [[rock music]] with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], Cajun, [[blue-eyed soul]], [[funk]], [[country music|country]], tribal, and Latin roots. Their first world commercial success came with the [[single (music)|single]] "[[The Witch Queen of New Orleans]]" that peaked at No. 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and followed by the single "Maggie" from their second [[album]], ''[[Potlatch (album)|Potlatch]]''. "[[Come and Get Your Love]]" followed as a big No. 5 hit for Redbone and remained on the chart for 24 weeks being [[music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|R.I.A.A.]] on April 22, 1974.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Redbone was also the opening act introducing the first [[Earth Day]] to the world in [[Philadelphia]] along with Senator [[Edmund Muskie]]. Their opening song was "Chant 13th Hour" from the ''Potlatch'' album.

Redbone's music was characterized by the [[Leslie speaker|Leslie rotating speaker]] effect that Lolly Vegas used for his [[electric guitar]] [[Guitar amplifier|amplifier]] and a "King Kong" style of drumming developed by drummer [[Peter DePoe]].

The first self-titled album by Redbone was released as a [[double album]] in [[North America]]. In Europe it was released both as a double (EPC 67242) and as a single album (BN 26280) on the Epic label.

Their third album, ''[[Message from a Drum]]'', was released in Europe (except Spain) with the title ''The Witch Queen of New Orleans'' and different cover than the one released in the U.S. and Canada.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Redbone1971 b.png|thumb|left|Pat Vegas, 1971]] -->In 1973, Redbone released the politically oriented "We Were All Wounded at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]]", recalling the massacre of [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] Indians by the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] in 1890. The song ends with the subtly altered sentence "We were all wounded 'by' Wounded Knee".  It charted in several European countries and reached the No. 1 position in The [[Netherlands]] but did not [[record chart|chart]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] where it was initially withheld from release due to lyrical controversy and then banned by several radio stations due to its confrontation of a sore subject.<ref name="Musician Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004043/Redbone.html|title=Redbone Biography|publisher=Musician Guide|year=2009|access-date=2009-01-19}}</ref> DePoe had left this band in 1972. He was replaced by Arturo Perez (1939-  ), but later by Bellamy's [[Filipino people|Filipino]]-Chicano cousin, Butch Rillera around that point. Following this the band achieved much of their commercial success. Tony Bellamy (guitar, piano and vocals) left the band in 1977, with Rillera leaving shortly after.<ref name="Musician Guide"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://20gp.ovh.net/~redbone/history3.html |title=Redbone-History |publisher=20gp.ovh.net |access-date=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227095518/http://20gp.ovh.net/~redbone/history3.html |archive-date=2012-02-27 }}</ref>

The band's current remaining membership is led by Pat Vegas, although an array of new members have joined Redbone since then due to Lolly Vegas suffering a [[stroke]] that left him unable to tour with the band. No member has been official other than Pat Vegas after the original members were not present. A proposed reunion tour in 2003 did not occur. There is evidence that suggests the existence of an "imposter band" (one of many who try to gain recognition) who was illegally touring the United States and posing as Redbone under the name (or alias) "Denny Freeman". Freeman - who Pat Vegas confirmed to be unaffiliated with Redbone in an interview with the ''[[Montana Standard]]'' - defrauded the county fair board of the Butte Silver-Bow County Fair in [[Butte, Montana]], under pretenses of being a co-founding member of Redbone, yet he was never a band member.<ref name="Emeigh1">{{Cite news |title=Fake band scams fair |url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/fake-band-scams-fair/article_a7397955-0e43-58ed-b7a8-03b6e73f0d87.html |first=John Grant |last=Emeigh |newspaper=[[The Montana Standard]] |date=2006-08-11 |publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]] |location=Butte, MT |access-date=2014-03-08}}</ref><ref name="Emeigh2">{{Cite news |title=Musician says he'll pay back 'every dime' |url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/musician-says-he-ll-pay-back-every-dime/article_15dd7537-5530-545f-a39b-a4900130b93e.html |first=John Grant |last=Emeigh |newspaper=[[The Montana Standard]] |date=2006-08-16 |publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]] |location=Butte, MT |access-date=2014-03-08}}</ref>

Pat Vegas continues to tour in the United States and Canada in support of his solo albums, ''Ambergris'', ''Peacepipe'', ''Speed of Sound'', and "Buffalo Bluz". He also is part of a touring version of Redbone that plays both his solo efforts and the hits from the band's heyday.
