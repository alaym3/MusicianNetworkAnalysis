==Reception==
Complimenting the "irresistibly catchy" hook and fingersnap heavy instrumental, Alphonse Pierre of ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]'' said the song "seems inspired by San Bernardino, California rapper Whoheem's experiences hitting on girls in their Instagram DMs and it sounds as if it was written at his local mall's food court".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/whoheem-lets-link-new-song-listen/amp/|title=The Ones: Whoheem's "Lets Link"|work=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]|last=Pierre|first=Alphonse|date=August 28, 2020|accessdate=September 8, 2020}}</ref>
