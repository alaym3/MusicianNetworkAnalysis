==History==
Dilated Peoples began when [[DJ Babu]] (from the DJ crew [[Beat Junkies]]), [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]], and [[Rakaa]] joined together in 1992 and released "Third Degree" (1997) on ABB Records, developing their material in the underground hip hop community. They had previously recorded an album titled ''Imagery, Battle Hymns & Political Poetry'' (1995) that was never released, although many fans still have it on bootlegged tapes. The group eventually signed with [[Capitol Records]]<ref>''CMJ New Music Monthly'', June 2000, no. 88, p.32</ref> and released ''[[The Platform (album)|The Platform]]'' (2000).

The second album, ''[[Expansion Team (album)|Expansion Team]]'', was released in 2001<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122060052/http://www.chartattack.com/DAMN/2001/10/3001.cfm "CD REVIEWS: Baby Blue Soundcrew, Lenny Kravitz, Matthew Good Band and many more"]. ''Chart Attack'', October 30, 2001, Debbie Bento</ref> led by [[The Alchemist (musician)|the Alchemist]]–produced "Worst Comes to Worst," which utilized a vocal sample from [[Mobb Deep]]'s "Survival of the Fittest" and a musical sample from [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]]'s "I Forgot to be Your Lover". ''Expansion Team'' debuted at number 8 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B Albums]] [[record chart|chart]] and number 36 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4618780-1.html ''Dilated Peoples To Headline 'scratch Tour'', Allbusiness.com]</ref> The group's third album, ''[[Neighborhood Watch (album)|Neighborhood Watch]]'', was released in 2004 and debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200, selling 143,000 copies in the United States.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/news/dilated-peoples-back-again-with-new-album-1001881107.story#/news/dilated-peoples-back-again-with-new-album-1001881107 ''Dilated Peoples 'Back Again' With New Album'', Billboard]</ref> In addition to the Kanye West produced single, "This Way," it featured the singles "Who's Who?" and "Sorry? OK", which were also included as tracks on the ''[[Need for Speed: Underground]]'' and ''[[SSX 3]]'' soundtracks, and peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The fourth album, ''[[20/20 (Dilated Peoples album)|20/20]]'', was released in 2006; the debut single, "Back Again", was featured on the ''[[Fight Night Round 3]]'' soundtrack. This is the third [[EA Games]] soundtrack on which the group has been featured. "Back Again" is also featured on Sony's ''[[MLB 06: The Show]]''. In 2012, they collaborated with [[PlatinumGames]] to record the track "This is Madness" for the credits of the beat-'em-up video game, ''[[Anarchy Reigns]]''. [[20/20 (Dilated Peoples album)|20/20]] was the group's "farewell" album on [[Capitol Records]], ending a four album [[recording contract]]. They also work with the underground hip hop group, Global Warning, who originated in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]].

Dilated Peoples are affiliated with fellow West Coast hip hop group [[tha Alkaholiks]]. The Liks appeared on ''The Platform'' on the track "Right On" and ''Expansion Team'' on "Heavy Rotation." The group also collaborated frequently with west coast emcees Defari and Amad Jamal (an Urban Umpires member) and helped to launch their careers.  Defari made one appearance on each Dilated Peoples' album: "Ear Drums Pop (Remix)" on ''The Platform''; "Defari Interlude" on ''Expansion Team''; "Closed Session" on ''Neighborhood Watch''; and "Olde English" on ''20/20''.  Dilated Peoples also made multiple appearances on Defari's album ''Odds & Evens''.  Another Dilated associate is their long-time producer, the Alchemist, who produced five songs on ''The Platform'', three songs on ''Expansion Team'', four songs on ''Neighborhood Watch'', and two songs on ''20/20''.  Dilated Peoples were featured on a song on the Alchemists' ''[[1st Infantry (album)|1st Infantry]]'' album. Rakaa has also made guest appearances on the songs "Trance Fat" on [[Looptroop]]'s album, ''Good Things'', "Zet 't Blauw" from [[Dutch people|Dutch]] rapper Jerome XL's album, ''De laatste dag'' and "Memory Fades" on St. Cule's album, ''American Beef''.
