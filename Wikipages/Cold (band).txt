'''Cold''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], formed in 1986 by lead singer and rhythm guitarist [[Scooter Ward]], drummer [[Sam McCandless]], bassist Jeremy Marshall and lead guitarist [[Matt Loughran]]. The band has since gone through numerous lineup changes leaving Ward and McCandless as the remaining original members of the band. Cold has recorded six studio albums: ''[[Cold (Cold album)|Cold]]'' (1998), ''[[13 Ways to Bleed on Stage]]'' (2000), ''[[Year of the Spider]]'' (2003), ''[[A Different Kind of Pain]]'' (2005), ''[[Superfiction (album)|Superfiction]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Things We Can't Stop]]'' (2019). Within two [[Music recording sales certification|gold-albums]], Cold has sold over one million records in the US alone. On November 17, 2006, it was announced on [[Myspace]] that, after a period of uncertainty since that February, the group had decided to disband. In July 2008, it was announced that the original line-up would reunite for a tour in early 2009. This became permanent and the band released their fifth studio album ''[[Superfiction (album)|Superfiction]]'' on July 19, 2011. The band released their sixth studio album ''[[The Things We Can't Stop]]'' on September 13, 2019.

==History==

===Early history (1986–2000) ===
Cold, who at the time were called '''Grundig''', formed in 1986 with the line-up of Scooter Ward (vocals, rhythm guitar), Sam McCandless (drums), Jeremy Marshall (bass) and Matt Loughran (lead guitar) at [[Duncan U. Fletcher High School|Fletcher High School]] in [[Neptune Beach]], Florida. The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band released an 8-song EP called "Into Everything" Initially based in Jacksonville, they moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] hoping to get a break in the industry. During this time, Matt Loughran left the band and was replaced by Sean Lay, who also left the group. Kelly Hayes then joined the band, and they all later returned to Florida. Three and a half years later in 1995, Grundig broke up and Ward moved back to Jacksonville, where he, McCandless, Kelly Hayes, and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo. Diablo would only last about 3 months. At the end of that three-month period, Grundig reformed under the name Cold in 1996.

Following Cold's progress in the Jacksonville scene was local [[Fred Durst]]. Impressed by what he had heard, he invited Ward to record two acoustic tracks, "Check Please" and "Ugly." The two demos were passed on to producer [[Ross Robinson]], who was also impressed by what he had heard, leading the recently renamed Cold to record their debut album titled ''[[Cold (Cold album)|Cold]]'' in 1997. It was released by the major label [[A&M Records]] in 1998, which folded a year later after being merged into [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]].

That same year, the band released the ''[[Oddity EP]]''. Its cover photo, taken by the wife of McCandless, depicts their pet [[tarantula]] named Wednesday, crawling on the face of her doll. The band sought a signature element that fans could remember them by, and Wednesday served as the inspiration; McCandless gave a particularly favorable image of a spider to a friend and [[tattoo artist]] who transformed it into what would become Cold's official logo. The drummer would later note, "Our music kind of creeps along like a spider."<ref name="McCandlessInterview">Jablonski, Rachel [http://www.streamofconsciousness.net/interviews/COLD.htm Interview with Sam McCandless] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180826/http://www.streamofconsciousness.net/interviews/COLD.htm |date=2011-10-03 }} Stream of Consciousness (March 12, 2003).

===''13 Ways to Bleed on Stage'' (2000–2002) ===
Geffen financed their second album titled ''[[13 Ways to Bleed on Stage]]'', which was released on [[September 12]], [[2000 in music|2000]]. In 1999 before recording the album, the group recruited local guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]], who briefly played for [[Limp Bizkit]]. With the new guitar addition Ward was now able to focus more on singing and interacting with the crowd.<ref name=":0">''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed., s.v. "Cold."  ''Oxford Music Online''. Oxford University Press. (N.D.).</ref> ''13 Ways to Bleed on Stage'' proved to be Cold's breakthrough album with successful singles in "End of the World" and "No One" frequently played on hard rock radio, with "No One" hitting No. 17 on Mainstream Rock Tracks and No. 13 on Modern Rock Tracks, and the music video being put in heavy rotation on MTV2.<ref name=":1">Hay, Carla. "Flip/Geffen's Cold Finally Getting Hot, with Hit Rock Single, Video."''Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment'' 113, no. 25 (Jun 23, 2001): 12.</ref> The album included guest singer [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] from [[Staind]] on the songs "Send in the Clowns" and "Bleed" and singer [[Sierra Swan]] from [[Dollshead]] on "No One" and "Witch".<ref name=":0" /> The song "Just Got Wicked" was also a surprise hit, being featured in the soundtrack to the game [[Jet Grind Radio]] and hitting No. 25 on Mainstream Rock tracks, which aided in the band's popularity.<ref name=":1" />

In April 2002, the band released "[[WWE Tough Enough 2|Gone Away]], "a surprisingly moody [[ballad]]. The song first appeared on the ''[[WWF Tough Enough (album)|WWF Tough Enough]]'' album and had a successful music video.

===''Year of the Spider'' (2002–2004)===
With the success of ''13 Ways to Bleed on Stage'', Geffen financed their third major album titled ''[[Year of the Spider]]'', which was released on [[May 13]], [[2003 in music|2003]] (It was slated to release in October 2002, but was pushed back). The album has been to date the band's most commercially successful album, debuting at No.&nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Album charts]], with over 101,000 copies of the album sold in its first week of release.[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p277205|pure_url=no}}] The album's first single, "Stupid Girl," has been the only Cold single to crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No.&nbsp;87.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=p277205 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Cold |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref> Following the release of the album's second single "Suffocate" to radio stations, plans were set-forth for a video to accompany the song. However, a music video was not made due to Geffen not giving approval. The stalemate with the label led to frustrations within the band, and in January 2004 Terry Balsamo departed, replacing [[Ben Moody]] in [[Evanescence]]. Balsamo was later replaced by ex-Darwin's Waiting Room guitarist Eddie Randini, the following month.

In April 2004, guitarist Kelly Hayes quit the band as well. A week later, Hayes officially confirmed his position as the guitarist in the Jacksonville [[hard rock]] outfit Allele, a move that had been in the works from the time Terry Balsamo left the band. The band made efforts to release another single, "Wasted Years" from ''Year of the Spider''. However, Geffen continued to not support the album any further.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Subsequently, in mid-2004 the band asked to be released from the Geffen label. Around this time, Cold recorded the soundtrack for the video game ''[[Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy]]'' featuring the songs "With My Mind",<ref>Traiman, Steve. "Retail: Cold's Hot Game - Geffen, Midway Connect Band, 'PSI-Ops'."''Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment'' 116, no. 24 (Jun 12, 2004): 45.</ref> "Came All the Way" a b-side from Year of the Spider, "Just Got Wicked (Chris Vrenna Remix)", and "Go Away (Chris Vrenna Eye Socket Remix)" and embarked on a short tour with [[Sevendust]] in support of "With My Mind", the single released from the CD. They also performed at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] to promote the game; however, the song was never released on any of their albums.

===''A Different Kind of Pain'' (2004–2006)===
By September 2004, the band had added former member [[Matt Loughran]] and was signed by [[Atlantic Records]] ([[Lava Records]] division), where they set about recording a new album. The album was to be produced by Elvis Baskette and slated to be released in December 2004. However, Cold suffered another blow with Eddie Rendini leaving the band on November 14, 2004. The new album was scheduled to be released in spring of 2005. Before releasing the album, Cold went back in the studio to record several more tracks. The album was originally to be titled ''And a Sad Song Lives On'' but was later changed to ''The Calm that Killed the Storm'', and the release date was moved to September 13, 2005.

In June 2005, the band's official website noted yet another change to the new album's title, changing it to ''[[A Different Kind of Pain]]''. "Happens All the Time" was the first single and video released. Just prior to shooting the video, the band added Las Vegas guitarist Mike Booth to the band.  He would appear in the video and tour with them for a few months, being replaced later that fall by Florida-native Zac Gilbert. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;26 on the Billboard Albums charts with more than 36,000 copies sold.  ''A Different Kind of Pain'' was the beginning of a significant departure from the more radio-friendly [[alternative metal]] sound that was featured in the prior two albums.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Loftus|first1=Johnny|title=Cold - A Different Kind of Pain|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-different-kind-of-pain-mw0000312978|access-date=23 August 2014}}</ref> The title track was released as the second single, but Atlantic did not fund another video. The majority of ''A Different Kind of Pain'' was written in Ward's sister's bedroom while she had a long battle with [[cancer]], and is said to have been the root of the subject matter on the album.<ref>Titus, Christa L. "A Different Kind of Pain." ''Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment'' 117, no. 36 (Sep 03, 2005): 83.</ref>  Other subjects include the end of his relationship to his fiancée/mother of his daughter, and the physical abuse of a 14-year-old girl by her own father, and also had an alcoholic mother (a theme echoed from each of the three previous albums). The album has sold over 160,000 copies in the US.

On November 17, 2006, a MySpace post announced that Cold had decided to disband permanently. Ward announced that he and McCandless had started a side-project called The Witch, later known as When November Falls and now known as [[The Killer and the Star]]. Shortly after forming, McCandless left the project.

===Reunion, ''Superfiction'' (2008–2012)===
On July 25, 2008, a blog written by Ward on The Killer and the Star's MySpace confirmed both a b-sides/rarities release and a new Cold album featuring the original line-up, due Fall 2009.

In January 2009 Cold officially announced the first dates of its reunion tour on the band's MySpace page. When the page was originally updated, the lineup consisted of Scooter Ward, Sam McCandless, Jeremy Marshall, Kelly Hayes and Terry Balsamo. Hayes was replaced by Joe Bennett, who parted ways with Cold in July 2009 and has been replaced by former Cold guitarist Zac Gilbert. Terry Balsamo was briefly replaced by Michael Harris of [[Idiot Pilot]], who also played bass in The Killer and the Star. After the first tour in the spring, the band went out on the road again later that summer.

Cold confirmed on their site that the album had a release in mid-July 2011.<ref>[http://www.bleedingcoldness.com/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826154632/http://www.bleedingcoldness.com/ |date=August 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=2781922&blogId=538156498 |title=New Album Update van Cold op Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2010-08-12 |access-date=2011-07-17 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711022858/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=2781922&blogId=538156498 |archive-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although initially dubbed the "final album," Ward has said on "Alternative Addiction" that Cold will continue to record and tour after the 5th album comes out.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  The first official single from ''Superfiction'' was "Wicked World".

''[[Superfiction (album)|Superfiction]]'' was released on July 18, 2011 through [[Eleven Seven Music|Eleven Seven]] and debuted at No.&nbsp;37 on the Billboard 200 with 11,317 copies sold.  The band had mentioned while touring that they would be including a live version of their song "Snowblind" as a hidden track on the new album, though many fans who have purchased the album noticed that there was no hidden track at all. "Snowblind" was released 8 years later, as a track on their sixth album, The Things That We Can't Stop. The second single from the album, "American Dream", was released on January 1, 2012. The music video for it was released through Eleven Seven official YouTube channel two weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6Gd-sBPAzU|title=COLD - American Dream (Official Music Video)|date=13 January 2012|work=YouTube|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref>

===''COLD:LIVE'' and departure of Jeremy Marshall (2012–2016)===
In November 2012, Scooter Ward revealed via Facebook that Cold was going to record an acoustic album of fan favorites from the first four albums, b-sides, rarities and four new songs in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/coldofficial/posts/10151532614899466|title=Cold - Cold Army Update!

The campaign ended with 167% of the goal raised. On February 28, Cold played their first gig in almost three years in Central Florida Fair with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/coldofficial/posts/1462817347263475|title=Cold - Cold will be playing a show at end of month!
