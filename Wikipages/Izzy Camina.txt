Either way; plucky, bright-eyed, and very single me was not prepared for this new phenomenon of softboyism I would shortly encounter upon moving to East London. Alarmed by their numbers, I realized that this alluring faction would probably end up occupying a great deal of my headspace. I was right, and the resulting fallout is tenderly embodied by this fond ode… A heartfelt dedication.”

She cites Jersey club, UK garage, experimental electronic, synth wave, post punk, and pop as genre influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fredperry.com/us/subculture/playlist-profile-izzy-camina|title=Playlists and interviews exploring British subculture: Izzy Camina|website=www.fredperry.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> In 2020, she described her music as “Cyberpunk Britney Spears”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.londoninstereo.com/izzy-camina-in-short/|title=Izzy Camina // In Short {{!}} LONDON IN STEREO|last=Stereo|first=London In|date=2020-03-06|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>
