==Early life==
Born in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Havens was the oldest of nine children.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> He was of Native American ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfoot]]) descent on his father's side and of the [[British West Indies]] on his mother's.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/04/25/folk-singer-richie-havens-blackfeet-walks-149014 |title=Folk Singer Richie Havens, Blackfeet, Walks On |website=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |date=April 25, 2013 |access-date=April 29, 2013 |archive-date=April 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428213418/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/04/25/folk-singer-richie-havens-blackfeet-walks-149014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His grandfather was Blackfoot of the [[Montana]]/[[South Dakota]] area.

As a youth, Havens began organizing his neighborhood friends into a street corner [[doo-wop]] group. At age 16, he was performing with the McCrea Gospel Singers.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==Career==
===Early career===
At age 20, Havens left his hometown Brooklyn, seeking artistic stimulation in [[Greenwich Village]] in [[Manhattan]]. "I saw the Village as a place to escape to, in order to express yourself," he recalled. "I had first gone there during the [[beatnik]] days of the 1950s to perform poetry, then I drew portraits for two years and stayed up all night listening to folk music in the clubs. It took a while before I thought of picking up a guitar."<ref name="carnegie hall">{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2010/2/19/0830/PM/Richie-Havens/ |title= Richie Havens |website=CarnegieHall.org |publisher=Carnegie Hall Corporation |access-date=2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160807100928/http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2010/2/19/0830/PM/Richie-Havens/ |archive-date=August 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Havens's solo performances quickly spread beyond the Village folk music circles.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> After cutting two records for [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Douglas Records]], he signed on with [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager, [[Albert Grossman]], and landed a record deal with the [[Verve Records|Verve Folkways (later Verve Forecast)]] label. Verve released ''[[Mixed Bag]]'' in late 1966, which featured tracks such as "Handsome Johnny" (co-written by Havens and actor [[Louis Gossett Jr.]]), "Follow", and a cover<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://theimmortaljukebox.com/2016/03/09/richie-havens-roots-freedom-bob-dylan-the-beatles/|title=Richie Havens: Roots, Freedom, Bob Dylan & The Beatles!|first=Thom|last=Hickey|website=Theimmortaljukebox.com|date=March 9, 2016}}</ref> of Bob Dylan's "[[Just Like a Woman]]".<ref>{{cite web| first= Jim |last= Newsome| url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r40081|pure_url=yes}} |title= Mixed Bag: Review| work= [[AllMusic]].com}}</ref> Havens released his first single, "No Opportunity Necessary", in 1967.

''[[Something Else Again]]'' (1968) became his first album to hit the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], and it pulled ''Mixed Bag'' back onto the charts. By 1969 he had released five albums. Two of those albums were unauthorized "exploitation albums" released by Douglas Records (or Douglas International<ref name=verve>{{cite web |title = Richie Havens |website= Verve Records |access-date = April 22, 2013 |url= http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/richiehavens |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160809210057/http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/richiehavens |archive-date = August 9, 2016 |df = mdy-all}}</ref>):  ''Electric Havens'' (released June 1, 1968)<ref name=verve /><ref name=rhmusic>{{cite web| title = Music| website = RichieHavens.com| access-date =April 22, 2003| url = http://www.richiehavens.com/official_site/music.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Richie Havens: Electric Havens| website = MTV.com | access-date =April 22, 2013| url = http://www.mtv.com/artists/richie-havens/discography/391073/}}</ref> and ''Richie Havens Record'' (1969).<ref name=rhmusic /><ref>{{cite web| title = Richie Havens: Electric Havens| website = AllMusic.com| access-date =April 22, 2013

===Woodstock and rise in fame===
[[File:Woodstock redmond havens.JPG|thumbnail|left|Havens, playing at Woodstock Music Festival 1969]]
Havens' live performances earned widespread notice. His [[Woodstock]] appearance in 1969 catapulted him into stardom and was a major turning point in his career.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Despite Havens' recollection that he performed for nearly three hours, the actual recording and setlist reflect that he played about fifty minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wimwords.com/2019/08/09/from-the-stacks-woodstock-back-to-the-garden-the-definitive-50th-anniversary-archive/|title=From The Stacks: 'Woodstock – Back To The Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive'|first=James|last=Stafford |website= Wimwords.com|date=August 9, 2019|access-date=November 10, 2020}}</ref> Havens recalled that he was told to continue playing because many artists scheduled to perform after him were delayed in reaching the festival location with highways at a virtual standstill.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/04/23/opinion/havens-his-own-words/index.html|title=On Woodstock: Richie Havens in his own words| first= Richie |last= Havens |website= CNN.com |access-date=November 10, 2020}}</ref> Havens recalled being called back for several encores.<ref name="auto"/> At the end of his set, Havens improvised a song based on the old spiritual "[[Motherless Child]]" that became "Freedom". In an interview with Cliff Smith, for Music-Room, he explained:

<blockquote>I'd already played every song I knew and I was stalling, asking for more guitar and mic, trying to think of something else to play – and then it just came to me ... The establishment was foolish enough to give us all this freedom and we used it in every way we could.</blockquote>

The subsequent Woodstock movie release helped Havens reach a worldwide audience.  He also appeared two weeks later at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]], in late August 1969.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| author-link = John Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= [[Reed International Books Ltd]] | location= London

[[File:Richie Havens 1972 Hamburg.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Havens performing in [[Hamburg]], Germany, May 1972]]

Following the success of his Woodstock performance, Havens started his own record label, Stormy Forest, and released ''[[Stonehenge (Richie Havens album)|Stonehenge]]'' in 1970. Later that year came ''Alarm Clock'', which included the [[George Harrison]]–penned hit single, "[[Here Comes the Sun]]". This was Havens's first album to reach ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top 30 Chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Stormy Forest went on to release four more of his albums: ''The Great Blind Degree'' (1971), ''Live On Stage'' (1972), ''Portfolio'' (1973), and ''Mixed Bag II'' (1974).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Memorable television appearances included performances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. On the latter program, the audience reacted with such enthusiasm that, when the applause continued even after the commercial break, [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] asked Havens to return the following night.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=This appears to be unverified.}}

Havens also began acting during the 1970s. He was featured in the original 1972 stage presentation of ''[[The Who's Tommy]]'',<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years" />{{rp|244}} as Othello in the 1974 film ''[[Catch My Soul]]'', in ''[[Greased Lightning]]'' alongside [[Richard Pryor]], and in Bob Dylan's ''[[Hearts of Fire]]''.

Havens increasingly devoted his energies to educating young people about ecological issues. In the mid-1970s, he co-founded the Northwind Undersea Institute, an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] children's museum on [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City. That, in turn, led to the creation of the Natural Guard, an organization Havens described as "...a way of helping kids learn that they can have a hands-on role in affecting the environment. Children study the land, water, and air in their own communities and see how they can make positive changes from something as simple as planting a garden in an abandoned lot."<ref name=bio01>{{cite web| url= http://www.richiehavens.com/official_site/RH_bio_2008.pdf |title= Richie Havens Biography | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229030409/http://www.richiehavens.com/official_site/RH_bio_2008.pdf |archive-date= December 29, 2010 | website= RichieHavens.com| year= 2008| access-date= April 22, 2013}}</ref>

In July 1978, he was a featured performer at the Benefit Concert for [[The Longest Walk]], an American Indian spiritual walk from [[Alcatraz]] to Washington, D.C. affirming treaty rights, as a result of legislation that had been introduced to abrogate Indian treaties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/photos/longest-walk|title=The Longest Walk |website= si.edu| publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution]]| date= June 22, 2011| access-date= January 4, 2021}}</ref>

===Branching into other media===
