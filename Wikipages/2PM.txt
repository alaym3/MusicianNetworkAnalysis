'''2PM''' ({{Korean|투피엠}}) is a South Korean [[boy band]] formed by [[JYP Entertainment]]. The group is composed of six members: [[Jun. K]] (formerly known as Junsu), [[Nichkhun]], [[Ok Taec-yeon|Taecyeon]], [[Jang Wooyoung|Wooyoung]], [[Lee Jun-ho (singer)|Junho]] and [[Hwang Chan-sung|Chansung]]. Originally a seven-piece group, former member and leader [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]] temporarily left the group due to controversies that stemmed from his posts in MySpace in 2009 before being announced to have left both the band and the agency in early 2010.

The history of 2PM started when Korean musician [[Park Jin-young]] formed an eleven-member band known as [[One Day (South Korean band)|One Day]] through the documentary series ''Hot Blood Men''. Eventually, the band was split into the hip hop group 2PM and a similar but independent group known as [[2AM (band)|2AM]]. 2PM debuted with the song "[[10 Out of 10]]" ({{lang|ko|10점 만점에 10점}}, lit. "10 Points Out of 10 Points"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles.<ref name="2PM on CNB News">{{cite web|url=http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |title=관객과 함께 호흡하는 '퍼포먼스 보이그룹'2PM |date=September 28, 2008 |publisher=CNB News |access-date=May 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612153238/http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |archive-date=June 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |language=ko }}</ref> They then achieved their first number 1 single with "Again & Again". Both singles were featured on their first studio album, ''[[01:59PM]]'', which was released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as [[Hands Up (album)|''Hands Up'']], in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with ''[[Republic of 2PM]]''. After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album ''[[Grown (album)|Grown]]''. In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album ''[[Go Crazy (album)|Go Crazy]]''. On June 15, 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album ''[[No.5 (2PM album)|No.5]]''. After much anticipation, 2PM returned on September 13, 2016 with their sixth studio album ''[[Gentlemen's Game]]''.

Following touring for ''Gentlemen's Game'', the group took an official hiatus in July 2017 due to [[Conscription in South Korea|mandatory military service]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kstarlive.com/Despite-His-Group-Being-in-Hiatus-Right-Now--2PM-s-Nichkhun-Touches-HOTTESTs--Hearts-with-His-Gestures-as-a-Member-6010415|title=Despite His Group Being in Hiatus Right Now, 2PM's Nichkhun Touches HOTTESTs' Hearts with His Gestures as a Member|last=KStarLive|website=KStarLive|access-date=August 5, 2019}}</ref> Following the members' discharge, 2PM returned with their seventh studio album ''[[Must (album)|Must]]'' in June 2021.

Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including [[Jun. K]], who had won several singing competitions. [[Taecyeon|Ok Taecyeon]], [[Lee Jun-ho (singer)|Lee Junho]] and [[Hwang Chansung]] had participated in the show ''SuperStar Survival''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq1bHqKAkaU|title=[PREDEBUT] 060318 Superstar Survival Ep. 01|last=Secret Four Youtube|date=October 8, 2013|access-date=September 26, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> Some of the members had previously lived in the United States: former leader [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]] in the [[Seattle]] area, [[Nichkhun]] in [[Southern California]], while Taecyeon spent seven years in [[Massachusetts]] before returning to Korea.

Originally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as [[One Day (South Korean band)|One Day]]. A documentary called ''Hot Blood Men''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iamkoream.com/cover-story-2pm/ |title=Cover Story - 2AM|access-date=January 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205025918/http://iamkoream.com/cover-story-2pm/ |archive-date= February 5, 2011 }}</ref> captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]] finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, [[Jeong Jinwoon]], and [[Yoon Doo-joon]] were all cut. However, Jinwoon replaced Im Daehun upon the latter's withdrawal. By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. The band was then split into four-member ballad group [[2AM (band)|2AM]] and seven-member hip-hop group 2PM.

A controversy regarding Jaebeom emerged when on September 4, 2009, articles surfaced on the internet regarding his posts from 2005 made on his personal [[Myspace]] account, in which he expressed his dislike for Korea while he was still a trainee for [[JYP Entertainment]].

The show ran from July 21 until September 1, 2009, with seven episodes aired. The airing of the final episode, which coincidentally featured the members engaged in a "Leader Olympics" game to select a new leader, was postponed indefinitely due to [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]]'s internet controversy and his subsequent departure from the group.<ref>{{cite web|title=2PM's Jaebeom disgraced Korea; program delayed indefinitely|url=http://korea.sohu.com/20090909/n266586682.shtml|publisher=Sohu|date=September 11, 2009|access-date=October 1, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091113033815/http://korea.sohu.com/20090909/n266586682.shtml| archive-date= November 13, 2009 | url-status= live|language=zh}}</ref>
