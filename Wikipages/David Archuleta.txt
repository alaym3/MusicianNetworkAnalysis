During the 1970s themed week Archuleta sang the [[John Lennon]] song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", omitting the earlier verses in favor of the last one. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist [[Ann Powers]] speculated that he wanted to avoid singing "no religion too" because of his faith. "As a [[Mormon]], he's unlikely to espouse the song's [[agnostic]] ideal," she wrote.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Powers|title=David Archuleta's 'Imagine' wasn't just imagined up|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/02/idol-banter-ima.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 28, 2008|access-date=April 30, 2008}}</ref>

However, he did sing the entire song on "Good Things Utah" when he was 13. Asked by judge [[Randy Jackson]] why he did not sing the first verse, Archuleta said the third verse was his favorite because it has "a great message".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Top 20, 1970s theme week | series = American Idol | series-link = American Idol (season 7) | air-date = February 25, 2008 | season = 7 | number = February 25, 2008}}</ref>
