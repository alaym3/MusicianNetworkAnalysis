Malone commented on the mixtape on his website: <blockquote>I called this mixtape "Lost In Meanwhile City" because I stumbled across a film called [[Franklyn]] — I felt like I could relate to the dark atmosphere at the time and also some of the featured characters faced similar problems I felt I was faced with i.e family problems, girl problems, law suits, depression. I felt 'Lost In Meanwhile City' was the perfect metaphor for my position in life at that particular time, I felt lost and basically in a world of my own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebugzymaloneshow.co.uk/lost-in-meanwhile-city/|title=Lost In Meanwhile City {{!}} The Bugzy Malone Show.co.uk|website=The Bugzy Malone Show.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The lead single for the project and the second music video created by Malone was released on 23 August 2012.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bugzy Malone|title=Bugzy Malone ~ Nightmares (OFFICIAL VIDEO)|date=2012-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg5oZicsbxk|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> In 2014, Malone announced his fourth mixtape, ''Journal of an Evil Genius,'' and begun a "mixtape campaign" where he released music videos with narratives that coincided with the singles released from the mixtape, similar to a "visual album".<ref name="RM">{{Cite news|url=http://respect-mag.com/2014/02/interview-bugzy-malone-a-voice-from-the-underground/|title=Interview: Bugzy Malone, A Voice From The Underground {{!}} RESPECT.|date=2014-02-14|work=RESPECT.|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> The visuals were released in the form of a YouTube video every Monday at 19:00 for six weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wjlondon.com/interview-5-bugzy-malone/|title=Interview: A quickie with...

Talking about the mixtape, Davis wrote on his website. <blockquote>I called this mixtape 'The Journal of an Evil Genius' mainly because that is what it is. The songs themselves are written in a journal-like style making this record the one that means the most to me. The "Evil Genius" is an alias I came up with one day in the studio and it just kind of stuck. This project is an Intricate/accurate story about my past all the way back to childhood going right the way up to the present giving it a journal-like feel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebugzymaloneshow.co.uk/the-journal-of-an-evil-genius/|title=The Journal Of An Evil Genius {{!}} The Bugzy Malone Show.co.uk|website=The Bugzy Malone Show.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref></blockquote>
