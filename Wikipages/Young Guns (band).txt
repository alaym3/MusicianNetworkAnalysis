== Musical style and influences ==
The band has often been described as a general [[rock music|rock]] band that arose with the rest of the wave of [[British people|British]] rock bands, but have also been labeled as "melodic rock"<ref name="BBC Bones review">{{cite web|title=London-based prospects return with an energetic second album.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/z6gw|publisher=BBC|access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref><ref name="Drowned In Sound Bones review">{{cite web|last1=Yau|first1=Alex|title=Young Guns Bones|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16790/reviews/4144428|work=Drowned In Sound|date=3 February 2012|access-date=30 June 2014|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141902/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16790/reviews/4144428|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[hard rock]].<ref name="Alterthepress"/><ref name="Sputnik Music Bones review">{{cite web|last1=Boy|first1=Davey|title=Young Guns Bones|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/47970/Young-Guns-Bones/|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref>

Wood reflected on the labels given to the band over time in 2013, stating:
<blockquote> When we started the band...We’d play with like tech metal bands or pop punk bands and be stuck on all of these different bills and we just never seemed to find a group of bands that we sonically worked with...So, people were always putting labels on us and we were kind of surprised by all of this, because as far as we’re concerned, we’re just a rock band. We’re just a five piece rock band. We write melodic rock songs, it’s not like we are re-inventing the wheel. People have always struggled to kind of pigeon hole us I think. That seems to still be continuing. We’ve had a degree of connection at Active Rock radio and that’s amazing, but I don’t consider us an Active Rock band. I just consider us a rock band. I’m happy to be at the forefront of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] if that’s what people say, but I don’t consider us a [[heavy metal music|metal]] band. I don’t really even want us to be limited to being a British band. I just want us to be a band, but whatever anyone else wants to call us is fine by me.<ref name="USInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.unsungmelody.com/interviews/i-can-feel-it-in-my-bones-an-interview-with-gustav-wood-from-young-guns/|title=I can feel it in my bones.

Wood commented on the band's approach to music and sound again in 2016, stating:
<blockquote> I think we play a relatively American minded style of music but I think we’re British and that seems to do something to it that makes people think this is different...I think also that at the moment the world has so many labels, [[pop punk]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], metal. The fact that we’re just a rock band seems to help us stand apart. Especially at a festival like this with pop punk and [[ska]] bands there aren’t as many of us around...We’re almost different by just not aligning ourselves.<ref name="ADI1">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirectinterviews.com/rock/young-guns-gustav-wood-echoes-interview|title=Young Guns Talk "Echoes"|first=Adriana|last=Roda-Stuart|work=ARTISTdirect|date=25 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111084012/http://www.artistdirectinterviews.com/rock/young-guns-gustav-wood-echoes-interview|archive-date=11 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>
