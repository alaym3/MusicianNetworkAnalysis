'''Testament''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from [[Berkeley, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=103433 |title=Decibel Magazine: Testament – The Legacy |publisher=[[Decibel magazine]] |date=2010-03-07 |access-date=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921093123/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=103433 |archive-date=September 21, 2010 }}</ref> Formed in 1983 under the name '''Legacy''', the band's current lineup comprises guitarists [[Eric Peterson (musician)|Eric Peterson]] and [[Alex Skolnick]], lead vocalist [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]], drummer [[Gene Hoglan]], and bassist [[Steve Di Giorgio]]. Testament has experienced many lineup changes over the years, with Peterson being the only remaining original member, though they have since been rejoined by one of its songwriters Skolnick, who was out of the band from 1992 to 2005. Billy replaced original singer [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]] (who left the band to join [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] as the replacement of [[Paul Baloff]]) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, ''[[The Legacy (album)|The Legacy]]'', and has been a member of the band since. He and Peterson are the only members to appear on all of Testament's studio albums, with the latter being the only constant member overall.

The band achieved mainstream popularity with its third album ''[[Practice What You Preach]]'' (1989), which was Testament's first album to climb up the Top 100 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name="Billboard.com">{{cite web|title=Testament – Chart history|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Testament/chart-history/TLP|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> A string of more successful albums were released during the early-to-mid-1990s, including ''[[Souls of Black]]'' (1990), ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' (1992) and ''[[Low (Testament album)|Low]]'' (1994), with the first two also entering the Top 100 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.{{r|Billboard.com}} After Atlantic dropped the band in 1995, Testament (who had at this point had begun to experiment with a [[death metal]]-influenced sound) continued to record and perform until their temporary hiatus in 2001, when Billy was diagnosed with cancer.

Since Skolnick's return to the band, Testament has experienced a  resurgence of popularity, with two of their studio albums—''[[Dark Roots of Earth]]'' (2012) and ''[[Brotherhood of the Snake]]'' (2016)—entering the Top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200,{{r|Billboard.com}} and they have continued to tour consistently.{{r|dfwundercover}} The band released their latest studio album, ''[[Titans of Creation]]'', on April 3, 2020.<ref name="april2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testaments-new-album-gets-official-release-date/|title=TESTAMENT's New Album Gets Official Release Date|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=January 18, 2020|date=January 18, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Titans">{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/nz/album/titans-of-creation/1493544060|title=Titans of Creation by Testament|website=Apple Music|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> They are working on new material for their next studio album as of 2021.<ref name="nextalbum">{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=41290|title=Testament - Writing New Album|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=March 7, 2021|date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years and first two albums (1983–1989)===
The band was formed in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1983 under the name '''Legacy''' by guitarist [[Eric Peterson (musician)|Eric Peterson]] and his cousin, guitarist Derrick Ramirez. They soon added drummer [[Louie Clemente]], vocalist [[Steve Souza]] and bassist [[Greg Christian]] and began playing club shows with bands such as [[Slayer]], [[Lȧȧz Rockit]], [[Death Angel]] and others. Clemente left the band in 1985 and was replaced by drummer Mike Ronchette. Derrick Ramirez departed soon after and young guitarist [[Alex Skolnick]], who had studied under Bay Area guitarist [[Joe Satriani]], was brought into the band. Legacy had been writing original material since forming and released a self-titled, four-song demo in 1985. Steve Souza left the band in 1986 to join [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and was replaced by [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]] at Souza's suggestion. Mike Ronchette also left the band, and former drummer Louie Clemente returned.

The band was signed to [[Megaforce Records]] in 1986 on the strength of the demo tape. While recording their first album, the band was forced to change their name to Testament (which, according to Maria Ferrero in the May 2007 issue of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', was suggested by [[Billy Milano]] of [[Stormtroopers of Death|S.O.D.]] and [[M.O.D.]]), because the "Legacy" name was already trademarked by a hotel R&B cover band. Legacy played their last show prior to this name change at The Stone in San Francisco on March 4, 1987.<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=The Legacy / Testament|url=http://metallipromo.com/leg.html|work=Metallipromo.com|access-date=April 18, 2015}}</ref>

Testament's debut album, ''[[The Legacy (album)|The Legacy]]'', was released in April 1987 on [[Megaforce Records]], and also distributed by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. They received instant fame within thrash circles and were often compared with fellow Bay Area thrash pioneers Metallica. Thanks to this, and the regular rotation of their first-ever music video "Over the Wall" on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'',<ref name="hbb">{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref> the band quickly managed to increase their exposure by heading out on successful American and European tours with Anthrax, who were supporting their ''[[Among the Living]]'' album. On this tour, the ''[[Live at Eindhoven]]'' EP was recorded. Testament also opened for Slayer as well as their labelmates [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], and Megadeth on their ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'' [[Wake Up Dead Tour|tour]].{{r|metallipromo}}

Testament's second album, ''[[The New Order (album)|The New Order]]'', was released in May 1988, and found the band continuing in a similar vein. The album was a minor success, peaking at number 136 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],{{r|Billboard.com}} but managed to sell over 250,000 copies on the strength of the airplay of "Trial by Fire" and the cover of [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Nobody's Fault (Aerosmith song)|Nobody's Fault]]" (through radio and television), as well as relentless touring schedules.{{r|hbb}}<ref name="knac">{{Cite web|url=http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|title=KNAC A to Z Listing|date=March 5, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000305154225/http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|access-date=July 16, 2021|archive-date=March 5, 2000}}</ref><ref name="famousinterview">{{cite web|title=Testament Interview|url=http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/testament.htm|publisher=Famousinterview.ca|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> In support of ''The New Order'', Testament opened for Megadeth on their ''[[So Far, So Good...

===Commercial breakthrough (1989–1992)===
Testament released their third studio album, ''[[Practice What You Preach]]'', in August 1989. The album minimized the occult and gothic themes found in the lyrical content of their first two albums, instead focusing on real-life issues such as politics and corruption, and while staying true to its thrash metal roots, it saw the band drawing influences from [[heavy metal music|traditional heavy metal]], [[jazz fusion]] and [[progressive metal|progressive/technical metal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalreviews.com/reviews/album/4373|title=Testament - Practice What You Preach|publisher=metalreviews.com|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nolifetilmetal.com/testament.htm|title=CD Gallery - Testament - No Life Til Metal|publisher=nolifetilmetal.com|access-date=August 29, 2021}}</ref> ''Practice What You Preach'' was a commercial breakthrough for Testament, reaching at number 77 on the ''Billboard'' 200,{{r|Billboard.com}} and it was accompanied by three singles ([[Practice What You Preach (Testament song)|the title track]], "The Ballad" and "Greenhouse Effect") that received significant airplay from [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] radio stations and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', further helping raise the band's profile.{{r|hbb}}{{r|knac}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=70452 |title=Sunday Old School: Testament |publisher=Metalunderground.com |date=July 31, 2011 |access-date=April 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/alltime52.html|title=Z-Rock Top 1001 Songs of All-Time (1990)|website=rocklists.com|access-date=June 15, 2021}}</ref> Testament toured for almost a year behind ''Practice What You Preach'' with several bands, including [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], [[Wrathchild America]], [[Mortal Sin (band)|Mortal Sin]], [[Xentrix]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Savatage]], [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]], [[Mordred (band)|Mordred]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]] and a then-relatively unknown [[Primus (band)|Primus]].{{r|metallipromo}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Overkill Tour Dates|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/ov.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> Despite selling over 450,000 copies,{{r|famousinterview}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-06-18/features/9202240080_1_alex-skolnick-guitars-band-members|title=Thrashing Around At No. 4|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 18, 1992|access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref> the album has never been [[Music recording certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|RIAA]].

In October 1990, Testament released their fourth studio album ''[[Souls of Black]]''. Although reviews were mixed, the album managed to sell respectably, in no doubt largely off the strength of the single title track, and saw the band perform on arena tours, including the European [[Clash of the Titans (tour)|Clash of the Titans]] tour with Megadeth, Slayer and [[Suicidal Tendencies]].{{r|metallipromo}} Testament supported ''Souls of Black'' with two North American tours, opening for [[Judas Priest]] on their ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]'' [[Painkiller Tour|tour]] from October to December 1990,{{r|metallipromo}} and Slayer on their ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'' tour from January to March 1991.<ref name="1991 tour dates">{{cite web|url=http://www.chmetal.info/tourdates/Testament_1991.htm|title=Testament Tour Dates|publisher=chmetal.info|access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chmetal.info/tourdates/Slayer_1991.htm|title=Slayer Tour Dates|publisher=chmetal.info|access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> They also toured Japan, and played shows with Anthrax and [[Sepultura]].{{r|1991 tour dates}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Sepultura|url=http://metallipromo.com/sep.html|work=Metallipromo.com|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Testament Concert Setlist at Cow Palace, Daly City on May 26, 1991|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/testament/1991/cow-palace-daly-city-ca-3bca7ce8.html|work=setlist.fm|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anthrax Concert Setlist at Cow Palace, Daly City on May 26, 1991|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/anthrax/1991/cow-palace-daly-city-ca-bdad5de.html|work=setlist.fm|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref> Shortly after completing the ''Souls of Black'' tour, the band released their first VHS documentary ''[[Seen Between the Lines]]'', containing live clips recorded during the ''Souls of Black'' world tour, four promotional music videos and video interview segments.

Attempting to reconnect with an audience distracted by the growing [[grunge]] movement, Testament released ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' in 1992. Recorded at [[One on One Recording]] in [[Los Angeles]] under producer [[Tony Platt]], it saw a stylistic move away from thrash to a slower, slightly more traditional heavy metal sound,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalupdate.com/interviewbilly.html |title=Features |website=Metalupdate.com |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> and a somewhat more progressive atmosphere, with the title track being the longest song Testament had recorded up to this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalnerdblog.com/2011/10/16/testament-the-ritual-review/|title=Testament – The Ritual Review – Metal-Nerd Blog|date=October 16, 2011|publisher=metalnerdblog.com|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref> Drummer [[Louie Clemente]] acknowledged this musical change in a 1992 interview with ''[[Deseret News]]'', explaining, "''The Ritual'' is slower and geared toward the old style of metal while ''The Legacy'' was pure thrash. In fact, every release has been different. We've progressed naturally." Clemente said in the same interview that Platt's involvement within the album helped Testament "get more of a vibe."<ref>{{cite web|title=TESTAMENT SLOWS DOWN, LOOSENS UP - AND HAS FUN|url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/11/2/19013886/testament-slows-down-loosens-up-and-has-fun|magazine=[[Deseret News]]|date=November 2, 1992|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref> ''The Ritual'' peaked at 55 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the band's highest chart position at the time, and the power ballad "Return to Serenity" managed to receive radio airplay, peaking at number 22.

===Transitional period (1992–2004)===
For the duration of the 1990s, Testament had undergone a series of changes in its lineup, as well as a change of pace in its musical style. The first member of ''The Legacy''-era lineup to leave the band was lead guitarist [[Alex Skolnick]], who performed his last show with them on Halloween 1992. Skolnick has stated that one of the reasons he left Testament was because he wanted to expand his musical horizons rather than continuing to play thrash metal music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alex Skolnick: Interview with Metal Rules!! |url=https://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/alex.htm |work=Metal Rules |access-date=June 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tprs.com/interviews/interview-alex-skolnick-of-testament/ |title=TPRS Classic Interview: Alex Skolnick of Testament |publisher=Tprs.com|access-date=June 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Fabricus |first=Jodie |title=Metal Filings |magazine=The Hard Report |issue=295 |publication-date=September 25, 1992 |location=Medford, New Jersey |publisher=Hard Report, Inc. |page=54 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Hard-Report/1992/Hard-1992-09-25.pdf |access-date=June 1, 2021}}</ref> A few months later, drummer [[Louie Clemente]] left the band.

Skolnick and Clemente were temporarily replaced by [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] members [[Glen Alvelais]] and [[Paul Bostaph]], respectively. This lineup released the 1993 live EP, ''[[Return to the Apocalyptic City]]''. Soon after, Alvelais quit the band and Paul Bostaph departed to join Slayer. Their next album, ''[[Low (Testament album)|Low]]'' (1994), featured [[John Tempesta]] on drums and [[death metal]] guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]], formerly of [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Cancer (band)|Cancer]], and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]. ''Low'' was a diverse album, featuring various influences such as [[alternative metal|alternative]], [[hard rock]], [[death metal]], [[groove metal]], progressive, and as well as a ballad, "Trail of Tears". The band's remaining fans reacted favorably to the album, although it did little to expand Testament's fanbase. Some fans, however, viewed Testament's move away from the mainstream as a liberation that allowed them to expand artistically, not being pressured by sales and success as they once were. Despite the fact that the album charted lower than the band's previous three albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 122,{{r|Billboard.com}} its title track "Low" received decent airplay from ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' on [[MTV]] and the [[Los Angeles]]-based radio station [[KNAC]],{{r|hbb}}{{r|knac}} just before both outlets went off the air in early 1995. Testament toured for over a year in support of ''Low'', playing with numerous acts such as [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Downset.]], [[Korn]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Kreator]], [[At the Gates]], [[Moonspell]], [[Crowbar (American band)|Crowbar]], [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]] and [[Gorefest]]. Their first full-length live album ''[[Live at the Fillmore (Testament album)|Live at the Fillmore]]'', released in the summer of 1995, was recorded during this tour and marked their first release since they ended their eight-and-a-half-year tenure with [[Atlantic Records]].

Tempesta left Testament after the recording of ''Low'' to join [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], being replaced by [[Jon Dette]] for the following tour, though the latter would leave the band in 1995. Dette's replacement was [[Chris Kontos (musician)|Chris Kontos]], who had formerly been part of [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]. This lineup is featured on the Judas Priest cover Rapid Fire. After the 1996 club tour, Greg Christian, James Murphy, and Chris Kontos departed the band. During the time Kontos was in Testament he suggested the band drop the name altogether and call the band "Dog Faced Gods". This idea was turned down by Billy and Peterson who wanted to continue with the Testament name. The two later temporarily disbanded Testament.

The band's follow-up album, ''[[Demonic (album)|Demonic]]'', released June 1997, took a new approach, and found Testament experimenting with death metal more. The album featured Eric Peterson on both lead and rhythm guitar (although [[Glen Alvelais]] made a guest appearance, and played on the subsequent tour), early member Derrick Ramirez on bass guitar, and former [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]] drummer [[Gene Hoglan]]. ''Hoglan'' left before the Demonic tour to join [[Strapping Young Lad]], with Steve Jacobs doing the South American leg of the tour and Jon Dette returning later. Hoglan's loyalty to [[Strapping Young Lad]] and his desire to not remain a member of Testament actually came to realization during a published interview the band conducted with Metal Maniacs Magazine.

By 1998, Ramirez, Alvelais and Dette had departed and James Murphy had returned for the June 1999 release of ''[[The Gathering (Testament album)|The Gathering]]''. The rhythm section on ''[[The Gathering (Testament album)|The Gathering]]'' was highly respected, consisting of metal fretless bass pioneer [[Steve Di Giorgio]] (formerly of Death and [[Sadus]]) and original Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]]. The sound of the album was largely a combination of death metal and thrash metal, with a minor [[black metal]] influence from Eric Peterson's [[side project]], [[Dragonlord (band)|Dragonlord]].

Soon after the release of ''The Gathering'', lead guitarist James Murphy was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]. Through various fundraisers, Murphy was able to afford surgery and eventually made a full recovery, but was unable to recall anything from the recording of ''The Gathering''. In 2001, Chuck Billy was also diagnosed with [[Seminoma|germ cell seminoma]], a rare form of testicular cancer, but it only affected Billy's lungs and heart.  His cancer was also treated successfully. In August 2001, friends of Billy organized the ''[[Thrash of the Titans]]'' benefit concert, featuring seminal [[Bay Area thrash metal]] bands [[Vio-lence]], [[Death Angel]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Sadus]] and [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]], as well as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Stormtroopers of Death|S.O.D.]] and [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]]. The show was headlined by a Legacy reunion, featuring [[Steve Souza]] on vocals, and former guitarist [[Alex Skolnick]], who had not played with the band since 1992, and bassist [[Greg Christian]]. Late in 2001, Testament released ''[[First Strike Still Deadly]]'', a collection of re-recordings (with modern studio technology) of songs from their first two albums. The album featured the lineup of Billy, Peterson, Di Giorgio, the return of Alex Skolnick on guitar, and John Tempesta on drums.

By 2003, Chuck Billy had made a full recovery, and the band began performing live again with a new drummer, Jon Allen of [[Sadus (band)|Sadus]]. In 2004, the band changed their lineup once again for their summer festival appearances. Jon Allen was replaced by Paul Bostaph, returning to the band for a second stint after a decade's absence. Lead guitarist [[Steve Smyth]] departed to join [[Nevermore]] and was replaced by ex-[[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist "Metal" Mike Chlasciak. Shortly after Steve Smyth's departure, Eric Peterson fell down a flight of stairs, breaking his leg, and was unavailable for some dates. He was temporarily replaced by Steve Smyth.

===Reunion of classic lineup and ''The Formation of Damnation'' (2005–2010)===
[[file:Chuck billy, grita rock festival 2012.jpg|thumb|Lead vocalist Chuck Billy in 2012]]
In May 2005, it was announced that Testament would be doing a brief Europe-only reunion tour – known as the "10 Days in May Tour" – featuring the classic lineup of Billy, Peterson, Skolnick and Christian, with drum duties shared between John Tempesta and Louie Clemente. After the success of the initial tour dates, Testament announced more dates in the U.S., [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] with the classic lineup. Later that year, Skolnick also toured the East Coast with [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]]. The band went on to release a live DVD and CD from the tour entitled ''Live in London''. In interviews on the DVD, Eric Peterson expressed his desire to record the follow-up to ''The Gathering'' with the classic Testament lineup. He also stated that Alex Skolnick had begun writing songs for the new album. Chuck Billy was very vocal about how happy he was to have Alex, Greg, Louie, and John Tempesta in the band once again, and hoped to maintain a stable lineup going forward. Also in 2005, Testament's long-out of print documentary ''[[Seen Between the Lines]]'' was released on DVD for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|title=TESTAMENT: DVD Action Galore|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-dvd-action-galore/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 14, 2004|access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TESTAMENT: 'Seen Between The Lines' DVD Details Revealed|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-seen-between-the-lines-dvd-details-revealed/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 13, 2005|access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2007, the band played a show at Jaxx Nightclub in [[Springfield, Virginia]], with [[Paul Bostaph]] filling in on drum duties. It was later confirmed that Bostaph would be officially returning to the band to record the new album. The band debuted a new song at that show titled "The Afterlife",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=27495 |title=Testament Debut New Song, Interview Posted – in Metal News |website=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> which they also played at Earthshaker Fest.

Testament released their first studio album in nine years, ''[[The Formation of Damnation]]'', on April 29, 2008, through Nuclear Blast Records. It was the first Testament album to feature Alex Skolnick on guitar since 1992's ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'', and the first to feature bassist Greg Christian since 1994's ''[[Low (Testament album)|Low]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-guitarist-new-material-is-sounding-pretty-old-school/ |title=TESTAMENT Guitarist: 'New Material Is Sounding Pretty Old-School' |last=Blabbermouth |date=2006-06-13 |website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET |access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=75714 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215085149/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=75714 |archive-date=2009-02-15 }}</ref>

As early as 2009, Testament started writing new material for their tenth album. In an interview with Metalheadz, Peterson stated that there were about four songs written and that "there's other guys in the band who like to play the more rock melodic style but the next one is gonna be a bit heavier."{{r|roadrunnerrecords.com}} In a January 2011 interview during the [[70000 Tons of Metal]] cruise, Billy revealed that Testament had been working on six new songs, with four or five "maybe left to write," and would begin recording their new album by early March.<ref name="roadrunnerrecords1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-hoping-to-enter-studio-in-march/ |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET – TESTAMENT Hoping To Enter Studio In March |date=2012-09-13 |access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref> On May 18, 2011, Skolnick posted an update on his Twitter, saying, "Another tune done!

In May 2016, Billy confirmed their twelfth album would be entitled ''[[Brotherhood of the Snake]]''. Of the album's lyrical content, he commented, "The Brotherhood of the Snake was actually a society about 6,000 years ago that debarred all religions.
