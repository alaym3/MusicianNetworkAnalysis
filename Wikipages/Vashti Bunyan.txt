She released her debut album, ''[[Just Another Diamond Day]]'', in 1970. The album sold very few copies and Bunyan, discouraged, abandoned her musical career. By 2000, her album had acquired a cult following; it was re-released and Bunyan recorded more songs, initiating the second phase of her musical career after a gap of thirty years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96077033|title=Vashti Bunyan: 40 Years Later, A Musical Rebirth|work=NPR.org|access-date=28 July 2017|language=en}}</ref> She subsequently released two albums: ''[[Lookaftering]]'' in 2005, and ''[[Heartleap]]'' in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Bunyan was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1945 to John Bunyan and Helen Webber, and moved to London at six months old. Although she has been said to be descended from ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' author [[John Bunyan]],<ref>Richard Harrington, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020800500.html "Vashti Bunyan's 'Day' Has Come Again"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 9 February 2007</ref> this is a claim she has herself denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/music/v/4972-vashti-bunyan-interview.html |title=CultBox – British TV drama and comedy – News, reviews and interviews |publisher=Lastbroadcast.co.uk |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref> In the early 1960s, she studied at the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]], but was expelled for focusing on music instead of art.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.nysun.com/arts/reaching-carnegie-hall-by-horseback/47702/|title =Reaching Carnegie Hall by Horseback|first =Andy|last =Beta|website =The New York Sun|date =31 January 2007}}</ref>

==Musical career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2021}}

===1960s===
At age 18, Bunyan travelled to New York and discovered the music of [[Bob Dylan]] through his ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' album and decided to become a full-time musician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/entertainment/music/rocktalk/779511/if-i-could-take-off-to-the-hills-now-i-probably-would-says-godmother-of-freak-folk-vashti-bunyan-ahead-of-rare-fife-gig/|title='If I could take off to the hills I probably would,' says 'Godmother of freak folk' Vashti Bunyan ahead of rare Fife gig|last=Alex|first=Michael|website=The Courier|language=en-GB|access-date= 8 December 2019}}</ref> Returning to London, she was discovered by [[The Rolling Stones]]' manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. In June 1965, under his direction, she released her first single, "[[Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind]]", penned by [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]. Released using simply the name ''Vashti'', it was backed with her own song "I Want to Be Alone". This single and her follow-up "Train Song", released on [[Columbia (EMI)|Columbia]] in May 1966, produced by Canadian Peter Snell, received little attention.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The only other release of this time was her distinctive vocal on "The Coldest Night of the Year" by [[Twice as Much]] which eventually turned up on their second and final LP, ''That's All'', by Oldham's [[Immediate Records]] in 1968. After recording additional songs for Immediate Records, which remain unreleased, and making a brief appearance in the 1967 documentary ''[[Tonite Let's All Make Love in London]]'', with her song "Winter Is Blue", she decided to travel with her then boyfriend Robert Lewis by horse and cart to the [[Hebrides]] to join a commune planned by a friend, fellow singer/songwriter [[Donovan]] ("...from South London up to the Hebrides. Initially to Skye but we carried on to the Outer Hebrides."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/vashti-bunyan-interview |title=Vashti Bunyan Interview &#124; Features &#124; Clash Magazine |publisher=Clashmusic.com |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>). During the trip she began writing the songs which eventually became her first album, ''[[Just Another Diamond Day]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1135-just-another-diamond-day/|title=Vashti Bunyan: Just Another Diamond Day|last=Murphy|first=Matthew|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>

At Christmas 1968, during a break from her trip, she met [[Joe Boyd]] through a friend and he offered to record an album of her travelling songs for his Witchseason Productions.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-album-that-camein-from-the-cold-697476.html|title=The album that camein from the cold|date=25 August 2000|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> A year later, Bunyan returned to London and recorded her first LP with assistance from [[Simon Nicol]] and [[Dave Swarbrick]] of [[Fairport Convention]], [[Robin Williamson]] of [[The Incredible String Band]] and string arranger [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]]. The album appeared on [[Philips Records]] to warm reviews in December 1970, but struggled to find an audience.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

Disappointed, she left the music industry and moved to The Incredible String Band's Glen Row cottages, then Ireland, and back to Scotland. Much of the ensuing 30 years were spent raising her three children.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In this time, entirely unknown to her, the original album slowly became one of the most sought-after records of its time. It has sold online on [[Discogs]] for as much as US$3,946.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.discogs.com/en/top-30-most-expensive-items-sold-in-discogs-marketplace-for-may-2018/ |title=Top 30 Most Expensive Items Sold In Discogs Marketplace For May 2018 |date= 5 July 2018|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

===2000 to present===
In 2000, ''Just Another Diamond Day'' was re-released on CD (with bonus tracks), assuring Bunyan's influence over a new generation of folk artists such as [[Devendra Banhart]] and [[Joanna Newsom]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/9523-vashti-bunyan/|title=Vashti Bunyan|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsay|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> In 2001, Banhart wrote to her asking for her advice, beginning her connection with many of the contemporary performers who cite her work. In 2002, she was invited by [[Piano Magic]] musician Glen Johnson to sing guest vocals on his song "Crown of the Lost", her first recording in over 30 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/what-s-on/music/vashti-bunyan-when-just-another-diamond-day-came-out-again-it-was-as-if-there-was-a-whole-different-climate-1-9458114|title=Vashti Bunyan: 'When Just Another Diamond Day came out again it was as if there was a whole different climate'|website=www.yorkshirepost.co.uk|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Since then, she has appeared on releases by Devendra Banhart and [[Animal Collective]].

In 2005, she recorded and released her second album, ''[[Lookaftering]]'' on [[Fat Cat Records]], some 35 years after her first.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/music/reviews/5z3n/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Vashti Bunyan - Lookaftering|last=Long|first=Chris|date=9 November 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109195948/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/music/reviews/5z3n/|archive-date=9 November 2018|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> The album was produced by composer [[Max Richter (Composer)|Max Richter]] and featured many of her contemporary followers including Banhart, Joanna Newsom, [[Adem Ilhan|Adem]], Kevin Barker of Currituck Co, Otto Hauser of [[Espers (band)|Espers]] and Adam Pierce of [[Mice Parade]]. It was well received by critics and fans alike.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Vashti Bunyan at Summer Sundae 2006.JPG|thumb|right|Bunyan performing at the [[Summer Sundae]] festival in [[Leicester]] in 2006]]
During the autumn of 2006, Bunyan assembled an ''[[ad hoc]]'' band and embarked on a brief North American tour, with performances in both Canada and the US. She performed songs from both of her solo albums, as well as some of the rare material from the unreleased Oldham sessions.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Her music reached a much wider audience when "Just Another Diamond Day" was covered and used in a TV advert for [[T-Mobile]]. "Train Song" gained her further attention when it was used in 2008 by [[Reebok]] for an ad for the [[NFL]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oz7V8-L7R0 |title=Reebok "Join The Migration" |publisher=YouTube |date=23 July 2008 |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref> in 2014 as part of the soundtrack for the TV series ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'', as well as in 2015 as the opening credits song for the Amazon Original Series ''[[Patriot (TV series)|Patriot]]''.

In 2007, she collaborated with novelist [[Rodge Glass]] on the song "The Fire" for the compilation album ''[[Ballads of the Book]]'' which was devised to combine Scottish writers with Scottish singers (Bunyan lives in Edinburgh).
Bunyan also provided vocals on three songs for former [[Jack (band)|Jack]] frontman [[Anthony Reynolds]]' debut solo album ''British Ballads''.  Bunyan sang with Reynolds on the songs "Country Girl", "Just So You Know" and "Song of Leaving".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
In October 2007 a compilation album of her mid-1960s singles and unreleased demos was released entitled ''[[Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind - Singles and Demos 1964 to 1967]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Vashti BUNYAN Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind Singles & Demos 1964 To 1967 vinyl at Juno Records.|url=https://www.juno.co.uk/products/vashti-bunyan-some-things-just-stick-in/286652-01/|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10742-some-things-just-stick-in-your-mind-singles-and-demos-1964-to-1967/|title=Vashti Bunyan: Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind: Singles and Demos: 1964 to 1967|last=Powell|first=Mike|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>

In January 2008, Bunyan said she was in the process of recording a new album: "I'm supposed to be writing just now. I have one complete song and a whole lot of fragments. I'm supposed to have them finished by May and there's no way."<ref>Tobias Khan, [https://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/vashti-bunyan-0 "Vashti Bunyan: The Past and Future Collide"] ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' 8 February 2008</ref>

In June 2008, she appeared at London's Royal Festival Hall with The [[Heritage Orchestra]] as part of [[Massive Attack]]'s [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]], in a live performance of [[Vangelis]]' ''[[Blade Runner]]'' [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], singing "Rachel's Song" as sung by [[Mary Hopkin]] on the original recorded soundtrack.<ref>Ally Carnwath, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/22/popandrock.festivals1 "Massive chill melts into warm Vangelis"] ''[[The Observer]]'' 22 June 2008</ref>

In October 2008, a feature documentary about her, ''Vashti Bunyan: From Here To Before'', directed by [[Kieran Evans]], had its world premieres at the Times BFI [[London Film Festival]]. It retraces Bunyan's journey across the British Isles and sets it against the backdrop of her first high-profile London concert. It uses her trip through Britain as its main narrative structure. The album provides the soundtrack to that journey, just as it did the first time.

In 2011, Bunyan's cover of the late [[John Martyn]]'s "Head and Heart" appeared on the tribute album, ''Johnny Boy Would Love This...A Tribute to John Martyn''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roffman |first=Michael |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/07/check-out-robert-smith-covers-john-martyn/ |title=Check Out: Robert Smith covers John Martyn |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=5 July 2011 |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>

In June 2014, she announced her third and final album, ''[[Heartleap]]''. She wrote, "The whole point of the album was finally to learn a way that would enable me to record the music that is in my head, by myself. I neither read nor write music, nor can I play piano with more than one hand at a time, but I have loved being able to work it all out for myself and make it sound the way I wanted. I've built these songs over years. The album wouldn't have happened any other way." ''Heartleap'' was released on 7 October in the U.S. via DiCristina and 6 October in the UK via [[FatCat Records]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Jeremy|title=Vashti Bunyan Says New Album Will Be Her Last|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/55769-vashti-bunyan-says-new-album-will-be-her-last/|access-date=13 October 2014|agency=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=2 July 2014}}</ref> The cover artwork was by Bunyan's daughter, Whyn Lewis, who also did the artwork for ''Lookaftering''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whynlewis.tumblr.com/post/82377370535/run-oil-painting-from-2005-that-was-used-for-the|title=Whyn Lewis Paintings — 'Run' oil painting from 2005 that was used for the...|website=Whyn Lewis Paintings|access-date=31 May 2017}}</ref>

==Reception==
In 2008, Bunyan has been labelled "the Godmother of [[Freak Folk]]"<ref name="Hippie Chick">[http://www.nypress.com/19/37/music/music2.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202071015/http://www.nypress.com/19/37/music/music2.cfm |date=2 December 2008 }}</ref> for her role in inspiring the "new generation of folk experimentalists including [[Devendra Banhart]] and [[Adem Ilhan|Adem]]".<ref name="Hippie Chick"/><ref name=Times>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Jude|title=Lie back and think of ukuleles|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/02/folk.features11|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 January 2008|access-date=1 August 2008}}</ref> Her music has also been categorized as [[Folk music|folk]], [[psychedelic folk]], or new folk.<ref name="about.com">{{cite news|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/new_folk.htm|title=What Is New Folk?

Despite these classifications, she has stated multiple times she is not a folk singer: "[...] I find it quite hard to read myself described as a folk singer, because I'm not."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vashti Bunyan|url=https://www.prsformusic.com/m-magazine/features/interview-vashti-bunyan/|access-date=9 September 2020|website=www.prsformusic.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mookychick.co.uk/reviews/music/interview-vashti-bunyan.php|title = Lost music rediscovered: An interview with singer-songwriter Vashti Bunyan|date = 20 November 2018}}</ref> Her former producer Joe Boyd also underlines this in the 2008 Kieran Evans' film ''From Here to Before'', explaining how he never considered Bunyan to be "[...] much of a folkie".<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 August 2020|title=From Here To Before And Back Again - Kieran Evans|url=https://www.thesocial.com/from-here-to-before-and-back-again-kieran-evans/|access-date=9 September 2020|website=The Social|language=en-US}}</ref>
