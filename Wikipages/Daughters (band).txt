'''Daughters''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2002, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] after the break-up of As the Sun Sets. The band's current line-up consists of vocalist [[Alexis S.F. Marshall|Alexis Marshall]], guitarist Nicholas Andrew Sadler, drummer [[Jon Syverson]], and bassist Samuel Moorehouse Walker.

The band started out as a [[grindcore]] outfit, developing their sound with each album, with later albums often described as [[noise rock]]. In 2018 the band signed to [[Ipecac Recordings|Ipecac Records]] and released the album ''[[You Won't Get What You Want]]'', which released to universal critical acclaim, with many critics naming it one of the best albums of the year. It marks a significant departure from the band's earlier style.

==History==

=== Formation and ''Canada Songs'' (2002–2003)&nbsp; ===
Prior to forming Daughters, vocalist Alexis S.F. Marshall, guitarist Jeremy Wabiszczewicz and drummer Jon Syverson played in the American [[grindcore]]<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/3608/as-the-sun-sets-7744|title=As The Sun Sets - 7744|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> band As the Sun Sets.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/1467/Update-on-last-As-The-Sun-Sets-album|title=Update on last As The Sun Sets album|access-date=2016-12-17}}</ref> Following its disbandment, Marshall, Wabiszczewicz and Syverson went on to form Daughters along with guitarist Nicholas Andrew Sadler and bassist Pat Masterson.<ref name=":0222">{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/38113/interviews--nicholas-andrew-sadler-daughters-fang-island|title=Interviews:  Nicholas Andrew Sadler (Daughters/Fang Island)|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> As the Sun Sets' final release, ''8949'', contained an insert which had a message from the band on it.

=== ''Hell Songs'' (2004–2006) ===
In June, 2004 Daughters released its first live album, ''Live at CBGB'', through City of Hell. The album contained a new song, "Boner X-Ray". In July 2004 "Boner X-Ray" was later released for free as a download from Daughters' website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/bits/260/archived-news-tidbit|title=archived news tidbit|website=lambgoat.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}</ref> a studio version of the song would also appear on Daughters' upcoming album, ''[[Hell Songs]]'' under the title "X-Ray".

=== ''Daughters'' and break-up (2007–2010) ===
The writing process of the band's third album started three years prior to the album's release, Sadler has said he would take song ideas and riffs to bandmate Syverson "to hash them out".<ref name=":0222" /> Recording for Daughters' third album began in late April, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=12516|title=Daughters set to record new album|date=April 1, 2009|work=LambGoat|access-date=April 1, 2010}}</ref> and the tracking process was finished by June.<ref name="NC fallout22">{{cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/01/25/daughters-big-falling-out/|title=Daughters Down Two Members After 'Big Falling Out'|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=January 25, 2010|publisher=AOL Music|work=[[Noisecreep]]|access-date=April 1, 2010}}</ref> In August, Daughters had abruptly broken up.<ref name="NC fallout22" /> After finishing recording for the album Marshall and Sadler got in an argument resulting in Marshall leaving the band.<ref name=":0222" /><ref name="NC fallout22" /><ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddyhead.com/buddyhead-vs-daughters/|title=Buddyhead VS Daughters {{!}} BUDDYHEAD|date=2010-06-27|access-date=2017-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627204546/http://www.buddyhead.com/buddyhead-vs-daughters/|archive-date=2010-06-27}}</ref> The rest of the band decided to call a hiatus, expecting Marshall to re-join the band at some point.<ref name=":0222" /><ref name=":02" /> Sadler continued with mastering the record, finalizing the artwork and worked with artist Dave Fisher on a trailer video. Sadler said that he "was essentially trying to keep the band alive for who-knows-what" and "hoping [Marshall] would come back or maybe in few years we would start playing again."<ref name=":0222" /> Marshall decided that he wanted to rejoin the band, but that Sadler should be replaced.<ref name=":0222" /><ref name=":02" /> This caused bassist Samuel M. Walker to leave the band.<ref name=":02" /> This led to the band's break-up.<ref name=":0222" /><ref name="NC fallout22" />

The disbandment was never officially announced, and no one outside of Daughters knew about the breakup before the end of 2009.<ref name="NC fallout22" /> Some months after the disbandment, Marshall and Syverson reconnected and decided to continue with the band.<ref name="NC fallout22" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=360349|title=Decibel Magazine: Daughters|date=2010-03-25|access-date=2017-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325185133/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=360349|archive-date=2010-03-25}}</ref> Stating “We started this band and we’re the only two people who have been through it consistently, so there was no reason to stop altogether and throw the whole thing away.”<ref name="NC fallout22" /> Marshall continued to say the pair have “no plans to replace anybody, but we’re not ruling out the idea that people could come in here and if it works out, they’ll stay.”<ref name="NC fallout22" /> Sadler has said "From my perspective, I don't think I'll ever play with Daughters again - I've been through way too much stress and I'm in a way better place with writing and being in a band with [[Fang Island]]. With the new album, I think we ended on a really good note with Daughters and if [Marshall] carries it beyond that then I'm happy for him and that's cool. So I didn't really leave, the band just fell apart. In some way, I guess I was kicked out by the guy who quit. (laughs) I don't know where that leaves me or the band, but I'm using that as an excuse to step out officially."<ref name=":0222" />

The band performed a one-off secret show at [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in Providence, where they played most of the songs from their upcoming album.<ref name=":02" /> This was the first and only time Daughters played songs off their self-titled album before their reunion in 2013.<ref name=":02" /> Despite the "break-up", Daughters released their third album ''[[Daughters (album)|Daughters]]'' on March 9, 2010, through Hydra Head.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hydrahead.bandcamp.com/album/daughters|title=Daughters, by Daughters|website=Hydra Head Records|access-date=2016-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14186-daughters/|title=Daughters: Daughters Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref> The band's management announced there would not be any tour in support of the album.<ref name="NC fallout22" /> Looking back on the album Sadler said "This album really caught up with us. People were getting a little older, the whole band was extremely poor from touring over the years, so life outside the band really caught up with us and it became hard to really do anything. I'm very proud of this record just because we were able to make it, you know? It was a real struggle."<ref name=":0222" />

=== Reunion and recording sessions (2013–2014) ===
Marshall has credited Andy Low of Robotic Empire for reuniting Daughters. While Marshall and Sadler were not speaking to each other, Low told them both that one wanted to see the other. However, neither member had actually expressed any feelings to Low about wanting to see the other. Not knowing this, they both reluctantly agreed to have dinner together. They found out during the dinner that Low had tricked them to get them to talk to each other again.<ref name=":03" /> The situation was described by Marshall: “We sat down and had dinner and within 15 minutes we started talking about plans. We just needed to be in the same room I guess.” He then went on to say, “It felt that enough time had gone by that any issues that Nick and I had had been not necessarily forgotten but they didn’t seem that important anymore.”<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://beatroute.ca/2016/11/08/rhode-island-noise-rockers-daughters-come-back-dead/|title=Rhode Island noise rockers Daughters come back from the dead|date=2016-11-08|website=BeatRoute Magazine|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>

Speaking about Daughters' reunion Marshall stated the band had been talking about it for a while. He also mentioned how fans would regularly ask him "what was going on with Daughters" while he was on tour with his other band Fucking Invincible. He stated "It's crazy. People are actually still into it" referring to Daughters.<ref name=":5" /> When Marshall got home from touring with Fucking Invincible he sent out a group text to the other members of Daughters saying, "People are interested in us doing something. We shouldn’t fuck around. We should just go out and play some shows, because this writing thing is taking way longer than it was supposed to. Let’s not concern ourselves with that; let’s just play some shows and things will happen after that. Everything will happen by itself once we get in the mindset of being in Daughters and being with each other."<ref name=":5" />

On September 13, 2013, Daughters reformed for one show in Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3239331|title=Daughters Announce First Show in 4 Years|last=DiVincenzo|first=Alex|date=June 11, 2013|publisher=[[Spin Media]]|work=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=June 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/daughters_to_play_first_show_in_four_years|title=Daughters to play first show in four years|last=Kraus|first=Brian|date=June 11, 2013|work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=June 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/20584/Daughters-to-reunite-for-September-show|title=Daughters to reunite for September show|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref> Owing to popular demand, a second show was added on September 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/daughters_reunion_show_sells_out_second_date_added|title=Daughters reunion show sells out, second date added|last=Kraus|first=Brian|date=June 23, 2013|work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=June 24, 2013}}</ref> Although at the time no further official statements had been made, ever since the reunion the band has had heavy activity on social media and had been recording "bits and pieces" and making demos.<ref name=":5" /> In the summer of 2014 the band started recording at Providence-based studio, Machines With Magnets.

Our music is not like that, so why should the singing be like other bands?"<ref name=":4" />
