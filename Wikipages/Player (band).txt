'''Player''' is a British-American [[musical ensemble|rock band]] that made their mark during the late 1970s. The group scored several US Hot 100 hits, three of which went into the [[top 40]]; two of those single releases went top 10, including the No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Baby Come Back (Player song)|Baby Come Back]]", written by group members [[Peter Beckett]] and [[J.C. Crowley]].

== Career ==
Player first came together in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The original members included Peter Beckett (vocals, guitar), [[JC Crowley|John Charles "J.C." Crowley]] (vocals, keyboards, guitar), [[Ronn Moss]] (vocals, bass), and John Friesen (drums).

Beckett, a transplanted Englishman, had been in a group called Skyband with Australian [[Steve Kipner]] (who had also played with the Australian band [[Tin Tin (band)|Tin Tin]]). After Skyband broke up in 1975, Beckett was in Los Angeles and met Crowley at a party. He and Crowley teamed up in a new band called Riff Raff, which soon changed its name to Bandana and released a single, "Jukebox Saturday Night", on Dennis Lambert and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]]'s Haven label. Steve Kipner and former [[The Grass Roots|Grass Roots]] guitarist Reed Kailing were also members of Riff Raff/Bandana, but Kipner was gone before the single's recording and Kailing was aced out after its release, though some of the Bandana tracks with Kailing's playing and co-writing later appeared on Player's debut.

When the Haven label folded soon afterward, Lambert and Potter brought the others over to [[RSO Records]] in 1976, and Beckett and Crowley started anew with Moss and Friesen (a former percussionist and musical director for the [[Ice Follies]]) as Player. [[Wayne Cook]], a keyboardist/[[session player]] and former member of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], was an additional bandmember for its live performances; he is the curly-haired keyboardist in the band's videos from the 1970s.

Player gained popularity as a live act during the heyday of the 1970s [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] era. They first went on the road in the fall of 1977 opening for [[Gino Vannelli]], then [[Boz Scaggs]]. They began to develop a distinctive, edgy and melodic [[Rock music|rock style]]. Their biggest hit, "[[Baby Come Back (Player song)|Baby Come Back]]", released in late 1977, rose to No. 1 on the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in January 1978 and was a chart success in other countries. Their follow up single, "[[This Time I'm in It for Love]]", also peaked at No. 10 the same year. Among several notable accolades, Player was named [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]''<nowiki/>'''s Best New Singles Artist of 1978. [[Eric Clapton]] invited them to open for him during his 1978 [[North America]]n “Slow Hand” tour.

Later in 1978, keyboardist Cook left and was replaced by Bob Carpenter (who would go on to join [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]). Eventually the band began to headline some of their own events, as well as continuing to open shows for artists like [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and [[Kenny Loggins]] in the fall of 1978. But after playing a show with the latter at Coconut Grove in Miami, Florida, on October 29, 1978, tension among the various group members resulted in a huge blow up. When the smoke finally cleared, and after the group played a few more shows with Heart in late 1978, Beckett left the group and Player was without a record contract.

The remaining three, Crowley, Moss and Friesen, attempted to find a new deal and carry on but were unsuccessful. Crowley then decided to return to his native Texas, where he later pursued a career in country music. In the meantime, Beckett regrouped with Moss and Friesen to continue on as Player.

Player released four [[album]]s during their active touring years: ''Player'' (RSO Records in 1977), ''Danger Zone'' (RSO Records in 1978), ''Room With A View'' ([[Casablanca Records]] in 1980), the latter without Crowley, and ''Spies Of Life'' (RCA Records in 1981). After a long absence, Beckett brought Moss back into the fold in 1995 and Player released their fifth album, ''Lost In Reality'', on River North Records in 1996. ''Two Many Reasons'' followed on Frontiers Records in 2013 and, like ''Reality'', was written and produced by Beckett.

== Lineup changes and dissolution ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Miles Joseph (vocals, guitar) and Gabriel Katona (keyboards, ex-[[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]) joined Beckett, Moss and Friesen in the studio for the group's third album, ''Room With a View'' (April 1980), produced by Beckett with [[Tony Peluso]].

By the end of 1980, Player wasn't active, recording or touring, so Moss decided to pursue an [[Actor|acting]] career. He originated the role of [[Ridge Forrester]] on the new CBS-TV soap opera ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' from 1987 until August 2012, after which he made the decision to not continue in the series after he was injured in an auto accident.

As Moss was occupied with acting, Beckett kept going as Player with Friesen, Joseph, Katona and Rusty Buchanan (vocals, bass, ex-[[Sugarloaf (band)|Sugarloaf]]) and with producer Dennis Lambert back on board, released their fourth album, ''Spies of Life'', on [[RCA]] in late 1981. The band continued until 1982 and played on the music series [[Solid Gold (TV series)|''Solid Gold'']] that year. But after this, the band once again found themselves without a record deal and elected to go their separate ways. Guitarist Miles Joseph later passed away of heart failure on December 25, 2012.

Peter Beckett went on to be a member of [[Little River Band]] from 1989 to 1997 and played "Baby Come Back" at its performances.

J.C. Crowley (who still occasionally wrote with Beckett) became a Nashville performer and songwriter, recording his only solo album, ''[[Beneath the Texas Moon]]'', in 1988. In 1989 he had country hits with "[[Paint the Town and Hang the Moon Tonight]]" (No. 13) and "[[I Know What I've Got]]" (No. 21), and was named "Best New Male Country Performer". He wrote a number of songs recorded by Nashville artists, including [[Johnny Cash]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]]. He also won a battle with cancer in the late 1990's and now lives in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon, California]].

== Return ==

Although the original lineup of Player had disbanded, Beckett and Moss rejoined forces to record and tour together once again as Player in 1995. The duo recorded an additional [[Recording studio|studio]] album as Player, released in [[Japan]] in August 1995 as ''Electric Shadow'' and renamed ''Lost in Reality'' when put out on [[River North Records]] in the U.S. in May 1996.

On December 16, 1997, Player played live for the first time in years at the L.A. Music Awards at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] with a lineup consisting of Beckett, Moss, [[Elliot Easton]] (of [[The Cars]]) on guitar, [[Burleigh Drummond]] of [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]] on drums and [[Tony Sciuto]] of [[Little River Band]] on keyboards. A [[compilation album]], ''Best of Player'', was released in 1998.

The response to the group's reunion show was so enthusiastic that they had several offers for more concert dates. River North Records dropped the band and Player tried to buy back the rights to the ''Lost in Reality'' CD but were unsuccessful.

Player toured in the spring of 1998 with a lineup of Beckett, Moss, Sciuto, Drummond, guitarist Steve Farris (formerly of [[Mr. Mister]]) and percussionist Ron Green, with guitarist [[Dave Amato]] (from [[REO Speedwagon]]) and drummer Ron Wikso (formerly of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[The Storm (American band)|The Storm]]) filling in for Drummond as needed, depending on the schedules of the others.

In 2000, the lineup of Player included: drummer Craig Pilo, guitarist Michael Hakes, Green, Sciuto, Moss and Beckett playing more shows across the United States. But Michael Hakes died on November 19, 2003, from complications from leukemia. After Hakes' death, the band stopped touring and concentrated on other projects.

In 2007, Player reunited once again with a lineup of: Beckett, Moss, Pilo, Green, Ricky Zacharaides (guitar) and Ed Roth (keyboards). Percussionist Ron Green last appeared with Player in 2008.

By 2009, Rob Math (guitar) and keyboardist Johnny English (now known as Jawn Star)had come in to replace Zacharaides and Roth.

On November 14, 2009 J.C. Crowley temporarily reunited with Beckett and Moss at [[Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] for a tribute concert to Dennis Lambert in a charity benefiting the Desert Arc Foundation.

In February 2013, Player (Beckett and Moss) released their new album, ''Too Many Reasons'', on Frontiers Records. They toured throughout the United States and Canada over the summer as part of the ''Sail Rock 2013'' with [[Christopher Cross]], [[Gary Wright]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]], [[Firefall]], [[Robbie Dupree]] and [[John Ford Coley]].

[[Quiet Riot]]'s drummer, [[Frankie Banali]], guested with Player on June 3, 2013, for a charity concert in Agoura, CA.

[[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]]' drummer, Jimmy Carnelli, took over as their new drummer in 2014 and Player did an extensive tour of Australia in November 2014 promoted as "An Intimate Evening with Ronn Moss & Player", playing up Ronn's huge popularity [[Down Under]].

Beckett and Moss split off from the last incarnation of the band to tour with the ''Yacht Rock Revue'' both on cruise ships and other venues around the U.S in 2014. In 2015, Beckett and Moss appeared on tour with ''Rock The Yacht 2015'' with Little River Band as well as various dates with Orleans and [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]].

The two continued to tour in 2017 together, then separately: Peter Beckett as "The Voice of Player" and Moss as "Ronn Moss & Friends".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.centraljersey.com/time_off/player-is-bringing-classic-yacht-rock-to-harrah-s/article_ad90e5ba-8dc8-11e7-a06e-4f182c5e8b1b.html|title=Player is bringing classic 'Yacht Rock' to Harrah's|last=Morsch|first=Mike|work=CentralJersey.com|access-date=January 25, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Moss, though still listed an official member of the band, wasn't appearing with them in the latter part of 2017, where Mark Winley (ex-[[Johnny Winter]]) was standing in for him, alongside Beckett, Math, drummer Burleigh Drummond and new Singer/keyboardist Buster Akrey, known for writing the Power Rangers music.{{Cite news|url=https://www.soapoperaspy.com/2016/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-news-ronn-moss-where-is-he-now/|title='The Bold And The Beautiful' News: Ronn Moss - Where Is He Now? - Soap Opera Spy|date=2016-06-13|work=Soap Opera Spy|access-date=January 31, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> [http://playertheband.com/ronn-moss/]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/bold-outlook-ronn-moss-talks-life-bold-beautiful/|title=Bold Outlook: Ronn Moss Talks About Life After Bold & Beautiful|date=2016-11-09|work=Soap Opera Digest|access-date=February 14, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the summer of 2018, Beckett appeared with ''Rock The Yacht 2018'' alongside Ambrosia, John Ford Coley, [[Robbie Dupree]] and [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]].

Ronn Moss did his fourth solo tour of Australia with Player band mate Jawn Star in March 2019 and was slated to tour Italy for the first time in the summer of 2019 as well as releasing a new album, ''My Baby's Back''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Actor and singer Ronn Moss talks life, music |url=https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/entertainment/actor-and-singer-ronn-moss-talks-life-music-and-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-ahead-of-his-gold-coast-show-this-month/news-story/ |access-date=June 27, 2019 |work=Gold Coast Sun |date=2019-03-08}}</ref>

===Lawsuit and settlement===

In May 2018, Ronn Moss filed a lawsuit against former Player bandmate Peter Beckett over rights to the band's trademark. In November 2018, Moss and Beckett reached a settlement resulting in a stipulated court order, which stated that both Moss and Beckett owned common rights to the Player name and that the “mark is valid, subsisting, and enforceable."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hollywood Docket: Nicki Minaj Track "Sorry" Sparks Tracy Chapman Lawsuit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/nicki-minaj-track-sorry-sparks-tracy-chapman-lawsuit-1153115 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en}}</ref>

The court further ordered the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to update the registration for the Player trademark to “Peter Beckett and Ronn Moss, DBA", an unincorporated partnership. In the joint press release announcing their settlement, Moss and Beckett stated that in order to avoid any potential fan confusion, Moss and Becket have agreed to add their own name in front of the Player mark whenever they use it – i.e. Peter Beckett's Player or Ronn Moss’ Player.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longtime Soap Star Settles MAJOR Lawsuit! |url=https://soaphub.com/general-soap-operas/longtime-soap-star-ronn-moss-settles-major-lawsuit/ |website=Soap Hub |date=December 23, 2018}}</ref> According to the court order, the use of the name by either Beckett or Moss for individual use "without the consent of the other and in a manner which does not constitute fair use, is likely to cause consumer confusion as the source or sponsorship of such goods or services.”<ref>{{cite web |title=MOSS v BECKETT |url=https://kwikalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-12-18-doc-32-1-Stipulated-Judgment.pdf |access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ed Sheeran Asks Court to Reconsider Decision in 'Thinking Out Loud' Copyright Case |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/thr-esq/ed-sheeran-asks-court-reconsider-decision-thinking-loud-copyright-case-1172446 |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com}}</ref>

== Side projects ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Moss (with Beckett) has recorded two solo albums: ''I'm Your Man'' (2000) and ''Uncovered'' (2005). Both Moss and Beckett continue to play limited concert schedules as solo artists and teamed up to play in [[Australia]] in 2006 in support of ''Uncovered''.

On May 12, 2014, Player appeared on ABC's daytime drama/soap opera "General Hospital" as a surprise guest for the annual "Nurses Ball" segment. That lineup was Beckett (vocals, guitar), Moss (vocals, bass), Rob Math (vocals, guitar), Jawn Star (vocals, keyboard), and Bryan Hitt (drummer for REO Speedwagon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://player-theband.com/ronn-moss/|title=Ronn Moss – Player The Band|website=player-theband.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref>
