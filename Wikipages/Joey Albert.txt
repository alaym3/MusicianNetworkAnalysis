==Biography==
As a solo performer, Albert signed up initially with [[OctoArts International]] (now [[PolyEast Records]]) in 1984. Her first single, Gerry Paraiso's "Over and Over" (recorded January 1984), enjoyed tremendous airplay in local and national radio stations. OctoArts International released [[Louie Ocampo]] and Allan Ayque's "Tell Me", for which she received a Gold Record Award from the Philippine Association of the Recording Industry (PARI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carouselpinoy.com/joeycaroustar.html|title=Joey Albert|website=www.carouselpinoy.com}}</ref> Albert is also the first Filipino artist to record on CD.<ref name="auto3"/> Subsequently, Albert received the Best Female Vocalist trophy during the 1985 Cecil Awards, the Philippine music industry awards during the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philippineasiannewstoday.com/entertainment/television/5899-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-bring-youjoey-albert|title="Ladies and Gentlemen: We bring you Joey Albert", Philippine Asian News Today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050853/http://www.philippineasiannewstoday.com/entertainment/television/5899-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-bring-youjoey-albert|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

"Tell Me" established Albert as a major [[Filipino people|Filipino]] musical artist. Apart from "Over and Over" and "Tell Me", Albert's first album (''Joey Albert'') produced another hit, [[Robert More]]'s "A Million Miles Away". [[Cris Kuizon]]'s "Say You're Mine", on the other hand, foreshadowed a resurgence of the acoustic in Philippine popular music. Albert completed five more albums for OctoArts International: ''Touch of Love'' (1984), ''Expressions'' (1985), ''Joey'' (1986), ''Maligayang Pasko'' (1987) and ''Mixed Emotions'' (1989). These albums produced many hits, including [[Louie Ocampo]]&ndash;[[Freddie Santos]] collaborations like "Memories" (recorded January 1984), "Points of View" (duet with [[Pops Fernandez]], recorded January 1984) and "Yakapin mo ako" (recorded November 1985).Carousel Pinoy Entertainment

Other hits included [[Jose Mari Chan]]'s "I Remember the Boy" (recorded November 1985), Louie Ocampo and Jim Millbower's "Without You" (recorded November 1986), Louie Ocampo and Joey Albert's "Ikaw Lang ang Mamahalin" (recorded November 1986), Ray-Ann Fuentes's "Porma ng Porma" (recorded September 1988), Tony Perez and Allan Ayque's "Back in My Arms" (recorded September 1988), Louie Ocampo, Joey Albert and [[Janice de Belen]]'s "It's Over Now" (recorded November 1985), Louie Ocampo and Joey Albert's "You Threw It All Away" (recorded November 1986) and [[Sunny Ilacad]] and Joey Albert's "Na Sabihin Mo" (recorded November 1985).

Her first album for the company, entitled ''Joey Albert'', included commercial and artistic hits "Only a Mem'ry" and "Roses in the Rain", "How Can I Make You See", "Paano Sasabihin", "Sa Aking Pagbabalik", and "Iisa Pa Lamang".

From 1991 to 1994, Albert became the host and executive producer of ''Bahay Kalinga'', an award-winning public service outreach program at [[ABS-CBN]].<ref>[http://www.globalpinoy.com/gp.topics.v1/viewtopic.php?postid=4d9576a368964&channelName=4d9576a368964 "Pinoy Musicians: Joey Albert", Global Pinoy]</ref>

Albert's homecoming shows in the Philippines are eagerly awaited by her fans. ''Joey Albert... Once More'', her sell-out concert at the [[Music Museum]] on August 10 and 11, 2001, featured singer-composer [[Jeffrey Hidalgo]] with [[Gerard Salonga]] as musical director. During a press conference preceding the concert, esteemed movie critic and [[Malaysia|Malaya]] Sunday Magazine editor [[Mario Hernando]] pointed out that Albert holds the distinction of having released the first CD, a compilation of her greatest hits, in the Philippines.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030115163504/http://www.philstar.com:80/philstar/print.asp?article=46554 "Joey junks ‘diva’ title", Philippine Star]</ref>

In 2007, Albert recorded a new version of "Tell Me" as theme song of Star Cinema's "A Love Story", a romance-drama about infidelity starring Filipino actors [[Aga Muhlach]], [[Maricel Soriano]] and [[Angelica Panganiban]]. Albert's new version re-introduced her body of works to a new generation of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2007/08/08/11308/untold-story-behind-tell-me|title=The untold story behind Tell Me|website=philstar.com}}</ref>

In 2009, Albert and [[Basil Valdez]] were headline performers in "Incomparable", as part of a series of concerts organized by Viva Concerts & Events featuring iconic Original Pilipino Music (OPM) artists at the Skydome in SM City North EDSA ([[Quezon City]]). Viva scheduled several other shows, including [[Regine Velasquez]]’s "Most Requested", "Ladies of the ’90s" ([[Rachel Alejandro]], [[Jessa Zaragoza]], [[Roselle Nava]] and [[Geneva Cruz]]), "Men of the ’80s" ([[Raymond Lauchengco]], [[Randy Santiago]], [[Louie Heredia]] and [[Gino Padilla]]) and one topbilling [[Rachelle Ann Go]] and [[Jed Madela]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2009/07/27/490062/basil-joey-incomparable-tandem|title=Basil & Joey: Incomparable tandem|website=philstar.com}}</ref>

In 2010, Albert released "Songs of the Heart", made up of original Filipino compositions carefully chosen by producer [[Eugene Villaluz]] for Viva Records. The album contained some of Albert's personal favorites, as well as hits that came out after she left the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20100305-256851/Joey-Albert-waxes-her-personal-favorites |title="Joey Albert waxes her personal favorites".

Though she liked all of the songs included in the album, Albert picked "Forevermore" as her personal favorite largely because the material was originally done by [[Side A]], the same band that re-introduced Albert's "Tell Me" to local charts back in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/music/5746/joey-alberts-songs-of-the-heart-pays-homage-to-modern-opm-gems-|title=Joey Albert's Songs of the heart pays homage to modern OPM gems", pep.ph}}</ref>

In 2018, critic Ruel Mendoza cited Albert's rendition of "[[Kumukutikutitap]]" (1987) as one of ten most enduring Christmas songs in the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abante.com.ph/10-kantang-pamasko-na-tumatak-sa-puso-ng-mga-pinoy.htm|title=10 kantang Pamasko na tumatak sa puso ng mga Pinoy|website=abante.com.ph}}</ref> The song was composed by National Artist for Music [[Ryan Cayabyab]] and written by veteran film director and screenwriter [[Jose Javier Reyes]].

During the 2019 Aliw Awards, Albert was declared Best foreign-based Filipino performer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/247433-regine-velasquez-aliw-awards-2019|title=Regine Velasquez is 'Entertainer of the Year' at 2019 Aliw Awards|work=[[Rappler]]}}</ref> The 32nd edition of the entertainment awards also saw popular singer-actress [[Regine Velasquez]] winning the Entertainer of the Year Award.
