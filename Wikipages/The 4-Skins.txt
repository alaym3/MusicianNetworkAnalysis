'''The 4-Skins''' are an English working class [[Oi!]] band from the [[East End of London]], England.<ref name="Larkin"/> Originally composed of Gary Hodges (vocals), 'Hoxton' Tom McCourt (guitar), Steve 'H' Hamer (bass) and Gary Hitchcock (drums), they formed in 1979 and disbanded in 1984&nbsp;– although new line-ups formed in 2007 and 2008. Many of their songs dealt with violent topics, but the band has claimed they were discussing the realities of inner city life, not promoting violence.<ref name="The History of the 4Skins">{{Cite web|url=http://the4skins.tripod.com/id4.html|title=The History of the 4Skins|website=The4skins.tripod.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> Other 4-Skins song topics include police harassment, political corruption, war and unemployment.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=484–5}}</ref>

==Career==
Initially the band members had known each other from [[football (soccer)|football]], or from following bands such as [[Sham 69]] and Menace. Most of the original four band members were or had been [[skinhead]]s, thus the [[Foreskin|double meaning]] of the band's name.<ref name="Larkin"/> However, Steve Pear had a [[rockabilly]] style, and [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]]&nbsp;— who was a [[suedehead (subculture)|suedehead]]&nbsp;— was one of the leading participants of the [[mod revival]].<ref name="The History of the 4Skins"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://the4skins.tripod.com/id7.html|title=A Fistful of.........Feedback|website=The4skins.tripod.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> Prior to the release of the band's debut single, "One Law for Them", The 4-Skins contributed songs to the first three [[Oi!]] compilation albums, alongside bands such as [[Cockney Rejects]], [[Cock Sparrer]], [[The Business (band)|The Business]] and [[Angelic Upstarts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oisite.tripod.com/|title=Oi! the Web Site|website=Oisite.tripod.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>  The 4-Skins went through many personnel changes during their five-year existence, with only bassist/songwriter 'Hoxton' Tom McCourt being present in every line-up of the band.<ref name="Larkin"/> Other former members include Roi Pearce, who was also the frontman of The Last Resort, and Paul Swain, a guitarist who later joined the [[white power rock]] band [[Skrewdriver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands.php?full=1&bandid=6618|title=Skrewdriver|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>

In 2007, the band reformed with two original members &nbsp;— lead singer Gary Hodges and bassist Steve 'H' Harmer, plus guitarist Mick Geggus and drummer Andy Russell of Cockney Rejects. This line-up recorded two songs, "Chaos 2007" and "Glory Days" for the compilation album ''Kings of Streetpunk'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cockneyrejectsuk.co.uk/kingsofstreetpunkalbum.html|title=The Cockney Rejects The Kings Of Street Punk|date=28 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928211456/http://cockneyrejectsuk.co.uk/kingsofstreetpunkalbum.html|access-date=8 September 2020|archive-date=28 September 2008}}</ref> released by the [[independent record label]]  [[G&R London]].

In 2008, Hodges formed a new version of the band under the name '''Gary Hodges' 4-Skins'''. This line-up played three shows&nbsp;– one in [[Berlin]] at the Punk and Disorderly festival, in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], at the East Coast Oi Fest<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mad-tourbooking.de/punk_and_disorderly/|title=Punk & Disorderly 2020 |website=Mad-tourbooking.de|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.craigdowntown.com/index.html]{{dead link|date=August 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and as the headlining act on the final day of the [[Blackpool]] Rebellion punk festival in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/rebellion-blackpool-bands.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805040141/http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/rebellion-blackpool-bands.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2008|title=Confirmed Bands|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> Two newly recorded tracks were also released for free on The 4-Skins' official web page. Both were covers of [[Slade]] songs&nbsp;– "[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]" and "Thanks for the Memories". Following this, the band decided to continue recording and touring. On 4 April 2010, they released a studio album,  ''The Return'', on German label, Randale Records.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.the4-skins.co.uk/4skinsnews.html|title=4-skins news|publisher=The Official 4-Skins Website|access-date=26 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107011212/http://www.the4-skins.co.uk/4skinsnews.html|archive-date=7 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
