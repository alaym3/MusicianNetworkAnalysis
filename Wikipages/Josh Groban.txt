==Career==

===1997–2001: Debut===
In late 1997, the 16-year-old Groban was introduced by his [[vocal coach]], [[Seth Riggs]], to [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning producer and arranger [[David Foster]] and future manager Brian Avnet.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} At the time, Groban had no recording experience and was preparing for his studies at Carnegie Mellon.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Groban worked for David Foster as a rehearsal singer on a series of high-profile events, including the January 1999 California gubernatorial inauguration of [[Gray Davis]] and the [[41st Grammy Awards|1999 Grammy Awards]] where—as a stand-in for [[Andrea Bocelli]]—he rehearsed Foster's "[[The Prayer (Céline Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]" with [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]]. According to Avnet, Groban was very nervous about standing in for Bocelli and had to be talked into it; his performance prompted the show hostess, [[Rosie O'Donnell]], to ask him to appear on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her show]] the following week, which in turn led to an appearance on ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_BrianAvnetInterview.html |title=Interview with Brian Avnet |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=16 Feb 2004 |access-date=21 Dec 2010}}</ref> Creator [[David E. Kelley]] wrote the character Malcolm Wyatt for Groban in the season finale, aired in May 2001. Groban as Malcolm Wyatt was so popular that the show received upwards of 8,000 emails from viewers;<ref name=joshofcl/> thereafter, Groban was asked to return the next season to reprise his role as Wyatt and to perform "[[To Where You Are]]". Avnet claims this sequence of events effectively got Groban's career off the ground.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

Groban was offered a recording contract at [[Warner Bros. Records]] through Foster's [[143 Records]] imprint. Avnet told [[HitQuarters]] that Warner Bros. initially proved resistant to the deal because "They were afraid they wouldn't be able to get a voice like that on radio."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Explaining his reasons for signing the artist, Foster said: "I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with."<ref name=joshofcl>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshgroban.com/ |title=Official Josh Groban site |publisher=Joshgroban.com |access-date=2011-03-12}}</ref> Under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on classics such as "Gira Con Me Questa Notte" and "Alla Luce Del Sole".

Groban performed "[[There for Me (Sarah Brightman song)|There For Me]]" with [[Sarah Brightman]] on her 2000–01 ''La Luna World Tour'', and was featured on her "La Luna" concert DVD. He recorded "For Always" with [[Lara Fabian]] for the movie soundtrack of ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001). Groban performed in many benefit shows, including "The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children," alongside [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Don Henley]], and [[Robin Williams]]; "Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation" which honored [[Michael J. Fox]] and others; "The Family Celebration" (2001), which was co-hosted by President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[David E. Kelley]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raised funds for cancer research.

His self-titled debut album ''[[Josh Groban (album)|Josh Groban]]'' was released on November 20, 2001. Over the next year it went from [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] to [[Music recording sales certification|double-platinum]].<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/120602.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015200811/http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/120602.asp|date=October 15, 2006}}</ref>

Groban's second album ''[[Closer (Josh Groban album)|Closer]]'', produced and written by Foster, was released on November 11, 2003. Groban said he believed that his second album was a better reflection of him, and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of his personality from listening to it.{{cquote|What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title.<ref name="joshofcl"/>}}

On November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, ''Live At The [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek]]'', was released; it was also shown as a ''[[Great Performances]]'' special on [[PBS]]. That same year, Groban performed "Remember When It Rained", backed by a full orchestra, at the [[American Music Awards]], where he was nominated for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category; he was also nominated for a [[People's Choice Award]]. His recording of "Believe" secured an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in 2005 for the songwriters [[Glen Ballard]] and [[Alan Silvestri]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/2000-2009/77nominees.html |publisher=Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences|title=Nominees & Winners for the 77th Academy Awards (2005) |access-date=2012-01-19}}</ref> and earned them a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards|ceremony held in February 2006]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r714374/charts-awards/grammy|pure_url=yes}} ''The Polar Express'' Grammy Awards] AllMusic.com.

He performed two tracks with the South African group [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], "Lullaby" and [[Weeping (song)|"Weeping".]]  Groban's "Awake" world tour visited 71 cities between February and August 2007, and toured Australia and the Philippines with [[Lani Misalucha]] as his special guest in October 2007.

He said, "I am fortunate enough to have had many really big moments in my career. I think the mistake a lot of people in my position make is to always search for the next big thing. I am looking forward to playing some small theaters. I'm looking forward to writing more. I want to delve further into my acting career and explore some of the film and TV opportunities that I haven't had time for. My outlook is to expect the unexpected.

==Voice==
Various music critics have described Groban's voice in different ways, with some referring to him as a [[tenor]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0562707520071205 |title=Groban leads U.S. pop charts in slow sales week |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-12-05 |access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref> and others as a [[baritone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thatjoshgrobanguy.com/ |title=That Josh Groban Guy |publisher=That Josh Groban Guy |access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/08/earlyshow/leisure/music/main3807792.shtml |title=Josh Groban's "Full-Circle Moment" |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-02-08 |access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref> In performance, Groban's music goes as low as G<sub>2</sub> (as in the songs "[[To Where You Are]]", "[[Higher Window]]", and "The World We Knew (Over and Over)") and extends up to at least B<sub>4</sub> (as heard in "The Duel" from ''[[Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812]]''<ref name="Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812 - Original Broadway Cast Recording">{{cite web|title=The Duel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYPDlTjCMo&t=4m46s| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/vuYPDlTjCMo| archive-date=2021-10-30|date=11 May 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>). This places his voice lower than the usual tenor range on the low end (although still within the [[vocal fry register]] of a tenor), and just short of tenor C, and therefore above the baritone range, on the high end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipasource.com/baritone |title=IPA Source Baritone |publisher=Ipasource.com |access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref><ref name=McKinney>{{cite book|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults|last= McKinney|first= James|year= 1994|publisher= Genovex Music Group|isbn= 978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref>

There is no authoritative system of [[voice classification in non-classical music]]. The problem lies in the fact that classical terms are used to describe not merely various vocal ranges, but specific vocal timbres each unique to those respective ranges, and produced by the classical training techniques with which most popular singers are not intimately familiar and which are not universally employed by the few that are. In a 2002 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, Groban described himself as a "tenor in training".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7D71538F93BA15754C0A9649C8B63|title= MUSIC; The New Boy Wonder of the Voice|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 2008|access-date=2015-05-03|first=Matthew|last=Gurewitsch}}</ref> He mentioned during his appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in December 2013 that he is a high [[lyric baritone]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} On Twitter, in March 2012, he had also mentioned that he is a baritone "with some high notes up my sleeve."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/joshgroban/status/179815638204821504 |title=Twitter / joshgroban: A baritone with some high notes |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref>
