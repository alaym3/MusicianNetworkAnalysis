'''Zedbazi''' ({{lang-fa|زدبازی}}) is an [[Iran]]ian [[Iranian hip hop|hip hop]] band, formed by longtime friends Saman Wilson and Mehrad Hidden and later joined by Sohrab MJ, Sijal, Alireza JJ and Nassim. They are known as the pioneers of [[gangsta rap]] in [[Iran]].<ref name="sfgate">[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Rebels-of-rap-reign-in-Iran-3287827.php Rebels of rap reign in Iran]</ref><ref name="independent">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/irans-illegal-rappers-want-cultural-revolution-774943.html Iran's 'illegal' rappers want cultural revolution.]</ref> The band's most famous song called tabestoon kootahe is largely credited as the first wildly heard piece of Persian Rap.

The band was officially suspended in October 2014 due to personal reasons. On May 20, 2020 Zedbazi announced they are back on their [[Instagram]] page. Shortly after on June 10, 2020, they released two single tracks named ''Yakh'' (یخ; meaning ice), a diss track to “Moltafet” and ''Bache Mahal'' (بچه محل; meaning) talking about their past path to becoming famous from the beginning of [[Persian Rap]] in Iran. The songs were released on Radio Javan.

==History==
===Foundation===
The Foundation of the band dates back to early 2002. It was started up by Saman Rezapour ([[Saman Wilson]]) and Mehrad Mostofi-Rad ([[Mehrad Hidden]]), who were friends in a high school in [[Tehran]]. Despite having prior experiences in music, the formation of the band as in a hip hop style was motivated by Saman's cover of [[Eminem]]'s ''[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]'', which was performed with a matched vulgar lyrics written in [[Persian language|Persian]]. After moving to [[London]], they met Sohrab Mostafavi ([[Sohrab MJ]]) in a summer school, where he joined the band after collaborating on ''Kal Kal'' ({{lang|fa|کل‌کل}} – {{lang|fa-Latn|Kal-kal}}, "Argue"), a cover of [[D12]]'s ''Rap Game''.

The first collaboration of Siavash Jalali ([[Sijal]]) and Alireza Jazayeri ([[Alireza JJ]]) with the band's earlier members was ''Berim Faza'' ({{lang|fa|بریم فضا}} – {{lang|fa-Latn|Berim Fazā}}, "(Let's) Go to Space"), produced by [[Alireza JJ]] in 2005. Siavash and Alireza were best friends in [[Paris]], where they had also met [[Nassim Parize]], an Iranian finalist at the French reality TV show ''[[Star Academy (French TV series)|Star Academy]]'' (Season 5) with her twin sister, Neissa.

The three future band members officially joined Zedbazi by releasing ''Tabestoon Kootahe'' ({{lang|fa|تابستون کوتاهه}} – {{lang|fa-Latn|Tābestun Kutāh e}}, "Summer is Short") in September 2007. They brought a new style into the band, as [[Mehrad Hidden]] remarks in [[Ardeshir Ahmadi]]'s ''Zedbazi Documentary''. "The formula they brought was different than ours. Our formula was necessary for the inception, theirs was necessary for the continuation."<ref name="doc">{{cite AV media|url=http://www.radiojavan.com/videos/video/zedbazi-documentary|title=Zedbazi Documentary|date=|people=Ahmadi, Ardeshir (director)|publisher=[[Radio Javan]]|trans-title=|medium=Documentary film}}</ref>

The name ''Zedbazi'' ({{lang|fa|زدبازی}} – {{lang|fa-Latn|Zedbāzi}}) consists of the words ''zed'' ("Z", the first letter of ''Zakhar'' meaning mate) and ''bāzi'' ("play"). It is what Saman and his friends used to call each other in high school,<ref name="doc"/> and according to the band, it can mean both "an old and close friend" and "an old-fashioned and fusty person"; it depends on the purpose. Therefore, ''Zedbazi'' can be translated as "the ''Zakhar'' acts."

===Popularity===
[[File:Zed bazi.JPG|thumb|Zedbazi in the [[Iran]]ian Intergalactic Music Festival (October 22, 2006).]]
Zedbazi emerged at the same time as [[Hichkas]], and rapidly garnered huge popularity between the youth, due to their controversial lyrics, littered with profanities, depictions of sexual encounters and drug use.<ref name="revrap">[[Al Jazeera]]: ''[https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/inside-irans-revolutionary-rap-120749194.html Inside Iran's 'revolutionary' rap] – September 2014</ref>

''Tabestoon Kootahe'' is considered Zedbazi's most popular song, which was released in September 2007. It is about "the bittersweet feeling" of summertime in Iran.<ref name="revrap"/>

===Temporary Dissolution===
In October 2014, the band announced a separation between the members. It was due to some internal disagreements. [[Saman Wilson]], who had not been attending to the band's songs after ''Tabestoon Kootahe'',<ref name="doc"/> returned and joined [[Mehrad Hidden]], forming a new band named ''Bozorg'' ({{lang|fa|بزرگ}} – {{lang|fa-Latn|Bozorg}}, "Great"). [[Alireza JJ]], [[Sijal]], and [[Nassim Parize|Nassim]] decided to work together, and [[Sohrab MJ]] worked alone. 

===Return===
Zedbazi announced their return to [[Persian Rap]] in June 2020 by releasing two tracks (Yakh and Bache Mahal).<ref name="podcast8">{{Citation | title = PODCAST #8 ANSWERS ON BOZORG ALBUM AND ZEDBAZI | publisher = Alireza JJ | date = February 25, 2015 | url = http://www.alirezajj.com/jjs-site/podcast-8-answers-on-bozorg-album-and-zedbazi}}</ref>

==Discography==
