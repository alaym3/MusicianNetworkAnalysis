'''Gabrielle Ann Aplin''' (born 1992) is an English singer-songwriter. After amassing a following for her acoustic music covers on [[YouTube]], Aplin signed a recording deal with [[Parlophone]] in February 2012. She rose to prominence the following November when she was selected to record the soundtrack for a [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] television commercial with a cover of [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]'s "[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)#Gabrielle Aplin version (2012)|The Power of Love]]", which went on to top the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Her debut album, ''[[English Rain]]'', was released in May 2013 to positive reviews. It debuted at number two on the [[UK Album Chart]] and led to more singles: "[[Please Don't Say You Love Me]]", "[[Panic Cord]]", "[[Home (Gabrielle Aplin song)|Home]]" and "[[Salvation (Gabrielle Aplin song)|Salvation]]". ''English Rain'' has since been certified Gold in the UK, selling over 100,000 copies. Aplin's second album, ''[[Light Up the Dark (album)|Light Up the Dark]]'', was released in September 2015, followed by the release of her third album, ''[[Dear Happy]]'', in January 2020. She has also released multiple extended plays throughout her career.
