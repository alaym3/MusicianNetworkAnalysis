== Career ==
Before her first album, Irina was in the music business for about a decade. She toured for six years in a band called Playa, played both in rock bars and [[nightclubs]] and sang everything from Finnish pop to rock and [[Soul music|soul]]. She was also a member of the so-called therapy band Redux.

In August 2002, her friend Toni Wirtanen asked her to sing a song he wrote for a television series. The song was for the show ''Juulian totuudet'' ("''Juulia's Truths''"). After the project ended, Wirtanen and Irina decided to continue to work together and did the songs "Öiden kruunu" ("The Crown of the Nights") and "Hiirenloukku" ("Mousetrap"). In autumn of the same year, the songwriting continued and out of these songs came Irina's debut album.

The performance of her first album was on 17 March 2005 in [[Lahti]]. The album, ''[[Vahva (album)|Vahva]]'' (''Strong''), came out on 22 March 2004 and it stayed in the Finnish charts for 24 weeks. A gold edition of this album came out in October 2004 which had two previously unreleased songs.

Her second album, ''Älä riko kaavaa'', was released on 26 October 2005. Her third album, ''Liiba laaba'', was released on 28 March 2007 and sold gold.
