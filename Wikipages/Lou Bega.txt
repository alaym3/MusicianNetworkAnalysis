'''David Lubega Balemezi''' (born 13 April 1975), better known by his stage name '''Lou Bega''', is a German singer. His 1999 song "[[Mambo No. 5#Lou Bega version|Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit of...)]]", a remake of [[Pérez Prado]]'s 1949 instrumental piece, reached number 1 in many European countries and was nominated for a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]].

Bega's musical signature consists of combining musical elements of the 1940s and 1950s with modern beats and grooves.

In 2019, Bega released "Scatman & Hatman", his first release since 2013. The track uses vocal samples from the 1994 single "[[Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)]]" by John Paul Larkin, better known as [[Scatman John]]. Shortly after the track's release, he told Jason Lipshitz of ''Billboard'' that he was inspired to create the track by the fact that Larkin died in the same year that "Mambo No. 5" was released, adding,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8516252/lou-bega-interview-scatman-hatman-mambo-no-5-star |title=A Little Bit of New Lou Bega: 'Mambo No. 5' Star Discusses 'Scatman & Hatman,' His First Single In Six Years |first=Jason |last=Lipshitz |website=Billboard.com |date=17 June 2019 |access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref>{{blockquote|We found out how much [John and I] had in common. The guy died of a brain tumor in 1999 — my own father died of a similar brain tumor in 1999 as well, just four weeks before the mambo came out. And then of course, there's the suits, and the mustaches, and the retro style.}}
