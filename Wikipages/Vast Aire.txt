'''Theodore Arrington III''' (born February 5, 1978<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/02/happy-birthday-vast-aire/|title=Happy Birthday, Vast Aire|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|first=Sidney|last=Madden|date=February 5, 2015|access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref>), better known by his stage name '''Vast Aire''', is an American [[rapping|rapper]] from New York City. He is one half of the New York hip hop duo [[Cannibal Ox]], which consists of him and fellow rapper [[Vordul Mega]]. He is also a member of the rap group Atoms Family. He was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], then lived in [[Jamaica, Queens]] before moving to [[Harlem]],<ref>[http://cultureking.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/culture-king-podcast-vast-aire-2004-interview/ :: Culture King Interviews - Vast Aire ::]</ref> and became acquainted with the underground rap scene, performing in many clubs while still a teenager. He was once a part of the [[underground hip hop]] group [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]].

==Career==
Vast Aire's fame increased significantly as part of Cannibal Ox with Vordul Mega. Their debut album, ''[[The Cold Vein]]'', recorded with [[record producer|producer]] [[El-P]], was released in 2001 to critical acclaim. Since then, Vast Aire has pursued solo interests. His first solo album ''[[Look Mom... No Hands]]'' was released in April 2004. This was followed by ''The Best Damn Rap Show'', a collaborative effort with DJ Mighty Mi from [[The High & Mighty]] in 2005. These solo projects did not break Vast Aire from his obligations at [[Definitive Jux]] with [[Cannibal Ox]]. Vast has since gone on to work with members from the Megahertz crew, and was a member of The Weathermen alongside [[Copywrite (rapper)|Copywrite]], [[Yak Ballz]], [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]], [[Aesop Rock]], the late [[Camu Tao]], and [[Tame One]]. However, he was kicked out of the Weathermen by Camu Tao after allegedly stealing from both Yak Ballz and Tame One. In 2009 he denounced the Weathermen group as a whole.  This followed rapper and Weathermen founder Cage writing the song "Nothing Left to Say" about Vast Aire trying to profit from Camu Tao's death and then calling him out on his [[Myspace]] page.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Vast Aire is also a part of a group called LXG, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Name ==
When asked about the meaning of his name, Vast Aire explained: "I guess it means mad styles. I think it means a lot of attitude. Vast Aire. I have a very wordy type of style. Vast was given to me by a friend of mine I went to school with and the Aire pretty much came from me being a junior. My name is Theodore Arrington II. I used to spell it proper. H-E-I-R. But, in the past couple of years, I switched it to A-I-R-E."{{Attribution needed|date=March 2011}}
