'''David Kenneth Ritz Van Ronk''' (June 30, 1936 &ndash; February 10, 2002) was an American [[folk singer]]. An important figure in the [[American folk music revival]] and New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] scene in the 1960s, he was nicknamed the "Mayor of [[MacDougal Street]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dave Van Ronk|url=https://folkways.si.edu/dave-van-ronk/american-folk-blues-gospel/music/article/smithsonian|access-date=2021-02-01|website=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings|language=en-US}}</ref>

Van Ronk's work ranged from old English ballads to [[blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]], and [[swing (genre)|swing]]. He was also known for performing instrumental [[ragtime]] guitar music, especially his transcription of "St. Louis Tickle" and [[Scott Joplin]]'s "[[Maple Leaf Rag]]". Van Ronk was a widely admired avuncular figure in "the Village", presiding over the coffeehouse folk culture and acting as a friend to many up-and-coming artists by inspiring, assisting, and promoting them. Folk performers he befriended include [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Dylan recorded Van Ronk's arrangement of the traditional song "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" on his first album, which [[the Animals]] turned into a chart-topping rock single in 1964,<ref>Larry Rother.

Van Ronk received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ([[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]) in December 1997. He died in a New York hospital of cardiopulmonary failure while undergoing postoperative treatment for [[colon cancer]].<ref>Chris Morris (February 12, 2002).

==Life and career==
Van Ronk was born in [[Brooklyn]] to a family that was "mostly Irish, despite the Dutch name".<ref>''Rock of Ages: The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll''. p. 255, Pearson: 1987; {{ISBN|0137822936}}</ref> He moved from Brooklyn to [[Queens]] around 1945 and began attending Holy Child Jesus Catholic School, whose students were mainly of Irish descent. He had been performing in a [[Barbershop music|barbershop quartet]] since 1949, but left before finishing high school, and spent time in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]].<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/meet-the-folk-singer-who-inspired-inside-llewyn-davis-243730/</ref>

His first professional gigs playing tenor banjola were with various traditional jazz bands around New York, of which he later observed: "We wanted to play traditional jazz in the worst way&nbsp;... and we did!" But the [[trad jazz]] revival had already passed its prime, and Van Ronk turned to performing blues he had stumbled across while shopping for jazz 78s, by artists like [[Furry Lewis]] and [[Mississippi John Hurt]].

By about 1958, he was firmly committed to the folk-blues style, accompanying himself with his own acoustic guitar. He performed [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[folk music]], occasionally writing his own songs but generally arranging the work of earlier artists and his folk revival peers.

He became noted both for his large physical stature and his expansive charisma, which bespoke an intellectual, cultured gentleman of many talents. Among his many interests were cooking, [[science fiction]] (he was active for some time in [[science fiction fandom]], referring to it as "mind rot",<ref name= "memoir">{{cite book|author=Dave Van Ronk, Elijah Wald|title=The Mayor of MacDougal Street|place=New York|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2005|pages=230|isbn=978-0306814792}}</ref> and contributed to [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]]), world history, and politics. During the 1960s he supported radical left-wing political causes and was a member of the [[Libertarian League]] and the Trotskyist American Committee for the [[Fourth International]] (ACFI, later renamed the Workers League <ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Jackson Alexander|year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eUtQjseKaIC&pg=PA552 |title=International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: a documented analysis of the movement |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |page=552, para. 2 |isbn=978-0-8223-1066-2}}</ref>). In 1974, he appeared at "An Evening For [[Salvador Allende]]", a concert organized by [[Phil Ochs]], alongside such other performers as his old friend Bob Dylan, to protest the overthrow of the democratic socialist government of Chile and to aid refugees from the U.S.-backed military junta led by [[Augusto Pinochet]]. After Ochs's suicide in 1976, Van Ronk joined the many performers who played at his memorial concert in the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], playing his bluesy version of the traditional folk ballad "[[He Was A Friend Of Mine]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.clearlight.com/~acsa/introjs.htm?/~acsa/songfile/HE1WASA.HTM|title=He Was A Friend of Mine (Just A Hand To Hold)|publisher=Grateful Dead Lyric & Song Finder|access-date=August 13, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708164150/http://www3.clearlight.com/~acsa/introjs.htm?%2F~acsa%2Fsongfile%2FHE1WASA.HTM|archive-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> Although Van Ronk was less politically active in later years, he remained committed to anarchist and socialist ideals and was a dues-paying member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) almost until his death.<!--cited in song's article-->

Van Ronk was among 13 people arrested at the [[Stonewall Inn]] June 28, 1969—the night of the [[Stonewall Riots]], which is widely credited as the start of the gay rights movement. Van Ronk had been dining at a neighboring restaurant, joined the riot against the Stonewall's police occupation, and was dragged from the crowd into the building by police deputy inspector [[Seymour Pine]].<ref name="bausum">{{cite book |last=Bausum |first=Ann |date=2015 |title=Stonewall: Breaking Out in the Fight for Gay Rights |edition=1st |chapter=Chapter 5: Revolution |pages=50–51|publisher=Viking}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|author=Lucian Truscott IV|work=Village Voice |date=July 3, 1969|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/voice_19690703_truscott.html|format=Transcript|access-date=August 14, 2010}} [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/voice1.html page scans]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Carter, David|title=Stonewall: The riots that sparked the gay revolution|isbn= 978-0312671938|publisher=St. Martin’s Griffin|year=2010|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Stonewall/j04jLSvGNSMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22+folksinger+was+yet+a+third+person%22&pg=PA155&printsec=frontcover|pages=155–156}}</ref> The police slapped and punched Van Ronk to the point of near unconsciousness, handcuffed him to a radiator near the doorway, and decided to charge him for assault.<ref name="full moon">{{cite news|author=Howard Smith|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2015/06/26/full-moon-over-the-stonewall-howard-smiths-account-of-the-stonewall-riots/|title=Full Moon over the Stonewall|publisher=The Village Voice|date=July 3, 1969|access-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> Recalling the expanding riot, Van Ronk said, "There were more people out there [outside the building] when I came out than when I went in.

In 2000, he performed at Blind Willie's in [[Atlanta]], speaking fondly of his impending return to Greenwich Village. He reminisced over tunes like "You've Been a Good Old Wagon", a song teasing a worn-out lover, which he ruefully remarked had seemed humorous to him back in 1962. He was married to Terri Thal in the 1960s,<ref>Terri Thal [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/12/dave_van_ronk_inside_llewyn_davis.php Dave Van Ronk's Ex-Wife Takes Us Inside Inside Llewyn Davis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225225745/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/12/dave_van_ronk_inside_llewyn_davis.php |date=2015-02-25 }}, ''Village Voice'', December 13, 2013.</ref> lived for many years with Joanne Grace, then married Andrea Vuocolo, with whom he spent the rest of his life.

Van Ronk has been described{{by whom|date=July 2020}} as an irreverent and incomparable guitar artist and interpreter of black blues and folk, with an uncannily precise gift for impersonation. [[Joni Mitchell]] said that his rendition of her song "[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]" (which he called "Clouds") was her favorite version of the song.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joni Mitchell Library - Top Tunes: Evening Star (Washington DC), December 7, 1968|url=https://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=4361|access-date=2021-09-08|website=jonimitchell.com}}</ref>

His guitar work, for which he credits Tom Paley as fingerpicking teacher, is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision.<ref>{{cite book |last=Milward |first=John |author-link= |date=June 2021 |title=Americanaland: Where Country & Western Met Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/92gqf6qf9780252043918.html |location= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=}}</ref> It shows similarities to [[Mississippi John Hurt]]'s, but Van Ronk's main influence was the [[Reverend Gary Davis]], who conceived the guitar as "a piano around his neck." Van Ronk took this pianistic approach and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and [[Duke Ellington]]. He ranks high in bringing blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, as well as introducing the folk world to the complex harmonies of [[Kurt Weill]] in his many Brecht-Weill interpretations, and was one of a very few hardcore traditional revivalists to move with the times, bringing old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell and [[Leonard Cohen]]. During this crucial period, he performed with Dylan and similar artists and spent many years teaching guitar in Greenwich Village, including to [[Christine Lavin]], [[David Massengill]], [[Terre Roche]] and [[Suzzy Roche]]. He influenced his protégé [[Danny Kalb]] and [[the Blues Project]]. The Japanese singer Masato Tomobe, American pop-folk singer Geoff Thais and the musician and writer Elijah Wald learned from him as well. He once said, "Painting is all about space, and music is all about time." In his autobiography, Dylan writes, "I'd heard Van Ronk back in the Midwest on records and thought he was pretty great, copied some of his recordings phrase for phrase. [...] Van Ronk could howl and whisper, turn blues into ballads and ballads into blues. I loved his style. He was what the city was all about. In Greenwich Village, Van Ronk was king of the street, he reigned supreme."<ref>{{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Bob|title=Chronicles: Volume One|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=0743272587|pages=15–16|edition=illustrated|author-link=Bob Dylan|chapter=Chapter 1: Markin' Up the Score|date=Oct 11, 2004|title-link=Chronicles: Volume One}}</ref>

Thanks to what he had learned from Davis, Van Ronk was among the first to adapt traditional jazz and ragtime to the solo acoustic guitar.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} His guitar arrangements of such ragtime hits as "St. Louis Tickle", "[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]", "The Pearls" and "[[Maple Leaf Rag]]" continue to frustrate and challenge aspiring guitar players.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He also wrote compositions of his own in the classic styles, such as "Antelope Rag".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} His song "[[Last Call (Dave Van Ronk song)|Last Call]]" is the source of the title of [[Lawrence Block]]'s book ''When the Sacred Ginmill Closes''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[Coen brothers]] film ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'' follows a folk singer similar to Van Ronk, and incorporates anecdotes based on Van Ronk's life.<ref name="fischer">{{cite news|author=Russ Fischer|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/coen-bros-film-based-folk-musician-dave-van-ronk/#more-106431|title=The Coen Bros.

Van Ronk was mentioned among the dead musicians and recording artists in the song "Mirror Door" by [[the Who]] in 2006 on the album [[Endless Wire (The Who album)|''Endless Wire'']].

==Personal characteristics==
Van Ronk refused for many years to fly and never learned to drive (he took trains or buses or, when possible, recruited a girlfriend or young musician as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village for any extended period of time (having stayed in California for a short time in the 1960s).<ref>Van Ronk & Wald (2005).  pp. 113-114.</ref> Van Ronk's trademark [[stoneware]] jug of [[Tullamore Dew]] was frequently seen on stage next to him in his early days.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] described Van Ronk as "the musical mayor of MacDougal Street":

<blockquote>...a tall, garrulous hairy man of three quarters, or, more accurately, three fifths Irish descent. Topped by light brownish hair and a leonine beard, which he smoothed down several times a minute, he resembled an unmade bed strewn with books, record jackets, pipes, empty whiskey bottles, lines from obscure poets, finger picks, and broken guitar strings. He was [Dylan]'s first New York guru. Van Ronk was a walking museum of the blues. Through an early interest in jazz, he had gravitated toward black music—its jazz pole, its jug-band and ragtime center, its blues bedrock.... His manner was rough and testy, disguising a warm, sensitive core.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robert Shelton |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bob_Dylan_No_Direction_Home/pjA21i7xCUMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22garrulous+hairy+man+of+three+quarters%22&pg=PT174&printsec=frontcover |title=Bob Dylan: No Direction Home |publisher=W.
