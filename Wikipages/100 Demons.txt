'''100 Demons''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. Being fans of tattoos, the band derived their name from a book of traditional Japanese tattoo artwork by [[Horiyoshi III]]. The band usually incorporates their [[Agnostic]] beliefs into their lyrics.<ref name=lyrics>{{cite web|title=Lyrics to 100 Demons|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/1/100/|website=Lyricsfreak.com|access-date=1 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=lyrics2>{{cite web|title=About 100 Demons|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/1/100+demons/|website=Lyricsfreak.com|access-date=1 September 2013}}</ref>  

After over a decade of playing in the Connecticut hardcore scene, [[Deathwish Inc.]] announced the signing of 100 Demons to a record contract in 2003. In a press release the label was quoted as saying "Today's 100 DEMONS encapsulate a viciousness and ravenous intensity that few could achieve." The band then found themselves at Planet Z Studios with producer [[Zeuss]] ([[Hatebreed]], [[Shadows Fall]]) recording their [[100 Demons (album)|self-titled album]].

The video for the song "Repeat Process" was featured on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.

In 2019, Pete Morcey announced his new folk-influenced side project entitled Murmur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/on-the-hunt-for-a-murmur/|title=ON THE HUNT FOR A MURMUR|website=Maximumvolumemusic.com|date=January 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2019/01/30/murmur-stream-the-debut-song-funeral-of-the-hunt/|title=MURMUR *STREAM THE DEBUT SONG, "FUNERAL OF THE HUNT"|website=Ventsmagazine.com|date=January 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://lockedinmagazine.com/murmur-with-members-of-100-demons-call-it-arson-release-first-track-funeral-of-the-heart/ {{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>
