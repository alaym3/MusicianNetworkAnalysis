==Early life==
{{See also|Mangeshkar family}}[[File:LataMangeshkar14.jpg|thumb|right|Childhood photo of Lata Mangeshkar]]

Lata Mangeshkar was born in 1929, the eldest daughter of [[Pandit]] [[Deenanath Mangeshkar]], a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] and [[Konkani people|Konkani]] musician and his wife Shevanti<ref name=toi1>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|title=Unplugged: Lata Mangeshkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spotlight/Unplugged-Lata-Mangeshkar/articleshow/4625384.cms|date=20 September 2009}}</ref> in [[Indore]] (in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]] and then the capital of the [[princely state]] of [[Indore State|Indore]] which was part of the [[Central India Agency]] in [[British Raj|British India]]). Her father, Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] woman from [[Thalner]], [[Bombay Presidency]] (now in northwest [[Maharashtra]]), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.<ref name=toi2>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Meet-Lata-ben-Mangeshkar/articleshow/5066253.cms|location=[[Ahmedabad]]|title=Meet Lata-ben Mangeshkar!|first=Ashish|last=Vashi|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=29 September 2009}}</ref>

Lata's paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a [[Karhade Brahmin]] priest who performed the [[abhisheka]]m of the [[Shiva]] [[lingam]] at the [[Mangueshi Temple]] in [[Goa]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Book on Lata Mangeshkar: A Musical Journey out by January 2016|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/book-on-lata-mangeshkar-a-musical-journey-out-by-january-2016/articleshow/49134710.cms|access-date=2020-10-31}}</ref> and her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, belonged to the [[Gomantak Maratha Samaj]] community of [[Goa]] and Lata's maternal grandfather was the Gujarati businessman Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner; and Mangeshkar learnt [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] folk songs such as [[Garba (dance)|garbas]] of [[Pavagadh]] from her maternal grandmother.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bharatan|first=Raju|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK00DQAAQBAJ|title=Asha Bhosle: A Musical Biography|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Hay House, Inc|isbn=978-93-85827-16-7|pages=5–7|language=en}}</ref>

Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of [[Mangeshi]], [[Goa]]. Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, ''BhaawBandhan''.<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema">{{cite book | last = Khubchandani | first = Lata |editor=[[Gulzar]] |editor2=[[Govind Nihalani]] |editor3=Saibal Chatterjee | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema | year = 2003 | publisher = Popular Prakashan | isbn = 81-7991-066-0 | pages = 486–487}}</ref>

Lata is the eldest child of the family. [[Meena Mangeshkar|Meena]], [[Asha Bhosle|Asha]], [[Usha Mangeshkar|Usha]], and [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar|Hridaynath]], in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.

Lata received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (''[[Sangeet Natak]]'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). On her first day of school,<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/> she left school because they would not allow her to bring her sister Asha with her, as she would often bring her younger sister with her.

==Singing career==
{{Main|List of songs by Lata Mangeshkar}}

===Early career in the 1940s===

In 1942, when Lata was 13, her father died of [[heart disease]]. [[Master Vinayak]] (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress.

Lata sang the song "Naachu Yaa Gade, Khelu Saari Mani Haus Bhaari", which was composed by Sadashivrao Nevrekar for Vasant Joglekar's [[Marathi language|Marathi]] movie ''Kiti Hasaal'' (1942), but the song was dropped from the final cut. Vinayak gave her a small role in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi movie ''Pahili Mangalaa-gaur'' (1942), in which she sang "Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai" which was composed by Dada Chandekar.<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/> Her first Hindi song was "Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu" for the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Gajaabhaau'' (1943).

Lata moved to [[Mumbai]] in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessons in [[Hindustani classical music]] from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhindibazaar Gharana.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biographies of Maestros |url=http://swaramandakini.com/Biographies_maestros.html |website=Swaramandakini.com |access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=5 unknown facts about Lata Mangeshkar |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/5-unknown-facts-about-Lata-Mangeshkar/5-unknown-facts-about-Lata-Mangeshkar/photostory/32838183.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref> She sang "Paa Lagoon Kar Jori" for Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie ''Aap Ki Seva Mein'' (1946),<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/> which was composed by Datta Davjekar. The dance in the film was performed by [[Rohini Bhate]] who later became a famous classical dancer.  Lata and her sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak's first Hindi-language movie, ''Badi Maa'' (1945). In that movie, Lata also sang a [[bhajan]], "Maata Tere Charnon Mein." She was introduced to music director [[Vasant Desai]] during the recording of Vinayak's second Hindi-language movie, ''Subhadra'' (1946).

After Vinayak's death in 1948, music director [[Ghulam Haider (composer)|Ghulam Haider]] mentored her as a singer. He introduced Lata to producer [[Sashadhar Mukherjee]], who was working then on the movie ''[[Shaheed (1948 film)|Shaheed]]'' (1948), but Mukherjee dismissed Lata's voice as "too thin".<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/> An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years producers and directors would "fall at Lata's feet" and "beg her" to sing in their movies. Haider gave Lata her first major break with the song "Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora"—lyrics by [[Nazim Panipati]]—in the movie ''[[Majboor (1948 film)|Majboor]]'' (1948), which became her first big breakthrough film hit. In an interview on her 84th birthday, in September 2013, Lata herself declared, "Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather. He was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent."<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/><ref>Who is Lata Mangeshkar's Godfather ? glamsham.com website 27 September 2013 http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/13/sep/27-news-who-is-lata-mangeshkars-godfather-0913012.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035016/http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/13/sep/27-news-who-is-lata-mangeshkars-godfather-0913012.asp |date=25 May 2015 }}</ref>

Initially, Lata is said to have imitated the acclaimed singer [[Noor Jehan]], but she later developed her own style of singing.<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/> Lyrics of songs in Hindi movies are primarily composed by Urdu poets and contain a higher proportion of [[Urdu language|Urdu]] words, including the dialogue. Actor [[Dilip Kumar]] once made a mildly disapproving remark about Lata's Maharashtrian accent while singing Hindi/Urdu songs; so for a period of time, Lata took lessons in Urdu from an Urdu teacher named Shafi.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bharatan | first = Raju | title = Lata Mangeshkar: A Biography | year = 1995 | publisher = UBS Publishers Distributors | isbn = 978-81-7476-023-4}}</ref> In subsequent interviews, Lata has said that Noor Jehan had heard her as a child and had told her to practice a lot. The two stayed in touch with each other for many years to come.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview with Lata Mangeshkar - Irrfan |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV}}</ref>

One of her first major hits was "Aayega Aanewaala," a song in the movie ''[[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'' (1949), composed by music director [[Khemchand Prakash]] and lip-synced on screen by actress [[Madhubala]].<ref name="dailytimes.com.pk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/08-Aug-2014/lata-mangeshkar-the-living-legend-part-i |title=Lata Mangeshkar&nbsp;— the living legend&nbsp;— Part I |work=DailyTimes |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710052627/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/08-Aug-2014/lata-mangeshkar-the-living-legend-part-i |archive-date=10 July 2015}}</ref>

She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with "Vanaradham" in 1956 (''Uran Khotala'' dubbed in Tamil) with the Tamil song "Enthan Kannalan" for [[Nimmi]] in the dubbed version composed by Naushad.

Lata sang many [[raga]]-based songs for [[Naushad Ali|Naushad]] in movies such as ''[[Deedar (1951 film)|Deedar]]'' (1951), ''[[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]'' (1952), ''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]'' (1954), ''[[Uran Khatola (1955 film)|Uran Khatola]]'' (1955) and ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957).<ref name="dailytimes.com.pk"/> ''Ae Chorre Ki Jaat Badi Bewafa'', a duet with G.

However a rift developed between Lata and Burman in 1957, and she did not sing his compositions again until 1962.<ref name="encyclopaedia_of_hindi_cinema"/>

Lata won a [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] for [[Salil Chowdhury]]'s composition "Aaja Re Pardesi" from ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958). Lata Mangeshkar's association with C.

===1960s===
Lata's song "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" from ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960), composed by Naushad and lip-synced by [[Madhubala]], still remains famous. The [[music of Hawaii|Hawaiian]]-themed number "Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh", from ''[[Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai]]'' (1960), was composed by [[Shankar–Jaikishan]] and lip-synced by [[Meena Kumari]].

On 27 January 1963, against the backdrop of the [[Sino-Indian War]], Lata sang the patriotic song "[[Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo]]" (literally, "Oh, People of My Country") in the presence of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], then the [[Prime Minister of India]]. The song, composed by [[C.

In 1963, Lata returned to collaborate with [[S. D. Burman]]. She had sung in [[R. D.

The 1960s also witnessed the beginning of Mangeshkar's association with [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]], the music directors for whom she sang the most popular songs in her career. Starting in 1963, [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]]'s association with Lata Mangeshkar grew stronger over the years.

In the 1960s, Mangeshkar recorded duets with [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Mahendra Kapoor]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], and [[Kishore Kumar]].
