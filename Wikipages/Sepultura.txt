The band has had several lineup changes throughout its existence, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Sepultura's current lineup consists of vocalist [[Derrick Green]] (who replaced Max in 1998), guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]], bassist [[Paulo Jr.]] and drummer [[Eloy Casagrande]] (who replaced Igor's successor [[Jean Dolabella]] in 2011). Since Igor Cavalera's departure in 2006, there have been no original members left in the band. Although Paulo Jr. joined Sepultura shortly after its formation in late 1984 and is the longest serving member, he did not play on any of the band's studio albums until ''[[Chaos A.D.]]'' (1993).{{efn|name=note1|Despite being credited as bassist on the band's first four albums, the members of Sepultura have stated in interviews that Paulo Jr. had not played on any albums prior to ''Chaos A.D.''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/max-cavalera-says-paulo-jr-didn-t-play-bass-on-any-early-sepultura-recordings/|title=MAX CAVALERA Says PAULO JR.

===Formation, ''Bestial Devastation'' and ''Morbid Visions'' (1984–1986)===
[[File:Sepultura Max Cavalera.jpg|thumb|Singer and guitarist [[Max Cavalera]] formed Sepultura, along with his brother [[Igor Cavalera|Igor]], in 1984, and stayed with the band until 1996.]]
Sepultura was formed in 1984 in [[Belo Horizonte]], the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.<ref name="barcinski16"/> The band was founded by teen brothers [[Max Cavalera|Max]] and [[Igor Cavalera]], the impoverished sons of Vânia, a model, and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial ruin.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 14.</ref> Graciliano's death deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard the album ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4]]'' the very same day.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Roots |title-link=Roots (Sepultura album) |others=Sepultura |year=2005 |chapter=The Roots of Sepultura |first=Steffan |last=Chirazi |page=13 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |location= New York, New York}}</ref> They chose the band name ''Sepultura'', the Portuguese word for "grave", when Max translated the lyrics of the [[Motörhead]] song "Dancing on Your Grave".<ref name="Barcinski17"/>

The brothers' early influences included [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]], and metal and hard rock artists of the early 1980s, such as [[Van Halen]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Motörhead]], [[AC/DC]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[V8 (band)|V8]].<ref name="barcinski16"/> They would travel to a record shop in [[São Paulo]] that mixed tapes of the latest records by American bands.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12">{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Robert|title=The Boys from Brazil Transplanted to Phoenix, Sepultura Strives for Death Metal with a Conscience|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/160396|access-date=August 3, 2010|newspaper=Phoenix New Times|date=May 12, 1993}}</ref> Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to [[Venom (band)|Venom]]. As Igor Cavalera put it:

{{cquote|"I remember the first time I listened to Venom, it was on a friend's borrowed tape. It was similar to Motörhead, only a lot heavier. I remember someone saying: it's the devil's Motörhead! After we got acquainted with Venom, we stopped listening to Iron Maiden and all that lighter stuff."<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 19.</ref>}}

The Cavalera brothers started listening to bands such as [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], and [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 26.</ref> They also had influences on Brazilian metal from bands like [[Stress (Brazilian band)|Stress]], [[Sagrado Inferno]], and [[Dorsal Atlântica]]. By 1984, they had dropped out of school.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, vocalist [[Wagner Lamounier]], and bassist [[Paulo Jr.]]<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 21.</ref> Lamounier departed in March 1985 after disagreements with the band, and moved on to become the leader of the pioneering Brazilian [[black metal]] band [[Sarcófago]]. After his departure, Max took over the vocal duties. [[Jairo Guedes]] was invited to join the band as lead guitarist.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 28.</ref>

After about a year of performing, Sepultura signed to [[Cogumelo Records]] in 1985. Later that year, they released ''[[Bestial Devastation]]'', a shared EP with fellow Brazilian band Overdose. It was recorded and self-produced in just two days. The band recorded their first full-length album, ''[[Morbid Visions]]'', in August 1986. It contained their first hit, "Troops of Doom", which gained some media attention. The band then decided to relocate to the larger city of São Paulo.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/>

===''Schizophrenia'', ''Beneath the Remains'', and ''Arise'' (1987–1992)===
[[File:Sepultura in performance (Lisboa 2004).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Kisser]] has been the lead guitarist of Sepultura since 1987. His arrival provided the group with a more technical experience.]]
In early 1987, Jairo Guedz quit the band. Guedz was replaced by [[São Paulo]]-based guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]],<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 49.</ref> and they released their second studio album, ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]'', later that year. The album reflected a stylistic change towards a more thrash metal-oriented sound, while still keeping the death metal elements of ''Morbid Visions''. ''Schizophrenia'' was an improvement in production and performance, and became a minor critical sensation across Europe and America as a much sought-after import. The band sent tapes to the United States that made radio playlists at a time when they were struggling to book gigs, because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> The band gained attention from [[Roadrunner Records]] who signed them and released ''Schizophrenia'' internationally before seeing the band perform in person.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/><ref name="Colon 1991-08-07">{{cite news|last=Colon|first=Suzan|title=Name That Tomb|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233397|access-date=August 2, 2010|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=August 1, 1991}}</ref>

During a May 2018 interview with teenyrockers.com, Kisser noted that Sepultura would not have been possible without family support, not only from his own family, but also from the families of Max and Igor, and Paulo Jr.<ref>{{cite web|title=May 2018 Interview With Derrick Green and Andreas Kisser|url=https://teenyrockers.com/blogs/milk-hugs-rock-n-roll/teeny-rockers-presents-sepultura|website=Teenyrockers.com}}</ref>

The band's third studio album, ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'', was released in 1989. The album was recorded in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro while the band communicated through translators with the American producer [[Scott Burns (producer)|Scott Burns]].<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> It was an immediate success and became known in thrash metal circles as a classic on the order of Slayer's ''[[Reign in Blood]]''.<ref name="Colon 1991-08-07"/> It was hailed by ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums,<ref>''Terrorizer'' No.&nbsp;109 (2003), page 35 (author unknown)</ref> as well as gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records.<ref name= terrorizer151>Hinchliffe 2006, page 54</ref> [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, "The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r17716 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66JnBuZ2K?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r17716 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |title=Beneath the Remains – Sepultura |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref> A long European and American tour furthered the band's reputation, despite the fact that they were still very limited English speakers.

In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the [[Rock in Rio]] II festival. The band relocated from their native Brazil to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded the album ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'' at [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound Studios]] in Tampa, Florida.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> By the time the album was released in March 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single "[[Dead Embryonic Cells]]" was a success, and the [[Arise (Sepultura song)|title track]] gained additional attention when its video was banned by MTV America due to its apocalyptic religious imagery; it did, however, get some airplay on ''Headbangers Ball'' as did the music videos for "Dead Embryonic Cells" and "Desperate Cry".<ref name="MTV HBB"/> ''Arise'' was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching No.&nbsp;119.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-05-04/billboard-200

Sepultura toured relentlessly throughout 1991 and 1992 in support of ''Arise''; its touring cycle began in May 1991 with a European trek with [[Sacred Reich]] and [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]], followed by the New Titans on the Block tour in the US that included support from Sacred Reich, Napalm Death and [[Sick of It All]].<ref name=metallipromo/> They also played with several other bands, including [[Slayer]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Motörhead]], [[Kreator]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Type O Negative]] and [[Fudge Tunnel]], and along with [[Alice in Chains]], Sepultura supported [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on his ''[[No More Tears]]'' tour.<ref name=metallipromo/> Max Cavalera married the band's manager Gloria Bujnowski during this period.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> The ''Arise'' tour concluded in December 1992 with a US tour, where the band (along with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]) supported [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Psalm 69]]'' tour.<ref name=metallipromo/>

Also in 1994, Max and Igor collaborated with Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel to form [[Nailbomb]]. They released an even more industrial-oriented album, ''[[Point Blank (Nailbomb album)|Point Blank]]'' the same year. The group performed only one full live gig at [[Dynamo Open Air]] in 1995, and the performance was released as ''[[Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide]]''. Nailbomb was disbanded shortly afterwards.

Sepultura's sound change continued with their sixth album, ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', which was released in 1996. On this album the band experimented with elements of the music of Brazil's indigenous peoples, and adopted a slower, down-tuned sound. The album was hailed as a modern-day heavy metal classic and a major influence on the then-nascent [[nu metal]] scene. [[AllMusic]] gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, "''Roots'' consolidates Sepultura's position as perhaps the most distinctive, original heavy metal band of the 1990s."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r233334 |title=Roots – Sepultura |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, Sepultura performed "War (Guerra)" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the Red Hot Organization.

===Departure of Max Cavalera, Derrick Green joins and ''Against'' (1996–2000)===
In August 1996, Sepultura played on the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock main stage alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], and [[Fear Factory]]. The band was suddenly a three-piece with Andreas Kisser taking over on lead vocals, after Max Cavalera left the concert site earlier in the day upon learning of the death of his stepson Dana Wells in a car accident. After Dana Wells' funeral was finished, Max returned and continued to tour with Sepultura. A few months after Wells' death, the band had a meeting with Max and said that they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was Max's wife and Dana's mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was giving preferential treatment to Max while neglecting the rest of the band. Max, who was still coming to terms with the death of Wells, felt betrayed by his bandmates for wanting to get rid of Bujnowski and abruptly quit the band.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> Max Cavalera's final performance with Sepultura was at [[Brixton Academy]] in England on December 16, 1996.<ref>Rock Sound Issue 15576:pg 56.

The band's eighth album, ''[[Nation (Sepultura album)|Nation]]'', released in 2001, sold poorly. It would be their last studio album with Roadrunner Records. [[AllMusic]] gives the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, "As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he's singing about more than just 'one nation, Sepulnation'; he's suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for." In an interview, Derrick Green said that, "Every song will be related to the idea of building this nation.

Despite receiving greater critical acclaim than its predecessors, sales remained low. It was their first album with [[SPV GmbH|SPV Records]]. [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, "if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003's excellent ''Roorback'' should put them to rest for good.

Sepultura's tenth album, ''[[Dante XXI]]'', was released on March 14, 2006. It is a [[concept album]] based on [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Music videos were recorded for the songs "[[Convicted in Life]]" and "Ostia". [[AllMusic]] gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, "Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals."<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r821812 |title=Dante XXI – Sepultura |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=March 14, 2006 |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom having recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited line up would play on the main stage at [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 2007|Ozzfest 2007]].
