==History==
===Formation and early years===
Haines was born in [[New Delhi]], India, to American-born parents, and was raised in Fenelon Falls, [[Ontario]]. She grew up as a dual citizen of both Canada and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mfyi.com/m/metricquotes.html|title=Metric Quotes|website= Mfyi.com|access-date=17 May 2012| url-status=live |archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120518225910/http://www.mfyi.com/m/metricquotes.html|archive-date=18 May 2012}}</ref> Her father, poet [[Paul Haines (poet)|Paul Haines]] (best known for his lyrical collaboration with [[Carla Bley]] in the 1971 jazz opera ''[[Escalator over the Hill]]''), often made cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to, and her early influences included Carla Bley and [[Robert Wyatt]].<ref name="allmusic" />

Haines attended [[Etobicoke School of the Arts]].<ref name="allmusic" /> There she met [[Amy Millan]] (future member of [[Stars (Canadian band)|Stars]] and [[Broken Social Scene]]), and [[Kevin Drew]] (future member of Broken Social Scene).<ref name="allmusic" /> Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA. Haines attended the University of British Columbia in [[Vancouver]] in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995, and at [[Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]] in 1995–1996. She distributed in 1996 an early album titled ''[[Cut in Half and Also Double]]'' with a limited number of copies. The album included songs written and recorded during her student years.

Shaw, who was born in [[England]] and raised in Ontario, was attending a [[Boston]] music school when he befriended singer [[Torquil Campbell]] and [[Chris Seligman]], both future members of the band [[Stars (Canadian band)|Stars]]. Campbell convinced Shaw to apply to [[Juilliard School|Juilliard Music School]] and the two moved to [[New York City]]. After a three-year classical music education at the institution, Shaw decided that his musical interests lay elsewhere; Shaw and Campbell returned to Toronto.

In the summer of 1996, Haines and Shaw met at Toronto’s Horseshoe Tavern.<ref name="National Post">{{cite web |title=Metric: the measure of a band |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/metric-the-measure-of-a-band |website=nationalpost |access-date=31 January 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210131191318/https://nationalpost.com/news/metric-the-measure-of-a-band |archive-date=31 January 2021 |language=en-CA |url-status=live }}</ref>  Bonded over a mutual distaste of the music scene, they began dating and writing songs together.<ref name="National Post" /> In 1997, Shaw released the studio album ''Life on the Clock'' which featured Haines singing on some songs. Shaw also moved to Montreal where Haines was living. In 1998, calling themselves Mainstream, the pair self-released the five-song ''[[Mainstream EP]]'' with an overall [[downtempo]] and electronic feel.<ref name=spinmag />

[[File:Metric live 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Metric live 2005]]
At some point in 1998, they changed the band's name to Metric,<ref name=spinmag /> which was originally the name of a sound that Shaw had programmed into his keyboard while working on a song.<ref name=spinmag />

In the fall of 1998, Shaw, Haines, Campbell, and Seligman moved back to [[New York City]], where they shared a [[loft]] in the Williamsburg section of [[Brooklyn]]. Struggling financially during their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile roommates with future members of the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[Liars (band)|Liars]] and [[TV on the Radio]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metric Interview - Coachella 2013 - YouTube (starting at 4:10)|website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCv_uoCE4fQ|access-date=21 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523215831/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCv_uoCE4fQ|archive-date=23 May 2014}}</ref>

That same year, the band signed a development deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. A producer in [[London]] listened to the demos they recorded in this period and offered to bring Metric to the United Kingdom for a possible record deal. Eager to escape from the crowded conditions of the loft, Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with [[Chrysalis Records]].

With the help of the producer [[Stephen Hague]], Metric recorded a set of [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[synthpop]] [[drum machine]] paced songs. The pair tired of recording demos, and in November 2000 returned to their Brooklyn loft to put a band together; they recruited Joules Scott-Key (a native of Flint, Michigan) as their drummer and Jarrett Mason as their bassist.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Berman|first=Stuart|date=2001|title=Metropolitan Cosmopolitans|work=Eye Weekly}}</ref>

===''Grow Up and Blow Away'' (2001–2002)===
{{Main|Grow Up and Blow Away}}
Metric continued to work on their debut album in the first few months of 2001. Now dubbed ''[[Grow Up and Blow Away]]'', they developed a more musically layered and mature sound than the earlier ''[[Mainstream EP]]''. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April and by this time had found a new label for their release, the Los Angeles [[independent record label|indie label]] [[Restless Records]]. However, the album, produced by Shaw, was delayed for years by the label. It was finally released in 2007 on [[Last Gang Records]].

''[[Grow Up and Blow Away]]'' included the [[uptempo]] songs "Grow Up and Blow Away", "Raw Sugar", and "Soft Rock Star", as well as [[downtempo]] songs "White Gold", "The Twist", and "Rock Me Now" (which included falsetto singing by Shaw and spoken-word vocals by Haines in a manner reminiscent of "The Mandate", and had an overall jazzy vibe). "Parkdale", featuring trumpeting by Shaw and a fanfare intro, concerned the [[Parkdale, Toronto]] neighborhood. When the track titled "Rock Me Now" was reworked, it had been stripped of its intro "bubble" sounds, as well as an additional vocal part was added to the bridge. The title track was also reworked during the chorus, in which, Haines vocalizes "If this is the life, why does it feel so good to die today?" and the synths get a more "heavier" feel.

In the same year, the band released ''[[Static Anonymity]]'', a five-song EP which they sold only at Metric performances and on their official site. Three tracks from the EP were also included on ''[[Grow Up and Blow Away]]''.

[[File:Metric live at the 9-30 Club, 2004.jpg|thumb|Metric live at the 9:30 Club, 2004]]
Metric up to this time had been for the most part a studio band; live shows could not reproduce the [[synthesizer]]-centered and [[drum machine]]-driven sound of the recordings. After recruiting a drummer to allow a stronger, more engaging live presence, Metric performed in New York in early spring and late summer 2001. They handed out handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, and later gave away the music on the internet.

In August 2001 the [[television commercial]] "Be Afraid", advertising [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]]'s I-Zone Pocket Fortune film, used music from the song "Grow Up and Blow Away", with the line "Why does it feel so good to die today?" changed to "Why does it feel so good to fly today?".

In March 2002, Metric performed at [[Canadian Music Week]]. The band's performance was criticized in an article in [[University of Waterloo]]'s newspaper ''[[Imprint (newspaper)|Imprint]]'', where the reviewer referred to the band's music as "derivative, pretentious, boring pap at its most mediocre".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://issuu.com/imprintuw/docs/2001-02_v24-n30_imprint/23|title=Canadian Music Week rolls in again|access-date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>

By the end of 2002, Metric had gained another bandmate: the [[bassist]] Joshua Winstead (a native of Texas), who was in town performing with long-time friend Scott-Key in the local music scene.

===''Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?'' (2003–2004)===
{{Main|Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?}}
In 2003, Metric released their first official studio album ''[[Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?]]'' on.,<ref>[[Everloving Records]]</ref> and shortly thereafter it appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 radio chart.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://earshot-online.com/charts/index.cfm?intChartTypeID=101&dWeekOfID=2003-09-16 | title= The National Top 50 For the Week Ending: Tuesday, September 16, 2003 | work= !earshot| via= earshot-online.com }}</ref> The album was produced by [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and recorded at Elgonix Labs, Los Angeles.  The band then moved to Los Angeles, where they performed locally, often playing at [[Silverlake Lounge]] and Spaceland.<ref>{{cite web |last= Bronson |first=Kevin |url= http://buzzbands.la/2012/05/04/salvation-takes-its-leave-of-silver-lake-while-the-silverlake-lounge-goes-on-without-bookers-the-fold/ |title='Salvation' takes its leave of Silver Lake, while the Silverlake Lounge goes on without bookers the Fold |website=Buzzbands.la |date=2012-05-04 |access-date=2017-09-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170916202653/http://buzzbands.la/2012/05/04/salvation-takes-its-leave-of-silver-lake-while-the-silverlake-lounge-goes-on-without-bookers-the-fold/ |archive-date= 2017-09-16 }}</ref> ''Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?'' received generally positive reviews. In December 2005, the album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in Canada.

The songs "Combat Baby" and "Dead Disco" were released as singles. "Combat Baby" was featured as a free single on iTunes in 2004. Six music videos were created to promote the album and accompany "Calculation Theme", "IOU", "Combat Baby", "Succexy", and "Dead Disco" respectively.

Metric was featured as themselves in the 2004 independent French film, ''[[Clean (2004 film)|Clean]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Metric - Live It Out - Review|work=Stylus Magazine| url= http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/metric/live-it-out.htm| access-date= 24 April 2013| url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121015073124/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/metric/live-it-out.htm|archive-date=15 October 2012}}</ref> directed by [[Olivier Assayas]] and starring [[Maggie Cheung]]. The band performed the song "Dead Disco" in the film and also acted in a short sequence. The film, which also featured songs by [[Brian Eno]], [[Daniel Lanois]], and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], was nominated for the [[Palme D'Or]] award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

{{Main|Live It Out|Grow Up and Blow Away}}
[[File:Metric live at Washington, DC 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Metric live at Washington, DC 2006]]
On October 4, 2005, Metric released their second studio album, ''[[Live It Out]]'', on [[Last Gang Records]]. The album, produced by Shaw, was well received by critics and fans, and eventually went twice [[platinum record|platinum]] in Canada, selling over 200,000 units.

Three singles supported the album' sales: "[[Monster Hospital]]" (number 55 on [[UK singles charts]]), "[[Poster of a Girl]]" and "[[Empty (Metric song)|Empty]]". "[[Monster Hospital]]" was selected as [[NME]] Track of the Week<ref name="nme">{{cite web|title=Rocklist.net...NME End of Year Lists 2006...|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2006.html|access-date=22 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130424163756/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2006.html|archive-date=24 April 2013}}</ref> and was number 12 on NME Tracks of 2006.<ref name=nme /> ''Live It Out'' as well as number 38 on NME Recordings of 2006.<ref name=nme />

During this time, Metric opened for the [[Rolling Stones]], whose tour coincided with theirs in [[New York City]]. The band did a UK-wide tour supporting [[Bloc Party]] as well as performing at [[Reading and Leeds Festival]], [[The Great Escape (festival)|The Great Escape]] in [[Brighton]], [[Wireless Festival]] at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London and club dates throughout the UK. The band toured the world extensively for several years playing concerts in France, Germany, Iceland, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, United States, Canada, Venezuela, Mexico and Japan to promote ''Live it Out''.

On June 26, 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric's 2001 album ''[[Grow Up and Blow Away]]'', with an altered track listing compared to the unofficial version. There were added the songs "London Halflife" and "Soft Rock Star" (Jimmy vs. Joe mix) from the 2001 EP ''[[Static Anonymity]]'' and removed the songs "Torture Me", "Fanfare" and "Parkdale". The tracks were reordered and some songs (including the title track and "Rock Me Now") were slightly reworked.

Throughout the summer of 2007, four new songs were road-tested by the band, tentatively named "Black Sheep", "The Hooks", "Stadium Love", and "Up in Flames". On October that year Metric played a live webcast show on [[Myspace]]'s "Hey Play This" programme, playing requests sent in by fans. Along with old material, they performed several new songs, including "Freddie" (aka "Black Sheep"), "Standing in Line", "Gimme Sympathy" (aka "The Hooks"), "Twilight", "Joyride" and "Stadium Love".

On November 13, 2007, Last Gang Records released a trailer on [[YouTube]] for a Metric [[DVD]] showcasing a live concert at the Metropolis Theatre in [[Montreal]], as well as all three music videos from ''[[Live It Out]]''. The DVD ''Live at Metropolis'' was released on February 12, 2008. A three-track [[extended play|EP]] was released on [[iTunes]] in December, featuring the live tracks "The Police and the Private", "Too Little Too Late" and "Patriarch on a Vespa" from the DVD, as well as the DVD trailer.

===''Fantasies'' (2008–2011)===
{{Main|Fantasies (album)}}
The band performed in 2008 in Canada, Mexico and Brazil while continuing to record their upcoming fourth album. They performed at the 2008 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]],<ref>{{cite web | last = Goldstein | first = Melissa | url = https://www.spin.com/2008/05/coachella-08-reviewed-day-three-metric-im-barcelona-duffy-stars-sean-penn/ | title = Coachella '08 Reviewed, Day Three: Metric, I'm From Barcelona, Duffy, Stars, Sean Penn | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | date = 1 May 2008 | access-date = 2008-11-28 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171204222852/https://www.spin.com/2008/05/coachella-08-reviewed-day-three-metric-im-barcelona-duffy-stars-sean-penn/ | archive-date = 4 December 2017 }}</ref> and at the 2008 [[Ottawa Bluesfest]] in addition to playing at the inaugural [[Pemberton Music Festival]] in [[Pemberton, British Columbia]] in July and [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in New Jersey in August.

During December 13–23, 2008, Metric toured across Canada with [[Tokyo Police Club]], [[The Dears]], and [[Sebastien Grainger and The Mountains]], to raise money for various charities under the name "Jingle Bell Rock" tour. "[[Help, I'm Alive]]" was released as the lead single from the upcoming album on iTunes on December 23, 2008 in Canada and January 1, 2009 elsewhere.

Their fourth record, ''[[Fantasies (album)|Fantasies]]'', was self-released on April 7, 2009 through [[Last Gang Records]] in Canada, and their own label, Metric Music International. The album was produced by [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]] and by Shaw; it was recorded at the band's Giant Studios in Toronto, and [[Electric Lady Studios]], New York. ''Fantasies'' was issued in a standard edition (featuring 10 tracks), a deluxe edition (including 4 more tracks), a deluxe edition UK edition (including 10 more tracks), and later, an Expanded Edition (a second disc with 10 tracks).

A fusion of new wave and loud rock,<ref>[https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/metric-fantasies "Metric Fantasies"]. ''Slant Magazine'', by Casey Boland, April 13, 2009</ref> ''Fantasies'' was generally well received by critics and fans. By 2012 it had sold 500,000 copies, the band's best selling album so far. Haines and Shaw had performed all ten tracks acoustically the previous September at Union Pool in Brooklyn.

[[File:Emily Haines and Josh Winstead performing with Metric.jpg|thumb|right|Emily Haines and Josh Winstead performing with Metric, 2009]]
The music video for "Gimme Sympathy" was released on [[Myspace]] on March 16, 2009. Haines and Shaw completed a mini tour of acoustic shows across Canada, with stops in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria in late April with cooperation from local radio stations.  The band finished a Europe tour in May 2009 and toured the US (with Sebastien Grainger and The Mountains and Smile Smile), UK, and Canada at music festivals during the summer. They then headed to Australia for their first Australian tour in early October, and performed a show in Tokyo.

In August that year [[Mike Shinoda]] of [[Linkin Park]] fame began streaming a remix of the track "Gold Guns Girls"  through his website. The track was the theme for his art exhibition Glorious Excess (Dies), and later became part of a compilation album set up by Linkin Park's ''[[Music for Relief]]'' for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shinoda+Metric Remix: GOLD GUNS GIRLS|url=http://mikeshinoda.com/2009/08/30/shinodametric-remix-gold-guns-girls/|website=MikeShinoda.com|access-date=29 July 2012|last=Shinoda|first=Mike |date=30 August 2009| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013559/http://mikeshinoda.com/2009/08/30/shinodametric-remix-gold-guns-girls/|archive-date=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In October 2009, Metric released a five-track EP called ''Plug in Plug Out'' containing acoustic versions of songs from ''Fantasies'', which was available on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] for 30 days. In December that year the band produced a charity T-shirt for the [[Yellow Bird Project]] to raise funding to promote musical education across Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Riley |first=Jack |title=Yellow Bird Project: Harnessing indie power to help those in need |work=The Independent |date=2009-01-07 |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2009/12/07/yellow-bird-project-harnessing-indie-power-to-help-those-in-need/ |access-date=2013-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203051102/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2009/12/07/yellow-bird-project-harnessing-indie-power-to-help-those-in-need/ |archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref> The T-shirt bears the slogan 'Keep the dream tight' - a lyric from their song, "Hustle Rose".

Haines and Shaw performed an acoustic version of "Help I'm Alive" on January 22, 2010 for the Canada for Haiti telethon. During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record [[K'Naan]]'s song "[[Wavin' Flag]]" to benefit Haiti in a movement called [[Young Artists for Haiti]]. Haines and Shaw also performed at a Neil Young tribute event alongside their friends in [[Broken Social Scene]]. It was at this event that Haines met [[Lou Reed]], leading to later collaborations between the two of them.

The track "Black Sheep" was released on August 10, 2010, and became available on the band's [[Myspace]] page. The song is on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''. In the movie, the song is sung by [[Brie Larson]], who portrayed [[Envy Adams]] in the film. ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' author [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] said he was inspired by concert photos of Haines while originally drawing Envy's singing poses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The band toured in Western USA, before playing shows in the Canadian Maritimes and Eastern Ontario for most of March 2010. Metric also toured with [[Sarah McLachlan]] for part of her 2010 [[Lilith Fair]].

Metric won two awards ("Group of the Year" and "Alternative Album of the Year" for ''Fantasies'') at the [[2010 Juno Awards]].

On June 8, 2010, the [[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (soundtrack)|''Twilight Saga: Eclipse'' soundtrack]] was released featuring Metric' song "Eclipse (All Yours)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958273/muse-metric-confirmed-for-twilight-eclipse-soundtrack|title=Muse, Metric Confirmed For 'Twilight: Eclipse' Soundtrack|last=McKnight|first=Connor|date=May 13, 2010|work=Billboard|access-date=June 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120604104033/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958273/muse-metric-confirmed-for-twilight-eclipse-soundtrack|archive-date=June 4, 2012}}</ref> The song was written with the film's composer, [[Howard Shore]].

In October 2011, Metric released a collection of remixes from ''Fantasies'' entitled ''Fantasies Flashbacks'' through a collaboration with website Indaba Music. The band released all the individual tracks as well as their stems so that the general public could remix the songs.
