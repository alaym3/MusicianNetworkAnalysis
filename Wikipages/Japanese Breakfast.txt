==History==

=== 2013–2016: Early releases ===
The first Japanese Breakfast release was ''June'' (2013), the result of a project where Zauner and [[Slutever|Rachel Gagliardi]] recorded and posted one song every day for the month of June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/album/june|title=June - Japanese Breakfast|website=[[Bandcamp]]|date=July 1, 2013|access-date=June 7, 2021|language=en}}</ref> These songs were posted daily on the [[Tumblr]] blog rachelandmichelledojune. As Japanese Breakfast, Zauner also participated in a song project with musicians [[Gabby's World|Gabrielle Smith]], [[Florist (band)|Florist]], [[Frankie Cosmos]], and Small Wonder. All of their songs were posted daily on the Tumblr blog may5to12songs. Zauner released her songs from the project on [[Bandcamp]] as a digital album entitled ''Where Is My Great Big Feeling?'' on June 6, 2014, followed shortly by ''American Sound'' on July 24. Both were released as the cassette tape ''American Sound/Where Is My Great Big Feeling''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/album/where-is-my-great-big-feeling|title=Where Is My Great Big Feeling? - Japanese Breakfast|website=[[Bandcamp]]|date=June 6, 2014|access-date=June 8, 2021|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/album/american-sound|title=American Sound - Japanese Breakfast|website=[[Bandcamp]]|date=July 24, 2014|access-date=June 8, 2021|language=en}}</ref> Re-recorded versions of several songs from these releases appeared on the first two Japanese Breakfast albums.

While in Oregon with her family, Zauner continued recording as Japanese Breakfast. She described the project as having much more to say after ''Tropical Jinx'', the 2014 studio album by Little Big League. Originally Zauner began to record [[Music sample|samples of music]] as a meditative exercise and "instant gratification".<ref name="line of best fit interview">{{cite web|last1=Hannah|first1=Andy|title=In the Rugged Country: Michelle Zauner of Japanese Breakfast tells Andy Hannah about the loss which brought her back to the Pacific Northwest.|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/in-the-rugged-country-japanese-breakfast|website=The Line of Best Fit|access-date=December 24, 2016|date=October 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225170039/https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/in-the-rugged-country-japanese-breakfast|archive-date=December 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
