== History ==

=== 2020: Formation and ''Little Mix: The Search'' ===
In 2020, the English band was formed on BBC One's talent competition ''Little Mix: The Search'', following the 'Rap R&B' group auditions. After their formation the group spent time living together for 8 weeks, while competing on the show. From the submitted online auditions Little Mix picked the best rapper and R&B singers, including Ashley, Eden, Romina and VerSay. Thereafter the four all auditioned individually on the show, face to face with Little Mix as their judges. Each of them passed their audition with four yeses and met up in the band room. Once all contestants were gathered in the band room they passed to the rehearsal stage where they got evaluated once more while singing as a collective. After the four, along with other contestants made it through the evaluation they performed in front of a live stage and the final line up of the Rap R&B group was decided, consisting of Ashley, Eden, Romina and VerSay.<ref name=":0" />

When all six groups were formed, the Battle of the Bands began. That's where the band announced its name "YChange" since the group is the most diverse group that was formed in the competition. After performing "[[West Ten]]" by [[AJ Tracey]] and [[Mabel (singer)|Mabel]], the group received 24 points from [[Jade Thirlwall]], 23 points from [[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]], 23 points from [[Perrie Edwards]] and 24 points from [[Jesy Nelson]], with 100 points max and each girl handing out 25 points max, the group received 94% of the maximum number of points, rocketing them to the first place in the battle of the bands and enabling them to proceed to the Semi-Final.<ref>{{Citation|title=YChange give an unreal performance! ü§Ø @Little Mix The Search - BBC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G5aJwNzaEc|language=en|access-date=2021-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2020-11-08|title=YChange: The next big name in R&B?|url=https://www.pieradio.co.uk/ychange-the-next-big-names-in-rb/|access-date=2021-08-06|website=Pie Radio|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Before their first performance in the final, YChange had a personal talk with Little Mix and took advice from them. Then they performed a mashup of "[[All of the Lights|All of The Lights]]" by [[Kanye West]] and "[[Never Forget You (Zara Larsson and MNEK song)|Never Forget You]]" by [[Zara Larsson]] and [[MNEK]]. Although the judges votes didn't matter in the final where only the public votes matter, Perrie and Leigh-Anne gave YChange a score of 95% for their first performance while Jade gave them a score of 94%.<ref>{{Citation|title=YChange just did THAT! ü§Ø @Little Mix The Search - BBC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFl_t43dTTQ|language=en|access-date=2021-08-06}}</ref> Their second and last performance was a stripped back cover of "[[Runnin' (Lose It All)]]" by [[Naughty Boy]], with Romina accompanying them on the piano. For this cover they received a score of 100% from each of the girls, minus Jesy who was absent during the finals.
