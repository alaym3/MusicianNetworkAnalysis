'''Useless ID''' ({{lang-he|יוסלס איי.די}}) is an [[Israel]]i [[punk rock]] band, formed in [[Haifa]], Israel in 1994. Known as one of the most successful Middle Eastern punk bands worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==History==
Useless ID was founded in 1994 as a four-piece:
Guy Carmel - vocal and guitar, Ralf Hober - drums, Adi Elkabets - lead guitar, Nadav Elkabets - Bass.
At its first years, the band was mainly active in the Israeli punk scene, and released two studio albums independently, on its own label "Falafel Records", named after band member's favorite food, the [[falafel]]. The band's singer at the time was rhythm guitarist [[Guy Carmel]].

Two years after the band's formation, the four members decided to play shows in the United States and toured around the country for six months. This successful tour was followed by five more tours around North America, two around Europe and one in Japan. In 1996, upon returning to Israel from the tours, the band's bassist [[Adi Elkabets]] was replaced by [[Yotam Ben-Horin]].

The band's international breakthrough happened in 1999, after [[The Ataris]] frontman, [[Kris Roe]], heard the band and invited it to record a split album for [[Kung Fu Records]]. The album, titled ''[[Let It Burn (The Ataris and Useless ID album)|Let It Burn]]'', featured nine songs by the Ataris and seven by Useless ID. The song "Too Bad You Don't Get It" was also featured on [[Fat Wreck Chords]]' compilation, ''[[Short Music for Short People]]'' that same year. After the release of ''Let It Burn'', the band signed to Kung Fu Records, and in 2001 the band's third studio album, ''[[Bad Story, Happy Ending]]'', was released. The album was produced by Kris Roe. This was the first album by the band to feature bassist Yotam Ben-Horin on lead vocals. Ben-Horin eventually became the band's frontman and main composer and lyricist.

In 2003 the band released another album via Kung Fu, titled ''[[No Vacation from the World]]'', with [[Angus Cooke]] co-producing the album with the band, and additional production by [[Tony Sly]] of [[No Use for a Name]].

A year later, the band was featured in the Fat Wreck Chords' ''[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2]]'' compilation, with the song "State of Fear". After returning to Israel, the band released its fifth album, ''[[Redemption (Useless ID album)|Redemption]]'', in December 2004 in Israel and Japan, and July 2005 in the rest of the world. This album was produced by [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] of [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]] fame, and recorded at [[The Blasting Room]] in [[Colorado]] between March and April 2004. Drummer Ido Blaustein left the band prior to the recording of the album. Moshe Liberman played drums on the album, but Yonatan Harpak of Israeli punk band Punkache joined as the official drummer prior to the release of the album.

Still in 2004, the band took part in the movie "[[Jericho's Echo]]", directed by [[Liz Nord]], which dealt with the Israeli [[Punk subculture|punk]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene.

On September 2006, the band released a DVD, titled ''[[Ratfaces Home Videos Presents Useless ID]]'', containing live and studio video clips of the band.

In 2008 the band returned to the Blasting Room, to record its sixth studio album, again with Stevenson as producer. On July 24, 2008, it was announced that the album, entitled ''[[The Lost Broken Bones]]'', would be released via [[Suburban Home Records]] in October of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suburbanhomerecords.com/2008/07/24/suburban-home-signs-useless-id/ |title=Suburban Home signs Useless I.D. |date=24 July 2008 |website=Suburban Home Records |access-date=8 May 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210023829/http://www.suburbanhomerecords.com/2008/07/24/suburban-home-signs-useless-id/ |archive-date=10 February 2012}}</ref>

After the recording of the album, the band left for a brief tour around the [[United Kingdom]], and in June 2008, the band played live in [[Trafalgar Square]], London, as part of the "Salute to Israel" event. After another tour in Japan and China in September, the band returned to Israel for a special release show of ''The Lost Broken Bones'' on October 18, 2008, at the Barby club in [[Tel Aviv]], joined by famous musicians from the Israeli mainstream music scene, including [[Danny Sanderson]], Muki and more.

The band finished off 2008 with an Israeli tour supporting ''The Lost Broken Bones'', playing in Haifa, with [[Betzefer]] and [[Friday Night Sissy Fight]], in Tel Aviv with [[Got No Shame]] and [[Kill the Drive]], and in [[Jerusalem]] with [[Man Alive (band)|Man Alive]], [[Mondo Gecko]] and [[Evenyaru]].

In [[Purim]] 2009, the band joined Betzefer and Almana Shchora for a special show in Tel Aviv.

After opening for No Use for a Name for two shows in Tel Aviv, Israel, Useless ID joined them as support on the remainder of their summer European dates during June and July.

In the summer of 2009, the band recorded an album in Hebrew, with Israeli [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[reggae]] artist [[Muki (singer)|Muki]], in which the band wrote and played all the music, and Muki was responsible for all the lyrics. Useless ID singer Yotam Ben-Horin co-sings on some songs. The band celebrated the launch of the project with a tour across Israel, starting with the first show on August 15, 2009, at the Barzilay Club in Tel Aviv.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3756392,00.html |title=כשהראפ פגש את הפאנק |date=4 August 2009 |website=Ynet |language=he |access-date=8 May 2019}}</ref> The collaboration's launch show was on September 30, 2009, at the ''Reading 3'' club at the Tel Aviv port.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.walla.co.il/?w=/202/1531472 |title=מוקי ויוסלס איי.די - "עוד יבואו ימים טובים יותר" |date=4 August 2009 |website=Walla!

In September 2009, Yotam Ben-Horin has finished recording his solo [[acoustic music|acoustic]] album, and started writing material for the next Useless ID album. The Muki and Useless ID [[Muki & Useless ID|collaboration album]] was released on January 7, 2010, followed by an official release show on January 28, 2010, at the Barby club in Tel Aviv.

In May 2010, frontman Yotam Ben-Horin confirmed that he had written most of the material for the band's next album, with only some writing left and plans to record the album in the end of 2010.

In July 2010, the band went on a European tour with [[Gideon Berger]] of Kill the Drive filling in on drums, as the band's drummer [[Yonatan Harpak]] could not leave the country.

In February 2011, the band recorded and mixed their next album at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado with producer Bill Stevenson, with whom they had worked on their previous two albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.punknews.org/article/41329/useless-id-to-enter-studio |title=Useless ID to enter studio |website=Punknews.org |access-date=8 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4018133,00.html |title="יוסלס איי.די" יורדת מהבמה ונכנסת לאולפן |date=24 January 2011 |website=Ynet |language=he |access-date=8 May 2019}}</ref> On January 30, 2011, Yotam Ben-Horin announced on his [[Facebook]] page that songwriting for the new Useless ID album was complete.
