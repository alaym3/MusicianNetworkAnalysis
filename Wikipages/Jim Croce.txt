'''James Joseph Croce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|tʃ|i}}; January 10, 1943 – September 20, 1973) was an American [[Folk music|folk]] and rock singer-[[songwriter]]. Between 1966 and 1973, he released five studio albums and numerous singles. During this period, Croce took a series of odd jobs to pay bills while he continued to write, record, and perform concerts. After he formed a partnership with songwriter and guitarist [[Maury Muehleisen]] his fortunes turned in the early 1970s. His breakthrough came in 1972; his third album, ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'', produced three charting singles, including "[[Time in a Bottle]]", which reached No. 1 after his death. The follow-up album, ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]'', contained the song "[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]", which was the only No. 1 hit he had during his lifetime.

On September 20, 1973, at the height of his popularity and the day before the lead single to his fifth album, ''[[I Got a Name]]'', was released, Croce and five others died in a plane crash. His music continued to chart throughout the 1970s following his death. Croce's wife, [[Ingrid Croce]], was his early songwriting partner. She continued to write and record after his death and their son [[A. J. Croce]] became a singer-songwriter in the 1990s.

Croce grew up in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], and attended [[Upper Darby High School]]. Graduating in 1960, he studied at [[Malvern Preparatory School]] for a year before enrolling at [[Villanova University]], where he majored in [[psychology]] and minored in German.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite interview|work=89.3 KPCC|series=Take Two |url= http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2012/10/08/28748/new-book-looks-at-singer-songwriter-jim-croces-too/ |title=New book looks at singer-songwriter Jim Croce's too-short life |publisher=Southern California Public Radio |date=October 8, 2012 | first1= Alex| last1= Cohen |first2= A| last2= Martínez |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/17053704-421/jim-croces-hit-had-roots-in-boot-camp.html |title=Jim Croce's hit had roots in boot camp |newspaper= Chicago Sun-Times |location= Chicago |publisher= Sun-Times Media, LLC |date=December 16, 2012 |first=Dave |last=Hoekstra |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Croce received a Bachelor of Science in Social Studies degree in 1965.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Croce did not take music seriously until he studied at Villanova, where he formed bands and performed at [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] parties, [[coffee house]]s, and universities around Philadelphia, playing "anything that the people wanted to hear: blues, rock, [[a cappella]], railroad music ... anything." Croce's band was chosen for a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] tour of Africa, the Middle East, and [[Yugoslavia]]. He later said, "We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn't speak English over there but if you mean what you're singing, people understand." On November 29, 1963, Croce met his future wife, [[Ingrid Croce|Ingrid Jacobson]], at the [[Philadelphia Convention Hall]] during a [[hootenanny]], where he was judging a contest.

Croce released his first album, [[Facets (album)|''Facets'']], in 1966, with 500 copies pressed. The album had been financed with a $500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) wedding gift from Croce's parents, who set a condition that the money must be spent to make an album. They hoped that he would give up music after the album failed, and use his college education to pursue a "respectable" profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/jim-croce/news/jim-croce-release-shows-him-as-young-man--12174841 |title=Jim Croce News | website= music.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2004 |access-date=August 24, 2012}}</ref> However, the album proved a success, with every copy sold.

=== 1960s ===
Croce married Jacobson in 1966, and [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], as his wife was Jewish. He and Ingrid were married in a [[Jewish wedding|traditional Jewish ceremony]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Applebaum |newspaper=[[The Detroit Jewish News]] |url=http://www.netporch.com/sa/ |title=Article: Photographs And Memories, A story of love, music and conversion |publisher=The Northern Music Group, Inc. |date=1998 |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> He enlisted in the [[Army National Guard]] in [[New Jersey]] that same year to avoid being drafted and deployed to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and served on active duty for four months, leaving for duty a week after his honeymoon.<ref>{{cite news| work= The Philadelphia Inquirer | date= August 13, 1967 | title= Jim Croce| publisher= }}</ref> Croce, who was not good with authority, had to go through basic training twice.<ref>{{cite web| first= Carl |last=Wiser |url= http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/ingrid_croce/ |title=Ingrid Croce: Songwriter Interviews |website= Songfacts.com |date=May 1, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> He said he would be prepared if "there's ever a war where we have to defend ourselves with mops."

From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Croce performed with his wife as a duo. At first, their performances included songs by artists such as [[Ian & Sylvia]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Arlo Guthrie]], but in time they began writing their own music. During this time, Croce got his first long-term gig, at a suburban bar and [[steakhouse]] in [[Lima, Pennsylvania]], called The Riddle Paddock. His set list covered several genres, including blues, country, rock and roll, and folk.

In 1968, the Croces were encouraged by record producer [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] to move to New York City. The couple spent time in the [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] section of the Bronx and recorded their first album with [[Capitol Records]]. During the next two years, they drove more than {{convert|300000|mi}},<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070802142841/http://www.croces.com/croces.shtml Croce's Restaurant- San Diego]. Croces.com. Retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> playing small clubs and concerts on the college concert circuit promoting their album ''[[Jim & Ingrid Croce]]''.

Becoming disillusioned by the music business and New York City, they sold all but one guitar to pay the rent and returned to the Pennsylvania countryside, settling in an old farm in [[Lyndell, Pennsylvania|Lyndell]], where he played for $25 a night (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1970}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which was not enough money to live on. Croce was forced to take odd jobs such as [[truck driver|driving trucks]], [[construction worker|construction work]], and teaching guitar to pay the bills while continuing to write songs, often about the characters he would meet at the local bars and [[truck stops]] and his experiences at work; these provided the material for such songs as "Big Wheel" and "[[Workin' at the Car Wash Blues]]."<ref>{{cite book| title= Jim Croce Anthology (Songbook): The Stories Behind the Songs| first1= Ingrid |last1= Croce| first2= Jim |last2= Croce| publisher= | year= | isbn= }}</ref>

=== 1970s ===
[[File:Jim Croce Wide World In Concert.jpg|thumb|Jim Croce, ''[[In Concert (American TV series)|In Concert]]'']]
The Croces returned to Philadelphia and Croce decided to be "serious" about becoming a productive member of society. "I'd worked construction crews, and I'd been a welder while I was in college. But I'd rather do other things than get burned." His determination to be "serious" led to a job at a Philadelphia [[R&B]] AM radio station, [[WHAT (AM)|WHAT]], where he translated commercials into "soul". "I'd sell airtime to Bronco's Poolroom and then write the spot: 'You wanna be cool, and you wanna shoot pool ... ''dig it''.'"

In 1970, Croce met classically trained pianist-guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Maury Muehleisen]] from [[Trenton, New Jersey]], through producer Joe Salviuolo. Salviuolo and Croce had been friends when they studied at Villanova University, and Salviuolo had met Muehleisen when he was teaching at [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] in New Jersey. Salviuolo brought Croce and Muehleisen together at the [[production office]] of [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] and [[Terry Cashman]] in New York City. Croce at first backed Muehleisen on guitar, but gradually their roles reversed, with Muehleisen adding a lead guitar to Croce's music.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

When Jim Croce and Ingrid discovered they were going to have a child, Croce became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could get a record deal. When their son [[A. J. Croce|Adrian James (A.J.)]] was born in September 1971, Ingrid became a stay-at-home mom while Jim went on the road to promote his music.

In 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with [[ABC Records]], releasing two albums, ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'' and ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]''. The singles "[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim (song)|You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]", "[[Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)]]", and "[[Time in a Bottle]]" all received airplay. Also that year, the Croce family moved to San Diego, California. Croce began appearing on television, including his national debut on ''[[American Bandstand]]''<ref>americanbandstandperformerlist</ref> on August 12, ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''<ref>johnnycarson.com</ref> on August 14, and ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on September 20 and 21.

Croce began touring the United States with Muehleisen, performing in large coffee houses, on college campuses, and at folk festivals. However, his financial situation remained precarious. The record company had fronted him the money to record, and much of his earnings went to pay back the advance. {{nowrap|In February 1973,}} Croce and Muehleisen traveled to Europe, performing in London, Paris, [[Amsterdam]], [[Monte Carlo]], Zurich and [[Dublin]] and receiving positive reviews. Croce made television appearances on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]],'' which he co-hosted on {{nowrap|June 15}}, and ''The [[Helen Reddy]] Show'' on July 19. Croce's biggest single, "[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]," reached Number 1 on the American charts in July.

From July 16 through August 4, Croce and Muehleisen returned to London and performed on ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]],'' where they sang "Lover's Cross" and "[[Workin' at the Car Wash Blues]]" from their upcoming album ''[[I Got a Name]].'' Croce finished recording the album just a week before his death. While on tour, he grew increasingly homesick and decided to take a break from music and settle with Ingrid and A.J. when his ''Life and Times'' tour ended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcroce.com/articles/article-written-by-barry-weber.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807083834/http://www.jimcroce.com/articles/article-written-by-barry-weber.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 7, 2012 |first=Bryan |last=Weber |title=Article |publisher=Jim Croce- The Official Site |date=2014 |access-date=April 11, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Colin |last=Devenish |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/croces-lost-recordings-due-20030820 |title=Croce's Lost Recordings Due |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=August 20, 2003 |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> In a letter to Ingrid which arrived after his death, Croce told her he had decided to quit music and stick to writing short stories and movie scripts as a career and withdraw from {{nowrap|public life.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>Everitt, Richard:''Falling Stars: Air Crashes that Filled Rock and Roll Heaven'' (2004)</ref>}}

== Death ==
On the night of Thursday, September 20, 1973, during Croce's ''Life and Times'' tour and the day before his ABC single "[[I Got a Name (song)|I Got a Name]]" was released, Croce and all five others on board were killed when their chartered [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beechcraft E18S]] crashed into a tree during takeoff from the [[Natchitoches Regional Airport]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]]. Croce was 30 years old. Others killed in the crash were pilot Robert N. Elliott, Croce's bandmate Maury Muehleisen, comedian George Stevens, manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortese, and road manager Dennis Rast.<ref name=rstrap>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=py1OAAAAIBAJ&pg=5658%2C2870135 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Recording star, 5 others killed in crash of plane |date=September 22, 1973 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=AP>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2706&dat=19730922&id=NxZKAAAAIBAJ&pg=2941,1273229 |newspaper=The Michigan Daily |title=Rock group killed |agency=Associated Press |date=September 22, 1973 |page=2 |location=(Ann Arbor)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Celebrity_Plane_Crashes.htm |title=Celebrity Plane Crashes |access-date=November 27, 2011 |publisher=Check-Six.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714012315/http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Celebrity_Plane_Crashes.htm |archive-date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> An hour before the crash, Croce had completed a concert at [[Northwestern State University]]'s [[Prather Coliseum]] in Natchitoches; he was flying to [[Sherman, Texas]], for a concert at [[Austin College]].

An investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]]<ref name="ntsb_report">{{cite report|url=http://ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=84416&key=0&print=1 |title=NTSB Identification: FTW74AF017; 14 CFR Part 135 Nonscheduled operation of Robert Airways; Aircraft: Beech E18S, registration: N50JR |date=September 20, 1973 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]].gov}}</ref> named the probable cause as the pilot's failure to see the obstruction due to physical impairment and because fog reduced his vision. The 57-year-old Elliott suffered from severe [[coronary artery disease]] and had run three miles to the airport from a motel. He had an [[Airline Transport Pilot Licence|ATP certificate]], 14,290 hours total flight time, and 2,190 hours in the Beech 18 type airplane.<ref name="ntsb_report" /> A later investigation placed the sole blame on [[pilot error]] because of his downwind takeoff into a "black hole" of severe darkness, limiting his use of visual references.<ref>{{cite document|url=http://openjurist.org/623/f2d/1084/croce-v-bromley-corporation|title=Croce v.

Croce was buried at [[Haym Salomon]] Memorial Park in [[Frazer, Pennsylvania]].

== Legacy ==
The album ''I Got a Name'' was released on December 1, 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/croce_jim/albums.jhtml?albumId=373780|title=Jim Croce Album I Got A Name|publisher=[[VH1]].com|access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref> The [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] release included three hits: "[[Workin' at the Car Wash Blues]]," "[[I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song]]," and the [[I Got a Name (song)|title song]], which had been used as the theme to the film ''[[The Last American Hero]]'', which was released two months prior to his death. The album reached No. 2, and "I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song" reached No. 9 on the singles chart.

While ABC had not originally released the song "Time in a Bottle" as a single, Croce's untimely death gave its lyrics, dealing with mortality and the wish to have more time, an additional resonance. The song subsequently received a large amount of airplay as an album track, and demand for a single release built. When it was eventually issued as a 7", it became his second and final No. 1 hit.<ref>Whitburn, Joel. ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 7th edition, Billboard Books, 2000, p. 159.</ref> After the single had finished its two-week run at the top in early January 1974, the album ''You Don't Mess Around with Jim'' became No. 1 for five weeks.<ref>Whitburn, Joel. ''The Billboard Book of Top Pop Albums 1955–1985'', Record Research Inc., 1985, p. 88, 505.</ref>

A greatest hits album entitled ''[[Photographs & Memories]]'' was released in 1974. Later posthumous releases have included ''[[Home Recordings: Americana]]'', ''[[The Faces I've Been]]'', ''Jim Croce: Classic Hits'', ''[[Down the Highway]]'', and DVD and CD releases of Croce's television performances, ''[[Have You Heard: Jim Croce Live]]''. In 1990, Croce was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C119|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame – Jim Croce|publisher=[[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]|access-date=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1974 album [[Sheer Heart Attack]] included the song "Bring Back That Leroy Brown", whose title and lyrics reference Croce's "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown".

In 2012, Ingrid Croce published a memoir about Croce entitled ''I Got a Name: The Jim Croce Story.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Croce, Ingrid n|author2=Rock, Jimmy|title=I Got a Name: The Jim Croce Story|year=2012|publisher=Da Capo Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Vq4KZ4hUaUC |isbn=978-0-306-82123-3}}</ref>

In 1985, Ingrid Croce opened Croce's Restaurant & Jazz Bar, a project she and Jim had jokingly discussed over a decade earlier, in the historic [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego|Gaslamp Quarter]] in downtown San Diego. She owned and managed it until it closed on December 31, 2013. In December 2013, she opened Croce's Park West on 5th Avenue in the Bankers Hill neighborhood near Balboa Park. She closed this restaurant in January 2016.<ref>{{cite news |first=Andie |last=Adams |url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Croces-Park-West-Closes-for-Good-366499371.html |publisher=[[NBC]] San Diego |title=Croce's Park West Closes for Good |date=January 25, 2016 |access-date=March 11, 2016 }}</ref>

Croce's music has appeared in several popular movies and television shows, such as ''[[Invincible (2006 film)|Invincible]]; [[The Hangover Part II]]; [[Django Unchained]]; [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]; [[Logan (film)|Logan]]; [[Hobbs & Shaw]]''; ''[[I Know This Much Is True (miniseries)|I Know This Much Is True]]''; ''[[New Girl]]''; ''[[Prodigal Son (TV series)|Prodigal Son]]''; ''[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]''; ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Stranger Things]]''.
