'''Keane''' are <!-- ("They are") Please note that British English uses the plural "are" instead of the Americanised singular "is" --> an English [[alternative rock]] band from [[Battle, East Sussex]], formed in 1995. They met whilst at [[Tonbridge School]] together. The band currently comprises [[Tom Chaplin]] (lead vocals, electric/acoustic guitar), [[Tim Rice-Oxley]] (piano, synthesisers, bass guitar, backing vocals), [[Richard Hughes (musician)|Richard Hughes]] (drums, percussion, backing vocals), and [[Jesse Quin]] (bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, backing vocals). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist [[Dominic Scott]], who left in 2001.

Keane achieved mainstream, international success with the release of their debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004. Topping the UK charts, the album won the [[Brit Awards|2005 Brit Award]] for [[2005 Brit Awards|Best British Album]] and was the second best-selling British album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2005|title=The BRITs 2005|website=Brits.co.uk|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling albums in UK chart history]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-biggest-studio-albums-of-all-time__24431/|title=The UK's Top 40 biggest studio albums of time|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=13 October 2018|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'', released in 2006, topped the UK album charts and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In May 2008, both ''Hopes and Fears'' (number 13) and ''Under the Iron Sea'' (number 8) were voted by readers of ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, [[The Beatles]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Radiohead]] the only artists having two albums in the top 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keanemusic.com/keane-biography.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804225517/http://www.keanemusic.com/keane-biography.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2008|title=Keane official site: Biography|access-date=5 August 2008}}</ref> In 2009, ''Hopes and Fears'' was listed as the [[List of best-selling albums of the 2000s (decade) in the United Kingdom|ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8433447.stm |title=James Blunt records the biggest selling album of decade |work=Press Office |publisher=BBC |date=29 December 2009 |access-date=27 July 2015}}</ref> Their EP ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' was released in May 2010.

Keane are known for using keyboards as the lead instrument instead of guitar, differentiating them from most other rock bands.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3363889.stm|title=Sound of 2004 winners: Keane|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=7 August 2008 | date=9 January 2004}}</ref> The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/keane/22621|title=Keane explain their new sound|work=NME|date=28 March 2006|access-date=19 August 2006}}</ref><ref name="Shore">{{cite web|last=Odell |first=Michael |url=http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |title=The Shore Thing (Annotated) |work=[[Q magazine]] |date=1 May 2004 |pages=48–52 |access-date=24 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013211302/http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |archive-date=13 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which developed on the second and third albums.

After the release of their compilation album ''[[The Best of Keane]]'' in 2013, the band took a hiatus, lasting nearly 5 years.

The band returned after the hiatus with new music, announcing their fifth studio album titled ''[[Cause and Effect (Keane album)|Cause and Effect]]'' on 6 June 2019 and releasing the lead single from the album "The Way I Feel". A collection of the songs were written by Tim Rice-Oxley during his divorce, and after discussions with Tom who had visited Tim the previous year, decided to proceed with recording the songs for the album. ''Cause and Effect'' was released on 20 September 2019. After the release of the album, the band embarked on the Cause and Effect Tour, visiting Europe and Latin America, before the remainder of the tour was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

==History==
===1995–99: Early years and formation===
Tom Chaplin and Tim Rice-Oxley became friends when very young.<ref name="Strangers">''[[Strangers (DVD)|Strangers]]'' Keane DVD autobiography.</ref> Chaplin's father David was the headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, East Sussex (owned by Chaplin's family) for 25 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinehall.info/website/about/history.html |title=Vinehall School History |access-date=22 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618231118/http://www.vinehall.info/website/about/history.html |archive-date=18 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the school all three attended until the age of 13. They later attended [[Tonbridge School]] in [[Kent]], where Rice-Oxley met [[Dominic Scott]]; both discovered their liking for music. [[Richard Hughes (musician)|Richard Hughes]], Keane's future drummer, also attended Tonbridge. Chaplin had learned to play the flute, but none considered music as a proper career at the time.<ref name="book">{{Cite journal|last=Craic|first=Seamus|title=Keane: The Band|publisher=Artnik|date=31 January 2006|isbn=1-903906-64-4<!-- (UK)-->}}</ref>

In 1995, while studying at University College London, Rice-Oxley formed a rock band with Scott and invited Hughes to play drums.<ref name="Shore" /> The band, named Lotus Eaters, started as a cover band, playing songs by the members' favourite bands, including [[U2]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and [[The Beatles]], and rehearsing at home. <!--Waiting for reference -- Adam Tudhope, whom Rice-Oxley met and became friends with at University, became their manager ha. Tudhope is also involved in film production through his company, White House Pictures and has contributed to some English films such as ''[[Love Actually]]'' – -->

After listening to Rice-Oxley's piano playing during a weekend at [[Virginia Water]], Surrey in 1997, [[Chris Martin]] invited him to join his newly formed band [[Coldplay]]. However, Rice-Oxley declined because he did not want to leave The Lotus Eaters, stating "I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay's keyboard player idea was dropped."<ref name="Shore" /> Because of Martin's offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley's place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin's recruitment also marked a change of name from The Lotus Eaters to Cherry Keane after a friend of Chaplin's mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. At her death from cancer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keanemusic.com |title=Keanemusic – Tom Chaplin's blog, 28.06.07 |access-date=7 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612214136/http://www.keanemusic.com/ |archive-date=12 June 2006 }}</ref> she had left money for Chaplin's family. Chaplin commented: "I used some of the money to see me through the harder times with the music." The name was shortened to Keane soon afterward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chapman|first=Tegan|url=http://www.greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/327/2/|title=Keane man on success, songs and Steve Lamacq|website=Greatreporter.com|date=13 January 2005}}</ref>

Chaplin departed for South Africa in Summer 1997 to work as a volunteer during his [[gap year]].<ref name="Strangers" /> Chaplin's early experiences there later were reflected in the band's position for the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. Returning a year later, in July 1998, following a meeting with friend David Lloyd Seaman, Hughes' first words when the band picked up Chaplin at the airport were "we've got a gig in 10 days."<ref name="book" /> With original material, Keane made their debut live appearance at the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope & Anchor]] pub on 13 July 1998. In this same year, Chaplin went to Edinburgh University to study for a degree in art history]<ref name="book" /> However, he later quit his degree and moved to London to pursue a full-time musical career.<ref name="Shore" /><ref name="book" /> After their debut performance, the band went touring London's pub gig circuit throughout 1998 and 1999.

===1999–2003: Early releases and Scott's departure===
In late 1999, and without a record deal, Keane recorded their first promotional single "[[Call Me What You Like]]". Released on CD format through Keane's label Zoomorphic, it was sold after live performances at the pubs where Keane used to play in early 2000. Only 500 copies were printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/zoo_call.htm|title=Keaneshaped on "Call Me What You Like"|access-date =16 September 2006}}</ref> The band have declared they are not against fans sharing tracks unreleased on CD, such as the demos "[[Keane discography#More Matey|More Matey]]" and "[[Keane discography#Emily|Emily]]". Chaplin has said "they most likely see those recordings as an interesting extra to get hold of and I don't see it causing any damage. If it was the album we have coming out leaked early, then I'd probably feel differently."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco|title=Keaneshaped – Discography|access-date=12 September 2006}}</ref> The EP was reviewed by Bec Rodwell from ''eFestivals'' who listed "[[Call Me What You Like#Closer Now|Closer Now]]" as the best song of the record.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bec.|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/misc/reviews/keaneEP-010525.shtml|title=Keane : "Call Me What You Like" EP Review|work=eFestivals.com.uk|date=25 May 2001| access-date =12 September 2006}}</ref>

Four months after the "Call Me What You Like" re-recording session in February 2001, "[[Wolf at the Door]]" was released. Only 50 copies are known to have been made, using unlabelled [[CD-R]]s.<ref name="Wolf">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/zoo_wolf.htm|title=Keaneshaped on "Wolf at the Door"|access-date=4 August 2006}}</ref> Both singles are considered highly valuable collectors' items by fans. In particular, "Wolf at the Door" has been known to be sold for over [[Pound sterling|£]]1000 on eBay.<ref name="Wolf" />

Because of the limited success Keane had at this time, Scott decided to leave the group a month after this single was released to continue his studies at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keane.at/staring/website-old.htm |title=[14/11/01] entry |work=Keane.at |access-date=19 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013210447/http://keane.at/staring/website-old.htm |archive-date=13 October 2006 }}</ref> Before this, in November 2000, Keane had been invited by record producer James Sanger to his recording studio at Les Essarts, France, where the band recorded a number of tracks from August to November 2001, including "[[Bedshaped]]" and "[[This Is the Last Time]]". It was during these sessions that the idea of using a piano as lead instrument began to emerge. Sanger received a shared credit for four songs that appeared on Keane's debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'', including the song "Sunshine", the only one composed there.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cashmere|first=Tim|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/keane2004.html|title=Keane Undercover Music Interviews|access-date=19 August 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821170006/http://undercover.com.au/idol/keane2004.html|archive-date=21 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The remaining members of the band returned to England in November 2001. Soon after, they signed to [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] to publish their music, but at this time they did not yet have a recording contract. 2002 was a hard year for Keane. All recording or live performances were stopped, and Scott's feeling of going nowhere was starting to tell on Rice-Oxley and Chaplin.<ref name="book" />

In December 2002, Keane returned to performing live. Luckily for the band, one gig at the Betsey Trotwood in London was attended by [[Simon Williams (writer)|Simon Williams]] of [[Fierce Panda Records]], the same man who had discovered [[Coldplay]] years previously. Williams offered to release the first commercial single by the band. This release was "[[Everybody's Changing]]", which [[Steve Lamacq]] named single of the week on ''Lamacq Live'' on 19 April 2003; the CD single was released on 12 May 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/fp_ec.htm|title=Discography – Everybody's Changing (Fierce Panda)|work=Keaneshaped.co| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref>

As a result of the attention created by this release and because of the strong live reputation they had built through constant UK touring, a bidding war for the band ensued among major record labels.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hoyle|first=Wayne|url=http://www.virtual-festivals.com/artists/article.cfm?articleid=981|title=Keane Interview|date=14 April 2004| access-date =4 November 2006}}</ref> The band decided to sign with [[Island Records]] in Summer 2003. After first being attracted to the band by the considerable industry buzz then surrounding them and from hearing "Everybody's Changing" on the radio, the Island A&R, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, told [[HitQuarters]] that he wanted to sign them after hearing the five songs "Everybody’s Changing", "This Is the Last Time", "She Has No Time", "Bend and Break" and "Somewhere Only We Know", saying  "every one of them was brilliant...they had a fantastic live show [but] even if I hadn't been able to see them live, I would have tried to sign them anyway."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Ferdy_UngerHamilton_Interview.html |title=Interview With Ferdy Unger-Hamilton |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=21 March 2005 |access-date=18 April 2011}}</ref> According to Unger-Hamilton, Keane chose to sign with Island because they got on well with the A&R and were convinced that he did not want to change them in any way.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

The band released "This Is the Last Time" on Fierce Panda, in October 2003 as the final release on that label.

===2004–05: ''Hopes and Fears''===
{{Main|Hopes and Fears}}
With the release of their first major single, Keane began to achieve recognition in the United Kingdom and the United States, where "This Is the Last Time" was released and remained as the only single sold there until "Crystal Ball" in late 2006.

In January 2004, Keane was named the band most likely to achieve success in the coming year in the BBC's [[Sound of...|Sound of 2004]] poll; additionally, this year is popularly referred to as one of the best years for new British music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3369355.stm|title=Sound of 2004 music poll revealed|date=9 January 2004| access-date =10 September 2006 | work=BBC News}}</ref>

A month later, Keane's first release on Island was "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]", which reached number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 2004. On 4 May, a re-release of "[[Everybody's Changing]]" followed and featured new cover and b-sides; it reached number four in the UK Singles Chart.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Keane's debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' was released on 10 May 2004 in the UK, a day before the band started their first world tour. It debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and became the second best-selling British album of the year. It has been certified 9x platinum in the UK.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Drowned in Sound]] gave it 5 out of 10, accusing Keane of excessively imitating [[Coldplay]] (specifically comparing "Your Eyes Open" and "On a Day Like Today" with, respectively, "Daylight" and "Politik" on the band's album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''), criticising the album as being "stylistically all over the place" and its lyrics as being "immature" and "cringe-worthy". However, it gave credit to the album's "fine moments", praising lead single "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]" as "breathtaking".<ref>{{cite web|last=Future |first=Andrew |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3682/reviews/9594 |title=Album Review: Keane – Hopes and Fears / Releases / Releases // Drowned in Sound |work=Drowned in Sound |date=2004-05-13 |access-date=2014-05-10}}</ref>

The album has sold approximately 5.5 million copies worldwide. In the UK, it stayed in the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart for 72 weeks, appearing again on its 115th week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/haf.htm|title=Keaneshaped on ''Hopes and Fears''|access-date=25 May 2007}}</ref>

The band won two awards at the 2005 [[BRIT Awards]] in February; Best British album for ''Hopes and Fears'', and the British breakthrough act award as voted for by listeners of [[BBC Radio 1]]. Three months after, Rice-Oxley received the [[Ivor Novello]] award for songwriter of the year.

As members of the [[Make Poverty History]], Keane performed "Somewhere Only We Know" and "Bedshaped" at the [[Live 8]] concert, which took place in London on 2 July 2005. Keane are also patrons of [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], and in September 2005, they recorded a cover version of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (song)|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]" to the charity album ''[[Help: a Day in the Life]]''. Previously, the band had recorded a cover of [[the Walker Brothers]]' "[[The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore]]". It also was released as a [[Gramophone record|7" single]] as a gift to members of the Keane emailing list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/sun.htm|title=Discography – The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore|work=Keaneshaped.co.uk| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref>

Twenty years after the 1984 version, [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] (now called [[Band Aid 20]]) recorded a new version of "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]". Rice-Oxley and Chaplin both contributed vocals.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

During the year, the band achieved minor recognition in the U.S. from their extensive touring, which culminated with a series of gigs as the opening act for [[U2]]. The group were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category along with [[Sugarland]], [[John Legend]], [[Ciara]], and [[Fall Out Boy]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2005-12-08-grammy-list-nominations_x.htm|title= Complete list of Grammy Award nominations (48th)|work=[[USA Today]]|date=8 February 2006| access-date =25 May 2007}}</ref>

===2006–07: ''Under the Iron Sea''===
{{Main|Under the Iron Sea}}
In April 2005, in the middle of the Hopes and Fears tour, the band began recording ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' with producer Andy Green, who worked with them on ''Hopes and Fears''. The band later recruited [[Mark 'Spike' Stent|Mark "Spike" Stent]] for mixing duties. Recording took place in Helioscentric Studios, where ''Hopes and Fears'' was recorded. Additional recording was done at The Magic Shop Studios in New York.

The album's release was preceded by the release of the "[[Atlantic (song)|Atlantic]]", a download-only music video and the lead single "[[Is It Any Wonder?]]", which reached number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] in 2007. The album had a worldwide release in June 2006 and was at number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] for the first two weeks of its release. {{As of|2007|05|22}}, it had sold more than 2.2 million copies. The third single from the album was "Crystal Ball", released on 21 August 2006, and reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The fourth single from the album was "[[Nothing in My Way]]", released on 30 October 2006, which received particular success on Mexican commercial radio, charting on Top 3 on 13 January 2007 and staying a month on that chart. The band released the single "[[The Night Sky]]" in aid of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]].

Before the release of the album (in May 2006), Keane had started their second world tour. However, because of the extensive touring, on 22 August 2006, Chaplin announced he had admitted himself to a clinic for drinking and drug problems. This initially resulted in the cancellation of three gigs and postponement of their September tour. The entire North American tour was cancelled outright to allow continued treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keanemusic.com/news.php?action=get&id=1159&y=06&m=09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007171130/http://www.keanemusic.com/news.php?action=get&id=1159&y=06&m=09|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 October 2007|title=Keane cancel N. American tour|work=KeaneMusic.com|date=9 August 2006| access-date =8 September 2006}}</ref> As a result, the upcoming UK and European tours, scheduled for October and November 2006, were considered to be liable for possible postponement depending on Chaplin's treatment. Chaplin then left the Priory Clinic in London on 6 October, but he continued to receive treatment. The tour reached for the first time South American countries (Argentina, Chile and Brazil) and saw the band's third visit to Mexico in late April with four dates, playing at the downtown [[zócalo]] in Mexico City, as well their first visit to Monterrey and Guadalajara. On 7 July 2007, Keane played at the [[Live Earth concert, London|UK leg]] of [[Live Earth]] at Wembley Stadium, part of a series of gigs similar to [[Live 8]], to highlight the threat of global warming. They performed "Somewhere Only We Know", "Is It Any Wonder?" and "Bedshaped". The Under the Iron Sea tour was brought to an end with performances in Oporto, Portugal, and at the Natural Music Festival in El Ejido, Spain on 3 August and 4 respectively.

In 2008, ''Under the Iron Sea'' was voted the 8th best British album of all time by a poll conducted by ''Q'' Magazine and HMV.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7249473.stm |title=BBC Entertainment |work=BBC News |date=18 February 2008 |access-date=2012-08-26}}</ref> In early October, Concert Live announced they were releasing a limited edition nine-CD set of every Keane live performance in the UK during October 2006 under the name ''[[Live 06]]''.

===2008–09: ''Perfect Symmetry''===
{{Main|Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)}}

In a March 2007 video interview, Chaplin and Hughes spoke of wanting to take a more "organic" approach on album three, but played down suggestions about the use of guitars, referring to them as "a fun part of the live set" at present; however, the cover of "[[A Bad Dream#She Sells Sanctuary|She Sells Sanctuary]]" became the first song recorded since "The Happy Soldier" (2001) to feature the instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/display?id=opencms:/out/hotnow/music/keane_interview |title=Keane Interview |format=Video |work=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]] |access-date=14 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316100121/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/display?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fhotnow%2Fmusic%2Fkeane_interview |archive-date=16 March 2007 }}</ref> Photographic updates to the Keane website implied the use of guitars in the album's recording sessions. [[Jesse Quin]] joined the band since this album as permanent studio and live member. He plays the bass, percussion, guitar, synths and backing vocals.

Helen Lear from ''The Music'' wrote that ''Strangeland'' "will still sound to some like middle-of-the-road indie-pop" and "pretty much what you would expect from Keane", but "the tempo is noticeably more upbeat and the style more diverse than previous albums" and "offers some more fun in a grown-up style that may attract new fans to take a listen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/reviews/album/2012/05/03/keane-strangeland/ |title=Keane - Strangeland |publisher=Themusic.com.au |date=2012-05-03 |access-date=2012-05-11}}</ref> Chris Roberts of the BBC criticised ''Strangeland'' as "an unabashed scurry back to the comfort zone", and that "Keane lack blood, guts and muscle", with the album ultimately classed as "a somewhat saddening step backwards."<ref name="Roberts">{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Chris|title=Review of Keane - Strangeland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m2d3|publisher=BBC|access-date=3 May 2012|date=29 April 2012}}</ref> John Murphy of musicOMH rated the album two stars out of five, where "melodies are stodgy and predictable", with "a whole bucket of cliches piled in", calling ''Strangeland'' "proof positive that playing it safe is not always the best option."<ref name="Murphy">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/keane-5_0412.htm |title=Keane - Strangeland &#124; album reviews |publisher=musicOMH |access-date=2012-05-11}}</ref> Ian Gittins of Virgin Media felt the album was "major musical step back from the wilful experimentalism of ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'', a record that saw Keane hiring dance producer [[Stuart Price]] and leaping far out of their comfort zone", commenting that the album "finds them fairly back in the middle of the road".<ref>{{cite web|author=Album review by Ian Gittins |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/reviews/keane-strangeland.php |title=Keane: Strangeland Album Review - Reviews - Music |publisher=Virgin Media |date=2012-05-07 |access-date=2012-05-11}}</ref>

{{Main|Cause and Effect (Keane album)|Cause and Effect Tour}}

Toward the end of 2018, Keane posted a series of cryptic images onto their various social media accounts, hinting that the quartet were in the studio working on material.

On 17 January 2019, an article from ''The Sun'' revealed that the band are planning "to make a comeback after six years away" and that a "source close to the rockers has revealed the band is ready to work together again after 'putting their differences to one side'".

On 6 February, Keane posted an image of them on their various social media accounts. This was followed by several announcements on their Instagram and Facebook sites of various festivals in which the band would perform, including Cornbury Music Festival (6 July 2019), 4ever Valencia Fest in Spain (21 July 2019), MEO Marés Vivas in Portugal (19 July 2019), Noches del Botánico in Madrid (20 July 2019), and Hello Festival in The Netherlands (9 June).

On 15 March 2019, Keane performed their song "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]" on [[Comic Relief|Comic Relief's Red Nose Day]] on BBC One with London Contemporary Voices. On 26 March 2019, Keane posted "We’ve been desperate to tell you that we’re busy making another album, which we’ll be releasing later this year" to their Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/keane/photos/a.389942263717/10157026967578718/?type=3&theater|title=Keane|website=Facebook.com|access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref>

On 17 May 2019, Keane released an EP titled ''Retroactive EP1'' featuring "our favourite archived live performances, older demos and random treasures".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/retroactive-ep1-ep/1463186790|title=Retroactive – EP1 – EP by Keane|website=Music.apple.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/keane/videos/2203806506354596/|title=Keane – Retroactive EP|website=Facebook.com}}</ref> On 6 June 2019, the band released the first new single from ''[[Cause and Effect (Keane album)|Cause and Effect]]'', titled "The Way I Feel".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2019/06/06/keane-returns-with-tour-announcement-new-album-cause-and-effect-out-9-20-with-new-track-the-way-i-feel/|title=Keane Returns With Tour Announcement & New Album, Cause and Effect, Out 9/20 – With New Track 'The Way I Feel'|website=Ventsmagazine.com|date=6 June 2019}}</ref>

On 6 August 2019, the band performed live "The Way I Feel" on ''[[Today (American TV program)|The Today Show]]''. Later that day, they hinted at the release of their second single from ''Cause and Effect'', titled "Love Too Much". On 8 August 2019, "Love Too Much" was released for streaming and debuted on ''The Breakfast Show'' on BBC Radio 2. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, writing "Not a game-changing comeback by any means, ''Cause and Effect'' is instead a satisfying return to form that manages to gracefully age Keane by invigorating a familiar formula with wisdom and honesty learned over a dramatic, life-changing decade."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cause-and-effect-mw0003289655 |title=cause and effect review |access-date=15 July 2020}}</ref>

=== 2021-present: Dirt EP ===

==Collaborations==
In November 2004, Keane collaborated with electronic DJ Faultline on a cover of the [[Elton John]] song "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road". Two years later, Rice-Oxley collaborated with [[Gwen Stefani]] as a co-writer of the song "[[Early Winter]]", released later in 2007 as a single, from her album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]''. Stefani had been wishing to work with the band since 2005, and Rice-Oxley responded by saying "we might give it a go".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keane.at/articles/154.html |title=Gwen Stefani eyes up Keane |access-date=28 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011170122/http://keane.at/articles/154.html |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> Tom Chaplin collaborated with Rocco Deluca and the Burden on the song "Mercy". The band collaborated with Somali-Canadian rapper [[K'naan]] and Japanese [[Funk carioca|Baile Funk]] singer Tigarah on the EP ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]''. In late 2009, Rice-Oxley collaborated with the Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]] as co-writer of the song "Everything Is Beautiful", for Minogue's eleventh studio album "[[Aphrodite (album)|Aphrodite]]", released in June 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/7854430/Kylie-Minogue-Aphrodite-CD-review.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Kylie Minogue: Aphrodite, CD review | first=Neil | last=McCormick | date=25 June 2010}}</ref>
The band collaborated with dance artist [[Chicane (recording artist)|Chicane]] on a remix of the song "Bend & Break", renamed "Wake Up". It was featured on the artist's 2008 best-of compilation. In 2012, Tom Chaplin collaborated with the Dutch singer Laura Jansen on the song "Same Heart" for a Dutch charity radio programme. The track was featured on Jansen's second studio album ''Elba''. In 2017, a version of Tom Chaplin's solo track "Solid Gold", featuring alternative pop singer JONES, was released as a single.

==Musical style and themes==
Tim Rice-Oxley and Dominic Scott were the main writers of the band's songs during their early years. When Scott left in 2001, Rice-Oxley became the main composer.<ref name="Songs">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/faq/#writes|title=FAQ – Who writes the songs?|work=Keaneshaped.com| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref> However, Rice-Oxley credits the rest of the band on all compositions, so that royalties for song credits are shared.<ref name="Songs" />

Keane usually harbours an ample, reverberated, melodic, slow- to mid-tempo fully orchestrated sound, somehow reminiscent of [[Elton John]]'s early and middle career, and their more introspective songs have brought comparisons to [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Jeff Buckley]].

While guitars have been (minimally) present even in their early work, their appearance in the final mix has always been slight, and while Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as to be more than barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as "the band with no guitars", thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] and [[distortion]] effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren't immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what they really wanted to do was try something different. He referred to the piano as an odd instrument to form part of a rock band instrumentation, comparing it to The Beatles' set of instruments. Rice-Oxley's distortion piano has been key to most of Keane's multifaceted style and most definitely their most recognizable asset.

Keane have covered songs by music artists such as [[U2]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIeY5sWWNgM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/SIeY5sWWNgM| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=with or without you-keane |publisher=YouTube |access-date=4 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Rufus Wainwright]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7COEI4vm1E | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/_7COEI4vm1E| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=keane dinner at eight |publisher=YouTube |date=16 July 2007 |access-date=4 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Depeche Mode]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTzQC9alliU |title=Keane – Enjoy The Silence ( Depeche mode cover ) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref> [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Cult]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Rice-Oxley said "I guess it's classic song writing that is the main influence rather than one band in particular – we love people like [[Nick Drake]] who can convey so much emotion and write songs and albums that will be loved and cherished for many years – the things that will be in people's record collections for their whole lives."<ref name="keaneshaped.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/faq/#influences |title=FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions|website=Keaneshaped.co.uk |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref>
