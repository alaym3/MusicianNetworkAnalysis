In early 2000, he composed his own songs and writes, in particular, ''Rue des Souffrances'', a song featured on his first LP.

=== Career as a songwriter ===
From 2003 to 2006, Elias composed some songs for other artists with many writers. He signed a contract with Free Demo, a publishing house in [[Paris]] (V.M.A group ) and then he started writing songs for French real T.V artists (''[[Star Academy (France)|Star Academy]]'' and ''[[Nouvelle Star]]'').<ref>[http://www.francebleu.fr/societe/place-des-grands-hommes/place-des-grands-hommes-france-bleu-gironde-recoit-elias-18h10 Interview d'Elias], francebleu.fr, 19 June 2014</ref>

Between 2007 and 2008 he took a professional break.

From 2009 on, Elias decided to sing his own songs; and wrote and composed most of the titles of his first LP.

=== LPs ===
In January 2010, Elias registered on Akamusic, the online crowdfunding site, to back financially a single for which they quickly got the budget.<ref>[http://www.akastarter.com/elias Elias] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720173130/http://www.akastarter.com/elias |date=20 July 2014 }}, akastarter.com, 19 June 2014</ref>

During the summer 2010, via Akamusic, the same community site, Elias settled the financing of an album with 10 titles which were released in February 2012 (''Des roses en hiver'') This first LP is particularly made up of songs that he wrote himself. The other extracts were written by Laura Bismuth, Sabine Cardinal, Maurice Vallet and David Zana. Love is the recurrent theme – love of a woman, love of life or love of the other.<ref>[http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Elias/news-77270.html Elias : écoutez son nouveau single], chartsinfrance.net, 19 June 2014</ref> The titles are often to the sound of banjo-guitar and the lyrics, optimistic, are in the true French music tradition of years 2000.

At the beginning of 2014, in order to record and to promote his 2nd LP; with 11 titles, he signed up on ''[[My Major Company]]'', the crowdfunding site.<ref>[http://www.mymajorcompany.com/elias-un-nouveau-jour-se-leve selon Elias], mymajorcompany.com, 19 June 2014</ref> If he is still composing musics, he makes sure of the support of many writers such as Sabine Cardinal, Iza Loris, Daria de Martynoff, Jacques Roure, Maurice Vallet, Christian Vié or François Welgryn.<ref>[http://www.webtoulousain.fr/index.php/actualites/culture/1878-elias-revient-avec-son-nouveau-projetn-un-nouveau-jour-se-leve.html Elias revient avec son nouveau projet : Un nouveau jour se lève] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140528110324/http://www.webtoulousain.fr/index.php/actualites/culture/1878-elias-revient-avec-son-nouveau-projetn-un-nouveau-jour-se-leve.html |date=28 May 2014 }}, webtoulousain.fr, 19 June 2014</ref> For this new LP, the ''pop with electro strains'' music had been largely influenced by Anglo-Saxon bands, such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]] or [[Coldplay]], that Elias had been listening to.
