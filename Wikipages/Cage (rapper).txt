His father would often force Palko to pull homemade [[tourniquets]] around his arm as he injected heroin. At the age of eight, Palko's father was arrested during a standoff with state troopers after threatening his family with a [[shotgun]].<ref name="Goldberg">{{cite web |first=Michael Alan |last=Goldberg |title=Cage: Plenty to rap about |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/177858 |website=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=November 24, 2005 |access-date=2008-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045724/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/177858/ |archive-date=March 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Jeffries">{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|title=Biography of Cage|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cage-mn0000536470/biography|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227195339/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cage-mn0000536470/biography|archive-date=2015-02-27|access-date=2008-09-09|website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> By the time Palko was expelled from high school, his mother had remarried twice, and he was beaten by his stepfather Frank.

Palko was arrested several times for drug possession and fighting in the streets. When he faced jail time for violating probation, his mother convinced the judge that he was mentally unstable, and he was sent to the Stony Lodge psychiatric hospital for a two-week evaluation.

==Career==

===1991–2001: Career beginnings===
When Palko was released from the hospital at eighteen, he pursued a career as a rapper, giving himself the stagename "Alex", after the protagonist of [[Anthony Burgess]]' novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref name="Bio"/> After hiring a manager and recording a [[Demo (music)|demo]], he was introduced to rapper [[Pete Nice]], and Cage was featured on the 1993 album ''[[Dust to Dust (Pete Nice and DJ Richie Rich album)|Dust to Dust]]''.

When García founded the label [[Fondle 'Em Records]], he offered Palko a record deal, and Cage released a single featuring the songs "Radiohead" and "Agent Orange" in 1997, to success and acclaim.<ref name="Bio"/> Following the release of ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' in December 1997, Palko accused [[Detroit]]-based rapper [[Eminem]] of imitating his style.<ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Drumming |title=Smut Peddlers: Split-Level Raunch |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-417506.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 14, 2001 |access-date=2008-09-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812052334/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-417506.html |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11923595_ITM |first=Matt |last=Dearborn |author2=Duke |title=Interview: His name is not Slim Shady |publisher=University Wire |date=December 1, 2005 |access-date=2008-09-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918021355/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11923595_ITM |archive-date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>

After several more singles with Fondle 'Em, Palko met Mr. Eon and DJ Mighty Mi of [[The High & Mighty]], and the trio formed the group Smut Peddlers, releasing the album ''[[Porn Again]]'' on [[Rawkus Records]] in 2001.

Because Palko felt that he should no longer play a character, he began to take on a more open writing style,<ref name="Jeffries"/> and signed with [[Definitive Jux]], where he released his second studio album ''[[Hell's Winter]]'', on September 20, 2005.
