In 1960, Rivera was nominated for a Tony Award<ref name="bw"/> for creating the role of Rose in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]'' opposite [[Dick Van Dyke]].

In 1963, Rivera was a guest on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' and was cast opposite [[Alfred Drake]] in ''[[Zenda (musical)|Zenda]]''. The Broadway-bound musical closed on the road but in 1964, Rivera returned to Broadway in ''[[Bajour (musical)|Bajour]]''<ref name=":0" /> and television in ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''<ref name=":1" />''.''

Among many national tours, Rivera starred most notably in ''Sweet Charity'' directed by [[Bob Fosse]], playing the role of Nickie in the film adaptation of ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]'' with [[Shirley MacLaine]] (1969).<ref name="N" /> Rivera appeared three times on ''The Hollywood Palace'', twice on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (including an episode airing February 22, 1971<ref>The Carol Burnett Show Collector's Edition</ref><ref name=":1" />) and between 1973–74, played Connie Richardson on ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.<ref name=":1" /> In 1975, she earned a Tony Award nomination<ref name="bw" /> starring as Velma Kelly opposite [[Gwen Verdon]] in the original cast of the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'',<ref name="N" /> directed by [[Bob Fosse]].

Miraculously revitalized, in 1988, she toured the country in ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' and got involved in a restaurant venture in partnership with the novelist [[Daniel Simone]]. The eatery, located on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] between [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|9th]] and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]], was named "Chita's" after her.
