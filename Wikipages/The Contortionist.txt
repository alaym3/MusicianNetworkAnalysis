'''The Contortionist''' is an American [[progressive metal]] band from [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Formed in 2007, the band consists of guitarists Robby Baca and Cameron Maynard, drummer Joey Baca, vocalist Mike Lessard, bassist Jordan Eberhardt, and keyboardist Eric Guenther. They have released four studio albums and three EPs. The band signed with [[E1 Music|E1]] and [[Good Fight Music]] in early 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Fight Music|url=http://www.goodfightmusic.com/artists/thecontortionist.php#|publisher=Good Fight Music|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The Contortionist formed in 2007 under the name At the Hands of Machines with vocalist Jake Morris, guitarists Roby Baca and Cameron Maynard, bassist Christopher Tilley, and drummer Joey Baca. The band's first release, the EP ''[[Sporadic Movements (EP)|Sporadic Movements]]'', was released later that year. At the Hands of Machines changed their name to The Contortionist following the EP's release and the same line-up recorded the EP ''[[Shapeshifter (The Contortionist EP)|Shapeshifter]]'', which was released in September 2008. These two EPs featured a [[deathcore]] sound in contrast to the band's later works. Following the release of ''Shapeshifter'', vocalist Jake Morris left the band and was replaced by Dave Hoffman, who also provided keyboards. The band entered Voltaic Recording Studio in early 2009 and released their third EP, ''[[Apparition (EP)|Apparition]]'', in September of that year. The sound of this EP continued the deathcore sound heard with Morris, but also showed the band incorporating elements of [[progressive metal]] into its music. 

Hoffman departed the band in early 2010 and was replaced by Jonathan Carpenter. Not too long after Carpenter's arrival, The Contortionist began work on their debut album, ''[[Exoplanet (album)|Exoplanet]]''. ''Exoplanet'' was released on August 31, 2010 through [[Good Fight Music]]. The album's sound continued the progressive metal/deathcore sound heard on ''Apparition'', with lyrics exploring themes such as space and interstellar travel. Several of the album's songs are reworked songs from ''Apparition'', featuring new lyrics written by Carpenter with slightly different musical passages. The band's second album, ''[[Intrinsic (album)|Intrinsic]]'', was released on July 17, 2012. A month before the album's release, the Contortionist released their first music video for the song "Holomovement." The sound of ''Intrinsic'' differed from previous releases; the album still contained elements of deathcore, but had a greater focus on melody and atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/50945/The-Contortionist-Intrinsic|title=The Contortionist: Intrinsic - Sputnikmusic - Staff review|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]|author= Jacob Royal|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> Carpenter's lyrics focused on science fiction themes which are reflected in the music videos for "Causality" and "Dreaming Schematics."

In March 2013, Jonathan Carpenter announced his departure from the band. At the time, Carpenter and his longtime girlfriend (now his wife) were expecting their first child. He left on good terms with the band to focus on his personal life and starting his family. Carpenter commented on his departure:

{{quotation|"It's going to be a jarring change of pace for my life, not being on the road most of the year. Making songs with the band and then performing them in front of the best fans has been a once in a lifetime experience. I wouldn't trade the perspective I've found in the past few years for anything. I got to meet so many amazing people and see a good chunk of the world. I absolutely intend to keep creating and playing music in the future, albeit in a more personal pursuit.

I will miss seeing everyone in the TC family very much. I wish the best to all of my band buds and everyone who supports live music and all this heavy banger music we've been making. I feel very excited for my future with the love of my life and our pups, and our little one on the way. Music has always been one of my passions and that's what drew me to this band in the first place. The music comes first, and I know that the talent of the band will rise above this member change and they will find a new arrangement that will blow your minds."}}

Robby Baca also commented on Carpenter leaving:
<blockquote>"We are sad to see John go, but at the same time remain fully supportive of his decision. We look forward to the process of finding a new vocalist and writing a new record."</blockquote>

Mike Lessard of [[Last Chance to Reason]]  took over vocal duties for upcoming shows until the band found a permanent replacement. Mike Lessard commented on filling in for Carpenter:

<blockquote>"I'm happy to be helping my friends in the Contortionist for the next few months on tour as a temporary vocalist. I'll be returning to my duties in Last Chance to Reason once these dates are finished in May. I look forward to seeing a bunch of new and familiar faces in the months to come."

On April 23, 2014, the Contortionist announced via Facebook the completion of recording their third full-length album. The album was produced by Jamie King ([[Between the Buried and Me]], [[He Is Legend]], [[The Human Abstract (band)|the Human Abstract]], among many others).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Contortionist Enter The Studio For New Album|accessdate=May 18, 2014|url=http://www.theprp.com/2014/03/20/news/the-contortionist-enter-the-studio-for-new-album/|date=March 20, 2014}}</ref> On June 26, 2014, the Contortionist announced on their Facebook page that their new album, entitled ''Language'', would be released September 16, 2014 through eOne and Good Fight Music. It was also officially made known that bassist Christopher Tilley had been replaced by former [[Scale the Summit]] bassist, Jordan Eberhardt, for unannounced reasons. During an AMA session, which took place on September 12, a question regarding Christopher Tilley's departure was answered, the band's response was: "Touring and all that comes with it just wasn't what Tilley wanted to do anymore. We love Chris and wish him the best!"

The band released their fourth album, entitled ''[[Clairvoyant (album)|Clairvoyant]]'', on September 15, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprogressiveaspect.net/blog/2017/09/13/the-contortionist-clairvoyant/|title=The Contortionist – Clairvoyant|author=Calder Hannan|publisher=The Progressive Aspect|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}</ref> This album featured a softer sound, with predominantly clean vocals.

On August 9, 2019, the band released the EP ''Our Bones''. The EP features two new full-length songs, an [[Ambient music|ambient]] interlude, and a cover of "[[1979 (song)|1979]]," originally by [[the Smashing Pumpkins]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Metal Injection|author=Leon T.K.|url=https://metalinjection.net/reviews/the-contortionist-our-bones|title=EP Review: THE CONTORTIONIST Our Bones|date=August 16, 2019|accessdate=September 11, 2019}}</ref>
