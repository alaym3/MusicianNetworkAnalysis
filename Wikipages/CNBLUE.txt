'''CNBLUE''' ({{lang-ko|씨엔블루}}) is a South Korean [[pop rock]] band formed in 2009. The band consists of [[Jung Yong-hwa]] (leader, main vocals, [[guitar]], keyboard, [[rapping|rap]]), [[Kang Min-hyuk]] ([[drum kit|drums]]), and [[Lee Jung-shin]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]). First bassist Kwon Kwang-jin left the band after they released their debut Japanese [[extended play]] ''Now or Never'' in 2009, and was replaced by Lee Jung-shin. [[Lee Jong-hyun]] (guitar and vocals) left the band on August 28, 2019.

CN is an initialism for ''Code Name'', while BLUE is a [[backronym]] for ''burning'', ''lovely'', ''untouchable'', and ''emotional''; it is meant to portray the images of Jong-hyun, Min-hyuk, Jung-shin, and Yong-hwa, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ko:씨엔블루 "할아버지 밴드 되기로 약속했죠"|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1000696429|website=SBS News|publisher=[[Seoul Broadcasting System]]|access-date=October 6, 2015|language=ko|date=January 13, 2010|archive-date=October 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005085613/http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1000696429|url-status=live}}</ref> On January 14, 2010, CNBLUE debuted in Korea with the lead single "[[I'm a Loner]]" from their first Korean EP ''[[Bluetory]]''.
