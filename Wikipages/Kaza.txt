|group=note}}) is an [[administrative division]] historically used in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and currently used in several of its successor states. The term is from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and means "jurisdiction"; it is often translated "district",<ref name=Faroqhi/> "sub-district"<ref name=Quataert/> (though this also applies to a [[nahiye]]), or "juridical district".<ref name=Rogan/>

==Ottoman Empire==
In the Ottoman Empire, a kaza was originally a "geographical area subject to the legal and administrative jurisdiction of a ''[[kadı]]''.<ref name=Somel151/> With the first [[Tanzimat]] reforms of 1839, the administrative duties of the ''kadı'' were transferred to a governor ''([[kaymakam]])'', with the ''kadıs'' acting as judges of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref name=Somel144/> In the Tanzimat era, the kaza became an administrative district with the 1864 Provincial Reform Law, which was implemented over the following decade.<ref name=Rogan/> A kaza unified the jurisdiction of a governor ''(kaymakam)'' appointed by the [[Interior ministry|Ministry of the Interior]],<ref name=Cetinsaya/> a treasurer (chief finance officer), and a judge ''(kadı)'' in a single administrative unit.<ref name=Rogan/> It was part of efforts of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to establish uniform, rational administration across the empire.<ref name=Rogan/>

The kaza was a subdivision of a [[sanjak]]<ref name=Somel151/> and corresponded roughly to a city with its surrounding villages. Kazas, in turn, were divided into [[Nahiyah|nahiyes]] (governed by ''müdürs'' and ''[[mütesellim]]s'') and villages (''karye'', governed by ''[[Muhtar (title)|muhtars]]'').<ref name=Cetinsaya/> The 1871 revisions to the administrative law established the nahiye (still governing a ''müdür''), as an intermediate level between the kaza and the village.<ref name=Cetinsaya/>

==Turkey==
The early [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] continued to use the term ''kaza'' until it renamed them [[List of districts in Turkey|ilçe]] in the 1920s.

==Arab countries==
The kaza was also formerly a second-level administrative division in [[Syria]], but it is now called a [[mintaqah]].

The kaza or '''qadaa''' is used to refer to the following:

* [[districts of Iraq]] (second-level, below the governorate)
* [[districts of Lebanon]] (second-level, below the governorate)
* [[Jordan#Administrative divisions|Sub-districts]] (third-level, below the governorate and the district)
* [[Districts of Mandatory Palestine|subdistricts of Mandatory Palestine]]
* [[Districts of Israel|Counties of Israel]]
