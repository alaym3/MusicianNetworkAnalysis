'''George Baker Selection''' was a pop-rock band from [[Zaanstad]], the [[Netherlands]].

== History ==
In 1968, Hans Bouwens from [[Wormerveer]] joined the band ''Soul Invention'', a soul band that had been founded the previous year by Henk Kramer in [[Assendelft]] and played covers of songs by [[Otis Redding]] and [[Sam and Dave]]. The band consisted of Job Netten (guitar), Henk Kramer and Eric Bardoen (saxophone), Jacques Greuter (keyboard and flute), Theo Vermast and later Jan Visser (bass), and Ton Vredenburg (drums). Visser and Bouwens wrote the song "Little Greenback" (sic) in the summer of 1969.<ref>[http://www.zaansepophistorie.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=43&Itemid=27 Soul Invention] at "Zaanse Pophistory (in Dutch)</ref> The band recorded their first album in September 1969, after which, considering this was no soul music, they changed their name to '''"The George Baker Selection,"''' Bouwens naming himself for a character from a detective novel.<ref name=npo>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio5nostalgia.nl/weekartiest/44163/george-baker-selection.html|title=Weekartiest: George Baker Selection|publisher=[[NPO Radio 5]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> This first album, ''Little Green Bag'' (1970), produced an immediate worldwide hit:<ref name=npo/> their debut single, "[[Little Green Bag]]," reached No. 16 on the [[Cash Box magazine]] [[record chart|chart]] and No. 21 on the [[Billboard Top 100]] in the United States.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|title=George Baker Biography |work=www.georgebaker.com|url=http://www.georgebaker.com/website/ontwerpgb/English/biografie.html|accessdate=2007-05-25|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060047/http://www.georgebaker.com/website/ontwerpgb/English/biografie.html |archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy}}</ref> The success came as a surprise for Baker, who remembers hearing it on the radio while he was working in a lemonade factory.<ref name=npo/> The single sold over one million copies globally and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/273 273]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/273}}</ref> A string of singles and albums followed; the second single, "Dear Ann," was such a success that Baker resigned from his job in the lemonade factory and became a full-time musician. Not all band members followed suit and, besides Bouwens, the "Selection" from mid 1970 was formed by Jan Visser, Jan Hop (drums), Jacques Greuter and George Thé (voice, guitar, bass). In March 1971 Jan Visser left the band to be replaced by Cor Veerman.<ref>[http://www.zaansepophistorie.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158&Itemid=28 George Baker (Selection)] at "Zaanse Pophistory (in Dutch)</ref> Besides scoring hits with his own Selection, Baker also wrote songs for others, including [[BZN]], [[The Shoes (Dutch band)|The Shoes]], Andy Star, and Next One. In 1974, singer Lida Bond joined the Selection, and combining her voice with Baker's proved highly successful.<ref name=npo/>

Their fifth album, ''Paloma Blanca'', was released in 1975, and the single "[[Paloma Blanca]]" reached No. 1 on charts in several countries. It sold more than seven million copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful Dutch singles ever.<ref name=npo/>

In 1978, the George Baker Selection split up because "the pressure had become too much." The band has sold over 20 million records worldwide. George Baker formed a new George Baker Selection in 1982, which stayed together until 1989.<ref name="bio"/> The band has released twelve albums and several [[compilation album]]s.

The band experienced a brief return to the international charts in 1992 when the song "[[Little Green Bag]]" was used in the title sequence of the film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and in "Machos", a Chilean soap opera in 2003. The song is also featured in a Moto X smartphone commercial circa 2013.
