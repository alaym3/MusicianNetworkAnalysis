'''William Alan Finn''' (born February 28, 1952) is an American composer and lyricist. He is best known for his musicals, which include ''[[Falsettos]]'', for which he won the 1992 [[Tony Award]]s for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]] and [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book]], ''[[A New Brain]]'' (1998), and ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'' (2005).

==Early life==
Finn was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He is Jewish,<ref>Friedman, Jonathan C.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sg_uzWabr5cC&pg=PA83&dq=william+finn+jewish&hl=en&ei=hltHTvehHcX20gG926jeBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=finn%20jewish&f=false "Chapter Three"] ''Rainbow Jews:Jewish and Gay Identity in the Performing Arts'', Lexington Books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-7391-1448-4}}, p.74</ref> raised in [[conservative Judaism]],<ref name="Tablet">[[Wayne Hoffman (author)|Hoffman, Wayne]].

He attended the Temple Israel in Natick, where his Rabbi was [[Harold Kushner]]. In Hebrew School, Finn wrote his first play, saying, "I don't think I ever told anyone this: The first play I ever wrote was in Hebrew. I have no idea what it was about. But it was horrible, I guarantee it. I couldn't write plays, and I couldn't really speak Hebrew, so how good could it be?"<ref name="Tablet"/> While attending [[Natick High School]], Finn competed with the Natick Speech Team and was in the drama department headed by Gerald Dyer.<ref>Aucoin, Don.

[http://www.playbill.com/article/playbill-on-lines-brief-encounter-with-william-finn-com-329495] ''Playbill'' February 10, 2004</ref>

He went on to attend [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] as a music major. He originally entered as a guitar major, "When I got to college I kind of transferred to the piano. I transferred what I knew on the guitar to the piano. But when I was playing the guitar I was always writing my own songs — and singing a few of — I only had one book of folk songs, a blue book, of these sad, sad folk songs. ...I would start them the way they were written and then I would change them to how I wanted them….I would just use the lyrics — re-musicalize the lyrics."<ref name="Playbill1"/> He attended Williams after another future prominent musical theatre writer, [[Stephen Sondheim]]. When he graduated, he received the Hutchinson Fellowship (a musical composition award).<ref>Ruhlmann, William.[http://new.music.yahoo.com/william-finn/biography/ "William Finn Biography] new.music.yahoo.com, accessed August 22, 2011</ref> He is also Adjunct Faculty Composer/Lyricist at [[New York University]].<ref name="gradprofiles.com">[http://www.gradprofiles.com/nyu-tisch.html "Programs and Faculty, New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, New York, NY"] ''New York University'', accessed February 15, 2011</ref>

==Career==
Finn is a heavily [[autobiography|autobiographical]] writer; he always writes his own lyrics. His topics have included the [[gay]] and [[Jew]]ish experiences in contemporary America, and also family, belonging, sickness, healing, and loss. According to a 2006 article, "''The Washington Post'' called him 'the composer laureate of loss.'"<ref name=sf/>

Finn is especially noted for his work on what was to become a trilogy of short musicals [[Off-Broadway]]. ''[[In Trousers]]'', ''[[March of the Falsettos]]'', and ''[[Falsettoland]]'' all chronicle the lives of the character Marvin, his ex-wife Trina, his boyfriend, Whizzer, his [[psychiatrist]], Mendel, and his son, Jason.<ref name=time>Henry, William A.[http://www.barringtonstageco.org/aboutus/ "The Quirky William Finn"]''Time Magazine'', May 11, 1992</ref> ''[[Falsettos]]'', the combination of the latter two parts of his Marvin Trilogy (''March of the Falsettos'' and ''Falsettoland''), opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[John Golden Theater]] on April 29, 1992,<ref name=time/> and ran for 486 performances. It went on to garner seven nominations at the [[46th Tony Awards]], winning two: the 1992 [[Tony Award for Best Original Score]] as well as the 1992 [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical]], the latter shared with [[James Lapine]].

A critically acclaimed revival opened on September 29, 2016 at the [[Walter Kerr Theater]] and went on to garner five nominations at the [[71st Tony Awards]], including [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical|Best Revival]].

With Lapine, Finn penned a musical loosely based on his near-death experience following brain surgery, exploring the role of music in his life and recovery. The musical's main character is a man who has what may be a terminal arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Finn's longtime partner, Arthur Salvadore, is represented by the character Roger Delli-Bovi. Finn's mother is also present in the piece.<ref name=sf>Pall, Ellen.[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/magazine/the-long-running-musical-of-william-finn-s-life.html?ref=williamfinn "The Long-Running Musical of William Finn's Life"] nytimes.com, February 20, 2012</ref> That musical, ''[[A New Brain]]'', starred [[Malcolm Gets]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]] and [[Chip Zien]], and premiered [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Lincoln Center Theater]] in 1998.<ref>Brantley, Ben.[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/19/movies/theater-review-a-romp-through-the-valley-of-death.html?ref=williamfinn "Theater Review:A Romp Through the Valley of Death"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), June 19, 1998</ref> The musical won the 1999 [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding Off-Broadway Musical. The UK premiere was at the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

At the 2006 [[Elliot Norton Awards]] Ceremony, Finn brought his high school drama teacher, Gerry Dyer, onstage with him to present an award. Finn said of Dyer that he "imbued us with a ridiculous sense of our own self-worth."<ref>MacDonald, Sandy.[http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm?int_news_id=8309&showComments=all Camp, Mays, Spamalot, et al. Win 2006 Elliot Norton Awards"] theatermania.com,  May 23, 2006</ref> Another student of Gerald Dyer, [[Alison Fraser]], found fame on Broadway, collaborating with Finn in the original casts of ''[[In Trousers]]'' and ''[[March of the Falsettos]]''.

Finn had another Broadway success with ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', for which he wrote both music and lyrics. The show won two [[Tony Awards]] in 2005-one for [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]], and another for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]. It ran Off-Broadway, then on Broadway in 2005<ref>Isherwood, Charles.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/theater/reviews/03putn.html?_r=1&ref=williamfinn "Six Misfits Test Wits on Bigger Platform"]''The New York Times'', May 3, 2005</ref> and toured the United States in 2006.  The show was first workshopped and produced at [[Barrington Stage Company]] (BSC) in Pittsfield, MA, where Finn later created The Musical Theatre Lab (MTL) with BSC Artistic Director [[Julianne Boyd]].  The MTL is an annual summer lab where emerging musical theatre artists are supported and new musical works are created, fine-tuned and produced under the curatorship of Finn and Boyd.<ref>[http://www.barringtonstageco.org/aboutus/ "Barrington Stage History, Commitment to New Work and the Musical Theatre Lab"] ''Barrington Stage Company'', accessed August 22, 2011</ref>

Three musical revues or song suites of Finn's music have been produced:
* ''[[Infinite Joy]]'', in which the composer played the piano and sang along with an all-star cast, contained several songs from shows that were unfinished, and some that were cut from previous shows.
* ''[[Elegies (William Finn)|Elegies: A Song Cycle]]'' (2003) is a series of songs the composer wrote in memoriam of loved ones now gone, and in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref>Holden, Stephen.[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/28/movies/theater-review-departed-friends-vibrantly-recalled-in-song.html?ref=williamfinn Departed Friends Vibrantly Recalled in Song"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 28, 2003</ref>
* ''[[Make Me a Song (musical)|Make Me a Song]]'', conceived and directed by Rob Ruggiero, premiered at Hartford's Theaterworks in the summer of 2006, opened [[Off-Broadway]] in November 2007, and closed in December 2007 after 54 performances.<ref>Midgette, Anne.

Finn's first show was called ''Sizzle'' and was produced at Williams College in the fall of 1971.  Finn wrote the music and lyrics, and his good friend, Charlie Rubin, wrote the libretto.  ''Sizzle'' was the first original musical produced on the Williams College campus since Stephen Sondheim attended the college over 20 years earlier.  ''Sizzle'' was a coming of age musical about college students but concluded in an unusual way with the star of the show, played by J. Tyler Griffin, Jr., dying in an electric chair.  ''Sizzle'' played to packed houses.  Rubin possesses a reel-to-reel tape containing excerpts from the show, including most of the music.

His long-in-development show, ''The Royal Family of Broadway'', with a book by [[Richard Greenberg]], was based on the play by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Edna Ferber]], which tells the story of a girl from a family of great Broadway actors who contemplates leaving show business and getting married.  It has apparently been shelved, according to William Finn's personal notes for ''[[Make Me a Song (musical)|Make Me a Song]]'', ''[[Playbill]]'' magazine and an article from 2006.<ref name=sf/><ref>Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/print/112641?id=112641 "'Make Me a Song, Finn's Revue of "Heart and Music," Opens in NYC"] playbill.com, November 12, 2007</ref>

Finn's songs were featured exclusively on [[Lisa Howard (American actress)|Lisa Howard]]'s album ''Songs of Innocence and Experience'', released on April 12, 2011.<ref>Cerasaro, Pat.[http://broadwayworld.com/article/SOUND_OFF_Special_Interview_Lisa_Howard_on_William_Finn_Album_TWILIGHT_BREAKING_DAWN_and_More_20010101 "SOUND OFF Special Interview: Lisa Howard on William Finn Album, TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN, and More"] broadwayworld.com, April 13, 2011</ref>

The musical comedy ''[[Little Miss Sunshine (musical)|Little Miss Sunshine]]'', premiered at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], California, from February 15, 2011 through March 27, 2011. James Lapine wrote the book and is the director, set design by David Korins, staging by Lapine and [[Christopher Gattelli]].
