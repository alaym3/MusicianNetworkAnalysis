''' James Travis Tritt''' (born February 9, 1963)  is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and actor. He signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1989, releasing seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label between then and 1999. In the 2000s, he released three studio albums on [[Columbia Records]] and one for the now-defunct [[Category 5 Records]]. Seven of his albums (counting the Greatest Hits) are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA); the highest-certified is 1991's ''[[It's All About to Change]]'', which is certified triple-platinum. Tritt has also charted more than 40 times on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including five number ones—"[[Help Me Hold On]]", "[[Anymore (Travis Tritt song)|Anymore]]", "[[Can I Trust You with My Heart]]", "[[Foolish Pride]]", and "[[Best of Intentions]]"—and 15 additional top ten singles. Tritt's musical style is defined by mainstream country and [[Southern rock]] influences.

He has received two [[Grammy Award]]s, both for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]: in 1992 for "[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]", a duet with [[Marty Stuart]], and again in 1998 for "Same Old Train", a collaboration with Stuart and nine other artists. He has received four awards from the [[Country Music Association]] and has been a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since 1992.

==Early life==
James Travis Tritt was born on February 9, 1963, in [[Marietta, Georgia]], to James and Gwen Tritt.  He first took interest in singing after his church's Sunday school choir performed "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]".<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 2</ref> He received his first guitar at age 8 and taught himself how to play it; in the fourth grade, he performed "[[Annie's Song]]" and "[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]" for his class, and later got invited to play for other classrooms in his school.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 3</ref> At age 14, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 4</ref> Later on, Tritt joined his church band, which occasionally performed at other churches nearby.<ref name="thirteen">Tritt and Bane, p. 13</ref>

Tritt began writing music while he was attending [[Sprayberry High School]]; his first song composition, entitled "Spend a Little Time", was written about a girlfriend whom he had broken up with.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 17</ref> He performed the song for his friends, one of whom complimented him on his songwriting skills.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 20</ref> He also founded a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group with some of his friends and won second place in a local tournament for playing "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]".<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 35–36</ref>

During his teenage years, Tritt worked at a furniture store, and later as a supermarket clerk. He lived with his mother after she and his father divorced; they remarried when he was 18.<ref name="thirty-nine">, Tritt and Bane, pp. 39–41</ref> He worked at an air conditioning company while playing in clubs, but gave up the air conditioning job at the suggestion of one of his bandmates.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 46</ref> Tritt's father thought that he would not find success as a musician, while his mother thought that he should perform Christian music instead of country.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Through the assistance of [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive Danny Davenport, Tritt began recording [[demo (music)|demos]]. The two worked together for the next several years, eventually putting together a demo album called ''Proud of the Country''.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 64</ref> Davenport sent the demo to Warner Bros. representatives in Los Angeles, who in turn sent the demo to their Nashville division, which signed Tritt in 1987.<ref name="stabler">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|last3=Laudon|first3=Grelon|title=Country music: the encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22travis+tritt%22&pg=PA500|year=1997|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-26487-9}}</ref> Davenport also helped Tritt find a [[talent manager]], Ken Kragen. At first, Kragen was not interested in taking an "entry-level act", but decided to sign on as Tritt's manager after Kragen's wife convinced him.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 102</ref>

==Musical career==

===1989–1991: ''Country Club''===
Tritt's contract with Warner Bros.  meant that he was signed to record six songs, and three of them would be released as singles. According to the contract, he would not be signed on for a full album unless one of the three singles became a hit.<ref name="stabler" /><ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 94</ref> His first single was "[[Country Club (song)|Country Club]]". Recorded in late 1988 and released on August 7, 1989,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 98</ref> the song spent 26 weeks on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts, peaking at number nine.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=427–428|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> It was the title track to his 1990 debut album ''[[Country Club (album)|Country Club]]'', produced by Gregg Brown.

[[Brian Mansfield]] of [[AllMusic]] gave the album a positive review, saying that "Put Some Drive in Your Country" paid homage to Tritt's influences, but that the other singles were more radio-friendly.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r94384|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Country Club'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Giving the album a B-minus, [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared Tritt's music to that of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] and [[Joe Stampley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316906,00.html|title=We review new music from Travis Tritt, Kris Kristofferson, Alan Jackson, and more|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=March 16, 1990|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

===1991–1992: ''It's All About to Change''===
In 1991, Tritt received a second Horizon Award nomination, which he won that year.<ref name="opry"/> He also released his second album, ''[[It's All About to Change]]''. The album went on to become his best-selling, with a triple-platinum certification from the RIAA for shipments of three million copies.<ref name="riaa"/> All four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. "[[Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)]]" and the [[Marty Stuart]] duet "[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]", respectively the first and third singles, both reached number two, with the number-one "[[Anymore (Travis Tritt song)|Anymore]]" in between. "[[Nothing Short of Dying]]" was the fourth single, with a peak at number four on ''Billboard'';<ref name="whitburn"/> both it and "The Whiskey Ain't Working" went to Number One on ''Radio & Records''.<ref name="stabler"/> "Bible Belt", another cut from the album (recorded in collaboration with [[Little Feat]]), appeared in the 1992 film ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' (the lyrics for the song, however, were changed for the version played in the movie to match the story line). Although not released as a single, it peaked at number 72 country based on unsolicited airplay and was the [[b-side]] to "Nothing Short of Dying".<ref name="whitburn"/> "Bible Belt" was inspired by a youth pastor whom Tritt knew in his childhood.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 12–13</ref>

Stuart offered "The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Anymore" to Tritt backstage at the CMA awards show, and they recorded it as a duet through the suggestion of Tritt's record producer, Gregg Brown.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 190</ref> The duet won both artists the next year's [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Tritt and Stuart charted a second duet, "[[This One's Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)]]", which went to number seven in mid-1992 and appeared on Stuart's album ''[[This One's Gonna Hurt You]]''.<ref name="whitburn"/> This song won the 1992 CMA award for Vocal Event of the Year.<ref name="opry"/>

In June 1992, Tritt received media attention when he criticized [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]" at a Fan Fair interview, saying that he did not think that Cyrus' song made a "statement".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lTkpAAAAIBAJ&pg=3077,2956775&dq=travis-tritt+billy-ray-cyrus+statement&hl=en|title=Tritt pans Cyrus tune, video|date=June 12, 1992|work=Sun Journal|access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> The following January, Cyrus responded at the [[American Music Awards]] by referring to Tritt's "Here's a Quarter".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i9srAAAAIBAJ&pg=1859,2275018&dq=travis-tritt+billy-ray-cyrus&hl=en|title=Cyrus gives Tritt no quarter|date=January 28, 1993|work=Kentucky New Era|access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> Tritt later apologized to Cyrus, but said that he defended his opinion on the song.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 161</ref>

===1992–1993: ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' and ''A Travis Tritt Christmas''===
Tritt and Stuart began a "No Hats Tour" in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/78488388.html?dids=78488388:78488388&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+09%2C+1992&author=Jim+Abbott+of+The+Sentinel+Staff&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=TRAVIS+TRITT&pqatl=google|title=Travis Tritt|last=Abbott|first=Jim|date=October 9, 1992|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> In August of that same year, Tritt released the album ''[[T-R-O-U-B-L-E]]''. Its first single was "[[Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man]]", a song written by [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]]. This song, which featured backing vocals from [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[T. Graham Brown]], [[George Jones]], [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]], [[Dana McVicker]] (who also sang backup on Tritt's first two albums), [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Porter Wagoner]] on the final chorus, peaked at number five.<ref name="whitburn"/> Its follow-up, "[[Can I Trust You with My Heart]]", became Tritt's third ''Billboard'' number one in early 1993.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album's next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the [[T-R-O-U-B-L-E (song)|title track]] (a cover of an [[Elvis Presley]] song<ref name="trouble"/>), peaked at 13, followed by "[[Looking Out for Number One (Travis Tritt song)|Looking Out for Number One]]" at number 11 and "Worth Every Mile" at number 30.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification.<ref name="riaa"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic thought that ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' followed too closely the formula of ''It's All About to Change'', but said that the songs showed Tritt's personality.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123596|pure_url=yes}}|title=''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Nash gave the album a similar criticism, but praised the rock influences of "Looking Out for Number One" and the vocals on "Can I Trust You with My Heart".<ref name="trouble">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311646,00.html|title=''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=September 4, 1992|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

One month after the release of ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'', Tritt issued a Christmas album titled ''[[A Travis Tritt Christmas: Loving Time of the Year]]'', for which he wrote the title track.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123617|pure_url=yes}}|title=''A Travis Tritt Christmas: Loving Time of the Year'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> He also joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]], a weekly stage show and radio broadcast specializing in country music performances,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 115</ref> and filled in for [[Garth Brooks]] at a performance on the [[American Music Awards]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 179</ref> By year's end, Tritt and several other artists appeared on [[George Jones]]'s "[[I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair]]", which won all artists involved the next year's CMA Vocal Event of the Year award.<ref>Whitburn, p. 215</ref>

===1994–1995: ''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' and ''Greatest Hits''===
In early 1994, after "Worth Every Mile" fell from the charts, Tritt charted at number 21 with a cover of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' "[[Take It Easy]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> He recorded this song for the tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'' (released through Warner Bros.' [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] division), which featured country music artists' renditions of Eagles songs.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r188406|pure_url=yes}}|title=Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> When filming the music video for this song, Tritt requested that the band, which had been on hiatus for over 13 years, appear in it. This reunion inspired the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over Tour, which began that year.<ref name="stabler"/>

His fourth album, ''[[Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof]]'', was released that May. Its lead-off single, "[[Foolish Pride]]", went to number one, and the fourth single, "[[Tell Me I Was Dreaming]]", reached number two. In between these songs were the title track at number 22 and "[[Between an Old Memory and Me]]" (originally recorded by [[Keith Whitley]]<ref name="tenfeet"/>) at number 11.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album included two co-writes with [[Gary Rossington]] of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], and guest vocals from [[Waylon Jennings]] and Hank Williams, Jr. on the cut "Outlaws Like Us".<ref name="bulletproof">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r202312|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> The album achieved platinum certification in December of that year, and later became his third double-platinum album.<ref name="riaa"/> AllMusic reviewer Brian Mansfield said that Tritt was "most comfortable with his Southern rock/outlaw mantle" on it, comparing "Foolish Pride" favorably to "Anymore" and the work of [[Bob Seger]].<ref name="bulletproof"/> Alanna Nash praised the title track and "Tell Me I Was Dreaming" in her review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', but thought that the other songs were still too similar in sound to his previous works.<ref name="tenfeet">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302220,00.html|title=''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=May 23, 1994|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

1995's ''[[Greatest Hits: From the Beginning (Travis Tritt album)|Greatest Hits: From the Beginning]]'' included most of his singles to that point, as well as two new cuts: the [[Steve Earle]] composition "[[Sometimes She Forgets]]" and a cover of the pop standard "[[Only You (And You Alone)]]". The former was a top ten hit at number seven, while the latter spent only eight weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 51.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''Greatest Hits'' was certified platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

===1996–1997: ''The Restless Kind''===
In April 1996, Tritt and Stuart charted a third duet, "[[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best (song)|Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best]]", which appeared on Stuart's [[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best|album of the same name]] and peaked at 23 on the country charts. The song won both artists that year's Country Music Association award for Vocal Event, Tritt's third win in this category.<ref name="whitburn"/> The two began a second tour, the Double Trouble Tour, that year.<ref name="stabler" />

Tritt charted at number three in mid-1996 with "[[More Than You'll Ever Know]]", the first single from his fifth album, ''[[The Restless Kind]]''. The album accounted for one more top ten hit, a cover of Waylon Jennings's "[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]", which Tritt took to number six in late 1996. This song's chart run overlapped with that of "Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture)", a novelty release combining snippets of comedian [[Bill Engvall]]'s "Here are Your Sign" routines with a chorus sung by Tritt.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reece|first=Doug|date=March 22, 1997|title=Engvall Follows 'Sign' to His Own Success|journal=Billboard|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6g4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Here%27s+your+sign+get+the+picture%22&pg=PA9}}</ref> "Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture)" peaked at 29 on the country charts and 43 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]], accounting for Tritt's first entry on the latter chart.<ref name="whitburn"/> The other singles from ''The Restless Kind'' all failed to make Top Ten upon their 1997 release. "[[She's Going Home with Me]]" and "[[Still in Love with You (Travis Tritt song)|Still in Love with You]]" (previously the respective B-sides to "Where Corn Don't Grow" and "More Than You'll Ever Know") were the third and fifth releases, peaking at 24 and 23 on Hot Country Singles & Tracks. In between was the number 18 "[[Helping Me Get Over You]]", a duet with [[Lari White]] which the two co-wrote.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Unlike his previous albums, all of which were produced by Gregg Brown, Tritt produced ''The Restless Kind'' with [[Don Was]].<ref name="restless">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2807|title=''The Restless Kind'' review|last=Yates|first=Don|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Tritt told ''Billboard'' that the album showed a greater level of personal involvement than his previous efforts, as it was his first co-production credit. He also noted that he sang most of the vocal harmony by himself, played guitar on "She's Going Home with Me", and helped with the album's art direction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=July 20, 1996|title=Travis Tritt gets personal in marketing new WB set|journal=Billboard|pages=7, 70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70}}</ref> It received positive reviews from Thom Owens of AllMusic, who said that it was the most country-sounding album of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r239290|pure_url=yes}}|title=''The Restless Kind'' review|last=Owens|first=Thom|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Don Yates of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' also praised it for having a more "organic" sound than Tritt's other albums.<ref name="restless"/>

===1998–1999: ''No More Looking over My Shoulder''===
In 1998, he and several other artists contributed to Stuart's "Same Old Train", a cut from the collaborative album ''Tribute to Tradition''; this song charted at number 59 on Hot Country Songs and won Tritt his second Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.<ref>Whitburn, p. 367</ref> He also performed on [[Frank Wildhorn]]'s concept album of the musical ''[[The Civil War (musical)|The Civil War]]'', singing the song "The Day the Sun Stood Still".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/100347-Gettysburg-Welcomes-Wildhorns-New-Civil-War-Musical-For-the-Glory|title= Gettysburg Welcomes Wildhorn's 'New' Civil War Musical, ''For the Glory''|date= June 15, 2006|access-date= March 13, 2010|work= Playbill|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104230958/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/100347-Gettysburg-Welcomes-Wildhorns-New-Civil-War-Musical-For-the-Glory|archive-date= November 4, 2010}}</ref> By year's end, Tritt also released his final Warner Bros. album, ''[[No More Looking over My Shoulder]]''. It was his first of four consecutive albums which he produced with [[Billy Joe Walker, Jr.]], who is a session guitarist, producer, and [[New Age music]]ian. The album was led off by the ballad "If I Lost You", which peaked at number 29 on the country charts and number 86 on the Hot 100.<ref name="whitburn"/> [[Michael Peterson (singer)|Michael Peterson]] (who recorded for Warner Bros.'

Late in 1999, Tritt recorded a cover of [[Hank Williams]]'s "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It On Over]]" with [[George Thorogood]] for the [[King of the Hill (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the cartoon ''[[King of the Hill]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r432858|pure_url=yes}}|title=''King of the Hill'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 22, 2010}}</ref> This cut peaked at number 66 on the country charts from unsolicited airplay.<ref name="whitburn"/>

==Musical styles==
Although he had been singing since childhood, Tritt said that he began to put "a little more soul" in his voice after his church band performed at an African-American church. He said that he took interest in how African-American singers put "all these bends and sweeps and curls" in their voices, and began emulating that sound.<ref name="thirteen"/> While performing at these churches, he also took interest in gospel singers such as [[Andraé Crouch]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 14</ref> Later on, he began listening to [[Southern rock]] acts such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] through the recommendation of a friend,<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 29–30</ref> as well as the bluegrass music that his uncle exposed him to.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 34</ref> Tritt said that he found his songwriting began to develop during the creation of his demo tape, when he had written a song called "Gambler's Blues" that "felt a lot more connected to Southern rock" than his previous writings.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 63</ref> He cites country, rock and [[folk music|folk]] as his influences.<ref name="opry"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine contrasts him with contemporaries [[Clint Black]] and [[Alan Jackson]], saying that Tritt was "the only one not to wear a [cowboy] hat and the only one to dip into bluesy Southern rock. Consequently, he developed a gutsy, outlaw image that distinguished him from the pack."<ref name="allmusic"/> Zell Miller, in the book ''They Heard Georgia Singing'', said that Tritt has an "unerring ability to walk the narrow path between his country heritage and his rock leanings to the acclaim of the devotees of both."<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Zell|title=They Heard Georgia Singing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kv8EdRRkiQC&q=%22travis+tritt%22&pg=PA293|year=1996|publisher=0865545049|pages=293–294|isbn=9780865545045}}</ref>

Regarding his songwriting style and single choices, Tritt said that he writes "strictly from personal experiences" and does not follow a particular formula.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 22-23</ref> He described "Here's a Quarter" as "one of the simplest three-chord [[waltz]]es I've ever written",<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 25</ref> and said that label executives were reluctant to release it because they thought that it was a [[novelty song]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 136</ref> Also, he was told that "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" would not be a hit because it did not contain any rhymes,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 23</ref> and fought the release of the song "Country Club" because he did not think that it fit his style.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 137–138</ref> He also said that, despite their low peaks, the more rock-influenced "Put Some Drive in Your Country" and "T-R-O-U-B-L-E" helped generate sales for their respective albums more so than the top ten hits from those albums.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 138</ref>

===Political views and advocacy===
Tritt is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and supported [[George W. Bush]] for president in 2000. The two met in 1996 at the [[Republican National Convention]] in San Diego, California, where Tritt sang the national anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1474994/tritt-open-about-political-leanings/|title=Tritt Open About Political Leanings|publisher=Country Music Television|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> Tritt told [[Insight on the News]] that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. "I'm a pro-gun guy. I'm an NRA ([[National Rifle Association]]) member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns. Because you take away guns, and the next thing you know, stabbing murders are going to increase." He adds that he is "definitely pro-death penalty".{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In September 2020, Tritt gained notoriety for joining fellow Republican [[James Woods]] in blocking random [[Twitter]] users for using pro-[[Black Lives Matter]] and other anti-Trump tags in their posts, under the belief that it would counteract anti-Republican sentiment on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meaww.com/who-is-travis-tritt-musician-backs-james-woods-block-resisters-why-is-he-blocking-urge-trumpers/|title=Who is Travis Tritt?

On October 18, 2021, Tritt made a cameo appearance on conservative commentator [[Steven Crowder]]'s show ''Louder with Crowder''.

===Alleged paranormal encounters===
In October 2015, Tritt appeared on Lifetime network's ''[[The Haunting of...]]'' program to discuss his experiences with the paranormal. Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened "regularly" by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned – the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, "Over the years, these voices started happening
on such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here." He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.

The show's host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers' angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that "On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a '[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctor' close to the land where Travis' cabin was built." Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor's spirit also lingered on the property because it found a "kindred spirit" in Tritt.<ref>[http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/the-haunting-of/season-4/episode-9] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3di96b|title=The Haunting Of S05E22 – Travis Tritt – video|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>
