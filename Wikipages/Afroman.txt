'''Joseph Edgar Foreman''' (born July 28, 1974), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Afroman''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, comedian and multi-instrumentalist. He is known for his songs "[[Because I Got High]]", released in 2000, and "[[Crazy Rap]]", which was released in 2001 and both were featured on his album ''[[The Good Times]]''. Afroman was nominated for a [[Grammy]] award in 2002.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, Afroman initially grew up in [[South Los Angeles|South-Central Los Angeles]] and then later on he moved with his family to [[Palmdale, California]], in the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]] region of [[Southern California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://journalstar.com/entertainment/music/afroman-makes-music-from-what-he-knows/article_57dcfb87-f37e-5004-86ee-94d1fc7c8948.html|title=Afroman makes music from what he knows|last1=Stinson|first1=Liz|publisher=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|date=November 7, 2008|accessdate=April 30, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
Afroman's musical career began in the eighth grade, when he began recording homemade songs and selling them to his classmates.<ref name="allmusic"/> "The first tape I made was about my eighth-grade teacher", he once recalled. "She got me kicked out of school for [[sagging (fashion)|sagging my pants]], which was a big deal back then. So I wrote this song about her and it sold about 400 copies: it was selling to teachers, students, just about everybody. And I realized that, even though I wasn't at school, my song was at school, so in a way I was still there. All these people would come by my house just to give me comments about how cool they thought the song was."<ref>[https://www.myspace.com/afromanmusic Afroman | Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's]. Myspace.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-30.</ref> Foreman also performed in his church at a young age, playing both the drums and guitar.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 1998, Afroman released his first album, ''My Fro-losophy'' and later relocated to [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]],<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p435536|pure_url=yes}}|title=Afroman Biography|last=Nimmervoll|first=Ed|year=2008|publisher=allmusic|access-date=2009-03-27}}</ref> where he met drummer Jody Stallone, keyboardist/bassist Darrell Havard and producer Tim Ramenofsky (a.k.a. Headfridge).

Ramenofsky produced and released Afroman's album ''[[Because I Got High]]'' in 2000 on [[T-Bones Records]]; it was distributed primarily through concerts and the file-sharing service [[Napster]] before its title track was played on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''. Afroman was inspired to write the song's lyrical content by his unwillingness to clean his room, and he ran with the idea of everyday tasks being derailed by drug use.<ref name="allmusic"/> In late 2001, the song became a hit and was featured in the films ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[The Perfect Score]]'', and ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]'' later in the 2000s. "Because I Got High" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/4169.html |title=Grammy nominees led by U2, India.Arie, Alicia Keys |last=Evans |first=Rob |date=January 4, 2002 |work=LiveDaily |access-date=2009-03-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015215711/http://www.livedaily.com/news/4169.html |archive-date=October 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

After the single's success, Afroman joined the lineup of [[Cypress Hill]]'s fall festival "Smoke Out" with the [[Deftones]], [[Method Man]], and others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449406/20010928/cypress_hill.jhtml|title=Cypress Hill's Oakland Smoke Out Bumped By A's|last=Schumacher-Rasmussen|first=Eric|date=September 28, 2001|publisher=MTV News|access-date=2009-03-27}}</ref> After this, [[Universal Records]] signed Afroman to a six-album deal, and Universal released ''The Good Times'' in 2001. ''The Good Times'' was a compilation of Afroman's first two albums and some new tracks.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Afroman started releasing his music independently and mostly through the Internet in 2004,<ref name="allmusic"/> and that year, he recorded ''Jobe Bells'', which [[satirized]] traditional [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493225/20041028/simpson_jessica.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On Jessica Simpson, Ashlee Simpson, Snoop, Good Charlotte, Afroman, Chingy & More|date=October 28, 2004|publisher=MTV News|access-date=2009-03-27}}</ref>

Afroman was part of the 2010 [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] lineup.<ref>[http://juggalogathering.com/home.php?page_id=performances GOTJ 2011:::Buy Tickets Now!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816045903/http://www.juggalogathering.com/home.php?page_id=performances |date=August 16, 2010 }}.

In October 2014, Afroman released a remix of his hit song "Because I Got High" in order to highlight the usefulness of marijuana as part of the effort to legalize its sale across the United States.

==Personal life==

===Religion===
In 2003, Afroman declared himself a [[Christian]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 30, 2003|title=Rapper now gets high on his faith|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-05-30-0305300261-story.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630205347/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-05-30-0305300261-story.html|archive-date=June 30, 2021|access-date=July 9, 2021|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

===Assault case===
On February 17, 2015, Afroman was midway through his performance at a live music venue in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], when a woman walked on stage. She approached Foreman from behind, drink in hand, while dancing. When she touched Foreman he spun around and knocked her down with a blow to the head. He was subsequently escorted offstage by security and was arrested and taken into custody, and charged with [[Assault#United States|assault]]. He was released on bond shortly thereafter.

There were reportedly 12 to 15 security guards on duty to manage a crowd in excess of 500 people. When interviewed, Foreman's representative claimed that the act was an involuntary reflex caused by the woman invading his space. He also stated that he mistook the woman for another audience member who had been consistently heckling him. He has since publicly apologized and is seeking assistance with anger management.<ref>[http://www.wlox.com/story/28133270/afroman-punches-woman-during-performance-at-a-biloxi-nightclub?clienttype=generic&mobilecgbypass "Afroman punches woman during performance at a Biloxi nightclub"]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218094432/http://www.wlox.com/story/28133270/afroman-punches-woman-during-performance-at-a-biloxi-nightclub?clienttype=generic&mobilecgbypass |date=February 18, 2015 }} [[WLOX]] News.
