==== ''Escape from Hood Mountain'' and touring ====
In September 2016, Froggy Fresh pinned a comment across many of his videos, addressing the fan-expressed concern of a lack of videos since "Stolen Bikes 3", released five months prior. The comment stated that, while no releases were scheduled for Fall 2016 through Spring 2017, they did plan to release 13–15 new videos between Summer 2017 and 2020, as part of a double-disk album tentatively known as ''Escape from Hood Mountain''. The comment went on to state that ''Escape from Hood Mountain'' will "probably be the last album for our project, as we are all starting to grow up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imgur.com/gallery/9GVMo|title=Comment by Froggy Fresh|publisher=Imgur|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref>

Subsequent shows in June 2017 took place in the Southeastern United States and featured Froggy Fresh alongside Money Maker Mike. Future tour dates for other areas in the U.S. were announced up to October 2017.

On February 15, 2018, Cassidy uploaded a new update video on YouTube. He stated that ''Escape from Hood Mountain'' had been completed with eighteen tracks.
