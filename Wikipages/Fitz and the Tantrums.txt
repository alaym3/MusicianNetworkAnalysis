==History==

=== Early history ===
Fitz and the Tantrums was founded by [[Michael Fitzpatrick (musician)|Michael Fitzpatrick]] in 2008. Having purchased an old [[C.G. Conn|Conn]] [[Organ (music)|electronic organ]], he was inspired to write the song "Breakin' the Chains of Love" that same night.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2129374|pure_url=yes}} Fitz & the Tantrums] at [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref name="buzzbands">{{cite news| title = Fitz & the Tantrums: Finding plenty of soul mates |work = Buzz Bands |location=Los Angeles| date = June 17, 2010| url = http://buzzbands.la/2010/06/17/fitz-the-tantrums-finding-plenty-of-soul-mates/| access-date =Jun 22, 2011 }}</ref> He contacted his college friend, saxophonist [[James King (musician)|James King]], who recommended singer [[Noelle Scaggs]] and drummer [[John Wicks (drummer)|John Wicks]]. In turn, Wicks brought in bassist Joseph Karnes and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna. According to Fitzpatrick, the band immediately clicked. He has said, "It was literally like five phone calls, one rehearsal, and we could have played a show that night." The band performed their first show at [[Hotel Café]] in [[Hollywood]], in December 2008, which Fitzpatrick booked one week after their first rehearsal.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-02-13-fitz-otv_N.htm| title=On the verge: Fitz & the Tantrums channel the Motown spirit|author=Korina Lopez|date=February 13, 2011|work=USA Today|access-date=April 18, 2011}}</ref> In interviews, he has stated the importance of booking a date before the band was ready, in order to bring out the best in all performers. During the first half of 2009, they performed at several clubs in Los Angeles, including the [[Viper Room]] and [[Spaceland]]. Before Joseph Karnes was brought into the band, the previous bassist, Ethan Phillips was with the band for the first EP, and a part of their first album, "Pickin' Up The Pieces".

The band recorded their debut EP, ''[[Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1]]'', during the first half of 2009 at Fitzpatrick's home in Los Angeles.<ref name="rollingstonearticle">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/band-to-watch-fitz-and-the-tantrums-put-a-modern-spin-on-motown-20110412|title=Band to Watch: Fitz and the Tantrums Put a Modern Spin on Motown|date=April 12, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> The EP was first released on August 11, 2009, through Canyon Productions.

He told Adam, 'you gotta hear this band.' A week and a half later, we're opening for Maroon 5 on their college tour."<ref name="rollingstonearticle" /> In December 2009 the band shot the official music video for their first single, "Breakin' the Chains of Love", which was directed by [[Joshua Leonard]].

==Musical style==
Fitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as "soul-influenced indie pop." He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/126328-fitz-the-tantrums-keep-busy-over-the-holiday-weekend | title=Fitz & the Tantrums Keep Busy Over the Holiday Weekend | author=Jansen Seymour, Jane | publisher=PopMatters | date=June 1, 2010}}</ref> In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision not to use guitars in the band. "I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars," he said. "For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thewaster.com/interview/fitz-the-tantrums-more-soul-than-the-devil-could-buy/ | title=More Soul Than the Devil Could Buy: The Pockets of Sound with Michael Fitzpatrick | author=Johnson, Alexandra | publisher=TheWaster.com | date=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' music critic Ann Powers wrote, "Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/album-review-fitz-the-tantrums-pickin-up-the-pieces.html | title=Album review: Fitz & the Tantrums' 'Pickin' Up the Pieces' | author=Powers, Ann |work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> Aly Comingore of the ''[[Santa Barbara Independent]]'' wrote that the band members craft "soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/aug/30/fitz-tantrums/ | title=Fitz & the Tantrums – Pickin' Up the Pieces | author=Comingore, Aly |work=Santa Barbara Independent | date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> The band was heralded as a "band to watch" in an April 2011 profile in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rollingstonearticle" /> In June 2011, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' named Fitz and the Tantrums the "Hardest-Working Band" of the 2011 summer festival circuit.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/music-best-of-summer-2011-festivals/ | title=Music: Best of Summer 2011 Festivals | author=Campion, Freddie | work=Vogue Daily | date=June 7, 2011 | access-date=June 22, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615105549/http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/music-best-of-summer-2011-festivals/ | archive-date=June 15, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> "Not only do L.A.–based six-piece Fitz and the Tantrums share James Brown’s penchant for snazzy-dressed brass bands and feel-good retro ballads, they also have the late godfather of soul’s tireless work ethic."
