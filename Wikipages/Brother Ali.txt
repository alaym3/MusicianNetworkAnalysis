'''Ali Douglas Newman''' (born '''Jason Douglas Newman''', July 30, 1977), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Brother Ali''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]], community activist, and member of the [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] hip hop collective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymesayers.com/brotherali |title=Brother Ali |publisher=Rhymesayers Entertainment |access-date=January 3, 2012}}</ref> He has released seven albums, four EPs, and a number of singles and collaborations.

==Early life==
Ali was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He has [[albinism]], a disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. He moved with his family to [[Michigan]] for a few years and then settled in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] in 1992. He attended [[Robbinsdale Cooper High School]] in [[New Hope, Minnesota]].<ref name="NPR100509" />

Ali is [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ([[white American]]), but he has spoken of feeling more accepted by [[African-American|Black]] classmates than white ones: "It's not like black kids didn't make fun of me, but it was different. It wasn't done in a way to exclude me. It wasn't done in a way to make me feel like not even a human being, not even a person." He could relate to them because they were also judged by their skin color.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brother Ali delivers ‘The Undisputed Truth’|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/brother-ali-delivers-undisputed-truth-1C9430141|access-date=2020-12-16|website=TODAY.com|language=en}}</ref>

Ali began rapping at age eight. He has stated that he was influenced by hip-hop culture at a very early age. In an interview with ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck]]'' magazine, he stated "Ever since I was a little kid, I've always been into hip-hop. I started beatboxing when I was about seven years old. Eventually, that led to me falling in love with the words."<ref>[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/music-2/brother-ali-hip-hop-portal-finding-faith-identity/ "In hip-hop Brother Ali found faith and identity"] ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck]]'' Adam Woodward Retrieved January 22, 2016</ref> He has named [[Rakim]], [[Chuck D]], and [[KRS-ONE]] as early influences.

==Personal life==
Ali has a son, Faheem, from his first marriage, and a daughter, Stacy, from his second marriage in 2006. His music frequently addresses his role as a father, parent, and husband. The song "Real As Can Be" off his 2009 [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Truth Is Here]]'' refers to the impending birth of his daughter, and on the song "Fresh Air", which is on his 2009 album ''Us'', he goes on to say "Just got married last year/ treated so good that it ain't even fair/ already got a boy, now the baby girl's here/ Bought us a house like the [[Berenstain Bears]]."

Ali often makes fun of the media's constant urge to mention his [[Albinism in humans|albinism]] in the first lines of their reviews or newspaper articles. He is also [[legally blind]], a condition which is caused by his albinism.<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Neda Ulaby |last=Ulaby |first=Neda |title=Brother Ali: An Honest Act Of Worship |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |newspaper=NPR |date=October 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504084050/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |archive-date=May 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In an article titled "The Art of Mourning in America", Brother Ali said his favorite food is [[sweet potato pie]]. The interview was conducted during the month of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]] and Ali performed a freestyle: "Lifelong starvation, every month is Ramadan / Walk in the crib and I'm surprised that the power's on."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Muhammad Ali|first1=Queen|title=The Art of Mourning in America|date=February 19, 2013|publisher=Nation19 Magazine|pages=44–46|edition=#3|url=http://issuu.com/radiobums/docs/nation19_mag_3/44|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Religion===
Ali converted to [[Islam]] at age 15 and followed Imam [[Warith Deen Mohammed]]. During this time, Ali was selected to join a group of students on a [[Malaysia]]n study tour, in which they explored ways that a more [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|liberal Islam]]ic society could peacefully coexist with different religions.<ref name="NPR100509">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |title=Brother Ali: An Honest Act Of Worship |publisher=Npr.org |access-date=2015-04-02}}</ref>

Ali credits his conversion to Islam to KRS-ONE, whom he met during a lecture at age 13 at a local Minnesotan university. When asked about his faith, Ali stated, "KRS-ONE was actually the one who told me I should read [[Malcolm X]]. He assigned ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'' to me; I read it, and that's what led to me becoming a Muslim."<ref>[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/music-2/brother-ali-hip-hop-portal-finding-faith-identity/ "In hip-hop Brother Ali found faith and identity"] ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck Magazine]]'' Adam Woodward Retrieved January 22, 2016</ref>

Brother Ali has spoken out in favour of equality of rights and dignity for [[LGBT in Islam|LGBTQ Muslims]].

==Activism==
Many of Brother Ali's themes of [[social justice]] are incorporated into his lyrics, though he also takes part in activism outside of the music. He primarily focuses on themes of racial inequality, slavery, and critiquing the United States government, though overarching themes of hope, acceptance, and rising from sorrow are also often present. Much attention was garnered through Ali's album ''[[The Undisputed Truth (Brother Ali album)|The Undisputed Truth]]'', as it heavily criticized much about the United States' political system. After the music video for "[[Uncle Sam Goddamn]]" was released in 2007, it quickly gained much attention, and shortly after, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] froze a money transfer to his record label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/rapper-brother-ali-privilege-hope-stories|title=Rapper Brother Ali on Privilege, Hope, and Other People's Stories|last=Tepper|first=Fabien|website=YES! Magazine|language=en|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>

In 2012, Ali was arrested along with thirty-seven others while occupying the home of a Minneapolis resident to fight the house's foreclosure. The goal of the protesters was to block the eviction of the family through their assembly and occupancy, but they were unsuccessful. Ali ended up using his celebrity as a platform to discuss these events, and bring them to the attention of his audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/06/22/local-rapper-brother-ali-arrested-at-occupy-protest |title=Local Rapper Brother Ali Arrested At Occupy Protest « CBS Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota.cbslocal.com |date=2012-06-22 |access-date=2015-04-02}}</ref>

Ali deals heavily with the notion of privilege. He stated in an interview with ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|Yes!]]'' magazine that "The best definition of privilege I've heard is anything you don't have to wrestle with, that you don't have to think about." Ali feels a certain obligation to act politically, as he is unwilling to sit aside after experiencing all he has. He states, "I feel like that's my job, and I feel like within the last few years I fully woke up to that, found the courage to understand that, and stepped out like that."

While performing at a concert in 2015, Brother Ali endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[president of the United States]], as a candidate in the upcoming [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MHWc_Pzg-M|title=Brother Ali Endorses Bernie Sanders|date=15 December 2015}}</ref> He praised Sanders for saying "[[Black Lives Matter|Black lives matter]]" at a [[2016 United States presidential debates|presidential debate]], a reference to the social movement.

Then in November 2019, Brother Ali performed at a Bernie Sanders rally in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]], alongside Representative [[Ilhan Omar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/sanders-omar-push-working-class-politics-at-rally/article_eb73c60e-feaa-11e9-a277-f356ec0202bf.html|title=Sanders, Omar push ‘working class’ politics at rally|last=Bakst|first=Brian|date=3 November 2019|website=Mankato Free Press}}</ref>
