'''Grover Washington Jr.''' (December 12, 1943 – December 17, 1999)<ref name="ALLMUSIC">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/grover-washington-jr-mn0000944206/biography|title=Grover Washington, Jr. - Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 6, 2017|first=Scott|last=Yanow}}</ref> was an American [[jazz-funk]] / [[soul-jazz]] saxophonist. Along with [[Wes Montgomery]] and [[George Benson]], he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the [[smooth jazz]] genre.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxeMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA337|page=337|title=Experiencing Jazz|author=Richard J.

He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits, including "Mister Magic", "Reed Seed", "Black Frost", "Winelight", "Inner City Blues", "Let it Flow(For Dr. J)" and "The Best is Yet to Come".  In addition, he performed very frequently with other artists, including [[Bill Withers]] on "[[Just the Two of Us (Grover Washington Jr. song)|Just the Two of Us]]", [[Patti LaBelle]] on "[[The Best Is Yet To Come (Grover Washington Jr. song)|The Best Is Yet to Come]]" and [[Phyllis Hyman]] on "A Sacred Kind of Love". He is also remembered for his take on the [[Dave Brubeck]] classic "[[Take Five]]", and for his 1996 version of "[[Soulful Strut]]".

(Although he was later photographed with Keilwerth SX90 and SX90R black nickel plated soprano, alto, and tenor saxophones on album covers, he rarely played them live or in the studio.)

==Early life==
Washington was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States, on December 12, 1943.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=978-1-85227-745-1|page=1234/5}}</ref> His mother was a [[Church choir|church chorister]], and his father was a collector of old [[jazz]] [[gramophone records]] and a saxophonist as well, so music was everywhere in the home. He grew up listening to the great jazzmen and big band leaders like [[Benny Goodman]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], and others like them. At the age of 8, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone. He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo [[blues]] musicians. His younger brother, drummer Daryl Washington, would follow in his footsteps, he also had another younger brother named Michael Washington, who was an accomplished Gospel Music organist who mastered the Hammond B3 organ. He was part of a vocal ensemble, The Teen Kings, which included [[Lonnie Smith (jazz musician)|Lonnie Smith]].

==Career==
===Early career===
Washington left Buffalo and played with a [[Midwest]] group called the Four Clefs and then the Mark III Trio from Mansfield, Ohio. Shortly thereafter, he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], where he met drummer [[Billy Cobham]]. A music mainstay in New York City, Cobham introduced Washington to many New York musicians. After leaving the Army, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City, eventually landing in [[Philadelphia]] in 1967.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> In 1970 and 1971, he appeared on [[Leon Spencer]]'s first two albums on [[Prestige Records]], together with [[Idris Muhammad]] and [[Melvin Sparks]].

Washington's big break came when [[Alto saxophone|alto sax]] man [[Hank Crawford]] was unable to make a recording date with [[Creed Taylor]]'s [[CTI Records|Kudu Records]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dougpayne.com/kudut.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206101244/http://www.dougpayne.com/kudut.htm |archive-date=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and Washington took his place, even though he was a backup. This led to his first solo album, ''Inner City Blues''. He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones. Refreshing for his time, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.

===Rise to fame===
While his first three albums established him as a force in jazz and soul music, it was his fourth album in 1974, ''Mister Magic'', that proved a major commercial success. The album climbed to number 1 on Billboard's R&B album chart and number 10 on Billboard's Top 40 album chart. The title track reached No.&nbsp;16 on the R&B singles chart (#54, pop). All these albums included guitarist [[Eric Gale]] as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> His follow-up on Kudu in 1975, ''Feels So Good'' also made No. 1 on Billboard's R&B album chart and No.&nbsp;10 on the pop album chart. Both albums were major parts of the jazz-funk movement of the mid-1970s.<ref name="Larkin"/>

A string of acclaimed records brought Washington through the 1970s, culminating in the signature piece for everything he would do from then on. ''[[Winelight]]'' (1980) was the album that defined everything Washington was then about, having signed for Elektra Records, part of the major Warner Music group. The album was smooth, fused with [[R&B]] and easy listening feel. Washington's love of basketball, especially the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], led him to dedicate the second track, "Let It Flow", to [[Julius Erving]] (Dr. J). The highlight of the album was his collaboration with soul artist [[Bill Withers]], "Just the Two of Us," a hit on radio during the spring and summer of 1981, peaking at No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The album went [[platinum album|platinum]] in 1981,<ref name="Larkin"/> and also won [[Grammy Awards of 1982|Grammy Awards]] in 1982 for Best R&B Song ("Just The Two of Us"), and Best Jazz Fusion Performance ("Winelight"). "Winelight" was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In the post-''Winelight'' era, Washington is credited for giving rise to a new batch of talent that would make its mark in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is known for bringing [[Kenny G]] to the forefront, as well as artists such as [[Walter Beasley]], [[Steve Cole]], [[Pamela Williams]], [[Najee]], [[Boney James]] and [[George Howard (jazz)|George Howard]]. His song "Mr. Magic" is noted as being influential on [[go-go]] music starting in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Jeff|title=Wind me up, Chuck!|publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian|date=June 2001|url=http://www.sfbg.com/noise/44-01/chuk.html|access-date=2007-06-01}}</ref>

==Death==
On December 17, 1999, five days after his 56th birthday, Washington collapsed while waiting in the [[green room]] after performing four songs for ''[[The Saturday Early Show]]'', at [[CBS]] Studios in New York City. He was taken to [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center|St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital]], where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30&nbsp;pm. His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> He is interred at [[West Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Grover Washington, Jr |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11983/grover-washington|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=6 April 2019}}</ref>
