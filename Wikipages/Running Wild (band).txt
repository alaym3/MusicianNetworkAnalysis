'''Running Wild''' is a German [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Hamburg]] in 1976. They were part of the [[Music of Germany#Heavy Metal|German metal scene]] to emerge in the early to mid-1980s, and are also considered to be one of the country's so-called "big four" of [[power metal]], along with [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]], [[Helloween]] and [[Rage (German band)|Rage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bnrmetal.com/v5/band/band/Hell|title=The BNR Metal Pages – Helloween|website=bnrmetal.com|access-date=10 May 2021}}</ref> Over the course of their career, they have released 16 studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. 

Although their earlier releases contained [[Satanism|Satanic]] themes and imagery, from the third album on, the band's primary subject matter centered around pirates, sailing and other historical events. In 1987, the band released the album ''[[Under Jolly Roger]],'' which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named [[pirate metal]] subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by frontman Rolf Kasparek in particular.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.running-wild.de/html/history_2.html |title=RUNNING WILD – the official website |website=Running-wild.de |access-date=28 July 2014}}</ref>

After this album, from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums ''[[Port Royal (album)|Port Royal]]'', ''[[Death or Glory (album)|Death or Glory]]'', ''[[Blazon Stone]]'' and ''[[Pile of Skulls]]''), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates, the band also addressed subjects like the [[Wars of the Roses]], the [[Battle of Waterloo]], or the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the New World]] by the Conquistadors.<ref name="history" />

In April 2009, Kasparek announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at [[Wacken Open Air]] in July that year. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as ''[[The Final Jolly Roger]]'' in 2011. The split would prove temporary as they reunited in 2012. Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in 2015. As of 2021, the band have released 17 studio albums, with their most recent being ''Blood on Blood''.

== History ==
[[File:RunningWildLogoType.gif|thumb|The band's logo]]
=== Early years and first albums ===
The band formed in 1976 under the name Granite Heart, but they would change their name in 1979 to Running Wild after the [[Judas Priest]] song of the same name. The band recorded their first demo in 1981 and featured the songs "Hallow the Hell", "War Child" and "King of the Midnight Fire". The first two of these tracks appeared on the compilation album "Debut No. 1" on the Raubbau Label. In June 1984, the band started work on their debut album ''[[Gates to Purgatory]]'', which was released by [[Noise Records]], featuring satanic lyrics. The album proved to be a success, and the band quickly gained a cult following. Guitarist Gerald "Preacher" Warnecke left the band soon after the album's release. (Gerald "Preacher" Warnecke was studying theology at the time and is now a [[pastor]] in Cologne.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Wacken Open Air 2015 starts with Metal worship|url=http://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/123027/22-07-2015/wacken-open-air-2015-startet-metal-gottesdienst|website=Evangelisch.de|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kirche-suerth.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=55|title=Ev. Gemeinde Sürth/Weiß – Kontakt|website=kirche-suerth.de|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> The band soon recruited Majk Moti to take his place, and soon recorded their follow up ''[[Branded and Exiled]]'' in 1985. This album would prove to be the final release of the band with satanic imagery in their music.

=== Rise in popularity, success and later albums ===
For the following release, the band shifted their sound and image and adopted a pirate theme. The band released ''[[Under Jolly Roger]]'' in 1987. This would prove a significant change because the band would be more known as a "pirate metal" band, with lyrics dealing with pirates and historical events. With this album, the band found their identity, and the pirate theme would be prominent on their future releases. Their 1988 follow-up release ''[[Port Royal (album)|Port Royal]]'' featured a more mature style of songwriting and expanded on the pirate theme explored on their previous album. The album featured one of the band's first epics, Calico Jack. In 1989, the release of the band's fifth studio recording ''[[Death or Glory (album)|Death or Glory]]'', proved to be the band's most successful album to date.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The tour was also a success and a concert during the tour was filmed and was released as ''Death or Glory Tour''. This album and tour would be the final release to feature guitarist Majk Moti and drummer Ian Finlay.

Upon the departure of Moti and Finlay, Kasparek recruited guitarist Axel Morgan and drummer Rudiger Dreffein (better known as "AC") to record the band's first album in two years, ''[[Blazon Stone]]'', released in 1991. The album continued the band's trend of writing about historical themes, and according to band leader, Rolf Kasparek, it was to be the band's best-selling album of the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The album proved to be a slight shift in their overall sound, as the band brought a more speed metal approach to their songs, which would be prevalent throughout their releases during the decade. In 1992, the band began work on ''[[Pile of Skulls]]'' which was regarded by many as one of the band's strongest efforts.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Around this time, Kasparek started becoming more interested in conspiracy theories, becoming the basis of the next album, 1994's ''[[Black Hand Inn]]''.

1995's ''[[Masquerade (Running Wild album)|Masquerade]]'' was the first in a trilogy of albums dealing with a specific theme. The album would go on to be one of Running Wild's worst selling albums up to that point. The second album followed with the 1998 album ''[[The Rivalry (album)|The Rivalry]]'' under their new label [[GUN Records]] with the conclusion of the trilogy culminating with 2000's ''[[Victory (Running Wild album)|Victory]]''. It would be the final album featuring drummer Jörg Michael. With so many line-up changes, Running Wild was considered a solo project due to the fact that guitarist and main songwriter Rolf Kasparek remained the sole constant member of the band. The album ''[[The Brotherhood (Running Wild album)|The Brotherhood]]'' was released in 2002. It was to be another three years before Running Wild released another album ''[[Rogues en Vogue]]'' in 2005.
