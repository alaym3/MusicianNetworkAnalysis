'''''Flyte''''' is a 2006 children's novel by [[Angie Sage]] and the second book in the ''[[Septimus Heap]]'' series. The book's cover was modelled after the in-story book: ''How to Survive Dragon Fostering: A Practykal Guide'' with the Flyte Charm lying on top. ''Flyte'' was released in March 2006 through [[HarperCollins]] and [[Bloomsbury Publishing]].

==Plot==
The book begins with a "fair haired" boy rowing a canoe to the place where Necromancer DomDaniel drowned, along with his ship. His skeleton climbs into the canoe, while the fair haired boy thinks about exacting his revenge on all the people who underestimated him. He thinks that they'll be sorry, especially when he becomes the ExtraOrdinary Wizard.  
Septimus Heap has become the apprentice to Marcia Overstrand, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and a year has gone by. Septimus's older brother, Simon, had run away after an argument between him and Sarah and Silas Heap about Septimus, who Simon dislikes. He comes back and kidnaps Jenna on his horse, Thunder. Septimus goes to search for her and he is assisted in his search by his brother Nicko, who helps build boats at Jannit Maarten's boatyard. Along the way, Septimus meets his old friend Boy 409 from the young army, who went missing before the events of Book 1. He is now called Wolf Boy. Jenna runs away from Simon's observatory in The Badlands and makes her way towards The Port. Eventually Septimus is able to rescue Jenna with his elder brother [[Nicko Heap|Nicko]]'s help from the Port but they are tracked by Sleuth, Simon's tracking ball.

They make their way to the Marram Marshes where they take the [[Dragon-Boat]] from [[List of Septimus Heap characters#Zelda Zanuba Heap|Aunt Zelda]]'s cottage and fly her to the Castle. However, they are pursued by Simon, who used a Flyte Charm to fly in the sky. Simon drops a huge ''Thunderflash'' on the Dragon-Boat's wing and it drops over [[Jannit Marten]]'s Boatyard. Septimus, Jenna, and Aunt Zelda are able to revive her through the ''Transubstantiation Triple'' spell.

Septimus is also in search of the long lost ''Flyte'' charm. He finds the separated charm and unites it along with the small pair-of-wings ''Flyte'' charm that Marcia had given him as a token for his apprenticeship. Eventually he is able to fly and even warns Simon never to harm Jenna again. Also, the rock that Jenna gave him at Aunt Zelda's cottage turns out to be the egg of a dragon and eventually it hatches. Septimus absolutely adores the dragon and names him [[Spit Fyre]]. The dragon, based on the seeing-is-believing basis, identifies Marcia as his mother after yelling at him on the dragon launch pad.

Septimus rescues Marcia by identifying the shadow that has been trailing her. He also finds out that the '''''ShadowSafe''''' Marcia is developing contains, unbeknownst to her, the bones of the dead [[Necromancy|Necromancer]], [[DomDaniel]], which, once reassembled, tries to kill Marcia. With Septimus's help, Marcia is able to ''Identify'' him and he is once again destroyed.
