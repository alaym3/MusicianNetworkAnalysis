'''Cabell''' "'''Cab'''" '''Calloway III''' (December 25, 1907 – November 18, 1994) was an American [[jazz]] singer, dancer, bandleader and actor. He was associated with the [[Cotton Club]] in [[Harlem]], where he was a regular performer and became a popular vocalist of the [[Swing music|swing]] era. His niche of mixing jazz and [[vaudeville]] won him acclaim during a career that spanned over 65 years.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/transition-186434|title=Transition|date=November 27, 1994|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref>

Calloway was a master of energetic [[scat singing]] and led one of the most popular [[Big band|dance bands]] in the United States from the early 1930s to the late 1940s. His band included trumpeters [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Jonah Jones]], and [[Doc Cheatham|Adolphus "Doc" Cheatham]], saxophonists [[Ben Webster]] and [[Chu Berry|Leon "Chu" Berry]], guitarist [[Danny Barker]], bassist [[Milt Hinton]], and drummer [[Cozy Cole]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite magazine|last=Litchman|first=Irv|date=December 3, 1994|title=Cab Calloway Conquered Biz With Panache|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwgEAAAAMBAJ&q=calloway+&pg=PA10|magazine=Billboard|pages=10, 105}}</ref>

Calloway had several hit records in the 1930s and 1940s, becoming known as the "Hi-de-ho" man of jazz for his most famous song, "[[Minnie the Moocher]]", originally recorded in 1931. He reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in five consecutive decades (1930s–1970s).<ref name=":2" /> Calloway also made several stage, film, and television appearances until his death in 1994 at the age of 86. He had roles in [[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|''Stormy Weather'']] (1943), ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1953), ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965), and [[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|''Hello Dolly!'']] (1967). His career saw renewed interest when he appeared in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers.]]''

Calloway was the first African American musician to sell a million records from a single and to have a nationally syndicated radio show.<ref name="Brooks">{{cite news|author=Brooks, Peter|title=The case for the Calloway house|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 26, 2019|page=11}}</ref> In 1993, Calloway received the [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]] from the [[United States Congress]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/2e495a7671b93f757dbdf001550d9ace|title=National Medal of Arts to Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Arthur Miller|last=Lelyveld|first=Nita|date=October 4, 1993|website=AP News}}</ref> He posthumously received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2008.

Calloway grew up in the West Baltimore neighborhood of Druid Hill. He often skipped school to earn money by selling newspapers, shining shoes, and cooling down horses at the [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico racetrack]] where he developed an interest in racing and betting on horse races.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/11/19/Big-Band-leader-Calloway-dies-at-86/2549785221200/|title=Big Band leader Calloway dies at 86|date=November 19, 1994|website=UPI|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Gates (Jr.)|first1=Henry Louis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_vRLcgEdGoC&q=camay+calloway+1927+zelma+proctor&pg=PA98|title=Harlem Renaissance Lives from the African American National Biography|last2=Higginbotham|first2=Evelyn Brooks|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-538795-7|pages=98|language=en}}</ref> After he was caught playing dice on the church steps, his mother sent him to [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania|Downingtown]] Industrial and Agricultural School in 1921, a reform school run by his mother's uncle in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=":1" />

Calloway resumed hustling when he returned to Baltimore and worked as a caterer while he improved his studies in school.<ref name=":1" /> He began private vocal lessons in 1922, and studied music throughout his formal schooling. Despite his parents' and teachers' disapproval of [[jazz]], he began performing in nightclubs in Baltimore. His mentors included drummer [[Chick Webb]] and pianist Johnny Jones. Calloway joined his high school basketball team, and in his senior year he started playing professional basketball with the Baltimore Athenians, a team in the Negro Professional Basketball League.<ref name="Sun1994">{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-11-20/news/1994324027_1_cab-calloway-baltimore-black |title=Cab Calloway's memoirs tell story of growing up in a segregated Baltimore |date=November 20, 1994 |first1=Linell |last1=Smith |first2=Fred |last2=Rasmussen |work=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> He graduated from [[Frederick Douglass High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Frederick Douglass High School]] in 1925.<ref name="Sun-PBS" /><ref name="FDHSalumni">{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimorecityschools.org/Page/17999 |title=Alumni |work=The Historic Frederick Douglass High School |publisher=Baltimore County Public School |access-date=September 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921192726/http://www.baltimorecityschools.org/Page/17999 |archive-date=September 21, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Music career ==

=== 1927–1929: Early career ===
In 1927, Calloway joined his older sister, [[Blanche Calloway]], on tour for the popular black musical revue ''Plantation Days''.<ref name=":6" /> His sister became an accomplished bandleader before him, and he often credited her as his inspiration for entering show business.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lloyd|first=Robin|title=Black History Month: The Bold Blanche Calloway|url=https://www.knkx.org/post/black-history-month-bold-blanche-calloway|access-date=March 26, 2021|website=www.knkx.org|date=February 25, 2021|language=en}}</ref> Calloway's mother wanted him to be a lawyer like his father, so once the tour ended he enrolled at [[Crane College]] in Chicago, but he was more interested in singing and entertaining. While at Crane he refused the opportunity to play basketball for the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] to pursue a singing career.<ref name=":1" />

Calloway spent most of his nights at Chicago's Dreamland Café, [[Sunset Cafe]], and Club Berlin, performing as a singer, drummer, and master of ceremonies.<ref name=":6" /> At Sunset Cafe, he was an understudy for singer [[Adelaide Hall]]. There he met and performed with [[Louis Armstrong]], who taught him to sing in the [[Scat singing|scat]] style. He left school to sing with the Alabamians band.<ref name="Ossman">{{cite news |last1=Ossman |first1=David |title=Cab Calloway: 'A Hi De Ho Centennial'|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/12/26/17408371/cab-calloway-a-hi-de-ho-centennial|newspaper=NPR.org |access-date=June 16, 2021}}</ref>

In 1929, Calloway relocated to New York with the band. They opened at the [[Savoy Ballroom]] on September 20, 1929. When the Alabamians broke up, Armstrong recommended Calloway as a replacement singer in the musical revue ''[[Hot Chocolates|Connie's Hot Chocolates]]''.<ref name=":6" /> He established himself as a vocalist singing "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]" by [[Fats Waller]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine|date=August 14, 1993|title=Catchin' Cab: The Magic of Calloway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BEEAAAAMBAJ&q=cab&pg=PA61|magazine=Billboard|pages=3}}</ref> While Calloway was performing in the revue, [[The Missourians (band)|the Missourians]] asked him to front their band.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McClellan|first=Lawrence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oit7y0bS4MUC&q=savoy+cab+calloway+1929&pg=PA90|title=The Later Swing Era, 1942 to 1955|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30157-5|pages=90|language=en}}</ref>

=== 1930–1955: Success ===
In 1930, [[The Missourians (band)|the Missourians]] became known as [[The Cab Calloway Orchestra|Cab Calloway and His Orchestra]]. At the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem, New York, the band was hired in 1931 to substitute for the [[Duke Ellington]] Orchestra while Ellington's band was on tour. Their popularity led to a permanent position. The band also performed twice a week for radio broadcasts on [[NBC]]. Calloway appeared on radio programs with [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Bing Crosby]] and was the first African American to have a nationally syndicated radio show.<ref name="Brooks" /> During the depths of the [[Great Depression]], Calloway was earning $50,000 a year at 23 years old.<ref name=":7" />[[File:Cab Calloway as Bandleader (Van Vechten portrait -2).jpg|thumb|left|Calloway by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1933|alt=]]In 1931, Calloway recorded his most famous song, "[[Minnie the Moocher]]." It was the first single record by an African American to sell a million copies.<ref name="Brooks" /> Calloway performed the song and two others, "[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]" and "The Old Man of the Mountain," in the [[Betty Boop]] cartoons ''[[Minnie the Moocher (Betty Boop cartoon)|Minnie the Moocher]]'' (1932), ''[[Snow-White (1933 film)|Snow-White]]'' (1933), and ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933). Calloway performed voice-over for these cartoons, and through [[rotoscoping]], his dance steps were the basis of the characters' movements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/how-rotoscope-cab-calloway-changed-animation/|title=How the Rotoscope and Cab Calloway Changed the Way Animated Characters Move|date=December 4, 2019|website=Laughing Squid|language=en-US}}</ref>

As a result of the success of "Minnie the Moocher", Calloway became identified with its chorus, gaining the nickname "The Hi De Ho Man".<ref name="nyt_obit">{{cite news|author=Wilson, John S.|title=Cab Calloway&nbsp;Is Dead at 86; 'Hi-de-hi-de-ho' Jazz Man|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 20, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/obituaries/cab-calloway-is-dead-at-86-hi-de-hi-de-ho-jazz-man.html|access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref> He performed in the 1930s in a series of short films for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].

Calloway made his first Hollywood [[feature film]] appearance opposite [[Al Jolson]] in ''[[The Singing Kid]]'' (1936). He sang several duets with Jolson, and the film included Calloway's band and 22 Cotton Club dancers from New York.<ref>Shipton, Alyn.

Calloway's band recorded for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and the [[ARC Records|ARC]] dime-store labels (Banner, Cameo, Conqueror, Perfect, Melotone, Banner, Oriole) from 1930 to 1932, when he signed with [[RCA Victor]] for a year. He returned to Brunswick in late 1934 through 1936, then moved to Variety, run by his manager, [[Irving Mills]]. He remained with Mills when the label collapsed during the Depression. Their sessions were continued by [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] through 1939 and [[OKeh Records|OKeh]] through 1942. After an [[American Federation of Musicians|AFM]] recording ban due to the [[1942–44 musicians' strike]], Calloway continued to record.

In 1938, Calloway released ''Cab Calloway's Cat-ologue: A "[[Glossary of jive talk|Hepster]]'s" Dictionary'', the first dictionary published by an African American. It became the official [[Glossary of jive talk|jive language]] reference book of the [[New York Public Library]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flashbak.com/cab-calloways-hepsters-dictionary-a-guide-to-the-language-of-jive-1938-378657/|title=Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary: A Guide To The Language Of Jive (1938)|last=Sorene|first=Paul|date=April 26, 2017|website=Flashbak|language=en-US}}</ref> A revised version of the book was released with ''Professor Cab Calloway's Swingformation Bureau'' in 1939.

Calloway wrote a humorous pseudo-gossip column called "Coastin' with Cab" for ''Song Hits'' magazine. It was a collection of celebrity snippets, such as the following in the May 1946 issue: "[[Benny Goodman]] was dining at Ciro's steak house in New York when a very homely girl entered. 'If her face is her fortune,' Benny quipped, 'she'd be tax-free.'" In the late 1940s, however, Calloway's bad financial decisions and his gambling caused his band to break up.<ref name="Ossman" />[[File:Cabsuit.jpg|thumb|right|One of Cab Calloway's [[zoot suits]] on display in Baltimore's City Hall, October 2007]]

In 1953, he played the prominent role of Sportin' Life in a production of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' with [[William Warfield]] and [[Leontyne Price]] as the title characters.

Calloway and his daughter Lael recorded "Little Child", an adaption of "[[Little Boy and the Old Man]]".

In 1956, Clarence Robinson, who produced revues at the original Cotton Club and the [[Apollo Theater]], and choreographed the movie ''Stormy Weather'', cast Calloway as the main attraction for his project in Miami. The Cotton Club of Miami featured a troupe of 48 people, including singer [[Sallie Blair]], [[George Kirby]], [[Abbey Lincoln]], and the dance troupe of [[Norma Miller]].
