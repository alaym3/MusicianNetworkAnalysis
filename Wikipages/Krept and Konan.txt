Undeterred by the controversy, they released a cover of [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] and [[Lil Wayne]]'s "The Motto", launched their own clothing line called Play Dirty and early into 2012 were invited to join the British rapper [[Skepta]] on his tour in the UK.<ref name="Collins">{{cite web|last = Collins|first = Hattie|title = Krept and Konan: the secrets of Young Kingz success website|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/krept-konan-young-kingz-mixtape-success|date = 12 September 2013}}</ref> They appeared on [[Tinie Tempah]]'s 2011 mixtape ''[[Happy Birthday (mixtape)|Happy Birthday]]'' and in 2013 they released their third mixtape ''[[Young Kingz]]'', with features from [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]], [[Tinie Tempah]], G FrSH, [[Giggs (rapper)|Giggs]], [[George the Poet]], Yungen, Ari, Yana Toma, Fekky, Siah and Anthony Thomas.
