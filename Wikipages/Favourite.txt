A '''favourite''' ([[British English]]) or '''favorite''' ([[American English]]) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. In [[Post-classical Europe|post-classical]] and [[Early modern Europe|early-modern Europe]], among other times and places, the term was used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, particularly in Spain, England, France and Sweden.<ref>Elliott:5, summarising the work of French historian [[Jean Bérenger]]</ref>

The term is also sometimes employed by writers who want to avoid terms such as "[[royal mistress]]", "friend", "companion", or "lover" (of either sex). Several favourites had sexual relations with the monarch (or the monarch's spouse), but the feelings of the monarch for the favourite ran the gamut from simple faith in the favourite's abilities to various degrees of emotional affection and dependence, and sometimes even encompassed sexual infatuation.

The term has an inbuilt element of disapproval and is defined by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "One who stands unduly high in the favour of a prince",<ref>{{Cite OED|term=favourite|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref> citing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]: "Like favourites/ Made proud by Princes" (''[[Much Ado About Nothing|Much Ado about Nothing]]'', 3.1.9<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/much_3_1.html|title=Much Ado About Nothing 3.1|website=www.shakespeare-online.com|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>).

==Rises and falls of favourites==
[[File:Portrait of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (by Peter Paul Rubens).jpg|thumb|[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|The Duke of Buckingham]] by the workshop of [[Rubens]]]]

Favourites inevitably tended to incur the envy and loathing of the rest of the [[nobility]], and [[monarch]]s were sometimes obliged by political pressure to dismiss or execute them; in the Middle Ages nobles often rebelled in order to seize and kill a favourite. Too close a relationship between monarch and favourite was seen as a breach of the natural order and hierarchy of society. Since many favourites had flamboyant "over-reaching" personalities, they often led the way to their own downfall with their rash behaviour. As the opinions of the [[gentry]] and [[bourgeoisie]] grew in importance, they too often strongly disliked favourites. Dislike from all classes could be especially intense in the case of favourites who were elevated from humble, or at least minor, backgrounds by royal favour. Titles and estates were usually given lavishly to favourites, who were compared to [[mushroom]]s because they sprang up suddenly overnight, from a bed of [[excrement]]. The King's favourite [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]] is a "night-grown mushrump" (mushroom) to his enemies in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]''.<ref>[[s:Edward the Second]]</ref>

Their falls could be even more sudden, but after about 1650, executions tended to give way to quiet retirement. Favourites who came from the higher nobility, such as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], [[Francisco Goméz de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]], [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], and [[Axel Oxenstierna|Oxenstierna]], were often less resented and lasted longer. Successful minister-favourites also usually needed networks of their own favourites and relatives to help them carry out the work of government &ndash; [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] had his "créatures" and Olivares his "hechuras".<ref>Elliott:6</ref> Oxenstierna and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], who both died in office, successfully trained their sons to succeed them.

The favourite can often not be easily distinguished from the successful royal administrator, who at the top of the tree certainly needed the favour of the monarch, but the term is generally used of those who first came into contact with the monarch through the social life of the court, rather than the business of politics or administration. Figures like William Cecil and [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], whose accelerated rise through the administrative ranks owed much to their personal relations with the [[monarch]], but who did not attempt to behave like grandees of the nobility, were also often successful.  [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] had Cecil as [[Secretary of State]] and later [[Lord High Treasurer]] from the time she ascended the throne in 1558 until his death 40 years later. She had more colourful relationships with several courtiers; the most lasting and intimate one was with [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]], who was also a leading politician.<ref>Adams pp. 17&ndash;18</ref> Only in her last decade was the position of the Cecils, father and son, challenged by [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], when he fatally attempted a coup against [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|the younger Cecil]].

[[Cardinal Wolsey]] was one figure who rose through the administrative hierarchy, but then lived extremely ostentatiously, before falling suddenly from power. In the [[Middle Ages]] in particular, many royal favourites were promoted in the church, English examples including Saints [[Dunstan]] and [[Thomas Becket]]; Bishops [[William Waynflete]], [[Robert Burnell]] and [[Walter Reynolds]]. [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]], like his father, was a trusted Habsburg minister who lived grandly, but he was not really a favourite, partly because most of his career was spent away from the monarch.
[[Image:Triple Portrait of Cardinal de Richelieu probably 1642, Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Cardinal Richelieu]], one of the most successful from the golden age of the favourite]]

Some favourites came from very humble backgrounds: [[Archibald Armstrong]], [[jester]] to [[James I of England]] infuriated everyone else at court but managed to retire a wealthy man; unlike [[Robert Cochrane (architect)|Robert Cochrane]], a [[stonemason]] (probably a senior one, more like an [[architect]] than an [[artisan]]) who became [[Earl of Mar]] before the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] nobles revolted against him and hanged him and other low-born favourites of [[James III of Scotland]]. [[Olivier le Daim]], the barber of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], acquired a title and important military commands before he was executed on vague charges brought by nobles shortly after his master died, without the knowledge of the new king. It has been claimed that le Daim's career was the origin of the term, as ''favori'' (the French word) first appeared around the time of his death in 1484. ''Privado'' in Spanish was older, but was later partly replaced by the term ''valido''; in Spanish, both terms were less derogatory than in French and English.<ref>Elliott:1</ref>  Spain had a succession of ''validos'' during the reigns of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]].<ref>[https://whechmerspain360.umwblogs.org/the-validos-of-spain/ some blog]</ref>

Such rises from menial positions became progressively harder as the centuries progressed; one of the last families able to jump the widening chasm between servants and nobility was that of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s valet, [[Alexandre Bontemps]], whose descendants, holding the office for a further three generations, married into many great families, even eventually including the extended royal family itself. Queen Victoria's [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]] came much too late; the devotion of the monarch and ability to terrorize her household led to hardly any rise in social or economic position.

==Decline==
In England, the scope for giving political power to a favourite was reduced by the growing importance of [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. After the "mushroom" [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] was assassinated by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] in 1628, Charles I turned to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], who had been a leader of Parliamentary opposition to Buckingham and the King, but had become his supporter after Charles made concessions. Strafford can therefore hardly be called a favourite in the usual sense even though his relationship with Charles became very close. He was also from a well-established family, with powerful relations. After several years in power, Strafford was [[impeachment|impeached]] by a Parliament now very hostile to him. When that process failed, it passed a [[bill of attainder]] for his execution without trial, and it put enough pressure on Charles that to his subsequent regret, Charles signed it, and Strafford was executed in 1641. There were later minister-favourites in England, but they knew that the favour of the monarch alone was not sufficient to rule, and most also had careers in Parliament.
[[Image:Princepotemkin.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Grigori Potemkin]]]]

In France, the movement was in the opposite direction. On the death of [[Cardinal Mazarin]] in 1661, the 23-year-old Louis XIV determined that he would rule himself, and he did not allow the delegation of power to ministers that had marked the previous 40 years. The [[absolute monarchy]] pioneered by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], Mazarin's predecessor, was to be led by the monarch himself. Louis had many powerful ministers, notably [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], in finances, and [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois]], the army, but the overall direction was never delegated, and no subsequent French minister ever equalled the power of the two cardinals.

The [[Spanish Habsburgs]] were not capable of so much energy, but when Olivares was succeeded by his nephew, [[Luis Méndez de Haro]], the last real ''valido'', the control of government into a single pair of hands had already been weakened.

==In literature==
Favourites were the subject of much contemporary debate, some of it involving a certain amount of danger for the participants. There were a large number of English plays on the subject, amongst the best known to be Marlowe's ''Edward II'' in which Piers Gaveston is a leading character, and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'' (1603), for which [[Ben Jonson]] was called before the [[Privy Council]], accused of "Popery and treason", as the play was claimed by his enemies to contain allusions to the contemporary court of [[James I of England]]. [[Sejanus]], whose career under Tiberius was vividly described by [[Tacitus]], was the subject of numerous works all around Europe.<ref>Elliott:2-3</ref> [[Shakespeare]] was more cautious, and with the exceptions of [[Falstaff]], badly disappointed in his hopes of becoming a favourite, and Cardinal Wolsey in [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry&nbsp;VIII'']], he gives no major parts to favourites.<ref>Blair Worden in Elliott:171</ref>
[[Image:0024MAN-Antinous.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Antinous]] from [[Patras]], ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]])]]

[[Francis Bacon]], almost a favourite himself, devoted much of his [[essay]] ''On Friendship'' to the subject, writing as a rising politician under Elizabeth I:
<blockquote>It is a strange thing to observe, how high a rate great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of friendship, whereof we speak: So great, as they purchase it, many times, at the hazard of their own safety and greatness. For princes, in regard of the distance of their fortune from that of their subjects and servants, cannot gather this fruit, except (to make themselves capable thereof) they raise some persons to be, as it were, companions and almost equals to themselves, which many times sorteth to inconvenience. The modern languages give unto such persons the name of ''favorites'',<!-- this spelling in the original --> or privadoes ...&nbsp;.  And we see plainly that this hath been done, not by weak and passionate princes only, but by the wisest and most politic that ever reigned; who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants; whom both themselves have called friends, and allowed other likewise to call them in the same manner; using the word which is received between private men.{{refn|Published 1597, perhaps the earliest use of the word in English, it is missed by the [[OED]], who give the Shakespeare use quoted above, perhaps written in 1598.<ref>{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Bacon |author-link=Francis Bacon |year=1597 |url=http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-27.html |title=On Friendship |website=authorama.com}}</ref>}}</blockquote>

[[Lord Macaulay]] wrote in 1844 of [[George III]]'s old tutor, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], who became [[Prime Minister]]: "He was a favourite, and favourites have always been odious in this country. No mere favourite had been at the head of the government since the dagger of Felton had reached the heart of the Duke of Buckingham".<ref>Essay on "The Earl of Chatham", quoted Elliott:1</ref>

==Study of the subject==
In 1974 [[Jean Bérenger]] published his ''Annales'', the most meaningful comparative study on the subject.<ref name="todesca">{{cite book|last=Todesca|first=James J.|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Emergence_of_Le%C3%B3n_Castile_c_1065_15/sOjOCwAAQBAJ?hl|title=The Emergence of León-Castile C.1065-1500|page=|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2016|isbn=9781317034353}}</ref> According to Bérenger, the simultaneous success of minister-favorites in several monarchies of the 17th-century was not coincidental, but reflected some change that was taking place at the time. J.H. Elliot and Lawrence Brockliss's work (that resulted in the collection of essays ''The World of the Favorite''), undertaken to explore the matter put forward by Bérenger, became the most important comparative treatment of this subject.<ref name="todesca"/>
