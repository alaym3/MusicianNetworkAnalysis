'''Riverside''' are a [[progressive rock]] band from [[Warsaw]], Poland. They were founded in 2001 by friends [[Mariusz Duda]], [[Piotr Grudziński]], [[Piotr Kozieradzki]] and Jacek Melnicki, who shared a love for progressive rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although Duda, the main lyricist and composer of the band, was originally a fan of [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[experimental music]], like [[Radiohead]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Dead Can Dance]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Peter Gabriel]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backgroundmagazine.nl/Specials/InterviewDuda.html|title=BACKGROUND MAGAZINE Interview Mariusz Duda (Riverside, Lunatic Soul)|website=www.backgroundmagazine.nl|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> and later on, [[prog rock]] like [[Pink Floyd]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Marillion]]; and [[Thrash Metal]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105145650/http://www.riversideband.pl/en/band|title=Band|website=riversideband.pl}}</ref> Riverside can be described as a blend of atmospheric rock and metal elements, resulting in a sound similar to that of [[Porcupine Tree]], [[Pain of Salvation]], and [[Dream Theater]].<ref name=":0" />

== History ==

=== Beginnings and ''Out of Myself'' ===
One day near the turn of the millennium, during a short drive, Piotr Kozieradzki played [[Marillion]] in his car for Piotr Grudzińscvki. While drummer Piotr 'Mitloff' Kozieradzki had played in two death metal bands, Dominion and Hate, and Piotr Grudziński had played guitar in a metal band, Unnamed, they both shared a deep affection for progressive rock. They were already friends with producer and keyboardist Jacek Melnicki who also owned his own studio. The three decided to experiment with progressive music but they needed a bass player to complete the lineup. Mariusz Duda, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from the band Xanadu, agreed to attend a rehearsal in late fall of 2001 at the request of Jacek. Reactions to this first meeting between the four experienced instrumentalists were extremely positive.

After a few rehearsals, the members realized that they were involved in something special and deeply satisfying. Once a few compositions were completed, Mariusz attempted to sing in his own language, singing that was probably similar to the vocalizations in their future track "The Curtain Falls", although all future vocals and lyrics were to be written in English. Thus Mariusz began to take on the role of vocalist, as well as that of the bass player. In October 2002, about a year after their formation, the band performed a pair of shows in Warsaw. After the distribution of about 500 copies of their demo, the band performed at a small club in Warsaw once again in early 2003. As the band continued to write more material for a full-length release, there grew a dissonance between keyboardist Jacek and the other members of Riverside. Jacek wished to continue with his studio pursuits, so during the latter part of 2003, he split from the group.

The rest of the band was left to mix their first album, which was to be entitled ''Out of Myself''. It was released in Poland in late 2003. The success of the album in Poland and the live shows that the band performed led to a release of the album on American record label Laser's Edge in September 2004, this time with cover art from [[Travis Smith (artist)|Travis Smith]], painter for bands such as [[Opeth]], [[Katatonia]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], and [[Devin Townsend]]. The album ''[[Out of Myself]]'' has won best debut in many magazines and websites such as Metal Hammer and Belgium Prog-Nose.

=== ''Voices in My Head'' and ''Second Life Syndrome'' ===
Following their 2003 debut ''[[Out of Myself]]'' and the success that followed in 2004, the band began working on an EP entitled ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'' which was at first a release exclusive to Poland through the label [[Mystic Production]]. The quartet from Poland performed their first foreign gig at the Progpower festival in the Dutch city of Baarlo. The band were taken in by major prog label [[Inside Out Music|Inside Out]], releasing ''[[Second Life Syndrome]]'' in late October 2005. The album was a massive success, expanding the scope of the band's reach even further than Out of Myself. The album holds a formidable spot as number 62 on ''[[Prog Archives]]'' top 100 prog albums as well as the number one rated album of 2005.<ref name="prog archives top list">{{cite web | url = http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?salbumtypes=1#list | title = Progarchives top 100 albums | date = 2009-01-23 | access-date= 2009-01-23}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'', the EP originally released in Poland only, was re-released under the InsideOut label, now revamped with the inclusion of three high quality live tracks off the ''[[Out of Myself]]'' album. In addition, the band played their first overseas show at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 24 June 2006. Soon after, the band would begin writing for its third full-length album and final instalment in the Reality Dream Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/bio-band|title=RAPID EYE MOVEMENT, REALITY DREAM|website=riversideband.pl}}</ref>

=== ''Rapid Eye Movement'' and ''Lunatic Soul'' ===
In October 2007, the band released the album ''[[Rapid Eye Movement (album)|Rapid Eye Movement]]'', once again under the InsideOut label. The European release had the standard nine tracks but the American release saw two versions of the album. One was a single CD with the nine tracks from the album, plus three tracks from their 02 Panic Room Single. This single CD was also exclusive to Mystic Production and therefore mostly unavailable to oversea fans. The other version contained 2 CDs, the first with the nine album tracks and the second disc containing the three songs from the single as well as two new, more atmospheric, compositions. Before the release, the band toured in support for [[Dream Theater]] on the European leg of their tour, exposing them to even more potential fans. Mariusz Duda released the self-titled debut album from his new project ''[[Lunatic Soul]]'' by [[Kscope]] on 13 October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/lunaticsoul |title=Kscope present Lunatic Soul |publisher=Kscopemusic.com |access-date=2015-09-13}}</ref>

=== ''Anno Domini High Definition'' and ''Memories in My Head'' ===
The quartet's next album was "Anno Domini High Definition".<ref>[http://riverside.art.pl/en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621070137/http://riverside.art.pl/en |date=June 21, 2009 }}</ref> Mariusz Duda had the following to say about the album on 27 January 2009:
	
"We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer. We care deeply about creating a coherent record and that is why most probably there are only going to be five songs on it. The material will be energetic, multifarious, and - I hope so - very good for live performances. It will be a story about liquid modernity, life in a constant hurry, stress and anxiety about the future. A picture of our times in 1920 x 1080 definition."
	
The record was released in Poland by Mystic Production on 15 June 2009. ''Anno Domini High Definition'' became the best selling album in Poland during its second week on the charts, following a debut at sixth place.:<ref>[http://www.olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=517&lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627040030/http://www.olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=517&lang=en |date=June 27, 2015 }}</ref> The album was released on 6 June in the rest of Europe and on 28 July in North America. The band has tracked their recording process with the blog and website annodomininihighdefinition.com (which is no longer a registered domain).

The Limited Edition of Anno Domini HD is a 2-disc set. The second disc is a DVD that contains a seven-song video production. The show was taped at the Paradiso Theater in Amsterdam.

An EP entitled [[Memories in My Head]] was released in 2011.

=== ''Shrine of New Generation Slaves'' ===
In January 2013, Riverside released their fifth full-length album, ''[[Shrine of New Generation Slaves]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/discography/shrine-of-new-generation-slaves |title=Riverside - Shrine of New Generation Slaves |publisher=Riversideband.pl |access-date=2015-09-13}}</ref>
