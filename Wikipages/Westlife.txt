==History==

===Origin: Byrne, Egan, Feehily, Filan and McFadden's beginnings===
[[Kian Egan]], [[Mark Feehily]] and [[Shane Filan]], all schoolmates in [[Summerhill College]] in [[Sligo]], Ireland, participated in a school production of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett. They considered it as the start of Westlife. The sextet formed a pop vocal group called '''Six as One''' in 1997, which they later renamed '''IOYOU'''. Before this, Egan was part of a [[punk-rock]] band called '''Skrod'''. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh and two other informal managers, released a single titled "[[Together Girl Forever]]" under Sound Records which was written by Feehily and Filan with fellow Irish [[Those Nervous Animals]] and The Strong are Lonely band members Padraig Meehan and Daragh Connolly. Another song "Everlasting Love" included in the single was written by Feehily, Keighron, Meehan, and Connolly. There is also an unreleased song called "Good Thing".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1626452.stm|title=Westlife manager tells it straight|date=29 October 2001|publisher=BBC}}</ref> McDonagh first encountered Egan as a six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes, and came to know Filan and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Godspell]]'' for Sligo Fun Company.
[[File:Louis Walsh2009July.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife is managed by [[Louis Walsh]].]] [[File:Simon Cowell in December 2011.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife was originally signed by [[Simon Cowell]].]]
[[Louis Walsh]], the manager of fellow Irish boy band [[Boyzone]], came to know the group after Filan's mother Mae contacted him, but the group failed to secure a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] record deal with Simon Cowell. Cowell told Walsh: "You are going to have to fire at least three of them. They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have ever seen in my life."<ref>{{cite book |last= Cowell |first= Simon |title= I Don't Mean to Be Rude, But... |publisher= Broadway Books |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-7679-1741-3 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/idontmeantoberud00cowe }}</ref> Lacey, Keighron, and Garrett were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where [[Nicky Byrne]] and [[Brian McFadden]] were recruited. McFadden was part of an [[R&B]] group called '''Cartel''' before this.

The new group, formed on 3 July 1998, was originally named '''Westside''', but as another band was already using that name, the group was renamed Westlife. It was revealed that Walsh was already calling them Westlife before the Westside name came along.<ref name="Bower 2012">{{cite book |last= Bower |first= Tom |title= Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-0345533951 }}</ref> In ''[[Westlife – Our Story]]'', Byrne revealed that, unlike the others in the group, he was keen to change the name to West High. McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan to facilitate signing autographs. They managed to secure a major record deal the second time around under BMG with all other record labels competed. They have signed a four million pound record deal with [[RCA Records]]. Westlife's first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and [[Backstreet Boys]]' concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer [[Ronan Keating]] was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. Later, they won a special Smash Hits Roadshow award at that year's ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]''. Their first live television performance as a group in Ireland and worldwide was on the Irish TV series and the world's second longest-running late-night talk show, ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)|The Late Late Show]]'' that had its broadcast on 13 November 1998. They performed "[[Flying Without Wings]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/2018/1108/1009544-when-westlife-were-westside/ |title=Welcome Westside 1998 |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}</ref> The band then released an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Swear It Again]]'' afterwards. Both recorded songs under Westside were produced by [[Steve Mac]] and written by Mac and [[Wayne Hector]]. Cowell chose the debut extended play and single with the guidance of his father, [[Eric Cowell]], who stated then, "I think they will be big".<ref name="Bower 2012"/>

In April 1999, the group released their first single, "Swear It Again" which immediately topped the charts in Ireland and in the UK for two weeks.

It made them the only the second Irish act and fourth act to debut at No. 1 with their first three singles, [[B*Witched]], [[Robson and Jerome]], and [[Spice Girls]] being the other three. "Flying Without Wings" was also included on the soundtrack of the [[Warner Brothers]] film, ''[[Pokémon: The Movie 2000]]''. Their first album, simply titled ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'', was released in November 1999 and went to No. 2 in the UK and their first No. 1 in Ireland. The album was the biggest chart dropper on the top 40 in UK music history when, in its 58th week on the charts it leapt from No. 79 to No. 3 before falling to No. 37 the following week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/recordalb.html|title=Record-Breakers and Trivia – Albums |website=everyhit.com}}</ref> Despite the history, the album successfully managed to peak at No. 1 in [[Scotland]] in the year 2001 after premiering at No. 6 at the [[Scottish Albums Chart]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-albums-chart/20010114/40/|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=17 February 2013|title=Scottish Albums (14 January 2001)}}</ref>

In December 1999, a fourth and a double-side single was released, "[[I Have A Dream (ABBA song)#Westlife version|I Have A Dream]]"/"[[Seasons in the Sun#Westlife version|Seasons in the Sun]]".

On 14 March 2011, Westlife confirmed that they had left Cowell after 13 years and his record label [[Syco Music]] after nine years.

{{Quote|We signed to Simon back in 1998 and he was brilliant, but then came the development of ''The X Factor'' and ''[[American Idol]]''. Simon became famous himself and his interests went that way rather than on Westlife. We almost felt a little bit unloved with Simon Cowell, if I was to be honest. We had it (full time support) with Simon but he got so busy and would do it at the very last minute and we needed someone who was on it all the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/westlife-felt-unloved-by-cowell_1212334 |title=Westlife Felt 'Unloved' By Cowell |magazine=Contactmusic |date=13 April 2011 |access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref>}}

In October 2011, Egan ruled out speculation that McFadden would reunite with them for the new compilation album and its promotion for a television show.

The decision is entirely amicable and after spending all of our adult life together so far, we want to have a well-earned break and look at new ventures. We see the Greatest Hits collection and the farewell tour as the perfect way to celebrate our incredible career along with our fans. We are really looking forward to getting out on the tour and seeing our fans one last time.

Over the years, Westlife has become so much more to us than just a band. Westlife are a family. We would like to thank our fans who have been with us on this amazing journey and are part of our family too.

Westlife's name was used by the main character Vicky Pollard in the popular UK comedy television series ''[[Little Britain]]'' with one of her famous lines, "swapping her baby for a Westlife CD". They were referenced as part of 1990s pop culture on the British band [[Busted (band)|Busted]]'s 2018 music video "[[Nineties (song)|Nineties]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=James Bourne |title= @JamesBourne Wondering if Westlife will retaliate now with a music video wearing school uniforms jumping around in the playground with guitars |url=https://twitter.com/JamesBourne/status/1061968292993216512 |via=Twitter |access-date=17 November 2018 |date=12 November 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2021}}</ref> Their songs appeared in more than a thousand compilation albums.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/152450-Westlife?filter_anv=0&type=Appearances|title=Westlife discography|date=20 February 2001|publisher=discogs}}</ref>

Despite their success worldwide, Westlife was unable to break into the U.S. market. They had only one hit single in the United States, "Swear It Again", which peaked at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 2000. The band made an appearance on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and the U.S. edition of their debut album, ''Westlife'' was released, but it didn't meet with success. In 2002, with the two most prominent boy bands in the US, the Backstreet Boys and [[*NSYNC]], going on hiatus that year, an attempt was made to promote and release a US version of "World of Our Own", but was never successful. ''Billboard'' called the failure due to corporate politics.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQwEAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard+westlife+corporate+politics&pg=PA21 |title=Reviews and Previews – Spotlight – Westlife – World of Our Own |magazine=Billboard|date=10 August 2002 }}</ref>

{{Quote|"We sent over a CD of ''World of Our Own'' with no name on it. They didn't know it was Westlife and every single radio station in the States – all came back and said that this is an absolutely huge hit. They said it was great for radio and people are gonna love it, especially as there's just a slight bit of rock guitar to it. But as soon as we revealed it was Westlife, the radio pluggers all went, 'Whoa, not Westlife – it's a boyband.' And we cannot break that down, no matter what song we come out with. The problem with America is that it's all radio and you've got to break into radio first. And currently radio doesn't want to play boy bands or pop music. If [[Bono]] wrote a song with us tomorrow and it was the biggest hit in the world, if Westlife's name is put to it, it won't be a hit in America because radio will not play us."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/westlife-.blacklisted.-in-america |title=Westlife 'Blacklisted' In America|work=Contactmusic.com |date=8 July 2003 |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref>|Nicky Byrne, 8 July 2003 interview}}

"Flying Without Wings" peaked at number-two in the US when ''American Idol: Season 2'' winner [[Ruben Studdard]] recorded and released it as his debut single. In 2003, Westlife went to [[Nashville]] to film a TV documentary. While they were there, they gave a live performance of the song "[[Daytime Friends]]", originally by country music singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Though Westlife didn't gain as much success in the States as they did elsewhere, their music was still appreciated. Kid David Corey, assistant PD and music director at top 40 WXKS (Kiss 108) radio station in [[Boston]], Massachusetts was a Westlife supporter that was recorded saying "Bands like Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync are still climbing the charts, and radio is supporting them, so I don't think the boy band thing is going to hurt them. Besides, this song ["Swear it Again"] is just too good for any of that to be a concern. I can't imagine anyone not playing this because it's another boy band, especially when it doesn't even sound like those other guys."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Chuck|title=Dublin's darling Westlife wins over Europe, aims for success in U.S.|journal=ProQuest|date=5 February 2000|volume=112|issue=6|page=110|id={{ProQuest|1011343}}}}</ref>

Some have also criticized the band for doing many covers, having the same sound on every album released, lack of use of musical instruments and lack of songwriting skills. Feehily revealed in 2009: "There were many songs which I would be even scared to mention, you know, that were suggested to us which we turned down. There were many cover versions and many original songs that were either terrible. There was loads of stuff through the years, like '[[You Are Not Alone]]' by [[Michael Jackson]]?, that were suggested by their record company chief Cowell".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/Westlife-wanted-for-Jackson-song/4543/ |title=Westlife wanted for Jackson song |work=Skiddle |date=30 November 2009}}</ref>

==Collaboration==

Since then, the group has recorded studio and live performances with music acts including Mariah Carey ("Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)"), [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] ("[[Back at One (song)|Back at One]]"), Joanne Hindley ("The Way You Look Tonight"), [[Diana Ross]] ("When You Tell Me That You Love Me"), [[Donna Summer]] ("[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]"), and [[Delta Goodrem]] ("[[All Out of Love]]"), "[[If I Had Words]]" with The Vard Sisters, "I Have A Dream" with Indonesian child-star [[Sherina Munaf|Sherina]]. These songs were also recorded and included on various albums. In 2002, Westlife re-recorded their hit song "Flying Without Wings" with Mexican singer [[Cristian Castro]] and with Korean singer [[BoA]] as two separate duets.
