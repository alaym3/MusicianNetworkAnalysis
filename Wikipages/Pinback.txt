'''Pinback''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[San Diego]], [[California]]. The band was formed in 1998 by singers, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists [[Armistead Burwell Smith IV]] and [[Rob Crow]], who have been its two consistent members. They have released five studio albums and several other releases.

==History and origin==
