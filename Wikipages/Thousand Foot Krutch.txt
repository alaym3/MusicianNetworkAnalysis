== Background ==
=== Early years ===
[[Trevor McNevan]] formed the band in his home town of [[Peterborough, Ontario]], a city northeast of [[Toronto]] with his childhood friend Joel Bruyere and drummer Steve Augustine. McNevan's first band was {{nowrap|[[Trevor McNevan#Oddball|Oddball]]}}, and featured Dave Smith on guitar, Tim Baxter on bass and McNevan's good friend, [[Three Days Grace]]'s [[Neil Sanderson]], on drums. Oddball recorded only one album, ''Shutterbug'', which was released in 1995. The band's name was conceived by McNevan "symbolizing the point in our lives that we realize we can't make it on our own strength".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thousand Foot Krutch Biography |url=http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Thousand%20Foot%20Krutch.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609065947/http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Thousand%20Foot%20Krutch.html |archive-date=June 9, 2010 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Sweetslyrics}}</ref> He has written and released seven albums with Thousand Foot Krutch to date and another four with his side project [[FM Static]].

''Shutterbug'' was released by Trevor McNevan in 1995 under the band name Oddball. McNevan had friends Dave Smith (guitar), Tim Baxter (bass) and [[Neil Sanderson]] (drums), play on the album. There were 27 songs on the album, the first half rock, the second half hip-hop. McNevan recorded it at Barry Haggarty's studio in his home town of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. He worked at McDonald's and other jobs to pay for the studio time. The song "Lift It", first appeared here and was later re-recorded for Thousand Foot Krutch's first release, ''That's What People Do'', and appeared again on ''[[Set It Off (Thousand Foot Krutch album)|Set It Off]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=this.phenomenon.oddball |url=http://thisphenomenon.tripod.com/oddball.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717103900/http://thisphenomenon.tripod.com/oddball.html |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Thisphenomenon.tripod.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Tooth & Nail &#124; Set It Off |url=http://www.toothandnail.com/releases/436/Set_It_Off/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107083832/http://www.toothandnail.com/releases/436/Set_It_Off/about/ |archive-date=January 7, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Toothandnail.com}}</ref>

''That's What People Do'' was written the year McNevan started TFK in 1997. It was released independently in 1998 and is out of print. It sold over 5,000 copies. TFK climbed the ladder of local notoriety throughout Ontario and abroad. Reaching the ears of Ontario commercial radio, CKWF 101.5 FM in their home town of Peterborough added "Rhyme Animal", the band's first single from their independent recording, to their rotation. It clicked with listeners and within two months ended up being one of the five most requested songs of the year.

In 1999, TFK was chosen by ''7 Ball Magazine'' as one of the top 25 bands in North America. They were also awarded "Best Indie Recording" and McNevan awarded "Vocalist of the Year" by the readers of ''The Wire Magazine''. They were then awarded "Band of the Year" at the 2000 Wire Awards. They were also voted as the No.&nbsp;1 band of the millennium on 100.3 FM in Barrie, Ontario.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 21, 2008 |title=Thousand Foot Krutch's Biography – Discover music, videos, concerts, stats, & pictures at |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Thousand+Foot+Krutch/+wiki |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Last.fm}}</ref>

''[[Set It Off (Thousand Foot Krutch album)|Set It Off]]'' was released on November 14, 2000. It was the group's first indie label release. Though the sound of the album was distinct in its heavily hip-hop influenced nu metal, a few songs from the record (including "Puppet" and "Supafly") impacted at both secular and Christian radio.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The band toured it extensively across North America and ended up garnering much label attention by selling 85,000 copies of the indie release out of their van.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thousand Foot Krutch Dares to Move in New Musical Territory, Christian Music Review, Interviews, News |url=http://www.crosswalk.com/music/1362182/page1/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723140106/http://www.crosswalk.com/music/1362182/page1/ |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Crosswalk.com}}</ref> The band also printed a limited edition, "pre-release" version of ''Set It Off'' sold only at their release party at The Gordon Best Theatre in Peterborough, Ontario for their local fans. TFK toured with [[Finger Eleven]], [[Econoline Crush]], [[Treble Charger]], [[the Tea Party]], [[Matthew Good Band]], [[Gob (band)|Gob]], [[Sum 41]] and others. [[Three Days Grace]], which was a cover band at that time, was TFK's regular support act.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} McNevan helped with recordings of Three Days Grace's demo album. He is also featured on their song "This Movie" from this album. Around this same time, Dave Smith left the group, making McNevan the only original member. Smith was replaced with Myke Harrison, who parted ways about a year later. After Dave Smith's departure, McNevan began writing all the guitar lines and the band has used a live guitar player instead of officially replacing him.

Track seven from this album, "Unbelievable" – a cover of the [[EMF (band)|EMF]] song of the same name – appeared on the soundtrack for the 2010 film ''Just Wright''.<ref name="wordpress1">{{Cite web |title=All 17 Songs from the Just Wright Soundtrack are Alright By Me |url=http://reelsoundtrack.wordpress.com/2010/05/14/just-wright-soundtrack/ |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Reelsoundtrack.wordpress.com}}</ref>

=== Tooth & Nail years ===
[[File:ThousandFootKrutch-JoelBruyere.jpg|thumb|right|Bassist Joel Bruyere]]
In 2003, the band signed with [[Seattle]]-based [[Tooth & Nail Records]] and released their second full-length album, ''[[Phenomenon (Thousand Foot Krutch album)|Phenomenon]]''. Though something of a departure from the rap-heavy sound of ''Set it Off'', ''Phenomenon'' still relied on McNevan's rhythmic vocals, albeit with a solid modern metal sound. It was well received, and spawned four radio singles, including "[[Rawkfist (song)|Rawkfist]]". The album sold 200,000 units<ref>{{Cite web |title=soulpurpose.co.nz |url=http://www.soulpurpose.co.nz/music/reviews/alternative/thousand-foot-krutch-the-art-of-breaking/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621231737/http://www.soulpurpose.co.nz/music/reviews/alternative/thousand-foot-krutch-the-art-of-breaking/ |archive-date=June 21, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2021 |website=soulpurpose.co.nz |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=September 22, 2009 |title=Christian Music / Gospel – Article |url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/tournews/a/aatfk905tour |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Christianmusic.about.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> making it one of the best-selling albums in Tooth & Nail's history. They continued this success with the 2004 re-release of ''Set it Off'' through Tooth & Nail, allowing for a larger print run and adding six songs, including five from "That's What People Do", and one new song "Everyone Like Me", produced by [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]].

At this time, McNevan and Augustine started a side band called [[FM Static]], which can be classified as a pop-punk or pop-rock band and is usually much more light-hearted. FM Static scored numerous No. 1 songs, including their songs "Crazy Mary", and "Something to Believe In". In 2004, they toured with [[Kutless]] on the "Sea of Faces" tour alongside [[Falling Up (band)|Falling Up]] and FM Static.

On July 19, 2005, they released their third full-length album ''[[The Art of Breaking]]'', produced by [[Arnold Lanni]]. The album makes almost a complete break from the nu metal sound of ''Phenomenon'', focusing more on heavy elements. It is the first album to feature short guitar solos. "[[Move (TFK Song)|Move]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart early 2006.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Other singles included "Absolute" and "Breathe You In", which was released to alternative radio and was one of the band's first slower songs. During this time the band toured extensively.

In 2006, McNevan became involved with [[TobyMac]] and helped him write the song "Ignition" found on ''[[Portable Sounds]]''. The song has been used in media placements including ''Monday Night Football'' and ''NASCAR''. Because of this, in the early 2007, the band was part of the TobyMac Portable Sounds tour. The tour was such a success that Toby asked them to do the year-end tour as well.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 15, 2008 |title=Portable Sounds Tour concert review – Web Feature |url=http://media.www.nguskyliner.com/media/storage/paper284/news/2007/04/04/WebFeature/Portable.Sounds.Tour.Concert.Review-2822954.shtml |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Media.www.nguskyliner.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

After working in the studio with producer [[Ken Andrews]] they released ''[[The Flame in All of Us]]'' on September 18, 2007, with a move to a more mainstream rock sound, with some heavy influences from bands such as fellow Canadian artists [[Our Lady Peace]] and other metal bands of the time. The album includes the singles "Falls Apart", "What do we Know?", "Favorite Disease" and "The Flame in All of Us". On January 20, 2008, "The Flame in All of Us" became the 1000th song to make it on the ChristianRock.Net Top 30 Chart. The next tour was in early 2008 with [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]] and [[Decyfer Down]]. After a lengthy summer playing festivals and one-offs, they were included in the first Creation Festival: The Tour that consisted of nine bands: [[Kutless]], [[Pillar (band)|Pillar]], [[KJ-52]], [[Fireflight]], [[Worth Dying For]], [[Run Kid Run]], [[Esterlyn]], [[Capital Lights]] and themselves. They were asked to headline three tour dates, but declined.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Creation Festival: The Tour |url=http://www.itickets.com/tours/663.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023036/http://www.itickets.com/tours/663.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Itickets.com}}</ref> They also recorded the Christmas song "Jingle Bell Rawk" for the ''[[X Christmas]]'' compilation Christmas album, compiled by Tooth & Nail Records.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 21, 2008 |title=X Christmas – Various Artists – Discover music at |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/X+Christmas |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Last.fm}}</ref>
For ''[[Welcome to the Masquerade]]'', the band reunited with Aaron Sprinkle to co-produce this album, with [[Emery (band)|Emery]]'s Matt Carter assisting and Randy Staub mixing. The song "[[Fire It Up (Thousand Foot Krutch song)|Fire It Up]]" was included in video games such as [[EA Sports]] ''[[NHL 10]]'', and in the ''[[G.I.
