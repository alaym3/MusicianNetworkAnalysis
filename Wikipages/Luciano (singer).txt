==Career==
Born in Davyton, [[Manchester Parish]], and raised as the seventh of nine children in a strict [[Adventism|Adventist]] family, Luciano began recording in 1992, with his first single "Ebony & Ivory" (on which he was credited as 'Stepper John') on the Aquarius Record label, followed by a split album with DJ Presley (now credited as 'Luciana') for producer Sky High.<ref name="Thompson" /> His first releases as Luciano included the hit single "Give My Love a Try", produced at Castro Brown's New Name Studio, followed by others produced by Brown, [[Freddie McGregor]], Blacka Dread, and [[Sly and Robbie]], including the 1993 no. 1 [[UK]] reggae hit "Shake It Up Tonight".<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name=start>[http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20041011/ent/ent2.html Luciano gets started] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324145732/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20041011/ent/ent2.html |date=24 March 2012 }}.

He started working with [[Philip "Fatis" Burrell]], releasing the singles "Chant Out" and "Poor and Simple", with the [[album]] ''Moving Up'' following in late 1993.<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1994 he cut singles for Musclehead and Louie Culture before returning to work with Burrell for a series of successful singles and the album ''One Way Ticket'', which saw Luciano at the forefront of the "Rasta Renaissance" in [[dancehall]] music.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name=campbell>Campbell, Howard.

''Jamaica Gleaner'', 18 March 2008. Retrieved 6 April 2011.</ref> The renewal of Rastafarian influence into dancehall music in the early 1990s had begun with artists such as [[Tony Rebel]] and [[Garnett Silk]]. After Silk's death in late 1994, many looked to Luciano to continue consciousness in reggae music. Of Garnett Silk, he stated "Garnett was more like a brother, a father, a tutor, a forerunner. When he moved on I knew the work for me became harder still."<ref>O'Brien Chang, Kevin; Chen, Wayne. ''Reggae Routes''. Philadelphia: Temple University, 1998. pp. 207 {{ISBN|1-56639-629-8}}.</ref>

The following year brought the smash hit album ''Where There Is Life'' for [[Chris Blackwell|Chris Blackwell's]] label [[Island Records|Island Jamaica]]. It contained such hits as "It's Me Again Jah" (a no. 1 single in Jamaica), "Who Could It Be", as well as the title track.<ref name="Thompson" /> He recorded a second album for Island Jamaica in 1997 entitled ''The Messenger'' (largely compiled from his hit singles), whose title track earned him his enduring nickname.<ref>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20011119/star/star2.html Luciano to speak at International Men's Day function] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913045321/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20011119/star/star2.html |date=13 September 2012 }}. ''Jamaica Gleaner''. 19 November 2001. Retrieved 6 April 2011.</ref>

The majority of his recording in the mid-to-late 1990s was for Burrell and the [[Xterminator]] label, which by that time included such artists as [[Sizzla]], Mikey General and Firehouse Crew,<ref name=campbell/> as well as recordings from [[Capleton]] and [[Cocoa Tea]]. Along with the work on the two albums for Island Jamaica, the majority of Luciano hits produced by Burrell were featured on 1999's ''Sweep Over My Soul''. Burrell and Luciano parted ways in 1999.<ref name=vanpelt>Van Pelt, Carter. [http://incolor.inetnebr.com/cvanpelt/lucianoint.html Luciano Interview]. inetnebr.com. 1999. Retrieved 26 March 2011.</ref>

By 2001, Luciano had released two live albums as well as two compilation albums alongside Sizzla and [[Anthony B]] after the split with Xterminator. That year saw the release of two new albums of material, ''Great Controversy'' on [[Jet Star (record distribution company)|Jet Star]] and ''A New Day'' on [[VP Records]]. The latter received a nomination for Best Reggae Album at the [[2002 Grammy Awards]], and was executive produced by longtime saxophonist and touring partner [[Dean Fraser]]. The album received additional production from [[Sly & Robbie]] and was backed by Fraser and the Firehouse Crew.<ref name=Moody>Moody, Shelah.

Fraser continued to produce many of Luciano's albums throughout the decade, including 2008's ''Jah Is My Navigator''. In 2010, he released ''United States of Africa''. While the previous album had focused mostly on God, ''Africa'' dealt with global events. Of this, Luciano stated, "We're not just singing about Zion and all those glorious dreams. We're also dealing with issues that affect the people, their very minds."<ref name=united>{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Angus | url=http://unitedreggae.com/articles/n453/090710/interview-luciano|title= Interview: Luciano | publisher=UnitedReggae.com | date=7 September 2010 | access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref>

He was awarded the [[Order of Distinction]] in the rank of Officer on 15 October 2007, in recognition of his contribution to reggae music.<ref>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/lifestyle/html/20071015T230000-0500_128382_OBS_ARTISTES_PRESENTED_WITH_NATIONAL_AWARDS.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016131400/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/lifestyle/html/20071015T230000-0500_128382_OBS_ARTISTES_PRESENTED_WITH_NATIONAL_AWARDS.asp |date=16 October 2007 }}</ref>

In July 2009, Luciano paid his respects to fellow musician [[Michael Jackson]] by releasing a reggae tribute (on Lioni Records) of Jackson's iconic [[USA for Africa]] charity song, "[[We are the World]]".

Luciano's album ''Zion Awake'' was nominated for Best Reggae Album at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards#Reggae|58th Annual Grammy Awards]].

==Beliefs==
Luciano is a devout [[Rastafarian]], whose lyrics promote consciousness and eschew [[slackness]], or vulgarity, which is often prominent in reggae and dancehall music. He has criticized other Rastafarian reggae artists who record slackness material, describing them as having lost focus.<ref name=williams>Williams, Leighton. [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20030406/ent/ent3.html Luciano defends ganja, serves Jah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007014228/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20030406/ent/ent3.html |date=7 October 2012 }}. ''Jamaica Gleaner''. 6 April 2003.</ref> The singer himself has sometimes been criticized for the reading of Biblical verses prior to performances, which has been described as inappropriate.<ref name=williams/>

The singer is also an activist in the promotion of ganja, or marijuana, stating: "I'm not fighting for the decriminalisation of ganja, because it was never a criminal. My fight is to enlighten the people of the cannabis and let them know of the herbal properties and the benefits we can achieve from it."<ref name=williams/>

==Personal life==
In 2010, Luciano was reportedly given a tract of land for residence in the [[Gambia]] at the bequest of President Alhaji Dr [[Yahya Jammeh]].<ref>[http://www.dancehallreggaeworld.com/luciano-gets-house-and-land-in-gambia.html Luciano gets house and land in Gambia]. Dancehallreggaeworld.com. Retrieved 5 April 2011.</ref> The singer first performed in the country in 2001,<ref name=Moody/> and has stated his preference for eventually residing in Africa.<ref name=united/>

On 27 February 2016, Luciano's son Menelik McClymont was stabbed to death at the age of 19, in the vicinity of Parkington Plaza on Half-Way-Tree Road, St Andrew, Jamaica. He died of his wounds in hospital on 28 February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Luciano-s-son-killed-in-Kingston_53200|title=Luciano's son killed in Kingston – Entertainment|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref>
