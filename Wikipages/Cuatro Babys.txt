==Controversy==

A petition was posted on [[Change.org]] demanding for the removal of the song from digital platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7603779/maluma-cuatro-babys-petition-response|title=Maluma Responds to Online Petition Against His Song 'Cuatro Babys'|work=Billboard|access-date=16 April 2018}}</ref> Despite this controversy, the popularity of "Cuatro Babys" has only risen with the song having gone quadruple Platinum. Because of this, Latin trap has had a large, but primarily underground, following.
