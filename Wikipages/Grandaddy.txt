'''Grandaddy''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], [[California]]. The group was formed in 1992, and featured [[Jason Lytle]], Aaron Burtch, [[Jim Fairchild]], Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden, until Garcia's death in 2017 following a [[stroke]].

After several self-released records and [[Cassette tape|cassettes]], the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the [[V2 Records]] subsidiary [[Big Cat Records]] in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios.

Grandaddy released four studio albums before splitting in 2006, with band members going on to solo careers and other projects. Grandaddy reformed in 2012, made a number of live appearances and released its fifth studio album, ''[[Last Place (album)|Last Place]]'', in March 2017.

In 1997 they released their debut full-length album ''[[Under the Western Freeway]]'' through Will, and, with the help of [[Howe Gelb]], signed a UK deal with [[Big Cat Records]]&nbsp;– by then a subsidiary of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[V2 Records]]&nbsp;– who reissued the album the following year.<ref name="Barton" /><ref name="Strong 1"/> The album included the single "[[A.M. 180]]", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film ''[[28 Days Later]]''.

=== 1998-2005: V2 record deal and mainstream success ===

Unhappy with the efforts of Will Records, the band signed a worldwide deal with V2 Records in 1999, their first release on the label being the ''[[Signal to Snow Ratio]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in September that year.<ref name="Barton" /> In May 2000 they released their second album, ''[[The Sophtware Slump]]'', to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-sophtware-slump/grandaddy |title=The Sophtware Slump Reviews – Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308172943/http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-sophtware-slump/grandaddy |archive-date=March 8, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> ''NME'' later placed it at number 34 in their "Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade", and ''[[The Independent]]'' described it as "easily the equal of ''[[OK Computer]]''".<ref name="Buckley" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/the-top-100-greatest-albums-of-the-decade/158049/page/7 |title=The Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade nme.com |work=[[NME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811153904/http://www.nme.com/list/the-top-100-greatest-albums-of-the-decade/158049/page/7 |archive-date=August 11, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> The album reached number 36 on the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="Strong 1"/> and the band's fanbase increased, including celebrities such as [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Moss]] and [[Liv Tyler]].<ref name="Martin" /> By early 2001 the album had sold 80,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="Martin" /> The first single from the album, "[[The Crystal Lake]]", became the band's first UK top 40 single when it was reissued in 2001.<ref name="Strong 1"/>

Around the time that ''The Sophtware Slump'' was released, Grandaddy was invited to open for [[Elliott Smith]] on his tour for ''[[Figure 8 (album)|Figure 8]]''.<ref name="Martin"/> On some nights, Smith would join Grandaddy onstage and sing lead vocals on portions of "He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot".<ref>{{cite web|last=Diver |first=Mike |date=June 28, 2006 |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/951696-grandaddy-from-beyond-the-grave--jason-lytle-talks-to-dis |title=Grandaddy, From Beyond the Grave: Jason Lytle Talks to DiS / In Depth // Drowned in Sound |work=[[Drowned in Sound]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080253/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/951696-grandaddy-from-beyond-the-grave--jason-lytle-talks-to-dis |archive-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> The band later opened for [[Coldplay]] on their US tour in mid-2001.<ref name="WhiteWill">{{cite news|last=White |first=Will |date=June 19, 2001 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Coldplay-rises-above-sound-problems-at-Benaroya-1057608.php |title=Coldplay Rises Above Sound Problems at Benaroya – seattlepi.com |work=seattlepi.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220921/http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Coldplay-rises-above-sound-problems-at-Benaroya-1057608.php |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Also in 2001, the band's version of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" was used in the film ''[[I Am Sam]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hoskins |first=Roger W. |date=December 7, 2001 |title=Grandaddy's Lytle Sparks a 'Revolution' for Film |newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee|Modesto Bee]] |page=H3}}</ref>

Their third album, ''[[Sumday]]'', recorded in Lytle's home studio, was released in 2003.

=== 2006-2011: Breakup and post-Grandaddy activities ===

In January 2006, after a meeting the previous month, Lytle announced that the band had decided to split up, citing the lack of financial income from being in the group.<ref name="NME">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/grandaddy-12-1356930 |title=Exclusive – Grandaddy Split nme.com |date=January 27, 2006 |work=[[NME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708171604/http://www.nme.com/news/grandaddy/22068 |archive-date=July 8, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> ''Just Like the Fambly Cat'' was released later that year as a farewell album. Lytle spoke to the ''[[NME]]'':

<blockquote>It was inevitable&nbsp;... On one hand our stubbornness has paid off, but on the other hand refusing to buy into the way things are traditionally supposed to be done has made things worse for us&nbsp;... The realistic part is it hasn't proved to be a huge money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band.<ref name="NME"/></blockquote>

Lytle had called the meeting in a hotel in Modesto, and it was the first time the band had been in a room together for two years.<ref name="Barton" /> The feeling at the meeting was described by Lytle as frustration, the result of a breakdown in communication among the band members.<ref name="NME" /> According to Lytle the decision was not a surprise:

<blockquote>Everybody knew, but we needed to make it formal, we needed to make it official. We needed to pay some respects to what we've done, just make it real.<ref name="Barton" /></blockquote>

Lytle also stated that he was "burnt out on touring" and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol problems as a factor in the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was "a bit of a loner", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: "The main thing is not having four girlfriends to lug around with me all the time."<ref name="Allen">{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Dustin |date=February 11, 2009 |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2009/02/grandaddys-jason-lytle-ages-in-reverse/ |title=Grandaddy's Jason Lytle Ages in Reverse American Songwriter |work=American Songwriter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111200721/http://americansongwriter.com/2009/02/grandaddys-jason-lytle-ages-in-reverse/ |archive-date=November 11, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Righi |first=Len |date=July 15, 2006 |title=With Grandaddy Gone, Jason Lytle Puts His Cards on the Table |journal=[[The Morning Call]] |page=D5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/grandaddy-5-1312910 |title=Jason Lytle Reveals Why Grandaddy Split nme.com |work=[[NME]] |date=20 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019155755/http://www.nme.com/news/music/grandaddy-5-1312910 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref>

===2012-2013: Reunion===

In March 2012, it was announced that Grandaddy had reformed and were to play a limited number of shows, including London on September 4, and headlining the [[End of the Road Festival]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/grandaddy/62372 |title=Grandaddy Reform to Headline End of the Road Festival – Ticket Details nme.com |date=March 2, 2012 |work=[[NME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001502/http://www.nme.com/news/grandaddy/62372 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Grandaddy also played San Francisco's [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival]] and Paris's [[Rock en Seine]] Festival in August 2012. On August 7, 2012, to kick off their reunion tour, they played a "secret" show at the Partisan venue in Merced, California, but were billed as "[[The Arm of Roger]]". The next day they played as Grandaddy at the Henry Miller Library, [[Big Sur]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/08/watch-grandaddys-first-show-in-six-years/ |last=Larson |first=Jeremy D. |title=Watch Grandaddy's first show in six years |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=August 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907195055/http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/08/watch-grandaddys-first-show-in-six-years/ |archive-date=September 7, 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref>

Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, "The bargain I made myself regarding the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna talk too much about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's the good thing about festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backstagerider.com/2012/03/03/grandaddy-reunion/ |title=The Backstage Rider– The Scoop on the Grandaddy Reunion – From the Mouth of Jason Lytle (+ Solo Album News) |date=15 August 2012 |work=Backstage Rider |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117113526/http://backstagerider.com/2012/03/03/grandaddy-reunion/ |archive-date=17 January 2013 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref>

Lytle later noted, "It was actually Jim [Fairchild]'s fault. He suggested that we consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [but] he convinced me it might be a good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [and] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.&nbsp;... I was actually blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together."<ref name="shakenstir">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakenstir.co.uk/index.php/reviews/grandaddy-last-place-review/reviews/32674/2/ |title=Grandaddy ''Last Place'' Review |date=n.d. |work=Shakenstir |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308221255/http://www.shakenstir.co.uk/index.php/reviews/grandaddy-last-place-review/reviews/32674/2/ |archive-date=March 8, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref>

Lytle also noted that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, "It's probably going to happen.&nbsp;... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [solo] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [it would be] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I like the idea of that. I'd like to give it a shot."<ref name="shakenstir"/> In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going to get out there and tour in support of it?'&nbsp;... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4145993-how-to-disappear-completely--jason-lytle-talks-grandaddy-solo-exploits-and-sadness |title=How to Disappear Completely: Jason Lytle Talks Grandaddy, Solo Exploits and Sadness / In Depth // Drowned in Sound |date=February 5, 2013 |work=[[Drowned in Sound]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508114812/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4145993-how-to-disappear-completely--jason-lytle-talks-grandaddy-solo-exploits-and-sadness |archive-date=May 8, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2017 }}</ref>

===2020-present: ''The Sophtware Slump...on a wooden piano'' 20th anniversary edition and future===

On August 28th 2020 it was announced that Grandaddy would release their 2000 album ''[[The Sophtware Slump]]'' in a 20th anniversary edition but with a twist--the whole album being performed by Jason Lytle with piano and no other instruments. The album was initially recorded during lockdown by Jason Lytle and was released in November 2020.

In October 2020, Lytle confirmed that he had plans to record a sixth (and possibly final) Grandaddy album: "I'm working on a solo LP, then I'm gonna do another Grandaddy record. I'm gonna go big on the Grandaddy; I want it to be this all-encompassing, cool send-off. I have life plans that don't involve playing live.

Lytle has cited both The Beatles and E.L.O. as influences, stating in 2003: "I'm completely in tune with E.L.O. and Jeff Lynne – I know that guy like the back of my hand."<ref name="Lanham">{{cite journal |last=Lanham |first=Tom |date=July 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ykEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22jason+lytle%22+sewage&pg=PA26 |title=The Sounds of Silence |journal=[[CMJ|CMJ New Music Monthly]] |page=26 |access-date=February 14, 2012}}</ref> He stated in 2009: "I think the majority of my musical influences were set in stone when I was five or six years old."<ref name="Allen" /> Lytle's vocals have drawn comparisons with [[Neil Young]].<ref name="Eliscu" /><ref name="WhiteWill" /><ref name="Taylor" />

=== Lyrical themes ===

Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for [[PopMatters]], described the lyrics on ''The Sophtware Slump'' as "one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral".<ref name="Begrand" /> Ben Sisario of ''The New York Times'' stated that the band "provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen".<ref name="Sisario" /> Ross Raihala, reviewing ''Sumday'' for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', identified what he called Lytle's "geeky identification with technology".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Raihala |first=Ross |date=August 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gxaz3RhzGKoC&q=grandaddy+lytle&pg=PA116 |title=Grandaddy ''Sumday'' |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |page=116 |access-date=February 14, 2012}}</ref> On ''The Sophtware Slump'', [[CMJ]] writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's "sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape".<ref name="Martin" /> Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating "I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects" and how the song "I'm on Standby" is about Lytle relating to a [[mobile phone]]: "I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'".<ref name="Lanham"/>

Lytle said of the tracks on ''Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla'': "For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment."<ref name="Kaufman" /> He stated in 2001: "I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it."<ref name="Martin" />

There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, "[[Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland]]", which was also included on the charity compilation ''[[It's a Cool Cool Christmas]]'', described by [[AllMusic]]<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Tim DiGravina as possibly "the funniest song from 2000".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/its-a-cool-cool-christmas-r509239/review |title=It's a Cool Cool Christmas – Various Artists : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=DiGravina |first=Tim |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423075113/http://www.allmusic.com/album/its-a-cool-cool-christmas-r509239/review |archive-date=April 23, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=March 9, 2017 }}</ref>

== Recording techniques ==

The band's releases were generally recorded and mixed in makeshift studios based in homes, garages and warehouses, although the last two albums were mixed in a dedicated facility.<ref name="Slade">{{cite book |last=Slade |first=Nicola |year=2007 |title=How to Make Music in Your Bedroom |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=978-0-7535-1264-7 |pages=16–20}}</ref> Although live performances used a full band, much of the recordings were done by Lytle alone using analog recorders and [[Pro Tools]].<ref name="Slade" /> He recorded basic drum tracks in a soundproofed room and overdubbed cymbals and tom toms.<ref name="Slade" /> He recorded his vocals close to the strings of a piano for what he described as a "ghostly effect".<ref name="Slade" />

Lytle described how the Grandaddy recordings became more of a solo effort, and the right conditions for recording:

<blockquote>Earlier on I tried to include people as much as possible. Then I realised the magic is me really prying stuff out of my head and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.<ref name="Barton" /></blockquote>
