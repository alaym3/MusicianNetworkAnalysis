'''Nicholas Rodney Drake''' (19 June 1948&nbsp;– 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter known for his [[acoustic guitar]]-based songs. He did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has gradually achieved wider notice and recognition.<ref name="VH1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/drake_nick/artist.jhtml|title=Nick Drake— Biography|publisher=VH1.com|date=2005|access-date=2 September 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3604905.stm Brad Pitt fronts Nick Drake show]" ''BBC.co.uk.'', 2004.

''Mojo Magazine'', January 2000.</ref> Drake signed to [[Island Records]] when he was 20 years old and a student at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He released his debut album, ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'', in 1969. He recorded two more albums—''[[Bryter Layter]]'' (1971) and ''[[Pink Moon]]'' (1972). Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release.<ref>However, a [[BBC]] article by Mark Moxon from 14 January 2002 states that "The album only sold 15,000 copies, which was enough to please the record company, but nothing like the success Nick was hoping for".[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A662924]</ref> His reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. There is no known video footage of the adult Drake; he was only ever captured in still photographs and in home footage from his childhood.<ref name=ASTF/>

Drake suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]], particularly during the latter part of his life, a fact often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's ''Pink Moon'', he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural [[Warwickshire]]. On 25 November 1974, Drake died from an overdose of [[amitriptyline]], a prescribed [[antidepressant]]; he was 26 years old. Whether his death was an accident or suicide has not been resolved.

Drake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album ''[[Fruit Tree (Nick Drake album)|Fruit Tree]]'' allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. By the mid-1980s, Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] and [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M.]] In 1985, [[The Dream Academy]] reached the UK and US charts with "[[Life in a Northern Town]]", a song written for and dedicated to Drake.<ref>McNair, James.

''[[The Independent]]'', 26 March 1999.</ref> By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of "doomed romantic" musician in the UK music press and was frequently cited as an influence by artists including [[Kate Bush]], [[Paul Weller]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Beck]], and [[The Black Crowes]].<ref name=":1"/> His first biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film ''A Stranger Among Us''.

==1948–1966: Early life==
Drake's father, Rodney Shuttleworth Drake (1908–1988), moved to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], in the early 1930s as an engineer with the [[Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation]].<ref>Dann (2006), p. 75.</ref> In 1934, Rodney met [[Molly Drake|Molly Lloyd]] (1916–1993), the daughter of a senior member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. Rodney proposed in 1936, though they had to wait a year until she turned 21 before her family allowed them to marry.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 76.</ref> Nick was born in 1948.<ref name="VH1"/> In 1950 the family returned to England to live in [[Warwickshire]]<ref>[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, M.]] [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=104 "The Sad Ballad of Nick Drake"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' (UK), 12 July 1997; retrieved 31 January 2007.</ref> at their home, Far Leys, in [[Tanworth-in-Arden]], south of [[Birmingham]], where Rodney worked from 1952 as the chairman and managing director of [[Wolseley plc|Wolseley Engineering]].<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 83–84.</ref>

Nick's older sister, [[Gabrielle Drake|Gabrielle]], became a successful screen actress. Both parents wrote music. Recordings of Molly's songs, which have come to light since her death, are similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son;<ref name=ASTF>Berkvens, Jeroen, ''A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake'' (video documentary). Roxie Releasing, 2000.</ref> they shared a similar fragile vocal delivery, and Gabrielle and biographer [[Trevor Dann]] noted a parallel foreboding and [[fatalism]] in their music.<ref name=ASTF/><ref>Dann (2006), p. 91.</ref> Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano at an early age and began to compose songs which he recorded on a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]] that she kept in the family drawing room.<ref name="Macdonald"/>

In 1957, Drake was sent to [[Eagle House School]], a preparatory [[boarding school]] near [[Sandhurst, Berkshire]]. Five years later, he went to [[Marlborough College]], a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] in Wiltshire which had also been attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished 100- and 200-yard sprinter, representing the school's Open Team in 1966. He played [[Rugby football|rugby]] for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms.<ref>Marlborough College archives.</ref> School friends recall Drake as having been confident, often aloof, and "quietly authoritative".<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 95, 97.</ref> His father remembered: "In one of his reports [the headmaster] said that none of us seemed to know him very well. All the way through with Nick, people didn't know him very much."<ref name="Paphides1"/>

Drake played piano in the school orchestra, and learned [[clarinet]] and saxophone. He formed a band, the Perfumed Gardeners, with four schoolmates in 1964 or 1965. With Drake on piano and occasional [[Alto saxophone|alto sax]] and vocals, the group performed [[Pye International Records|Pye International R&B]] covers and jazz standards, as well as [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] and [[Manfred Mann]] songs. [[Chris de Burgh]] asked to join the band, but was rejected as his taste was "too poppy".<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 36.</ref>

Drake's attention to his studies deteriorated and, although he had accelerated a year in Eagle House, at Marlborough he neglected his studies in favour of music. In 1963 he attained seven [[General Certificate of Education|GCE O-Levels]], fewer than his teachers had been expecting, failing "Physics with Chemistry".<ref>Dann (2006), p. 100.</ref> In 1965, Drake paid £13 ({{Inflation|UK|13|1965|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for his first acoustic guitar, a [[Levin (guitar company)|Levin]], and was soon experimenting with [[open tuning]] and [[finger-picking]] techniques.<ref name="McGrath">McGrath, T.J. "Darkness Can Give You the Brightest Light", ''[[Dirty Linen]]'', Issue 42, October/November 1992.</ref>

In 1966 Drake enrolled at a [[Cram school|tutorial college]] in [[Five Ways, Birmingham]], where he won a scholarship to study at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]].<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 110–111.</ref> He delayed attendance to spend six months at the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix-Marseille]], France, beginning in February 1967, where he began to practise guitar in earnest. To earn money, he would [[busking|busk]] with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and he travelled with friends to Morocco; according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, "that was where you got the best pot".<ref>Dann (2006), p. 124.</ref> He most likely began using [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] while in Aix,<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 51–52.</ref> and lyrics written during this period—in particular for "Clothes of Sand"— suggest an interest in [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogens]].<ref>Dann (2006), p. 123.</ref>

==1967–1969: Cambridge==
Drake returned to England in 1967 and moved into his sister's flat in [[Hampstead]], [[London]]. That October, he enrolled at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]]<ref name=telegraph/> to study [[English Literature]]. His tutors found him bright but unenthusiastic and unwilling to apply himself.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 28.</ref> His biographer, [[Trevor Dann]], notes that he had difficulty connecting with staff and fellow students, and that matriculation photographs from this time portray a sullen young man.<ref name="d25"/> Cambridge placed emphasis on its [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]] teams, but by this time Drake had lost interest in sport, preferring to stay in his college room smoking cannabis and playing music. According to fellow student Brian Wells, "they were the rugger buggers and we were the cool people smoking dope".<ref name="d25">Dann (2006), p. 25</ref>

In September 1967, Drake met [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]], a music student who went on to write many of the string and woodwind arrangements for Drake's first two albums.<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 40–43.</ref> By this time, Drake had discovered the British and American [[folk music]] scenes, and was influenced by performers such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Donovan]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Josh White]] and [[Phil Ochs]]. He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London, and in February 1968, while playing support to [[Country Joe and the Fish]] at [[Roundhouse (venue)|the Roundhouse]] in [[Camden Town]], made an impression on [[Ashley Hutchings]], bass player with [[Fairport Convention]].<ref name="Chronology">"[http://www.uow.edu.au/~morgan/drake2.htm Nick Drake—Chronology"]. Retrieved 11 November 2006.</ref> Hutchings recalls being impressed by Drake's guitar skill, but even more so by his image: "He looked like a star. He looked wonderful, he seemed to be 7 ft [tall]."<ref name="Paphides">{{cite web|last=Paphides|first=Peter|title=Like A Heart with Legs On|publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|The Western Mail]]|date=21 May 2004|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5008063651|via=|access-date=|url-access=|archive-date=15 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213051/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5008063651|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hutchings introduced Drake to the 25-year-old American producer [[Joe Boyd]], owner of the production and management company [[Witchseason Productions]], which at the time was licensed to [[Island Records]].<ref name="Paphides1">Paphides, Peter. [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1200107,00.html "Stranger to the world"], Guardian.co.uk, 25 April 2004; retrieved 1 February 2007.</ref> Boyd, who had discovered Fairport Convention and introduced [[John Martyn]] and the [[The Incredible String Band|Incredible String Band]] to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene.<ref name="Paphides"/> He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and Boyd acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. Impressed by a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track]] demo recorded in Drake's college room in early 1968, Boyd offered Drake a management, publishing, and production contract. Boyd later said that "in those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [to me] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, "I'd like to make a record." He stammered, "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." Nick was a man of few words.<ref name="Paphides"/> According to Drake's friend Paul Wheeler, Drake had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge and was excited by the contract.<ref name="Paphides"/>

==Career==

===''Five Leaves Left'' (1969)===
Drake recorded his debut album ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'' later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. He had to skip lectures to travel by train to the sessions in [[Sound Techniques (studio)|Sound Techniques studio]], London. Inspired by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]]'s production of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s album ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'', Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, "with no shiny pop [[reverb effect|reverb]]".<ref name="b192">Boyd (2006), p. 192.</ref> He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, "without overwhelming&nbsp;... or sounding cheesy".<ref name="b192"/> To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London [[folk rock]] scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] bassist [[Danny Thompson]] (no relation).<ref>Rosen, Dave. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014082115/http://inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/drake.htm Five Leaves Left], ''Ink Blot Magazine''. Retrieved 2 March 2014.</ref>

Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their ''[[Unhalfbricking]]'' album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of [[George Martin]]'s approach of using the [[studio as an instrument]], while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann observed that Drake appears "tight and anxious" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation.<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 59–60.</ref> Both were unhappy with arranger [[Richard Anthony Hewson]]'s contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 60.</ref> Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial.<ref>Boyd (2006), p. 194.</ref> Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs.<ref name="Paphides1"/> While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece "[[River Man]]", which echoed the tone of [[Frederick Delius]], was orchestrated by the veteran composer [[Harry Robertson (musician)|Harry Robertson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Chris|title=Review of Nick Drake's Five Leaves Left|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3g54/|website=BBC News|date=2007}}</ref>
{{listen|filename=|title="River Man"|description="River Man" is noted for its 5/4 time, harmonic changes and use of [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]]. An early solo acoustic version recorded in Drake's Cambridge college bedroom appears on the 2004 compilation ''[[Made to Love Magic]]''.<ref>Fitzsimmons, Mick. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/cnhj "Nick Drake, Made to Love Magic"], BBC.co.uk; retrieved 1 February 2007.</ref>}}

[[Post-production]] difficulties delayed the release by several months, and the album was poorly marketed and supported.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 133.</ref> In July, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described ''Five Leaves Left'' as "poetic" and "interesting", though ''[[NME]]'' wrote in October that there was "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining".<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 101–02.</ref> It received little radio play outside shows by more progressive BBC DJs such as [[John Peel]]<ref>Boyd (2006), p. 197.</ref> and [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]]. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 134.</ref> In an interview, his sister Gabrielle said: "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!"<ref name="Paphides1"/>

===''Bryter Layter'' (1971)===
Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation and in late 1969 moved to London. His father remembered "writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge&nbsp;... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want."<ref name=ASTF/> Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's [[Kensington]] flat but usually sleeping on friends' sofas and floors.<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 107–08.</ref> Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor [[bedsit]] in [[Belsize Park]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]].<ref>Dann (2006), p. 141.</ref>

On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the [[BBC]]'s [[John Peel]] show ("Cello Song", "Three Hours", "River Man", "Time of No Reply" and an early version of "Bryter Layter"), three of which were broadcast the following night. A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer [[Michael Chapman (singer)|Michael Chapman]] said of the performances:<blockquote>The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig!<ref name="Chronology"/></blockquote>

{{listen|filename=|title="Northern Sky"|description="[[Northern Sky]]" features piano, organ, and [[celesta]] performed by [[John Cale]].}} 
The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.<ref name="Sandall">Sandall, Robert. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3617296/Brighter-very-much-later.html "Brighter Very Much Later"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 20 May 2004; retrieved 31 January 2007.</ref> Although ''Five Leaves Left'' attracted little publicity, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, ''[[Bryter Layter]]'' (1971),<ref name="autogenerated1">Drake, Gabrielle, ''Nick Drake: Remembered For A While'', Little, Brown and Co., 2014.</ref> again produced by Boyd and engineered by [[John Wood (record producer)|John Wood]], introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.<ref name="Unterberger">Unterberger, Richie.

''New York Times'', 22 August 1986.</ref> Disappointed by his debut's poor sales, Drake sought to move away from his [[pastoral]] sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. "It was more of a pop sound, I suppose," Boyd later said. "I imagined it as more commercial."<ref>Dann (2006), p. 142.</ref> Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from [[John Cale]] on two songs: "[[Northern Sky]]" and "Fly". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of "Northern Sky" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 242.</ref> Cale used heroin during this period,<ref>Cale (1999), p. 128.</ref> and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.<ref name="Hunt">Hunt, Rupert. [http://www.nickdrake.com/nick_life_in_quotes.html "Nick Drake—Life and Music in Quotes"], Nickdrake.com; retrieved 2 September 2006.</ref>

''Bryter Layter'' was a commercial failure, and reviews were again mixed; ''[[Record Mirror]]'' praised Drake as a "beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements", but ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described the album as "an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz".<ref name="Sandall"/> Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records and moved to Los Angeles to work with [[Warner Brothers]] to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at [[North East Surrey College Of Technology|Ewell Technical College]], Surrey. [[Ralph McTell]], who also performed that night, remembered: "Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it."<ref>Macaulay, Stephen. [http://www.gloriousnoise.com/articles/2006/nick_drake_bartleby_the_musici.php "Nick Drake—Bartleby the Musician"], gloriousnoise.com; accessed 1 November 2016.<br> His discomfort grew sufficiently for him to unexpectedly leave the tour, after only a couple scheduled dates. ''Glorious Noise'', 2 October 2006; retrieved 2 February 2007.</ref>

In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a [[psychiatrist]] at St Thomas' Hospital, London. He was prescribed [[antidepressant]]s, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends.<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 166.</ref> He worried about their side effects and was concerned that they would react with his regular cannabis use.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 166.</ref> Island Records urged Drake to promote ''Bryter Layter'' through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as "unbelievable amounts" of cannabis<ref>Kirby, Robert. Quoted in Dann (2006), p. 157.</ref> and exhibiting "the first signs of [[psychosis]]", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to ''Bryter Layter'', he turned inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs.<ref name=":2"/> According to photographer Keith Morris, by 1971 Drake was a "hunched, dishevelled figure, staring vacantly...ignoring the overtures of a friendly labrador or gazing blankly over Hampstead Heath."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feay|first=Suzi|date=19 February 2006|title=Darker than the Deepest Sea: the search for Nick Drake by Trevor Dann|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/darker-than-the-deepest-sea-the-search-for-nick-drake-by-trevor-dann-6108836.html|access-date=27 June 2020|website=The Independent}}</ref> His sister recalled: "This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong."<ref name=":2">Dann (2006), p. 157.</ref>

===''Pink Moon'' (1972)===
Although Island neither expected nor wanted a third album,<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 168–170, 172.</ref> Drake approached Wood in October 1971 to begin work on what would be his final release. Sessions took place over two nights, with only Drake and Wood in the studio.<ref name="Macdonald"/> The bleak songs of ''[[Pink Moon]]'' are short, and the eleven-track album lasts only 28 minutes, a length described by Wood as "just about right. You really wouldn't want it to be any longer."<ref name="Paphides"/> Drake had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of ''Bryter Layter'', and believed that the string, brass and saxophone arrangements resulted in a sound that was "too full, too elaborate".<ref>Cooper, Colin.

Wood later said: "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything.

Drake delivered the tapes of ''Pink Moon'' to [[Chris Blackwell]] at Island Records, contrary to a popular legend which claims that he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without saying a word.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 170.</ref> An advertisement for the album in ''Melody Maker'' in February opened with "''Pink Moon''—Nick Drake's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished."<ref>Sandison, Dave.

In ''Zigzag'', Connor McKnight wrote: "Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."<ref>McKnight, Connor, "In search of Nick Drake", ''Zigzag Magazine'', #42, 1974.</ref>

Blackwell felt ''Pink Moon'' had the potential to bring Drake to a mainstream audience; however, his staff were disappointed by Drake's unwillingness to promote it. [[A&R]] manager [[Muff Winwood]] recalled "tearing his hair out" in frustration and said that without Blackwell's enthusiastic support "the rest of us would have given him the boot".<ref>Dann (2006), p. 162</ref> At Boyd's insistence, Drake agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of ''Sounds Magazine''.<ref>Gilbert, Jerry.

In the months following ''Pink Moon'''s release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant.<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 166–168.</ref> He returned to live at his parents' home in [[Tanworth-in-Arden]], and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. "I don't like it at home," he told his mother, "but I can't bear it anywhere else."<ref name=ASTF/> His return was often difficult for his family, as Gabrielle said: "Good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really."<ref name="Paphides"/>{{listen|filename=|title="Black Eyed Dog"|description="Black Eyed Dog" from one of Drake's final recording sessions in February 1974.

Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer from Island Records ({{Inflation|UK|20|1973|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.<ref name="NKent">{{cite news |last=Kent |first=Nick |author-link=Nick Kent |title=Requiem For A Solitary Man|work=[[NME|New Musical Express]]|date=8 February 1975}}</ref> He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."<ref>Dann (2006), p. 175.</ref> Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around."<ref>Dann (2006), p. 177.</ref>

[[John Martyn]] (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album ''[[Solid Air]]'' about Drake) described Drake in this period as the most withdrawn person he had ever met.<ref name="guardian">[https://www.theguardian.com/albums/Story/0,,209103,00.html "The alternative top 100"], ''Guardian Unlimited'' (1999); retrieved 3 September 2006.</ref> He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed.<ref>Boyd (2006), p. 259.</ref> During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.<ref name="barnes"/> Early in 1972, Drake had a [[nervous breakdown]], and was hospitalized for five weeks.<ref name="Hunt"/> He was initially believed to suffer from [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]], although his former therapist suggested he was suffering from [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/last-10-days-singer-songwriter-nick-8153684|title=The last 10 days of singer-songwriter Nick Drake's life are revealed in his father's heartbreaking diary|first=Paul|last=Cole|date=22 November 2014|access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>

In February 1973, Drake contacted John Wood, stating he was ready to begin work on a fourth album.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Boyd was in England at the time, and agreed to attend the recordings. The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at Drake's anger and bitterness: "[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years."<ref>Boyd (2006), pp. 259, 261.</ref> Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in Drake's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised Drake's spirits; his mother recalled, "We were so absolutely thrilled to think that Nick was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in Nick's life for years."<ref name="Hunt"/>

By late 1974, Drake's weekly retainer from Island had ceased, and his severe depression meant that he remained in contact with only a few close friends. He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968.<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 54, 183.</ref> Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as "the nearest thing" to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description "best (girl) friend".<ref>Dann (2006), p. 55.</ref> In a 2005 interview, Ryde said that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I never saw him again."<ref name="Brooks">"[http://www.uow.edu.au/~morgan/drake4.htm Heartbreak letter clue to death of cult singer"], "The Death of Nick Drake"; retrieved 14 December 2011.</ref> As with the relationship he had shared with fellow folk musician [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.<ref name="Brooks"/>

==Death==
During the early hours of 25 November 1974, Drake died at his home from an overdose of [[amitriptyline]], an [[tricyclic antidepressant|antidepressant]]. He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".<ref>Dann (2006), p. 184.</ref>{{Clarify|reason=who said it was to help him sleep? did Drake say this or was this the family's supposition?|date=September 2020}}

Drake had been accustomed to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. His mother later said: "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs."<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 213–14.</ref> There was no [[suicide note]], although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 187.</ref>
[[File:Grave of Nick Drake.jpg|upright|thumb|The grave where Drake's ashes are buried with those of his parents.<ref name=gab/> The gravestone is inscribed with the [[epitaph]] "Now we rise / And we are everywhere", taken from the lyrics of "From the Morning", the final song on Drake's final album, ''[[Pink Moon]]''.<ref name=gab>Drake, Gabrielle. [http://www.brytermusic.com/molly-drake Molly Drake profile], BryterMusic.com (2012).</ref>|alt=]]

At the inquest in December, the coroner stated that the cause of death was "Acute amitriptyline poisoning—self-administered when suffering from a depressive illness", and concluded a verdict of suicide. Although the verdict has been disputed by some of his friends and members of his family,<ref name="VH1"/><ref name=telegraph>Brown, M., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/11250728/Nick-Drake-the-fragile-genius.html "Nick Drake: the fragile genius"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 25 November 2014.</ref> there is a widely held view that, accidental or not, Drake had by then "given up on life".<ref name="Sandall"/> Rodney described his son's death as unexpected and extraordinary; however, in a 1979 interview he said he had been "worried about Nick being so depressed. We used to hide away the aspirin and pills and things like that."<ref name="Brooks"/>

Boyd recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death".<ref>Boyd (2006), pp. 260–61.</ref> Writing in 1975, ''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Nick Kent]] commented on the irony of Drake's death at a time when he had just begun to regain a sense of "personal balance".<ref name="NKent"/> In contrast, Gabrielle said "I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That would seem to me to be terrible: for it to be a plea for help that nobody hears."<ref name="Brooks"/>

On 2 December 1974, after a service in the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Tanworth-in-Arden, Drake's remains were cremated at [[Solihull]] Crematorium and his ashes interred under an oak tree in the church's graveyard.<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 215.</ref> The funeral was attended by around fifty mourners, including friends from Marlborough, Aix, Cambridge, London, Witchseason, and Tanworth.<ref name="Dann 2006, 193–194">Dann (2006), pp. 193–94.</ref> Referring to Drake's tendency to compartmentalise relationships, Brian Wells observed that many met each other for the first time that morning.<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 75.</ref> His mother recalled "a lot of his young friends came up here. We'd never met many of them."<ref name="Dann 2006, 193–194"/>

==Posthumous popularity==
There were no documentaries or compilation albums in the wake of Drake's death.<ref name="Dann 2006, 193–194"/> His public profile remained low throughout the 1970s, although his name appeared occasionally in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans at the family home. Island Records, following a 1975 ''NME'' article written by Nick Kent, stated they had no plans of repackaging Drake's albums,<ref name=h238>Humphries (1997), p. 238.</ref> but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the ''[[Fruit Tree (Nick Drake album)|Fruit Tree]]'' box set. The release compiled the three studio albums, the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974, and an extensive biography written by the American journalist [[Arthur Lubow]]. Although sales were poor, [[Island Records]] did not delete the albums from its catalogue.<ref name=h238/>

By the mid-1980s, Drake was being cited as an influence by musicians such as [[Kate Bush]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], the [[The Black Crowes|Black Crowes]],<ref name=":1">Dann (2006), 201</ref> [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M.]], and [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of the [[The Cure|Cure]]. The Cure's name derives from Drake's song "Time Has Told Me" ("a troubled cure for a troubled mind").<ref>Dann (2006), p. 197.</ref> Drake gained further exposure in 1985 with the release of the [[The Dream Academy|Dream Academy]]'s hit single "[[Life in a Northern Town]]", which included a dedication to Drake on its sleeve.<ref>Fitzsimmons, Mick.

On 20 June 1998, [[BBC Radio 2]] broadcast a documentary, ''Fruit Tree: The Nick Drake Story'', featuring interviews with Boyd, Wood, Gabrielle and Molly Drake, Paul Wheeler, Robert Kirby and Ashley Hutchings, and narrated by Danny Thompson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.algonet.se/~iguana/DRAKE/fruittreedoc.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304135906/http://www.algonet.se/~iguana/DRAKE/fruittreedoc.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 March 2000|title=Transcript of documentary reproduced on "The Nick Drake Files" website|publisher=algonet.se|access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref> In early 1999, [[BBC Two]] aired a 40-minute documentary, ''A Stranger Among Us—In Search of Nick Drake''. The following year, Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens released the documentary ''A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake'', featuring interviews with Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, Wood and Kirby. Later that year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' placed ''Bryter Layter'' number one in its "Alternative Top 100 Albums Ever" list.<ref name="guardian"/>

==Musical and lyrical style==
Drake was obsessive about practising his guitar technique, and would stay up through the night writing and experimenting with [[Scordatura|alternative tunings]]. His mother remembered hearing him "bumping around at all hours. I think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early morning hours."<ref name="McGrath"/> Self-taught,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/nick-drake-comes-to-life-in-film-197316/|title=Nick Drake Comes to Life in Film|last1=Sullivan|first1=Denise|date=6 March 2002|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> he achieved his guitar style through the use of alternative tunings to create [[Tone cluster|cluster chords]],<ref name="Frederick">Frederick, Robin. [http://www.robinfrederick.com/nd2.html "Nick Drake&nbsp;— A Place To Be"] (2001), RobinFrederick.com; retrieved 26 October 2006.</ref> which are difficult to achieve on a guitar using [[standard tuning]]. Similarly, many of his vocal melodies comfortably rest on the [[Extended chord|extensions]] of chords, not just on notes of the triad.<ref name="Frederick"/> He sang in the [[baritone]] range, often quietly and with little projection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/artists-that-owe-nick-drake-a-round/|work=[[Townsquare Media|Diffuser.fm]]|last=Levith|first=Will|title=10 Artists That Owe Nick Drake a Round|date=26 July 2013|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

Drake, who studied English literature at Cambridge, was drawn to the works of [[William Blake]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Henry Vaughan]], whose influences are reflected in his lyrics.<ref name="Macdonald"/> He also employed a series of elemental<ref name="RS PM">DeCurtis, Anthony. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/pink-moon-20000217 "Pink Moon"]. ''Rolling Stone'', 17 February 2000; retrieved 14 December 2011.</ref> symbols and codes, largely drawn from nature. The moon, stars, sea, rain, trees, sky, mist, and seasons are all commonly used, influenced in part by his rural upbringing. Images related to summer figure centrally in his early work; from ''Bryter Layter'' on, his language is more autumnal, evoking a season commonly used to convey senses of loss and sorrow.<ref name="Macdonald"/> Throughout, Drake writes with detachment, more as an observer than participant, a point of view ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone's]]'' [[Anthony DeCurtis]] described "as if he were viewing his life from a great, unbridgeable distance".<ref name="RS PM"/>

This perceived inability to connect has caused speculation about Drake's sexuality.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 217.</ref> Boyd has said he detects a [[virgin]]al quality in Drake's lyrics and music, and notes that he never knew of him behaving in a sexual way with anyone, male or female.<ref>Boyd (2006), p. 263.</ref> Kirby described Drake's lyrics as a "series of extremely vivid, complete observations, almost like a series of [[epigrammatic]] proverbs", though he doubts that Drake saw himself as "any sort of poet". Instead, Kirby believes that Drake's lyrics were crafted to "complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place".<ref name="NKent"/>

==Appraisal==
Drake received little critical success during his lifetime, but has since been widely acclaimed.<ref name="Xgau">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=26 March 2019|url=http://robertchristgau.com/xgausez.php?d=2019-03-26|title=Xgau Sez|website=robertchristgau.com|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> Based on professional rankings of his albums and songs, the aggregate website [[Acclaimed Music]] lists him as the 101st most acclaimed recording artist in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/artist/Nick%20Drake.htm|title=Nick Drake|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' included all three of his albums on its 2003 list of [[the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Holzman|first=Jake|date=21 August 2017|url=https://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/8-21-2017/the-understated-importance-of-nick-drake.html|title=The Understated Importance of Nick Drake|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=29 March 2019|archive-date=30 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330020557/https://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/8-21-2017/the-understated-importance-of-nick-drake.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 4 April 2018, he was inducted into the Folk Hall of Fame at the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=7 March 2018|title=Nick Drake enters folk hall of fame|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43315596|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref>

In 1994, ''Rolling Stone'' journalist Paul Evans said Drake's music "throbs with [an] aching beauty" similar to the 1968 Van Morrison album ''[[Astral Weeks]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Evans|first=Paul|date=29 December 1994|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/way-to-blue-an-introduction-to-nick-drake-124433/|title=Way To Blue: An Introduction To Nick Drake|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> According to [[AllMusic]] critic [[Richie Unterberger]], Drake was a "singular talent" who "produced several albums of chilling, somber beauty", now "recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre". Unterberger felt that Drake's following spanned generations "in the manner of the young [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets of the 19th century who died before their time ... [[Baby boomer]]s who missed him the first time around found much to revisit once they discovered him, and his pensive loneliness speaks directly to contemporary alternative rockers who share his sense of morose alienation."<ref name="Unterberger"/>

[[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981): "I'm not inclined to revere suicides. But Drake's jazzy folk-pop is admired by a lot of people who have no use for [[Kenny Rankin]], and I prefer to leave open the possibility that he's yet another English mystic (romantic?) I'm too set in my ways to hear." In 2019, Christgau conceded this was a "fairly audacious" appraisal and wrote: "Drake is admired and beloved by many, so many that I'm sure he was an artist of real originality and, for many, appeal ... Although there've been a few exceptions, I've never been attracted to hypersensitives or depressives, and Drake is both."<ref name="Xgau"/>
