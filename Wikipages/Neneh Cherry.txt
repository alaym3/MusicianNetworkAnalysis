== Early life and family ==
Cherry was born as Neneh Mariann Karlsson in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, the daughter of [[Moki Cherry|Monika "Moki" Karlsson]] (1943–2009), a Swedish painter and textile artist, and the musician Ahmadu Jah (1936–2018). Jah was born in [[Sierra Leone]], West Africa, the son of a [[tribal chief]], and went to Stockholm to study engineering at university.<ref name=Guardian-WhereBeen-2014>{{cite news|last=Mossman|first=Kate|title=Neneh Cherry, interview: 'People ask me where I've been for 18 years'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/23/neneh-cherry-blank-project-solo-album-interview|access-date=25 February 2014|work=The Guardian|date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

Cherry's parents separated early and her mother married the influential American [[jazz]] musician [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], who helped raise Cherry since birth. Cherry took her stepfather's surname.<ref name="GreatRockDiscog-2000"/> From her mother's side, Cherry also has a half-brother, musician [[Eagle-Eye Cherry]]. From stepfather Don Cherry's side, she has a stepsister, violinist Jan Cherry, and a stepbrother, jazz musician David Ornette Cherry. Through her father Ahmadu Jah's marriage to Maylen Jah (née Bergström), Cherry is the half-sister of singer [[Titiyo]] and record producer Cherno Jah.

Cherry's parents, Moki and Don Cherry, bought and converted an old schoolhouse in the countryside outside the small town of [[Hässleholm]] in Sweden in 1970.<ref name=BBC-Front-Row-2012 /> In the early 1970s, the family moved to the United States, when Don Cherry taught at [[Dartmouth College]].<ref name=SPIN-Blank-2014 /> Cherry dropped out of school at 14 and moved to London.<ref name=iD-2000>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Terry|title=200 for 2000 |url=http://www.smartsecondskin.com/download/id.pdf|work=ID Magazine|access-date=25 February 2014|author2=29 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185754/http://www.smartsecondskin.com/download/id.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2013| format=Issue 200|year=2000}}</ref>

==Music career==
=== Early career ===
Cherry moved to the United Kingdom when she was 15, in the midst of the punk era, and she remembers finding "her people" there. Cherry had met [[Tessa Pollitt]], [[Viv Albertine]] and [[Ari Up]] from [[The Slits]] earlier as her stepfather, Don Cherry, was touring with them and took the 15-year-old Neneh along.<ref name=3AM-Slits-2003>{{cite web|last=Whitfield|first=Gregory Mario|title=Gregory Mario Whitfield interviews Tessa Pollitt of The Slits|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/musicarchives/2003/nov/interview_tessa_pollitt.html|work=3 AM Magazine|access-date=25 February 2014|date=November 2003}}</ref> She and Ari lived in a [[Squatting|squat]] in [[Battersea]]. She felt at home, after ending up there because The Slits invited Don Cherry to go on tour with them with [[Prince Hammer]] and Creation Rebel.<ref name=BBC-Front-Row-2012 />

In London, Cherry joined the [[punk rock]] band The Cherries. She moved through several bands, including [[The Slits]], [[New Age Steppers]], [[Rip Rig + Panic]], and Float Up CP.<ref name=Guardian-Jazz-2012 /> She also DJ’d, playing early rap music on the reggae pirate [[Dread Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref name=Portobello-2006>{{cite web | last = Vague | first = Tom | title = Counter Culture Portobello Psychogeographical History | url = http://www.portobellofilmfestival.com/talkpics/talk-vague04.html | work = Portobello Film Festival | year = 2006}}</ref> Cherry has stated that she found her voice singing along with [[Poly Styrene]] from [[X-Ray Spex]].

=== Albums ===
==== ''Raw Like Sushi'' ====
{{Main|Raw Like Sushi}}
Cherry began a solo career in 1982 with "Stop the War", a [[protest song]] about the [[Falklands War]]. She worked with [[Jonny Dollar]], [[The The]] and [[Cameron McVey]] (aka Booga Bear), who co-wrote most of her 1989 debut album ''Raw Like Sushi'', and whom she later married.<ref name="GreatRockDiscog-2000"/> She was intimately involved in the [[Bristol Urban Culture]] scene, working as an arranger on [[Massive Attack]]'s ''[[Blue Lines]]'' album, through which she met Dollar. Both [[Robert Del Naja]] and [[Andrew Vowles]] of Massive Attack contributed to ''Raw Like Sushi''.

The single "[[Buffalo Stance]]" eventually peaked at number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="GreatRockDiscog-2000"/> and number 1 on the US Dance chart. More singles released between 1988 and 1990 included "Manchild", "[[Kisses on the Wind]]", "Heart", and "Inna City Mama". She also found success with "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]", a reworking of the [[Cole Porter]] song, which appeared on the ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' AIDS fundraising album. The single reached number 25 in the UK.<ref name="GreatRockDiscog-2000"/> Cherry was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 in the Best New Artist category (but lost to [[Milli Vanilli]] who eventually had their award revoked). She won a [[Brit Award]] in 1990 for ''Raw Like Sushi''.

Cherry caused a press furore when she performed "Buffalo Stance" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' while pregnant (with her second child, Tyson).<ref name=Guardian-Jazz-2012 />

==== ''Homebrew'' ====
{{Main|Homebrew (Neneh Cherry album)}}
Cherry's second album was 1992's ''Homebrew''. ''Homebrew'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessor.<ref name="GreatRockDiscog-2000"/> The album had some success on various ''Billboard'' charts with songs "[[Buddy X]]" and "Trout".

"Buddy X" reached number 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance Club Music Charts where it spent a total of 11 weeks. The track also spent some time on ''Billboard''′s Pop Songs Charts as well as the [[Hot 100]] Charts, where it peaked at number 22 during its 8-week run and peaked at number 43 in its 12-week run, respectively.

The music video for "Buddy X" earned Neneh Cherry an [[MTV]] [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA]] nomination at the ceremony in 1993 for the [[Best Female Video]] category, alongside [[Janet Jackson]], [[Annie Lennox]], and [[k.d. lang]], with lang winning the [[MTV Video Music Award|moonman]].

"Trout" features additional vocals by [[R.E.M.]] singer [[Michael Stipe]] who helped to co-write the track along with Cherry, McVey, and Jonathan Sharp and contains samples of a guitar riff from [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] as well as drums by [[John Bonham]]. With airplay on college radio and increased popularity, "Trout" spent a total of 14 weeks on ''Billboard''′s [[Alternative rock|Alternative Music]] Charts where it reached number 2.

''Homebrew'' also included the work of [[Geoff Barrow]] (on "Somedays"), who later became part of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].

Additional recognition was attributed to remixes of track "Buddy X". First was the 1993 remix by [[The Notorious B.I.G.|The Notorious BIG]], which is considered by some{{who|date=February 2020}} to be "one of the great Biggie rarities in the world."<ref name="Complex-interview-2014" /> Cherry stated that she and McVey picked up Biggie for the studio where they remained for the session. The song was completed in one take.<ref name="Complex-interview-2014" /> "Buddy X" found success yet again in the 1999 [[UK garage]] remix by [[Dreem Teem]].

"Move with Me" was co-written by Cherry, McVey and [[Lenny Kravitz]].<ref>Album booklet.</ref>

During a 1 June 2012 interview with [[Kirsty Lang]], broadcast as part of the [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]'' daily podcast, Cherry discussed the jazz-inspired album, saying that The Thing were inspired by Cherry's stepfather's work, but that the band makes this inspiration their own. "I think that we're taking it on, to another place. I think that's really important," Cherry said. One of the songs from the album, "Golden Heart", was written by Don Cherry; Christer Bothén, a musician who played with Don Cherry, was invited to play on the album, and brought the song to their attention.

The album includes tracks originally performed by an eclectic mix of artists, including hip-hop artist [[MF Doom]], [[Martina Topley-Bird]]<ref name=Guardian-Jazz-2012 /> [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], and [[The Stooges]]'.<ref name=BBC-Front-Row-2012>{{cite web |last=Lang|first=Kirsty|title=Neneh Cherry interviewed; the Transit of Venus in art |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01j6wsv|work=Front Row|publisher=BBC Radio 4|access-date=25 February 2014|format=radio podcast|date=1 June 2012}}</ref> Most of the tracks were recorded together live.<ref name=BBC-Front-Row-2012 />

== Musical style ==
Cherry said she has never really thought of herself as a rapper. She sees herself as a "singer that does a bit of rapping."<ref name=BBC6-FoundVoice />

Breaking into the U.S. music industry was not a positive experience for Cherry. She said that while "Buffalo Stance" gave her a mainstream crossover moment in the U.S. she found the American music industry stiflingly attached to labels and genre identities.<ref name=Pitchfork-interview-2014>{{cite web|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsay|title=Neneh Cherry|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9287-neneh-cherry/|work=Pitchfork|access-date=26 February 2014|date=10 January 2014}}</ref>

The Cherry-McVeys have lived throughout Europe. In 1993, they moved near [[Málaga, Spain]], and lived there until 1999. In 1995, they briefly lived in New York City. They bought a home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, New York. Soon after moving in, the couple was held up at gunpoint and robbed by a teenage hoodlum. The entire family packed up again and headed back to Berkley Grove in London's [[Primrose Hill]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

They next returned to Cherry's childhood home in Hässleholm, Sweden, living in the same schoolhouse turned home (featured in ''[[Homebrew (Neneh Cherry album)|Homebrew]]'' album artwork) in which Cherry was raised as a child.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
