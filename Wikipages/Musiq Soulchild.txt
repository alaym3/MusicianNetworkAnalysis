'''Taalib Johnson''', professionally known as '''Musiq Soulchild''' or simply '''Musiq''' ([[Homophone|pronounced just like]] "music"; born September 16, 1977<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Tony|title=Happy Birthday Noel Gourdin and Musiq Soulchild!|url=http://www.wdasfm.com/onair/tony-brown-the-quiet-storm-4353/happy-birthday-noel-gourdin-and-musiq-13947240/|website=wdasfm.com|publisher=iHeartMedia, Inc.|access-date=December 26, 2015}}</ref>) is an American singer and songwriter whose style blends [[R&B]], [[funk]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] influences fused with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/musiq-soulchild-mn0000935739|title=Musiq Soulchild|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
Musiq was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and raised in a strict Muslim household. During his teenage years he built a reputation for being musically gifted, beat boxing for MCs free styling on the open mic circuit, scatting at jazz clubs or just performing an a cappella for strangers on the streets, which is where he got the name "Musiq" and later added "Soulchild". He cites as his inspiration such icons as [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Donny Hathaway]] as his most influential musical icons.<ref name="ATL">{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/musiqsoulchild |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112062034/http://www.atlanticrecords.com/musiqsoulchild |archive-date=November 12, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="billboard">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=musiq (soulchild)|bio=true}} Billboard: Musiq Soulchild]</ref> He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music.

{{Quote frame|"There were people who knew of me but they didn't really know me; they just knew me as 'that music dude.' So after getting that so much, I was like 'Just call me Musiq.' It was so fresh to me because if I had to be called anything, I would have wanted to be called Music. That's how much I dug it; when you see me, I want you to automatically think of music. The stage name "Musiq Soulchild" is technically two ideas. 'Musiq' is the front man and 'Soulchild' is the idea behind it. It's basically me as an artist in this generation, representing the traditions and the legacies of the past soul stars."<ref name="ATL"/>}}

==Career==

===2000–2004: Def Soul Recordings===
Musiq Soulchild signed with Def Soul Records in late 1999, and released his debut album, ''[[Aijuswanaseing]]'', in 2000. Its lead single was "Just Friends (Sunny)". Musiq's second single "Love" spent 22 weeks on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts.

Musiq's second album, 2002's ''[[Juslisen]]'', debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and went platinum; it also debuted number one on the [[R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and all-genre Billboard 200 charts.<ref name="All Soulchild">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/musiq-soulchild-mn0000935739/biography |title=Although known for laid back tracks, he's had a few uptempo tracks |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> The singles were "Halfcrazy" and "Dontchange", which were top tens.

In 2003, Musiq released his third album, ''[[Soulstar (album)|Soulstar]]'', which went gold.<ref name="All Soulchild"/> It included the singles "Forthenight" and "Whoknows".

Musiq took a four-year break and changed his management to Solqi Management, as well as his record label from [[Def Soul]] to [[Atlantic Records]].

===2006–2012: Atlantic Records===
In March 2007, Musiq's released his fourth album ''[[Luvanmusiq]]''. Its singles were "B.U.D.D.Y.". an uptempo track,<ref name="All Soulchild"/> "Teachme", and "Makeyouhappy".

His fifth album ''[[OnMyRadio]]'' was released on December 2, 2008. The lead single "Radio" was a complete contrast to the usual smooth neo soul Musiq fans were accustomed to. The following singles were the duet ''[[IfULeave]]'' featuring [[Mary J. Blige]]; and the ballad ''[[SoBeautiful (song)|SoBeautiful]]''. "SoBeautiful" marked the first collaboration between Musiq and the producer [[JR Hutson]], after Hutson had spent "about eight months" trying to get Musiq to come by his studio.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> According to Hutson, the two plan to work together again.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

In May 2010, he changed management to Victor Grieg.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JR_Hutson_Interview.html |title=Interview With JR Hutson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=May 10, 2010 |access-date=May 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107025211/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JR_Hutson_Interview.html |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
