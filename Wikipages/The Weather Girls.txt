'''The Weather Girls''' are an American female duo whose best-known line-up comprised [[Martha Wash]] and [[Izora Armstead]]. Formed in 1976 in [[San Francisco]], California, The Weather Girls members began their musical career as '''Two Tons O' Fun''', the female backup duo for disco singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]]. After years of limited success singing background for Sylvester, the duo were signed in 1979 to [[Fantasy Records]]. The Weather Girls was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling single, "[[It's Raining Men]]" (1982), which became their first number-one [[Dance Club Songs|Dance]] song. Despite critical and commercial success, the duo struggled to repeat the success of "It's Raining Men" and ultimately disbanded after the release of their self-titled fifth album ''The Weather Girls'' in 1988.

In 1991, Armstead reformed the duo with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes. Over the course of a decade, the duo released three albums: ''Double Tons of Fun'' (1993), ''Think Big!'', and ''Puttin' On The Hits'' (1999). In 2004, Armstead died and was replaced with Ingrid Arthur in 2005. Following the release of two albums ''Totally Wild!'' (2005) and ''The Woman I Am'' (2009), Arthur left the group and was replaced with Dorrey Lin Lyles in 2012.

The group received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal]] in 1983.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/weather-girls Weather Girls | Artist].

===1970–1975: Formation and early years===
Izora Rhodes and Martha Wash met at a young age.<ref name="sylvesterbook">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwIGcuy_xxMC&pg=PP1|title=The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco|first=Joshua|last=Gamson|date=March 10, 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780805072501|via=Google Books}}</ref> Wash attended [[Church of God in Christ]], which was an alley away from the Baptist church Rhodes was attending.<ref name="sylvesterbook"/> Rhodes was the lead vocalist and pianist of San Francisco Inspirational Choir.<ref name="sylvesterbook"/> Wash and Rhodes eventually landed in a gospel group called N.O.W.

===1976–1979: Sylvester and the Two Tons o Fun===
In February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]] and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as "the girls", Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called '''Two Tons O' Fun'''.{{sfnm|1a1=Gamson|1y=2005|1pp=115&ndash;118|2a1=Davis|2y=2015|2pp=10&ndash;11}} Two Tons O' Fun debuted as Sylvester's backing vocalists on his self-titled third album ''[[Sylvester (album)|Sylvester]]'', released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album's singles "Down, Down, Down" and "Over and Over", which charted at number eighteen on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance chart.<ref name="sylvesterbillboard">[https://www.billboard.com/music/sylvester Sylvester | Billboard Chart History]. Billboard. Retrieved on February 1, 2019</ref>

In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album ''Step II'', which also featured The Two Tons' background vocals throughout the album. "[[Dance (Disco Heat)]]", the album's lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Dance Club Songs|Dance chart]] and became their first number-one single on that chart.<ref name="sylvesterbillboard"/> The album's second single "[[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)]]", also featuring the duo, became their second number-one single on the Dance chart.<ref name="sylvesterbillboard"/> In 1979, the duo secured their own record deal with [[Fantasy Records]]. Much to Sylvester's disappointment about their newly scored record deal, the duo began fewer shows with Sylvester. In the same year, Two Tons O' Fun sang background on Sylvester's live album ''Living Proof'', one of their final performances together.

===1980–1981: Debut album and ''Backatcha''===
On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album ''Two Tons o' Fun''. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: "Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven" and "I Got the Feeling".<ref name="twotonsbillboard">[https://www.billboard.com/music/two-tons-of-fun/chart-history/dance-club-play-songs Two Tons of Fun | Billboard Chart History].

The album spawned a single "I Depend On You" that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart.<ref name="twotonsbillboard"/> The followup single "Never Like This" peaked at number fifty-five on the R&B chart.

===1982–1988: The Weather Girls and breakthrough===
In September 1982, the duo released their single "[[It's Raining Men]]". The song became their biggest hit to date, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart.<ref name="weathergirlsbillboard">[https://www.billboard.com/music/the-weather-girls The Weather Girls | Billboard Chart History].

On January 22, 1983, they released their third album ''[[Success (The Weather Girls album)|Success]]''.<ref name="weathergirlsbillboard"/> Despite the overall success of the album's lead single, the album experienced mild success.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/success-mw0000192383 Success - The Weather Girls (All Music)].

With the album's singles "Well-A-Wiggy" and "No One Can Love You More Than Me" experiencing moderate success and poor promotion, the duo were being considered a novelty act. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fifth album ''The Weather Girls'', party produced by [[Full Force]] and [[Reggie Lucas]], which was ultimately seen as a commercial failure by their record label. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-weather-girls-mn0000586493/biography The Weather Girls | Biography & History | AllMusic].

===1991–2004: Reformation===
After a three-year hiatus and Wash pursuing her solo career, Armstead reformed The Weather Girls with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes and relocated to [[Germany]] in 1991. Their first album together ''Double Tons of Fun'' was released in 1993. The album's lead single "Can You Feel It" peaked at number two ''Billboard'''s Dance chart. The song also peaked at number 75 on Germany's music chart, their second single to enter that chart since "It's Raining Men". While touring the club circuit, the album's third single "We Shall All Be Free" peaked at number 80 on Germany's music chart. Their follow-up album ''Think Big!'' was released in December 1995. The album saw Armstead's contribution as a songwriter and penning several songs, including the album's third single "The Sound of Sex (Ooh Gitchie O-La-La-Ay)" which was written with her daughter. The album also contained a cover version of [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]]'s 1979 disco hit "Stars", recorded as a duet with Scottish pop singer [[Jimmy Somerville]].

In 1999, The Weather Girls released eighth studio album ''Puttin' On The Hits'' which contained a collection of covered disco songs. In 2002, they joined the Disco Brothers for a participation in the German National Final for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], with their song "Get Up". In the end, the group only managed a 13th place out of 15. Their final single, the non-album track "Big Brown Girl", was released in 2004. On September 16, 2004, Izora Armstead died of heart failure at age 62.

===2005–2012: Lineup change===

It scored an underground club hit with the single "Wild Thang" in 2004. In 2006, Joan Faulkner began performing with Rhodes and often substituting for Arthur. In 2008, the Weather Girls released a single "Break You", which topped the Dance chart.<ref name="weathergirlsbillboard"/> In 2009, the duo released a new studio album titled ''The Woman I Am''.
