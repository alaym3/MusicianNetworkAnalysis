'''Iron Eyes Cody''' (born '''Espera Oscar de Corti''', April 3, 1904 – January 4, 1999) was an American actor of Italian descent who portrayed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in [[Hollywood]] films,<ref name=snopes>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/ironeyes.htm |title=Was Iron Eyes Cody an American Indian? |publisher=Snopes.com |date=August 9, 2007 |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson}}</ref> famously as ''Chief Iron Eyes'' in [[Bob Hope]]'s ''[[The Paleface (1948 film)|The Paleface]]'' (1948). He also played a Native American shedding a tear about litter in one of the country's most well-known television [[public service announcement]]s from the group [[Keep America Beautiful]].<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/05/arts/iron-eyes-cody-94-an-actor-and-tearful-anti-littering-icon.html |title=Iron Eyes Cody, 94, an Actor And Tearful Anti-Littering Icon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Amy |last=Waldman |date=January 5, 1999}}</ref> Living in Hollywood, he began to insist, even in his private life, that he was [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], over time claiming membership in several different tribes. In 1996, Cody's half-sister said that he was of [[Italian American|Italian]] ancestry, but he denied it.<ref name=NYTobit/><ref name=Picayune>{{cite news |last=Aleiss |first=Angela |title=Native Son: After a Career as Hollywood's Noble Indian Hero, Iron Eyes Cody is Found to Have an Unexpected Heritage |newspaper=[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|url=https://www.academia.edu/11282618/Native_Son_Italian-American_Identity_of_Iron_Eyes_Cody_ |date=May 26, 1996}}</ref> After his death, it was revealed that he was of Sicilian parentage, and not Native American at all.<ref name="snopes"/><ref name=NYTobit/><ref name=Picayune/>

==Early life==
Cody was born Espera Oscar de Corti on April 3, 1904, in [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]] in [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]], in southwestern [[Louisiana]], a second son of Francesca Salpietra from [[Sicily]] and her husband, Antonio de Corti from southern Italy.<ref name=Picayune/> He had two brothers, Joseph and Frank, and a sister, Victoria.<ref name="snopes"/> His parents had a local grocery store in [[Gueydan, Louisiana|Gueydan]], Louisiana, where he grew up.<ref name="walkoffame.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/iron-eyes-cody|title=Iron Eyes Cody - Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref> His father left the family and moved to [[Texas]], where he took the name Tony Corti. His mother married Alton Abshire and had five more children with him.<ref name="snopes"/>

When the three de Corti brothers were teenagers, they joined their father in Texas and shortened their last name from de Corti to Corti. Cody's father, Tony Corti, died in Texas in 1924.<ref name=Picayune/> The brothers moved on to [[California]], where they were acting in movies, and changed their surname to Cody.<ref name="Stefano2007">{{cite book|author=George De Stefano|title=An Offer We Can't Refuse: The Mafia in the Mind of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2482tWkpfpQC&pg=PA279|date=23 January 2007|publisher=Faber & Faber/Farrar, Straus, Giroux|isbn=978-0-86547-962-3|pages=279–}}</ref> Joseph William and Frank Henry Cody worked as extras, then moved on to other work.  Frank was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1949.<ref name=Picayune/>

==Career==
Cody began acting in the late 1920s. He worked in film and television until his death. Cody claimed his father was [[Cherokee]] (and his mother [[Cree]]),<ref name=NYTobit/> also naming several different tribes, and frequently changing his claimed place of birth. To those unfamiliar with [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indigenous American]] or [[First Nations]] cultures and people, he gave the appearance of living "as if" he were Native American, fulfilling the stereotypical expectations by wearing his film wardrobe as daily clothing&mdash;including braided wig, fringed leathers and beaded moccasins&mdash;at least when photographers were visiting, and in other ways continuing to play the same Hollywood-scripted roles off-screen as well as on.<ref name=snopes/><ref name=Picayune/>

He appeared in more than 200 films, including ''[[The Big Trail]]'' (1930), with [[John Wayne]]; ''[[The Scarlet Letter (1934 film)|The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1934), with [[Colleen Moore]]; ''[[Sitting Bull]]'' (1954), as [[Crazy Horse]]; ''[[The Light in the Forest (film)|The Light in the Forest]]'' (1958) as Cuyloga; ''[[The Great Sioux Massacre]]'' (1965), with Joseph Cotten; ''[[Nevada Smith]]'' (1966), with [[Steve McQueen]]; ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), with [[Richard Harris]]; and ''[[Ernest Goes to Camp]]'' (1987) as Chief St. Cloud, with [[Jim Varney]].
[[File:Iron Eyes Cody-Roy Rogers in North of the Great Divide.jpg|thumb|Iron Eyes Cody and [[Roy Rogers]] in ''[[North of the Great Divide]]'', 1950]]
He also appeared in over a hundred television programs.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-true-story-of-the-crying-indian/|title=The True Story of 'The Crying Indian'|website=Priceonomics}}</ref> For example, in 1953, he appeared twice in [[Duncan Renaldo]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]], ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' as Chief Sky Eagle. He guest starred on the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', starring [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], and ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'', with [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] and [[Clu Gulager]]. In 1961, he played the title role in "The Burying of Sammy Hart" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series, ''[[The Rebel (American TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]]. A close friend of [[Walt Disney]], Cody appeared in a [[Disney]] studio serial titled ''The First Americans'', and in episodes of ''The Mountain Man'', ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' and ''[[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]''. In 1964 Cody appeared as Chief Black Feather on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the episode "The Intruders." He also appeared in a 1974 episode of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' featuring Native American dancers.

Cody was widely seen as the "Crying Indian" in the "[[Keep America Beautiful]]" [[public service announcement]]s (PSA) in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/Our-Campaigns/The-Classics/Pollution-Keep-America-Beautiful-Iron-Eyes-Cody |title=Pollution: Keep America Beautiful - Iron Eyes Cody |publisher=Ad Council |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> The environmental commercial showed Cody in costume, shedding a tear after trash is thrown from the window of a car and it lands at his feet. The announcer, [[William Conrad]], says: "People start pollution; people can stop it." The ad won two Clio awards, incited a frenzy of community involvement, and "helped reduce litter by 88% across 38 states", according to one reliable source.<ref name="auto"/> Cody was a participant in the documentary series ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]'' (1980), where he discussed early [[Western (genre)|Western]] filmmaker [[William S. Hart]]'s use of [[Plains Indian Sign Language|Native American Sign Language]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Out West |series=[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]] |date=March 4, 1980 |number=9}}</ref>

The [[Joni Mitchell]] song "Lakota", from the 1988 album, ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'', features Cody's chanting.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris J. |last=Walker |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_larry_klein_doing/ |title=Larry Klein Is Doing It All |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=June 1, 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308220022/http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_larry_klein_doing/ |archive-date=March 8, 2014 }}</ref> He made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1990 film ''[[Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|Spirit of '76]]''.

==Personal life and death==
In 1936, Cody married archaeologist [[Bertha Parker Pallan|Bertha Parker]]. She was active in excavations during the late 1920s and early 1930s before becoming an assistant in archaeology at the [[Southwest Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-verdugo-views-the-true-story-of-iron-eyes-cody-20140828-story.html|title=Verdugo Views: The true story of Iron Eyes Cody|date=28 August 2014|via=LA Times}}</ref> They adopted two children said to be of [[Dakota people|Dakota]]-[[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] origin, [[Robert Tree Cody]] and Arthur. The couple remained married until Bertha's death in 1978.

Although the non-Native public who knew him from the movies and television thought of Cody as an American Indian, a 1996 story by ''The Times-Picayune'' in [[New Orleans]] questioned his heritage, reporting that he was a second-generation Italian-American. This was based on an interview with his half-sister, and documents including a baptismal record. Cody, who now wore his Hollywood costumes in daily life, denied the claim.<ref name=NYTobit/><ref name=Picayune/>

Cody, at age 94, died of [[mesothelioma]] at his home in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] on January 4, 1999.<ref name=NYTobit/> Before death, he had written this comment: 
"Make me ready to stand before you with clean and straight eyes. When Life fades, as the fading sunset, may our spirits stand before you without shame".<ref name="auto"/>

==Honors==
On 20 April 1983, he was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6601 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name="walkoffame.com"/>

In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-13 |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars – Listed by date dedicated }}</ref>
