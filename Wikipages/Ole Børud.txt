'''Ole Børud''' (born December 6, 1976) is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, producer, and [[Audio engineer|engineer]] known both for his solo recordings and as a member of the groups Arnold B. Family, [[Schaliach]], [[Extol]], and [[Fleshkiller]]. Børud, son of Norwegian [[gospel music|gospel]] singer [[Arnold Børud]], began performing music at age five as part of Arnold B. Family, a group which would compete in the [[Melodi Grand Prix]] three times. At age twelve, he released a [[Christian music|Christian]] [[children's music]] album. He later ventured into [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, first in the two-man project Schaliach and then in Extol and, briefly, the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Selfmindead]]. Since the early 2000s, he has also recorded several solo albums in [[Yacht rock|West Coast]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[funk]], and [[jazz]] styles: ''Chi-Rho'' (2002), ''Shakin' the Ground'' (2008), ''Keep Movin'' (2011), ''Someday at Christmas'' (2012, in collaboration with Samuel Ljungblahd), ''Stepping Up'' (2014), and ''Outside the Limit'' (2019). He re-joined Extol in 2012, and in 2016 he co-founded a heavy metal side-project, Fleshkiller. Børud has also performed for [[Torun Eriksen]] and Sofian and collaborated with Larvik Stroband and the [[Oslo Gospel Choir]], and has contributed to two [[hymn]] compilations, ''Takk, gode Gud, for alle ting: 20 sanger fra Barnesalmeboka'' and ''Søndagsskolen Synger'' (both in 2008). He has regularly appeared on various Norwegian television shows, including ''Det store korslaget'' and ''Stjernekamp'', and in 2017 provided backing choral vocals in [[Jowst]]'s performance of "[[Grab the Moment]]" in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 Eurovision contest]].
