== Musical career ==

=== From First to Last (2002&ndash;2010, 2013-present) ===
Richter was the original guitarist/screamer of [[post-hardcore]] band [[From First to Last]], and was featured on every release by the band, both albums and music videos. After being with the band from the beginning, [[From First to Last]] announced that Richter and the band had parted ways due to artistic differences;
Not long after his departure, the band announced their indefinite hiatus after eight years of touring and four full-length albums.
Upon the bands reformation, Richter rejoined the band as guitarist and scream vocals.

=== The Color of Violence (2002&ndash;2003, 2006&ndash;present) ===
Richter formed [[grindcore]] band [[The Color of Violence]] with future members of [[From First to Last]], including current [[guitarist]] and [[vocalist]] Matt Good and drummer Derek Bloom, as well as former bassist Joe Antillion, and his friend Chad Crews on guitar. The band started as a full-time band from 2002 to 2003, but the all of the members, except for Crews, decided to focus on [[From First to Last]]. However, in 2006, Richter and Bloom decided to restart the band as a two-man duo, with Richter under the alias of Guy Nucleosity and Bloom went under the alias of Glitch Killgasm. The two released their debut full-length album, ''[[Youthanize]]'', on April 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=DeAndrea|first=Joe|title=The Color of Violence Release Info|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=893162|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk]]|accessdate=2 August 2010|date=22 February 2009}}</ref> The band said that "[Youthanize] may not be groundbreaking, and it may not sell any copies, but we tried to be ourselves and experiment, and we're all really happy with the way it turned out..."<ref>{{cite web|title=Epitaph Records: The Color of Violence - Youthanize|url=http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/566/Youthanize#albdesc|publisher=[[Epitaph Records]]|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, Richter helped produced [[post-hardcore]] group [[I Set My Friends On Fire]]'s debut album, ''[[You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter]]'', along with main producer Lee Dyess of Earthsound Recordings and additional production with former band member Nabil Moo. The band recorded their second album with Dyess in early to mid-2010, but several factors, including Moo leaving the band, pushed production to Los Angeles, California where Richter ultimately produced the album in late 2010 to early 2011. This album, entitled ''[[Astral Rejection]]'' was released on June 21, 2011.

=== The Human Abstract (2010&ndash;2011, 2012&ndash;present) ===
Richter became the third lead vocalist of the [[progressive metal]] band [[The Human Abstract (band)|The Human Abstract]], replacing Nathan Ells.
