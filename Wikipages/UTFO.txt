== History ==
The group formed in the early 1980s and were originally known as UFO. However, the name was taken by a rock group so they were forced to change it to UTFO. Kangol Kid and Doctor Ice were originally known as The Keystone Dancers and were a dance duet, before going on to be dancers for [[Whodini]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/>  Eventually, they went on to form UTFO in their hometown of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], New York. In 1984, the group signed with Fred Munao's Select Records, and, in the same year, it released its hit single, "Roxanne Roxanne." The group's debut album was produced by R&B group [[Full Force]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Full Force brought in New York's sound and sampling wizard, Gary Pozner, to help create the sounds and the beats.  This was one of the first instances of the new sampling machine, the [[E-mu Emulator]], used on a commercially released record.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
