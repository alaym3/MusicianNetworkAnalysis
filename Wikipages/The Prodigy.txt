'''The Prodigy''' are an English [[electronic dance music]] band from [[Braintree, Essex]], formed in 1990 by [[keyboardist]] and [[songwriter]] [[Liam Howlett]]. The band's line-up has included [[Rapping|MC]] and vocalist [[Maxim (musician)|Maxim]], dancer and vocalist [[Keith Flint]] (until his death in March 2019), dancer and live keyboardist [[Leeroy Thornhill]] (who left to pursue a solo career in 2000), and dancer and vocalist Sharky (1990–1991). Along with [[the Chemical Brothers]] and [[Fatboy Slim]], the Prodigy are credited as pioneers of the [[breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]-influenced genre [[big beat]], which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock-inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic [[rave music]] beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's omnipresent mystique, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style and Flint's modern punk appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/big-beat-d4546 |title=Big Beat |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=30 September 2011 |archive-date=4 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204201802/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/big-beat-d4546 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Formation and "Charly" (1990–1991) ===
[[File:Moog Prodigy.jpg|thumb|right|The band was named after the [[Moog Prodigy]] synthesiser]]
The Prodigy were founded in [[Braintree, Essex]], in 1990 by keyboardist and songwriter [[Liam Howlett]]. He had taken piano lessons in his youth and gained the ability to play difficult passages in just a few run-throughs.{{sfn|James|2002|p=15}} After he decided to pursue a music career, Howlett met dancer and vocalist [[Keith Flint]] in mid-1989 at a rave at which Howlett was DJing. After Flint requested Howlett make a mix tape for him, Howlett obliged, returning a cassette several days later with a collection of his own songs on the other side.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=22}} Howlett had scratched the word "Prodigy" onto the cassette, the same name as the [[Moog Prodigy]] [[Analog synthesizer|analogue synthesiser]],{{sfn|James|2002|p=44}} and Howlett's moniker.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=23}} The tape was well-received by Flint and keyboardist [[Leeroy Thornhill]] who developed new dance sequences to the music and suggested to Howlett they begin a group together.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=23}} They were soon joined by MC and vocalist [[Maxim (musician)|Maxim]], then known as Maxim Reality, and female dancer and vocalist Sharky, a friend of Flint's. Together they became the first line-up of the Prodigy.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=23}}

The group's first live gig occurred at [[The Four Aces Club|Four Aces]] in [[Dalston]], London.<ref>Emma Warren, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/dec/09/10-classic-club-nights "From the Dug Out and dreads to DMZ and dubstep: 10 classic club nights"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112020301/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/dec/09/10-classic-club-nights |date=12 January 2021 }}, ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 20 April 2012.</ref>{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=23}} With a group secured, Howlett wrote, produced, and mixed a 10-track demo tape on a [[Roland W-30]] sampling workstation keyboard, and approached Tam Tam Records with the hope of securing a record deal, but they declined.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=30}} He then turned to [[XL Recordings]], headed by Tim Palmer (Founder) and [[Nick Halkes]] (Head of A&R) who agreed to a meeting and subsequently picked up the demo and signed the group on a 4 x Single contract.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=30}} In February 1991, the band released the extended play ''[[What Evil Lurks]]'' on 12-inch vinyl, containing four songs that Howlett had produced on the demo.

In August 1991, the Prodigy released their debut single "[[Charly (song)|Charly]]",{{sfn|James|2002|p=280}} which samples dialogue from the [[Charley Says]] series of animated films produced by the [[Central Office of Information]]. It became a hit in the rave scene at the time,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/prodigy-theirlaw |title=The Prodigy: Their Law: The Singles 1990–2005 |author=Mike Schiller |date=23 December 2005 |work=PopMatters |access-date=30 September 2011 |quote=Songs like “Out of Space” and “Charly” turned into massive club hits |archive-date=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130211702/http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/prodigy-theirlaw |url-status=live }}</ref> and reached number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], thus catapulting the band into the wider public attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/prodigy/ |title=PRODIGY |work=[[The Official Charts Company]] |access-date=30 September 2011}}</ref> The success of "Charly" began a trend of mixing dance and "hardcore rave" tracks with cartoon samples, such as "[[A Trip to Trumpton]]" by [[Urban Hype]] and "[[Sesame's Treet]]" by [[Smart E's]], which were a hit with clubbers, but not to reviewers and critics,<ref name="A Short History of Drum and Bass (Global Darkness)">{{cite web |url=http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/history%20of%20drum%20and%20bass%202.htm |title=A short history of Drum and Bass |author=Ben Gilman |work=globaldarkness.com |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-date=29 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529212755/http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/history%20of%20drum%20and%20bass%202.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> who dismissed the music as "kiddie rave" or "[[toytown techno]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/the-prodigy/their-law-the-singles-1990-2005.htm |title=The Prodigy&nbsp;– Their Law: The Singles 1990–2005 |author=Thomas Inskeep |date=8 May 2006 |work=Stylus Magazine |access-date=30 September 2011 |archive-date=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021124746/http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/the-prodigy/their-law-the-singles-1990-2005.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== "Everybody in the Place" and ''Experience'' (1991–1993) ===

}}
The band's second single, "[[Everybody in the Place|Everybody in the Place (Fairground Edit)]]", was released in December 1991.{{sfn|James|2002|p=280}} It reached number 2 in the UK, beaten by a re-release of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] following the death of their singer [[Freddie Mercury]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Official Singles Chart Top 75 12 January 1992 - 18 January 1992 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19920112/7501/ |access-date=16 March 2019 |agency=Official Charts Company |archive-date=7 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507215652/https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19920112/7501/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In September 1992, the band released their debut full-length album ''[[Experience (The Prodigy album)|Experience]]'', produced entirely by Howlett. The idea of making one originated from XL, and initially Howlett wanted to produce a "rave [[concept album]]" inspired by the [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]], but abandoned the idea due to the risk of limiting his musical ideas.{{sfn|Roach|2010|p=56}} It peaked at number 12 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for selling over 300,000 copies.<ref name="UK Charts">{{cite web | title = UK Top 40 Hit Database | work = everyHit.com | url = http://www.everyhit.com/ | access-date = 2 October 2011 | archive-date = 29 October 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191029090328/http://www.everyhit.com/ | url-status = live }} Note: User must define search parameters as "Prodigy".</ref><ref name="BPI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards Search |work=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004449/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=14 May 2011 }} Note: Reader must type "Prodigy" into the Search box and hit Go.</ref> The album contains many samples of songs from other artists, and closes with a live version of "Death of the Prodigy Dancers" featuring Maxim on vocals. As with "Charly", it became landmark release in the history of British rave music. Five singles spawned from the album: "Charly", "Everybody in the Place", "[[Fire/Jericho]]", "[[Out of Space]]", and "[[Wind It Up (Rewound)]]"; the latter a remix of "Wind It Up".

After ''Experience'' and the run of singles that accompanied it, the Prodigy moved to distance themselves from the "kiddie rave" reputation that now dogged them. The rave scene was beginning to move on from its hardcore phase, with the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Act]]'s "anti-rave" legislation on the horizon, calling rave music "repetitive beats".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprodigy.info/reviews/jilted.shtml |title=Review |author=Martin Bate |work=theprodigy.info |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-date=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704093639/http://www.theprodigy.info/reviews/jilted.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> The Prodigy responded to the bill by writing "Their Law".

=== ''Music for the Jilted Generation'' (1993–1995) ===
In 1993, Howlett released an anonymous [[white label]], bearing only the title "Earthbound I". Its hypnotic, hard-edged sound won wide underground approval. It was officially released as "One Love" later that year, and went on to chart at number 8 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprodigy.info/discography/promos/onelove/index.shtml |title=Promo |work=theprodigy.info |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-date=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68hMdppvp?url=http://www.theprodigy.info/discography/promos/onelove/index.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, the Prodigy's second album, ''[[Music for the Jilted Generation]]'', debuted in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one, and received positive reactions from album critics.<ref name=AllmusicBio>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-the-jilted-generation-r203543 |title=''Music for the Jilted Generation''&nbsp;– The Prodigy |author=John Bush |work=Allmusic |access-date=8 October 2011 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100629/https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-the-jilted-generation-mw0000622674 |url-status=live }}</ref> Adding elements of [[big beat]] and [[electro-industrial]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} to the mix, the album expressed a wider spectrum of musical styles, with heavy breakbeat-based tracks complemented by the concept sequence ''The Narcotic Suite'' and a rock-oriented inclination, "Their Law", featuring [[Pop Will Eat Itself]]. The album was later described as a "complex, powerful record that propelled dance music into stadiums with rock’n’roll swagger".<ref name="Guardian">{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/17/the-prodigy-the-day-is-my-enemy-oasis-blur|title = The Prodigy: 'we should be as important as Oasis or Blur'|date = 17 January 2015|website = theguardian.com|last = McQuaid|first = Ian|access-date = 16 December 2016|archive-date = 3 May 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100627/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/17/the-prodigy-the-day-is-my-enemy-oasis-blur|url-status = live}}</ref>

The album was nominated for a [[Mercury Music Prize]], although Howlett had reaffirmed his dedication to making the Prodigy a 'hard dance band', commercially successful but without compromise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theprodigyfanboy.com/even-more/books/ |title=Books |date=31 August 2011 |work=theprodigyfanboy.com |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-date=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68hMfwDjj?url=http://theprodigyfanboy.com/even-more/books/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The band managed to continue to prevent over-exposure in the media by refusing to appear on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' or other television shows in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/20/popandrock.prodigy |title=Prodigal son |date=20 August 2004 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100608/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/20/popandrock.prodigy |url-status=live }}</ref> To date, their only studio appearance on British television came when they appeared on the BBC2 series ''Dance Energy'' in 1991, performing "Everybody in the Place". In the ensuing years, their videos received a strong level of support by MTV Europe, which boosted their popularity across the continent. Keith Flint himself hosted an episode of the MTV show ''120 Minutes'' in 1995.

Following the international success of ''Music for the Jilted Generation'', the band augmented their line-up with guitarist [[Jim Davies (musician)|Jim Davies]] (a live band member who later joined the group [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]]) in 1995 for tracks such as "Their Law", "Break and Enter 95", and various live-only interludes and versions.

A number of the songs from the album were used in the film [[Hackers (film)|''Hackers'']] which starred [[Jonny Lee Miller]] and [[Angelina Jolie]].

The release of "[[Firestarter (Prodigy song)|Firestarter]]" in 1996, featuring vocals for the first time courtesy of a new-look Keith Flint, helped the band break into the United States and other overseas markets, and reached [[number one]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Roberts">Roberts, David (2006).

The Prodigy were getting considerable [[airplay]] on [[Rock music|rock]] stations with their controversial track "[[Smack My Bitch Up]]"—and also a negative backlash for the song. The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) criticized the song and its music video. The song's [[lyrics]] consist entirely of the repeated phrase "Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up", which NOW stated are a "dangerous and offensive message advocating violence against women".<ref name=latimes97>{{cite journal |author=Chuck Philips |date=4 December 1997 |title=Time Warner Again Faces the Music Over Song Lyrics |journal=[[LA Times]] }}</ref> Howlett responded to the criticism by stating that the meaning of the song and its lyrics were being misinterpreted, and the phrase meant "doing anything intensely, like being on stage—going for extreme manic energy".<ref name=latimes97 /> The band did not actually write the lyric, but rather, sampled it from the [[hip hop]] [[Ultramagnetic MCs]]' track "Give the Drummer Some"<ref>''The Fat of the Land'' liner notes.</ref> which also appears on the ''[[The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One|Dirtchamber Sessions]]''; they had also sampled another Ultramagnetic MCs song "Critical Beatdown" on their earlier "[[Out of Space]]" single.<ref>Liner notes from "Out of Space" single and ''Experience'' album.</ref> The National Organization for Women also believed that the lyrics are in reference to administering [[heroin]] (smack) to another person.<ref name="Ottawa Citizen NOW Prodigy">{{cite news |title=Music group, Prodigy, causing controversy with its new song and video |newspaper=[[The Ottawa Citizen]] |date=12 September 1997 }}</ref> Several radio stations limited the song's airplay to nighttime hours.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Music: The Prodigy |magazine=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]] |issue=409 }}</ref> In September 1997, the Prodigy performed "[[Breathe (Prodigy song)|Breathe]]" at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], and won the [[MTV Video Music Award&nbsp;– Viewer's Choice|Viewer's Choice Award]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1997/ 1997 MTV Video Music Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826045525/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1997/ |date=26 August 2011 }} MTV.com.

During a performance at the [[Reading Festival]] on 29 August 1998, the Prodigy and the [[Beastie Boys]] had an onstage disagreement over the track, with the Beastie Boys requesting the song should be pulled from their set as it could be considered offensive to those who had suffered domestic abuse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-b/beastieboys_main.htm |title=Beastie Boys |work=rockonthenet.com |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-date=26 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026130356/http://rockonthenet.com/artists-b/beastieboys_main.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Choosing to ignore the Beastie Boys' plea, Maxim introduced "Smack My Bitch Up" with the declaration "They didn't want us to play this fucking tune.

[[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] later announced they would pull ''The Fat of the Land'' off their shelves.

1999 saw the release of the Prodigy's ''[[The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One]]'', a DJ mix album by Howlett, produced as an official record of a successful guest appearance on the British [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Liam Howlett |title=BBC Radio 1 Breezeblock |work=The Breezeblock |url=http://www.brainkiller.it/prodigy/news/breezeblock2aug.php |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-date=19 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819002919/http://www.brainkiller.it/prodigy/news/breezeblock2aug.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The original session came into being following a conversation between journalism and band biographer Martin James and Breezeblock presenter Mary Anne Hobbs. They are subsequently both thanked on the album sleeve notes. In June of the same year, when the band had arguably reached their commercial peak, they parted company with guitarist Gizz Butt.

Following 1999, Thornhill departed from the group after splitting up with [[Sara Cox]]; the band's website was replaced with their logo and the words "We will be back..." set against a black background, which would remain until 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=I quit the Prodigy and life fell apart; Leeroy Thornhill tells how his split with DJ Sara Cox edged him close to a nervous breakdown... |first==John |last=Dingwall |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-70996289 |newspaper=Daily Record (Scotland) |date=2 March 2001 |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100607/https://www.gale.com/databases/questia |url-status=live }}</ref> [[File:Theprodigywebsite1999.png|thumb|The band's website after Thornhill left in 2000.]]

=== Reunion (2001–2004) ===
In 2002, after the group performed some live shows in 2001, the single "[[Baby's Got a Temper]]" was released to critical disappointment. The original version of the song was written by Keith Flint's sideband, [[Flint (band)|Flint]] and was called 'NNNN'. The Prodigy version was a total reworking of Flint's track with only a few of the lyrics and melody remaining from the original and produced by Howlett. The song also featured Jim Davies. Once again, the band courted controversy by including references to the so-called "[[date rape]]" drug [[Rohypnol]] in the song's lyrics.<ref>{{cite news  | last = James  | first = Martin  | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/liam-howlett-punk-and-disorderly-646664.html  | title = Liam Howlett: Punk and disorderly  | newspaper = [[The Independent]]  |date=28 June 2002 | access-date = 2 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The song's music video was also controversial, which featured barely covered women milking cows in a suggestive fashion.

=== ''Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned'' (2004–2008) ===
[[File:Liam Howlett.jpg|thumb|left|Liam Howlett live in August 2005.]]
The Prodigy's fourth studio album, ''[[Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned]]'', was released on 23 August 2004, and 14 September 2004 in the US. A precursory and experimental single, "[[Girls/Memphis Bells|Memphis Bells]]", was released in very limited numbers, followed by the traditional release of the single "[[Girls (Prodigy song)|Girls]]". The US version of the studio album contained a bonus track; a remix of "Girls", entitled "More Girls". The album, which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] in its debut week,<ref name="UK Charts"/> was promoted by a two-year-long tour.

5,000 digital copies of "Memphis Bells" were sold over the Internet. Each copy was a combination of customer-chosen instrumental, rhythmic, and melodic options, of which 39,600 choices were available. Five mixes were sold in three file formats, [[WAV]], two audio mixes in [[MP3]], and a 5.1 [[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]] [[surround sound]] mix, and all were free of [[digital rights management]].<ref name="PopMatters Howlett"/>

In 2005, they released a compilation, ''[[Their Law: The Singles 1990–2005]]'', which spawned a [[Voodoo People (Pendulum Remix)/Out of Space (Audio Bullys Remix)|single containing new remixes]] of the songs "Out of Space" ("[[Audio Bullys]] Remix") and "Voodoo People" (the "[[Pendulum (drum and bass group)|Pendulum]] Remix"). The artwork represented drawn versions of the front covers of the "Out of Space" and "Voodoo People" single releases. The latter was also followed by a music video filmed in [[Romford Market]], [[Essex]], which featured on the DVD release of the compilation. Sharky, the group's only female member, is shown running and winning the race depicted in the video. Also in 2005, the song "You'll be Under my Wheels" from the ''Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned'' album was added to the soundtrack of ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]''. The cover artwork included an extended essay by band biographer Martin James.

[[File:Prodigy (1).jpg|thumb|Maxim performing at the 2006 [[Sziget Festival]]]]

In 2006, the song "You'll be Under my Wheels" from the ''Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned'' album was added to the soundtrack of ''The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift''.

The Prodigy's first two albums, 1992's ''Experience'' and 1994's ''Music for the Jilted Generation'', were re-released in expanded, deluxe editions on 4 August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=33607_0_2_0_C |title=The Prodigy reissue first 2 albums and play new songs live |author=B.

The two albums also featured expanded artwork in addition to the new musical content.

When asked about the idea, Howlett responded that they were getting ready to make a new album:

<blockquote>No, we're all done with that [those albums] now, all the old material. We didn't actually want to do the ''Greatest Hits'', we were ready to start our new record—until the record company pointed out that it was in the contract. But then we got into it, and tried to be creative with it as much as [we could]. And, you know, we ended up being really proud of it. You have to have a different brain when you're doing a record like that. It's more about [saying] "this is your achievement"; I could hold in one hand all the records we've released, so that was cool. We're moving on now, and getting on with the new record.<ref name="PopMatters Howlett">{{cite web | last = O'Neal | first = Tim | title = So I Decided to Take My Work Underground: A Conversation with the Prodigy's Liam Howlett | work = [[PopMatters]] | url = https://www.popmatters.com/feature/prodigy-060421/ | access-date = 2 October 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

=== ''Invaders Must Die'' (2008–2010) ===
The Prodigy tested a few of the new tracks at Rainbow Warehouse Birmingham and Plug in Sheffield in May 2008.
The Prodigy showcased three new songs at the [[Oxegen]] Festival in the early hours of 13 July 2008. Among the tracks previewed were "Worlds on Fire", "Warriors Dance", and "Mescaline".

[[File:Flint&Holiday.jpg|thumb|The Prodigy frontman [[Keith Flint]] and live member [[Rob Holliday]]]]
On 5 November 2008, it was announced that the band's fifth studio album would be called ''[[Invaders Must Die]]'' and would be released on the band's new label, Take Me to the hospital. It was released in the U.S. on 3 March 2009, and was the first Prodigy album since 1997's ''The Fat of the Land'' to feature all three members of the band.<ref>{{cite web|author=Liam Howlett |title=Take Me to the Hospital |date=11 March 2008 |url=http://theprodigy.com/index.php/component/option,com_mojo/Itemid,204/p,3/ |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314145118/http://theprodigy.com/index.php/component/option%2Ccom_mojo/Itemid%2C204/p%2C3/ |archive-date=14 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/61969/the_prodigy|title=The Prodigy: Invaders Must Die New release date: March 3, 2009|date=30 January 2009|access-date=2 October 2011|work=idiomag.com|archive-date=26 June 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68hMhPkUc?url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/61969/the_prodigy|url-status=live}}</ref>

The album featured [[Dave Grohl]] on drums for "Run with the Wolves". The top five hit "[[Omen (Prodigy song)|Omen]]" and "Invaders Must Die" were co-produced with [[Does It Offend You, Yeah?]] frontman James Rushent.<ref>''Invaders Must Die'' liner notes.</ref> The band said that the album would go back to their "old-school but cutting edge" roots.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The album was released as a CD, CD-DVD set, double vinyl, digital download, and a luxury 7-inch vinyl box set including five 7-inches, CD-DVD, bonus CD, poster, stickers, and stencils.<ref name="Liam H blog">{{cite web|title=Liam H blog |publisher=The Prodigy |date=6 November 2008 |url=http://theprodigy.com/index.php/liam-h-blog |access-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109203538/http://theprodigy.com/index.php/liam-h-blog |archive-date=9 November 2008}}</ref>

''Invaders Must Die'' was released on 21 February 2009 in Australia and in Europe on 23 February 2009, charting at number one in the U.K. with week one sales of over 97,000—a higher figure than for either ''Always Outnumbered'' or their singles collection.<ref name="Roberts"/> The album also reached the top five in Germany and Australia and top 10 in Norway and several other European countries.

[[Image:Maxim Reality, German tour, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Maxim performing in 2009.]]
To coincide with the release of the album, the band embarked on a nine-date UK arena tour, with support from [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Noisia]], [[Herve]], and DJ Kissy Sell Out. The tour included the first edition of the band's own annual dance gig, the [[Warriors Dance Festival]]. The single "Omen" debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Singles Chart the week of 25 February 2009 and won the [[Kerrang! Award for Best Single]]. The initial critical response to ''Invaders Must Die'' was somewhat mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, based on 20 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/invaders-must-die |title=Invaders Must Die Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |work=Metacritic |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100629/https://www.metacritic.com/music/invaders-must-die |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the album was well received by the fans, who welcomed it in a positive light compared to ''Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/invaders-must-die/user-reviews |title=Invaders Must Die User Reviews at Metacritic |work=Metacritic |access-date=12 October 2011 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503100610/https://www.metacritic.com/music/invaders-must-die/user-reviews |url-status=live }}</ref> Two singles followed, "[[Warrior's Dance]]" and "[[Take Me to the Hospital]]", which were released on 11 May and 31 August 2009 respectively.

In the same year, Howlett co-produced the song "Immunize" on [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]]'s third album, ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]''.<ref>''Immersion'' liner notes.</ref>

On 12 January 2015, the Prodigy released "[[Nasty (Prodigy song)|Nasty]]" as the lead single off their upcoming album along with the title track on 26 January 2015. Howlett found that "violent is the word that keeps on coming up" when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking in a number of studios and a few restarts to establish that "angry, energetic sound".<ref name="Guardian" /> Unlike previous efforts ''The Day Is My Enemy'' became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that "four years ago we sat down and talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we knew we had to bust out the most 'band' album we could create".<ref name="Guardian" />
