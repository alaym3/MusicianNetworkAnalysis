'''Creeper''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Southampton]]. Formed in 2014, the group originally featured vocalist Will Gould, guitarists Ian Miles and Sina Nemati, bassist Sean Scott and drummer Dan Bratton. The band independently released their [[Creeper (EP)|self-titled debut EP]] in 2014, before signing with [[Roadrunner Records]] and issuing a follow-up, ''[[The Callous Heart]]'', the next year. At the end of 2015, Nemati was replaced by Oliver Burdett and touring keyboardist/vocalist Hannah Greenwood became an official member of the band. A third EP, ''[[The Stranger (EP)|The Stranger]]'', was released in 2016 and reached the [[UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts|UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart]] top ten.

The group's full-length debut album ''[[Eternity, in Your Arms]]'' reached number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in 2017. After an extensive touring cycle, Creeper announced their break-up in November 2018 in a fashion reminiscent of the end of Bowie's [[David Bowie#1972–1974: Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] character in 1973. The band returned exactly a year later and released their second album ''[[Sex, Death & the Infinite Void]]'' in July 2020, which reached number 5 in the UK. After the album's release, Bratton and Burdett left the group, with both Jake Fogarty taking over as permanent drummer and [[Miss Vincent]] guitarist Lawrie Pattison becoming a touring member in 2021.

Formed through their mutual involvement in [[hardcore punk]] and [[post-hardcore]] groups in the Southampton area, Creeper are musically and stylistically influenced by fellow "[[Horror punk|goth punk]]" groups including [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[Alkaline Trio]], as well as more traditional [[punk rock]] acts like [[The Bouncing Souls]] and [[glam rock]] artists such as [[David Bowie]]. The band's songwriting is typically led by Gould and Miles, although Nemati also co-wrote many of their early songs. Creeper were hailed by critics as one of the best new rock bands shortly after their formation, winning awards from magazines ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]'' in 2016.
