'''Morphine''' was an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] group formed by [[Mark Sandman]], [[Dana Colley]], and [[Jerome Deupree]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1989.  Drummer [[Billy Conway (drummer)|Billy Conway]] also played in the band, frequently during Deupree's absence, though at times both played together.  After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded after lead vocalist Sandman died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] onstage in [[Palestrina]], Italy, on July 3, 1999. Founding members have reformed into the band [[Vapors of Morphine]], maintaining much of the original style and sound.

Morphine combined [[blues]] and [[jazz]] elements with more traditional [[rock music|rock]] arrangements, giving the band an unusual sound. Sandman sang distinctively in a "deep, laid-back [[croon]]",<ref>{{cite news | title = Morphine's addictive music is seducing a phalanx of fans | first = Matt | last = Ashare | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | newspaper = [[The Boston Phoenix]] | date = 1994-05-27 | access-date = 2008-03-29 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132754/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | archive-date = 2008-05-15 }}</ref> and his songwriting featured a prominent [[Beat generation|beat]] influence. The band themselves coined the label "low rock" to describe their music, which involved "a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a '[[power trio]]' not built around the sound of an [[electric guitar]]. Instead, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album."<ref>{{cite web | title = Morphine discography | first = Greg | last = Kot | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=morphine | publisher = TrouserPress.com | access-date = 2008-03-30}}</ref>

The band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially.  In the United States the band was embraced and promoted by the [[indie rock]] community, including [[National Public Radio|public]] and [[campus radio|college]] radio stations and [[MTV]]'s ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which the band once guest-hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in [[Belgium]], [[Russia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and [[Australia]].

==History==
===Formation, independent years (1989–1996)===
Morphine was formed in 1989 by bassist and vocalist Mark Sandman, a member of the bluesy alternative rock band [[Treat Her Right]], saxophonist Dana Colley, a former member of the local Boston group Three Colors, and drummer Jerome Deupree, who had played with Sandman in the Hypnosonics.  Sandman, a prolific musician who frequently experimented with home-made instruments, played a single-stringed bass guitar of his own devising with a [[slide guitar|slide]], although he later added a second string.  Deupree briefly left the group for health reasons in 1991 and was temporarily replaced by Treat Her Right drummer [[Billy Conway (drummer)|Billy Conway]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=873}}</ref>  These years found the group building a strong local audience and touring occasionally.

With Deupree returning, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Good (Morphine album)|Good]]'', for the Boston-based Accurate/Distortion label in 1991.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album received positive reviews and increased the band's audience. The band subsequently signed to [[Rykodisc]], who re-released ''Good'' under its own imprint.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| page= 661| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

''[[Cure for Pain]]'', 1993's followup,<ref name="Larkin"/> increased the band's audience outside of [[New England]], and singles like "Thursday" and "Buena" picked up some college radio play.  During the recording of ''Cure for Pain'', Deupree was again replaced by Conway, although Deupree still played most of the percussion work on the album.  After the album was completed, the band toured the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.

In 1994, five songs from the album were prominently featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]''.  The band returned to the studio in 1995 and produced ''[[Yes (Morphine album)|Yes]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album featured the single "Honey White," the music video for which appeared on the [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', as had "Thursday". It also included "I Had My Chance," which was featured on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]''.

===DreamWorks Records years (1997–1999)===
After two years of touring, Morphine signed with [[DreamWorks Records]], who released their major label debut, ''[[Like Swimming]]'', in 1997.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> It was a critical success, but did not break the band into the domestic mainstream as had been hoped. DreamWorks released a music video for the single "Early to Bed"; directed by [[Jamie Caliri]] and released in March 1997, the nightmarish yet humorous video became an instant favorite among fans and was later nominated for a [[Grammy awards|Grammy award]].  The band also released ''[[B-Sides and Otherwise]]'', a collection of B-sides and live recordings, on Rykodisc this same year.

In the following time, Deupree once again began performing live and in the studio with the band, making the group a four-piece.  The band's final studio album, ''[[The Night (Morphine album)|The Night]]'', was completed in early 1999.

On July 3, 1999, Sandman collapsed on the stage of the [[:it:Nel Nome del Rock|Nel Nome del Rock]] festival at the Giardini del Principe in [[Palestrina]], [[Italy]], outside of [[Rome]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> He was soon pronounced dead of a heart attack and Morphine immediately disbanded. ''The Night'' was released in 2000.  Posthumous Morphine releases followed shortly thereafter, including ''[[Bootleg Detroit]]'', an "official live bootleg", and ''[[The Best of Morphine: 1992–1995]]'', both on Rykodisc.

===Posthumous projects (1999–present)===
[[File:Dana Colley in BA - 2011.jpg|thumb|180px|Dana Colley performing with the posthumous Members of Morphine project in 2011]]
Within a year of Sandman's death, Colley and Conway created '''Orchestra Morphine''', a group of Sandman's friends and colleagues who toured to celebrate the music of the band and to raise funds for the Mark Sandman Music Education Fund. Orchestra Morphine mostly performed music from ''The Night'', but also included some other Morphine and Hypnosonics material as well.  Orchestra Morphine still performs occasionally but no longer tours.  Singer and guitarist [[Laurie Sargent]], a member of Orchestra Morphine and former vocalist for the band [[Face to Face (new wave band)|Face to Face]], later joined Colley and Conway in their first post-Morphine musical endeavor, [[Twinemen]].

Conway and Colley also officially formed the [[Hi-n-Dry]] [[independent record label]] and studio, converting Sandman's workspace into a commercial enterprise. The label's roster includes a number of their friends, colleagues and other Boston-area musicians.  In 2004, Hi-n-Dry released the Mark Sandman box set ''Sandbox'', which contained two CDs and a DVD of previously unreleased material spanning Sandman's musical career. The DVD featured clips from early Sandman shows, interviews from the Morphine tours, and various videos from other Sandman solo and group projects, such as Treat Her Right. However, for copyright reasons the box set did not contain any previously released material found in the Morphine catalog, Morphine videos, or promotional material produced by Rykodisc or DreamWorks Records.

Deupree continued to record with various jazz musicians.

In 2009, Colley and Deupree began regularly performing Morphine songs and new material as '''Members of Morphine''' (alternately, the Ever-Expanding Elastic Waste Band), with singer, bassist and guitarist [[Jeremy Lyons]] of [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unity.edu/NewsEvents/News/UCCPAReunion609.aspx |title=Surviving Members of Morphine to Play UCCPA on Saturday, June 27 |publisher=Unity College |access-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720094425/http://www.unity.edu/NewsEvents/News/UCCPAReunion609.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-20 }}</ref>  In July 2009, the group played at Nel Nome Del Rock Festival in Palestrina, Italy, marking the ten-year anniversary of Sandman's death at the location in which it occurred.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/membersofmorphine |title=Myspace.com |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref> As of 2014, the group was renamed [[Vapors of Morphine]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20140416/Entertainment/140417005 |newspaper=Patriot Ledger |first=Chad |last=Berndtson |title=Vapors of Morphine makes it a point to keep the music fresh |access-date=2012-12-02}}</ref> and regularly performs in Boston and New Orleans, and holds a standing weekly gig at Atwood's Tavern in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/01/08/vapors-morphine-home-atwood-any-night/2DfssHaadUGocd8moJWJ4I/story.html|first=Sean L. |last=Maloney |newspaper=Boston Globe |title=Vapors of Morphine at home at Atwood's|access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref>

In 2009, [[Rhino Records]] released the two-disc set ''At Your Service'', composed of unreleased Morphine material.

As of 1999, Morphine has sold over 807,000 records in the United States, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggEAAAAMBAJ&q=good+morphine+soundscan&pg=PA11|title=DreamWorks Plans New Morphine Set|work=Billboard|first=Carrie|last=Bell|date=18 December 1999|page=11|access-date=14 October 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Instruments==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Morphine's instrumentation was unusual for a rock band: Sandman's primary instrument was a two-string [[bass guitar]] (with the strings usually tuned to a 5th or octave interval) played with a slide; however, on the group's records he added touches of [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[electronic organ]], and other self-invented guitar instruments such as the tritar, featuring two guitar strings and one bass string. Colley played primarily [[baritone saxophone]], along with soprano or tenor saxes, and the rare [[bass saxophone]], and he sometimes played two saxes at once, a la [[Roland Kirk]]; he also played occasional [[percussion]], and [[Dobro]] on a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].
