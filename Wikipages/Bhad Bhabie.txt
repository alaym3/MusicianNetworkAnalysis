On September 14, 2016, Bregoli and her mother Barbara Ann were interviewed on ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' for a segment titled "I Want to Give Up My Car-Stealing, Knife-Wielding, Twerking 13-Year-Old Daughter Who Tried to Frame Me for a Crime". They appeared on the show to discuss Bregoli's behavior, which included stealing a crew member's car while the episode was being filmed. When Bregoli became irritated at the audience's laughter, she responded to them by saying "Catch me outside, how about that?", jokingly challenging them to a fight outside the studio. Her accent made the phrase sound like "Cash me ousside, how bout dah", which became a meme, and Bregoli became known as the "'Cash Me Outside' Girl".<ref>{{cite news|last1=stubblebine|first1=allison|title=A Timeline of Danielle Bregoli's (a.k.a. the 'Cash Me Outside' Girl) Rise to Celebrity|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7968844/danielle-bregolis-cash-me-outside-girl-timeline|access-date=February 11, 2018|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Desantis|first=Rachel|title=Cash me ousside teen to Dr. Phil – You were nothing before me|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/02/10/cash-me-ousside-danielle-bregoli-dr-phil/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>Zimmerman, Amy (February 10, 2017).

Bregoli also released the trailer of her new reality show, ''[[Bringing Up Bhabie]]'', which would detail her daily life and her building her music career.
