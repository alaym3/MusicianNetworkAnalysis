'''''Caillou''''' ({{IPA-fr|kaˈju}}) is a Canadian [[educational television|educational]] [[children's television series]] that was first shown on [[Teletoon]] (both English and French versions), with its first episode airing on the former channel on September 15, 1997; the show later moved to [[Treehouse TV]], with its final episode being shown on that channel on October 3, 2010. The show was animated in Canada by [[Cookie Jar Entertainment|CINAR Corporation]] (later Cookie Jar Entertainment), In season 5, the show was animated by South African-based studio, [[Clockwork Zoo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationsa.org/community/press-releases/clockwork-zoo/clockwork-zoo-begins-key-animation-caillou|title=Clockwork Zoo begins key animation on Caillou &#124; Animation SA|date=January 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122212054/http://www.animationsa.org/community/press-releases/clockwork-zoo/clockwork-zoo-begins-key-animation-caillou|access-date=July 18, 2021|archive-date=January 22, 2010}}</ref> The show, based on the books by [[Hélène Desputeaux]],<ref name="RAAV2015"/><ref name="Devoir8-10-15"/> focuses on a four-year-old boy named Caillou who is fascinated by the world around him.

== Plot ==

Caillou lives with his mother, father, and younger sister, Rosie. He has many adventures with his family and friends, and uses his imagination in every episode.

Each episode in seasons 1 through 3 has a theme and is divided into several short sections that mix animation, puppet skits, and video of live-action children in real-life situations. In seasons 4 and 5, the episodes are divided into three short sections; the puppet segment was dropped, alongside the "Real Kids" version of the segment.

During the first season, many of the stories in the animated version began with a grandmother (who is also the show's narrator) introducing the story to her grandchildren, then reading the story from a book. Since the second season, the narrator and grandmother is an [[unseen character]].

Caillou is an imaginative four-year-old<ref name=About/> boy with a love for forms of transportive machinery such as rocket ships and airplanes.

== Production ==

''Caillou'' books have been published by Chouette Publishing Inc. since 1989.<ref name = "Baby Caillou">{{cite web |url=http://www.chouette-publishing.com/EN/caillou/history |title=Caillou - Creation |publisher=Chouette Publishing |access-date=October 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203002/http://www.chouette-publishing.com/EN/caillou/history |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The series was originally broadcast in French in Canada, and the episodes were later translated into English. The original books were also in French. ''Caillou'' was designed primarily for [[toddler]]s. It was created by child developmental psychologists. In 1997, 65 five-minute episodes of ''Caillou'' were aired in Canada and in selected markets worldwide, including the US. In 2000 there were 40 30-minute episodes of the show, containing a mixture of the five-minute episodes plus new stories, songs, real kids segment and puppets. This was followed by another 16 30-minute episodes containing all-new stories in 2003. The film ''Caillou's Holiday Movie'' was released on October 7, 2003. On April 3, 2006, a new set of 20 episodes finally premiered after a three-year hiatus. Caillou started attending preschool and there were new themes and a new opening. The show was renewed for a second and third season in 2003,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Caillou Back for Season Two|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/caillou-back-for-season-two/|last=Ball|first=Ryan|date=February 10, 2003|website=Animation Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=May 24, 2020}}</ref> and later a fourth season. The fifth season was animated by South Africa-based studio [[Clockwork Zoo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.toonboom.com/community/success-stories/clockwork-zoo|title=Leading the Animation Revolution in South Africa with Toon Boom|website=Toon Boom Animation|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2021|reason=The url redirects to https://www.toonboom.com/community for me}}

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
''Caillou'' initially received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children. The staff of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "Embellishing everything he sees with his rich imagination."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2012/08/01/caillou/|title=Caillou|last=EW Staff|date=August 1, 2012|website=EW.com|language=EN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "''Caillou'' looks at the world through the eyes of its 4-year-old namesake."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/tv/for-young-viewers-sharing-the-small-stuff.html|title=FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; Sharing the Small Stuff|date=October 7, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 17, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Lynne Heffley of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "''Caillou'' grows and learns to make sense of his world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-04-ca-15135-story.html|title=Kids' Series Give Gentle Life Lessons Television Review|last=Heffley|first=Lynne|date=September 4, 2000|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref>

==== Controversy ====
As the years progressed, the show became more publicly criticized. In a [[National Post|''National Post'']], writer Tristin Hopper identified ''Caillou'' to be "quite possibly the world's most universally reviled children's program." There were several "I hate Caillou" [[Facebook]] pages and petitions on [[Change.org]] for the show to stop airing. A common criticism towards the series is the "spoiled" behaviour of the titular character and the lack of consequences given within the parent characters.<ref name="NationalPost">{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Tristin|date=May 1, 2017|title=Caillou is an aggressively bad show ruining the world's children … and it's all Canada's fault|journal=[[National Post]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/analysis-caillou-is-an-aggressively-bad-show-ruining-the-worlds-children-and-its-all-canadas-fault|access-date=January 7, 2021}}</ref> 

Hopper once said: "Unlike most children's programming, Caillou makes almost no attempt to educate its young audience. There are no veiled math problems, spelling lessons or morality tales; it's just calm, non-threatening, bright-coloured people navigating everyday tasks." These criticisms of the show's titular character have been echoed on online platforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/this-is-how-much-people-hate-caillou_n_58d05f98e4b0be71dcf766a9 |title=This Is How Much People Hate 'Caillou' |date=2017-04-03 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|''Last Week Tonight'']], host [[John Oliver]] once described Caillou negatively.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.agonybooth.com/john-oliver-net-neutrality-video-35490 |title=John Oliver Presents The Only Interesting Story On Net Neutrality, Ever (Video) |language=en-US |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>

As Caillou appeared as a much younger child in the original line of children's books, he originally had no hair.
