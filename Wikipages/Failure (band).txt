'''Failure''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band from Los Angeles that was active from 1990 to 1997 and from 2014 to the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.radio.com/2014/02/28/failure-to-join-tool-on-u-s-tour/ |title=Failure to Join Tool on U.S. Tour « Radio.com |publisher=News.radio.com |date=2014-02-28 |access-date=2014-05-17}}</ref> They have released six full-length albums and five EPs.

==History==
===1992–1997: Formation, ''Comfort'', ''Magnified'' and ''Fantastic Planet''===
In 1992, Failure [[Recording contract|signed]] with [[Slash Records]] (an LA-based [[Independent record label|independent label]] whose releases were manufactured and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] in the United States), and went to [[Minnesota]] to record their debut album with producer [[Steve Albini]] at [[Pachyderm Studio]] that summer. [[Comfort (Failure album)|''Comfort'']] was released in September 1992, and around this same time, they went on their first of several tours with [[Tool (band)|Tool]].

The band were unsatisfied with the sound of ''Comfort'' and their lack of involvement in the mixing process; they wanted a more flattering, produced sound that went beyond Albini's style of essentially documenting a band's raw live sound.<ref name="TapeOpInterview">{{cite web |last1=Reyes-Kulkarni |first1=Saby |title=Ken Andrews: Perry Farrell, Creeper Lagoon, Pete Yorn |url=https://tapeop.com/interviews/34/ken-andrews/ |website=Tape Op |access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> So when the band went back into the studio in 1993, Andrews and Edwards took on the role of producers themselves. Midway through these sessions, Gauss left the band, so Edwards played some drums himself, until a replacement was found in Kellii Scott. Their second album, ''[[Magnified]]'', was released in March 1994; a [[music video|promotional video]] (the band's first) was made for the single "Undone", but it received little airtime, if any, on any of the traditional music video outlets. Critics took note of the sonic and musical advances achieved on ''Magnified'', and other more well-known musicians also began singing Failure's praises. That year, they again went on tour with Tool, and during Failure's set each night, Tool guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] came onstage to play rhythm guitar on the ''Comfort'' track "Macaque".

Anxious to build on the momentum afforded to them by the relative success of ''Magnified'', Andrews, Edwards, and Scott began recording again in 1995, this time in a rented home owned by [[Lita Ford]] in the hills just outside LA. With the band again producing themselves, and Andrews handling the lion's share of the engineering himself, the situation allowed the band to take far more time in recording than they ever had before, and follow their instincts as far as they chose without outside interference. As the recordings neared completion, they received word that their label's distribution deal with Warner had expired and would not be renewed. Since Failure was essentially sidelined while the owners of Slash were trying to negotiate a new distribution deal, the band members kept themselves busy with outside projects: Andrews and Edwards (and friends) recorded an album of [[Cover version|covers]] under the name [[Replicants (band)|Replicants]]; Andrews produced albums for [[Blinker the Star]] and Molly McGuire (the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]-based rock band, not the LA-based singer-songwriter); Scott did some session work. Meanwhile, the band continued to "unofficially" shop the record to other labels and industry personnel, while hoping that Warner would step up and release the album. In the spring of 1996, Warner did exactly that, agreeing to keep the Slash imprint one last time for Failure, and [[Fantastic Planet (album)|''Fantastic Planet'']] was released that August. Guitarist [[Troy Van Leeuwen]], a friend and former bandmate of Scott's, joined Failure around the time of the album's release. The album's first single, "[[Stuck on You (Failure song)|Stuck on You]]" (an appropriately catchy mid-[[tempo]] track that is a sublime metaphor for heroin addiction, exhibited by the lyric "Turn my nights to sleepless itch", a common side effect of opiate use, <ref>https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Failure/Stuck-on-You)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gardenstatetreatmentcenter.com/why-do-opiates-make-you-itchy/|title = Why do Opiates Make You Itchy?|date = January 16, 2021}}</ref> became a minor alternative-radio hit and achieved light to medium rotation on MTV, but failed to [[Billboard Hot 100|chart]] significantly. The song peaked at No.&nbsp;31 on the U.S. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock chart.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p21995/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[Allmusic]]</ref> Other songs, such as "Saturday Saviour" and "Pitiful", received some airplay from more adventurous-minded DJs, but no more videos were made for any of the album's tracks, and due to the state of disarray at their label at that time, little effort was put into its promotion.

In 1997, the band were asked by friends in the [[Industrial music|industrial]] rock band [[God Lives Underwater]] to contribute a track for a [[For the Masses|Depeche Mode tribute album]] that they were assembling; Failure chose to cover the 1990 hit "[[Enjoy the Silence]]", a worldwide smash and Depeche Mode's best-selling and most well-known single. The members of Depeche Mode were reportedly very pleased with the album, and with the Failure track particularly; [[Andrew Fletcher (musician)|Andrew Fletcher]] said that he actually prefers their cover over his band's original version.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  That summer, Failure also joined the [[Lollapalooza]] tour, during what became the last of that tour's travelling years. Originally booked to headline the side stage, Failure was promoted to also perform on the main stage to fill the void created when [[Korn]] dropped out; Failure played both an early afternoon set on the main stage and a longer headlining set in the evening on the side stage for the remainder of the tour.

On November 19, 1997, Failure officially announced that they had disbanded, citing personal differences.

===1997–2013: Post-breakup work===
Ken Andrews has gone on to become a well-known producer, engineer, and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixer]], and has been involved in several different music projects. [[On (band)|ON]] (1999–2002) was more or less a solo project, and was not unlike Failure, in terms of songwriting, but the overall sound was more based on [[Electronic music|electronics]], with less emphasis on guitars and the typical [[Hard rock|heavy rock]] sound. [[Year of the Rabbit (band)|Year of the Rabbit]] (2002–2004) saw Andrews' return to the four-piece rock band format, alongside ON's touring drummer, Tim Dow, and former members of [[National Skyline]] and Cupcakes; the harder-rocking sound of YotR is much closer to that of Failure, but the band lost momentum and eventually went on indefinite hiatus after their label, [[Elektra Records]], was ostensibly shut down by in the wake of its merger with [[Atlantic Records]]. Throughout all of this, Andrews has become increasingly sought-after for his production and mixing skills, and his résumé has expanded to include work on albums by [[Pete Yorn]], [[Paramore]], [[Candlebox]], [[Tenacious D]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], and [[Mae]], among many others. Also notable is his participation in the production of "[[You Know My Name]]", the theme for the 2006 [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', performed by then-former [[Soundgarden]]/[[Audioslave]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Currently, Andrews is performing as a solo artist, as well as collaborating in a self-described "digital band" called Los Angeles Digital Noise Academy, whose loose membership also includes [[Brad Laner]] ([[Medicine (band)|Medicine]]), Sharky Laguana ([[Creeper Lagoon]]), [[Charlotte Martin]] (whom Andrews married in 2005), and others. He released his first solo album, ''[[Secrets of the Lost Satellite]]'', in 2007. He has also started a label, Dinosaur Fight Records, which has released his solo album and Martin's, and has announced their intention to release the forthcoming LADNA album, as well.

Greg Edwards collaborated with fellow musicians [[Chris Pitman]], [[Brad Laner]], and [[Paul D'Amour]] in the [[psychedelic pop]] outfit Lusk, releasing the album [[Free Mars]] in 1997. In 2000, Edwards formed the band [[Autolux]] in with vocalist/bassist Eugene Goreshter and former [[Ednaswap]] drummer [[Carla Azar]]. Their self-produced, self-released 2001 EP ''Demonstration'' brought them to the attention of legendary producer [[T Bone Burnett]], who used his [[vanity label]] DMZ to secure them a contract with [[Sony BMG|Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] and produced their debut album, ''[[Future Perfect (Autolux album)|Future Perfect]]'', which was released in October 2004 to general critical praise. They were hand-picked by [[Trent Reznor]] to open for [[Nine Inch Nails]]' North American arena tour in the autumn of 2005, playing bottom of the bill before [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. In 2006, they collaborated on a few tracks with the British musical outfit [[Unkle]], for Unkle's 2007 release, [[War Stories (Album)|War Stories]]. After various delays, Autolux released their second album, [[Transit Transit]], in 2010.

Kellii Scott joined [[Blinker the Star]] after Failure's breakup, and then joined [[Campfire Girls (band)|Campfire Girls]] for their 2003 album, ''Tell Them Hi''. Scott also played on a track titled 'Best Friend' by [[Size 14]] bassist [[Robt Ptak]] on his solo project [[Artificial Joy]], Ptak put this on his own personal reverbnation page in 2013. As of 2005, he was playing drums for both [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] and [[Enemy (American band)|Enemy]]. In 2008, his most recent band The Brontosaur released their self-titled album. From 2008 to 2012 Kellii could be heard playing on all Linda Perry's recording sessions, most notably Christina Aguilera's song "You Lift Me Up" and Courtney Love's "Letter To God". And in 2013 he worked with the Dr Dre and a 72 piece orchestra at Capitol studios for a song on his upcoming album.

[[Troy Van Leeuwen]] first resurfaced in the original lineup of [[A Perfect Circle]], appearing on their debut album, [[Mer De Noms]] (2000), and on the subsequent tour. During the sessions for APC's second album, Van Leeuwen was extended an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]], which he accepted; he does appear on three tracks on the second APC album, ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'' (2003), but the included cover of Failure's "The Nurse Who Loved Me" is not one of them. He has remained with Queens of the Stone Age since then, first appearing on the tour for their 2002 album, ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'', but not on the album itself. Also, during this time, Van Leeuwen assembled [[Enemy (American band)|Enemy]], a vehicle in which he is the front man and guitarist; their debut album, ''Hooray for Dark Matter'', was released in October 2005. In 2008 Van Leeuwen formed the band [[Sweethead]] with vocalist [[Serrina Sims]], who also provided backing vocals on Queens of the Stone Age single [[Make It wit Chu]] on the album [[Era Vulgaris (album)|Era Vulgaris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudnoiseandpictures.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/troy-this-on-for-size/|title=Troy this on for size.|work=Loud Noise and Pictures|date=July 23, 2008}}</ref> in 2007. The bands roster was rounded up with [[Norm Block]] formerly of [[Plexi]] and Troy's former Enemy bandmate [[Eddie Nappi]].

In 2004, although the band had been inactive for many years, Andrews and Edwards got together to collaborate on a CD/DVD set entitled ''Golden'', which collects demos, [[outtake#Music|outtakes]], touring footage, both of the band's videos, and other rare material from the band's active period. Another posthumous compilation, a 2-CD set titled ''Essentials'', was assembled for release in 2006; the first disc contains selected tracks from Failure's three studio albums, and the second disc features the first official CD release of all four songs from their two pre-Slash singles, and the complete demos for ''Magnified''.  In 2008, a tribute album to Failure was released titled: "A Tribute to Failure: The Nurse Who Loved Me."  On June 8, 2010, Fantastic Planet was planned to be released on a 2LP vinyl set for the first time from Warner Bros.  Both Magnified and Comfort were released on LP for the first time in the second half of 2011 by ORG Music (Magnified was delayed until late 2013). The 2010 limited LP release of Fantastic Planet were in such high demand, that they were fetching hundreds of dollars online. In 2016 as part of their pledge project for ''The Heart Is A Monster'', the band re-released Fantastic Planet on vinyl once more.

===2013–2017: Reunion, ''The Heart is a Monster''===

After the first leg, starting in March and culminating with the "Cinquanta" shows on May 10 and 11 at The Greek Theater in Los Angeles, Failure's separate "Tree of Stars" tour took place during May and June 2014 for 18 performances.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tilles|first=Jay|title=Failure Announce North American Tour|url=http://radio.com/2014/04/07/failure-announce-north-american-tour/|publisher=radio.com|access-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> A tour exclusive EP entitled ''Tree of Stars'' was available during this leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=318720964945576 |title=Failure |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2014-05-17}}</ref> The EP contains 4 live tracks and their first new song since ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]'', entitled "Come Crashing". On May 14, Failure released the track on their Bandcamp following with "The Focus" on July 14, 2014.  Failure commenced work on their fourth album in late 2014, which was significant as their first album in over eighteen years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smellslikeinfinitesadness.com/ken-andrews-interview-failure-frontman-discusses-bands-reunion/|title=Ken Andrews Interview: Failure Frontman Discusses Band's Reunion|work=Smells Like Infinite Sadness|date=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

On March 30, Failure announced their fourth studio album ''[[The Heart Is a Monster]],'' spanning 18 tracks, which was released on June 30 through INgrooves. This announcement coincided with the release of the new single "Hot Traveler," which the band debuted at SXSW earlier that month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/failure-announces-new-first-new-album-in-19-years-premieres-hot-traveler-listen/|title=Failure announces first new album in 19 years, premieres "Hot Traveler" — listen - Consequence of Sound|work=Consequence of Sound|date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> Troy Van Leeuwen was not cited as returning to the band, however, he contributed guitar work on several tracks of the new album.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terich|first1=Jeff|title=Failure: The Heart is a Monster|date=June 30, 2015|url=http://www.treblezine.com/reviews/23962-failure-the-heart-is-a-monster-review/|publisher=treble|access-date=8 July 2015}}</ref> Despite this, Failure announced that Van Leeuwen would participate in its October 2015 tour. In summer 2016 Failure announced an October tour where they would be playing Fantastic Planet in its entirety to celebrate the album's 20 year anniversary. On Thanksgiving 2016, Failure announced they'd be releasing Fantastic Planet live, using tracks recorded during the Fantastic Planet Anniversary tour.

===2018–present: ''In the Future Your Body Will Be the Furthest Thing from Your Mind'' and ''Wild Type Droid''===
On December 8, 2017, Failure's [[Slash Records]] albums were acquired by [[PIAS Recordings]], as part of [[Warner Music Group]]'s divestment of artist catalogues to indie labels. On March 14, 2018, Failure announced a series of four EPs, with the first, ''In The Future'', released on March 30. The remaining three will be released throughout 2018 and will eventually culminate in a complete full-length studio album later in the year. The second EP, ''Your Body Will Be'', was released on May 25, 2018, and the third, ''The Furthest Thing'', was released on September 14, 2018.

In support of the new album, Failure embarked on a 29 city tour starting March 11, 2019 and ending April 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/failure-swervedriver-tour-786501/|website=www.rollingstone.com|title=Failure, Swervedriver Team for Spring North American Tour|date=January 30, 2019}}</ref>  They were joined by [[Swervedriver]] as a supporting act on the tour. On December 16, 2019, Failure announced their vinyl box set Failure 1992–1996, which includes their albums ''Comfort'', ''Magnified'', and ''Fantastic Planet''. The band will embark on 2020 residency shows in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in support of its release.

On July 3, 2020, the band released a re-recorded cover of "[[Enjoy the Silence]]", titled "Enjoy the Silence 2020". Failure had originally covered the song in 1998 for the tribute album ''[[For the Masses]]'' and re-recorded the song due to the album being hard to find, being out of print for several years and not available on streaming sites. Ken Andrews stated that Failure received the blessing of [[Depeche Mode]] for the updated cover.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/07/failure-shares-cover-of-depeche-modes-enjoy-the-silence/|title=Failure Shares Cover of 'Enjoy the Silence'|date=July 3, 2020|access-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref>

Ken Andrews appeared on a podcast by [[Shiner (band)|Shiner]]'s Allen Epley on April 26, 2021, stating that Failure is currently working on music for an upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thirdgearscratch.libsyn.com/episode-90-ken-andrews|title=Third Gear Scratch: Episode 90 - Ken Andrews|access-date=2020-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510102823/https://thirdgearscratch.libsyn.com/episode-90-ken-andrews|archive-date=2021-05-10}}</ref>

Failure's sixth studio album ''Wild Type Droid'' is set for release December 3, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/failure-new-album-wild-type-droid-1256836/|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|title=Reunited Space Rock Trio Failure Return With New Album ‘Wild Type Droid’|date=November 12, 2021}}</ref>

==Controversies==
''The Heart is a Monster'', ''Fantastic Planet Live'', and ''In The Future Your Body Will Be The Furthest Thing From Your Mind'' were all funded from [[PledgeMusic]], a crowdfunding website.  The campaigns for ''The Heart is a Monster'' and ''Fantastic Planet Live'' were both successfully completed with all the crowdfunding rewards issued to backers.  On March 5, 2019, an email alerted users of PledgeMusic that Failure was not paid at the end of the campaign for ''In The Future...'' and backers should seek remedies from their credit card companies if not too late.  Failure instead sold the campaign merchandise directly from their own website and during the following tour while PledgeMusic declared bankruptcy in May 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lott |first1=Roy |title=Failure Tell Fans Physical Item Orders From In The Future Your Body Will Be The Furthest Thing From Your Mind Campaign Cannot be Fulfilled Due to PledgeMusic Financial Issues |date=March 5, 2019 |url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2019/03/05/news/failure-tell-fans-physical-item-orders-from-in-the-future-your-body-will-be-the-furthest-thing-from-your-mind-campaign-cannot-be-fulfilled-due-to-pledgemusic-financial-issues/ |publisher=mxdwn.com |access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>  In November 2019, Ken Andrews released a statement about the aftermath of the PledgeMusic bankruptcy stating that a major label's artists got refunded from the bankruptcy while independent and self-funded musicians were left out.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thiessen |first1=Brock |title=Failure's Ken Andrews Pens Scathing Open Letter Demanding Justice over PlegeMusic Closure |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/failures_ken_andrews_pens_scathing_open_letter_over_plegemusic_fallout |website=Exclaim! |publisher=Exclaim!
