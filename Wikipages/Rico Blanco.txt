In May 2007, Blanco announced his departure from Rivermaya.

It was coincidental that Rico's first gig as singer for Rivermaya was also held at the Metro Bar (formerly known as ''"Kampo"''). Furthermore, first ever Rivermaya gig (where Blanco was keyboardist) was in [[Las Piñas]] in 1993 where the band was the opening act for [[Eraserheads]].

Critics and music fans immediately hail it as a "neo-epic". {{Citation needed|reason=please provide a source which called it a "neo-epic."|date=July 2019}} The song won a host of awards, among them 4 major Awit awards including Song of the Year. His first album titled ''[[Your Universe]]'' was released on August 8, 2008. The 10-track CD is a unique fusion of diverse sounds, among them the ethno-rock ''"Yugto"'', the heart-tugging title track ''"Your Universe"'', the rockabilly/punk feel of ''"Ayuz"'', the sweet, Pinoy-folk ''"Para Hindi Ka Mawala"'', and the sing-along anthem ''"Antukin"''. Also notable is his return to his roots as a keyboard player as evidenced by the infusion of synthesizer and electronic elements throughout the album. Incidentally, Warner Music Philippines are known for disbanding bands and turning their respective lead vocalists into solo artists.

Rico's live band was usually composed of Robert de la Cruz (of Queso and Skychurch) on drums and Ricci Gurango (formerly of Hungry Young Poets and Mojofly) on bass, while Rico plays guitars and keyboards. Many other session musicians join him on stage from time to time.

In November 2008, Blanco won the "Vocalist of the Year" award in the [[NU Rock Awards]]. In December 2008, he was heralded [[Monster Radio RX 93.1|RX93.1]] "OPM Solo Artist of the Year''.
