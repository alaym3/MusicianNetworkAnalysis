Tillman was raised in a Baptist church, attended an Episcopal elementary school, then a Pentecostal Messianic day school.<ref name=LATimes-Introspection-2009 /> Tillman said he was naive when he was growing up because there was limited cultural influence and no secular music allowed. Around the age of 17, there were new stipulations from his parents – he was allowed to listen to secular music that had a "spiritual theme". For this reason, his early purchases included albums like [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Slow Train Coming]]'' as he was able to establish that Dylan was classified as a "Christian artist".<ref name=WTF />

==Career==

===Early career and Fleet Foxes (2004–2012)===
After attending [[Nyack College]] in New York for a year,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/father-john-misty-just-quit-fleet-foxes-we-get-high-in-his-van-2405501|title=Father John Misty Just Quit Fleet Foxes: We Get High in His Van|last1=Frank|first1=Aaron|date=May 3, 2012|work=L.A.

Tillman Career |publisher=CMT |access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> Tillman moved to [[Seattle]] when he was 21.<ref name=WTF /> He found a job there working at a bakery, which allowed him to record at night before his 4:30&nbsp;am shift began. A demo he made eventually found its way to Seattle singer and songwriter [[Damien Jurado]]. A year later Tillman started opening for Jurado.<ref name="westernvinyl">{{cite web|url=http://westernvinyl.com/artists/j-till.html |title=J. Tillman |publisher=Western Vinyl |date=April 27, 2009 |access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> At shows Tillman would distribute CD-R copies of songs that would later become his album ''I Will Return''. During the tour, he also struck up a friendship with Eric Fisher, who produced another CD-R album, ''Long May You Run''. Both albums were later released on Keep Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtillmanmusic.com/ |title=J. Tillman – Discount Priced CDs |publisher=J Tillman Music |access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> Tillman and Jurado both later signed on for a U.S. tour with [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]].<ref name="autogenerated"/>

In 2006, the independent label Fargo Records released Tillman's first properly distributed solo album, ''Minor Works'', and reissued ''I Will Return'' and ''Long May You Run'' as a two-disc set the same year. In 2007, [[Yer Bird Records]] released his more elaborately arranged fourth album, ''Cancer and Delirium''.<ref name="autogenerated"/>

After signing to independent record label [[Western Vinyl]], Tillman released two albums in 2009, ''Vacilando Territory Blues'' and ''Year in the Kingdom''.<ref name="westernvinyl"/> Tillman said he wrote the title track of ''Vacilando Territory Blues'' to describe imagery he associates with his move to Seattle. His brother Zach subsequently moved there as well<ref name=thelineofbestfit /> and is now in the musical group Pearly Gate Music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barsuk.com/bands/pearlygatemusic|title=Pearly Gate Music|website=Barsuk.com|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref> The following year Tillman released ''Singing Ax''.<ref name="westernvinyl"/>

In 2008, Tillman joined Seattle [[folk rock]] band [[Fleet Foxes]] as their drummer.<ref name=LATimes-Introspection-2009>{{cite news|last1=Ducker|first1=George|title=Introspection pays: Sad folk ballads of J.

===Father John Misty moniker and ''Fear Fun'' (2012–2015)===
[[File:J. Tillman 2014.jpg|thumb|200px|Father John Misty performing at the Utopia Fest in 2014.]]
After leaving Fleet Foxes, Tillman moved to [[Los Angeles]] and signed to new label [[Sub Pop]]. Unsatisfied with pleased with the slow and sad music he previously put out, he adopted a new moniker called Father John Misty. The first album ''[[Fear Fun]]'' under his new moniker was released on May 1, 2012.<ref name=FJM>{{cite web|url=http://fatherjohnmisty.com/ |title=Father John Misty Website – Very Important Info! |publisher=FatherJohnMisty.com |access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> A couple of months prior to the release of the album a video was released for the song "Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings" starring ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''{{'}}s [[Aubrey Plaza]].

The "Limited Run Promotional Poster" was available at the artist's website, and promoted a purported release called ''New Winter'', described as a "Christmas Neu-Jazz Double Album", and quoted several paradoxes and reviews (for example, from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', calling it the "new standard by which all seasonal music must now be measured", or from [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], giving the release 10 out of 10 points and calling it "[e]ssential year-round listening"). The poster text further states that the release will be sold as "compact disc" as well as "[l]imited edition prismatic hologram 6xLP on merlot and emerald semi-translucent 180 gram vinyl with original alternate-side etchings by Josh Tillman available till[sic] supplies last". The poster names five songs that are part of the track list: "Gesture I: Inoculation (Mother And Child)", "Gesture II: Feast Of Spirits", "Anacrusis Future Seed", "Naked Fire/The Fifth Season" and "Gemini".<ref>{{cite web|title='New Winter' Christmas Neu-Jazz Double Album Promotional POSTER|url=http://fatherjohnmisty.merchline.com/products/new-winter-poster|access-date=February 17, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218002356/http://fatherjohnmisty.merchline.com/products/new-winter-poster|archive-date=February 18, 2015}}</ref>

===Subsequent Father John Misty studio albums (2015–2018)===
[[File:Father John Misty, 2015.jpg|thumb|Father John Misty performing at Fairgrounds Festival in December 2015.]]
The album ''[[I Love You, Honeybear]]'' was released in February 2015 to widespread acclaim. According to Tillman, it is a [[concept album]] about himself and his personal life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subpop.com/releases/father_john_misty/i_love_you_honeybear |title=Sub Pop Records : Father John Misty : I Love You, Honeybear |publisher=[[Sub Pop]] |date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=December 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/31/father-john-misty-josh-tillman-fleet-foxes|title = Father John Misty: 'I just wanted to write about love without bullshitting'|date = January 31, 2015|newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|last1 = Samadder|first1 = Rhik}}</ref> Tillman made headlines by covering Taylor Swift's "Blank Space" and "Welcome to New York" in 2015. He claimed to have never listened to the artist prior to recording the covers. This was done as a parody of [[Ryan Adams]], who had released his own version of Swift's [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|''1989'']], featuring covers of every song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6722745/father-john-misty-taylor-swift-covers|title=Father John Misty Finally Explains Taylor Swift Covers & Her Team's Reaction|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 9, 2015|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref> Tillman released a new song entitled "Real Love Baby" on May 19, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/65580-father-john-misty-shares-real-love-baby-listen/ |title=Father John Misty Shares 'Real Love Baby': Listen |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |first1=Evan |last1=Minsker |date=May 19, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> He appeared on the song "Saturday Night Inside Out" on [[The Avalanches]]' second studio album ''[[Wildflower (The Avalanches album)|Wildflower]]'', which was released on July 1, 2016.

Tillman gained media attention on July 22, 2016, after walking off stage at [[XPoNential Music Festival]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]], after twenty minutes into his planned fifty-minute performance.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/07/father-john-misty-went-full-troll-mode-for-his-set-at-philadelphias-xpn-festival/ |title=Father John Misty went full troll mode for his set at Philadelphia's XPN Festival |magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]] |first1=Alex |last1=Young |date=July 23, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> Instead of performing his setlist, Tillman walked out and asked, "What the fuck is going on?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inthemix/Father-John-Misty-upending-expectations-at-the-Xponential-Fest.html |title=Father John Misty, upending expectations at Xponential Fest |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |first1=Dan |last1=DeLuca |date=July 23, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> He then talked for six minutes about the "numbing" role entertainment plays in our lives and how "stupidity just fucking runs the world because entertainment is stupid." When the audience applauded him he asked them not to and responded by saying, "Maybe just take a moment to be really fucking profoundly sad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/67018-father-john-misty-explains-obscenely-vulnerable-festival-performance/ |title=Father John Misty Explains 'Obscenely Vulnerable' Festival Performance |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |first1=Evan |last1=Minsker |date=July 23, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> He finally played a thirteen-minute piece from his then-upcoming album ''[[Pure Comedy]]'' called "Leaving LA" which references the frustrations he spoke of during his speech. Tillman then covered [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Bird on the Wire]]" before telling the crowd he loved them and walked off the stage, cutting his performance short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/67014-father-john-misty-cuts-festival-set-short-after-lecture-about-evil-watch/ |title=Father John Misty Cuts Festival Set Short After Lecture About "Evil": Watch |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |first1=Evan |last1=Minsker |date=July 23, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> The following day, Tillman explained his performance in an Instagram post, in which he called [[Donald Trump]]'s [[2016 Republican National Convention#Donald Trump's speech|speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention]] a "demonic clown pageant coronation of our next potential Idiot King", which took place the night before Tillman's performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minsker|first1=Evan|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/67018-father-john-misty-explains-obscenely-vulnerable-festival-performance/|title=Father John Misty Explains "Obscenely Vulnerable" Festival Performance|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=July 23, 2016|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>

In September 2016, his voice and likeness were featured in [[Brad Neely]]'s [[Animated series|animated]] [[Surreal humour|surreal comedy]] [[variety show]] [[Brad Neely's Harg Nallin' Sclopio Peepio|''Harg Nallin' Sclopio Peepio'']] on [[Adult Swim]]. In the first-season finale episode ''For Alba'', he sings a song titled "This is America" (not affiliated with [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]]'s 2018 single "[[This Is America (song)|This is America]]"). The song features an animated Father John Misty singing what appears to be a humorous parody of his music, with lyrics most likely written by Brad Neely.
