{{Nihongo|'''One Ok Rock'''|ワンオクロック |Wan Oku Roku | lead=yes}} (stylized in all caps as '''ONE OK ROCK''') is a Japanese [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Tokyo]], Japan in 2005. The band currently consists of vocalist [[Takahiro Moriuchi]], guitarist and [[bandleader]] [[Toru Yamashita]], bassist [[Ryota Kohama]], and drummer [[Tomoya Kanki]]. They play varied styles of music, with songs ranging from [[alternative rock]] and [[emo]] to [[post-hardcore]] and [[pop rock]].<ref name="OOR-JaME USA">{{cite web|website=JaME USA|url=http://jame-world.com/us/artists-overview-700-one-ok-rock.html|title=ONE OK ROCK Overview|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ambitions-mw0003002723|title=Ambitions - ONE OK ROCK Reviews|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 11, 2017|last=Yeung|first=Neil Z.}}</ref>

The band's name comes from "one o'clock", the time that the band used to practice their music on weekends. They chose to play at one o'clock in the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during such hours. However, noticing that the [[Japanese language]] made no distinction between R's and L's, "O'CLOCK" transformed into "O'CROCK" or "O'KROCK", which later transformed into "OK ROCK".<ref name="Jame Interview"/> In addition, One Ok Rock can be expressed as "10969" ([[Japanese wordplay#Numeric substitution|wan-ō-ku-ro-ku]]). The band uses both Japanese and English lyrics in their songs.

One Ok Rock rose to international fame with their 2012 single "[[The Beginning (One Ok Rock song)|The Beginning]]" from their sixth album ''[[Jinsei×Boku=]]'', led them to concerts and [[music festival]]s outside Asia. Following the success, the band started to release their later albums in two versions (Japanese-English and full English) with 2 to 3 different tracks in each version. Their seventh studio album, ''[[35xxxv]]'', became their first album which charted on [[Billboard charts|US ''Billboard'']]. It peaked at No. 11 on [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/one-ok-rock/chart-history/TLN |title=Heatseekers Albums {{!}} Chart History|magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> No. 43 on [[Independent Albums]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/one-ok-rock/chart-history/IND |title=Independent Albums {{!}} Chart History|magazine=Billboard |date=February 28, 2015 |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> No. 23 on the [[Billboard charts#Albums|Hard Rock Albums]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/one-ok-rock/chart-history/MTL |title=Hard Rock Albums {{!}} Chart History |magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> and No. 1 on the [[Billboard charts#Albums|World Albums]] Chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/one-ok-rock/chart-history/WLP |title=World Albums {{!}} Chart History |magazine=Billboard |date=February 28, 2015 |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> The band's eighth album, ''[[Ambitions (One Ok Rock album)|Ambitions]]'', debuted at No. 106 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/one-ok-rock/chart-history/TLP|title=Billboard 200 {{!}} Chart History |magazine=Billboard |date=January 15, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref> and international charts while incorporated more American pop and pop-rock. In 2019, the band adopted [[Electronic music|electronic]] and pop sound on ninth album ''[[Eye of the Storm (One Ok Rock album)|Eye of the Storm]]''.

==History==
=== 2005–2006: Formation and earlier days ===
The foundation for One Ok Rock began when Toru Yamashita, then a high school student, wanted to start a band. He told his friend Ryota Kohama, a fellow member of the [[hip-hop dance]] group Heads, to learn the bass and asked Alexander Onizawa, who was their senior in school to join. He asked his classmate, Yu Koyanagi, to play drums. At that time, Takahiro Moriuchi was playing with another band, but Yamashita insisted that he join One Ok Rock instead. After signing with [[Amuse, Inc.]] Koyanagi left the band to pursue an acting career. Tomoya Kanki was a student at the ESP (Musical Academy) and was already in a band that wasn't going well. He then joined One Ok Rock in 2006, and became an official member when they debuted in 2007.<ref name="Jame Interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.jame-world.com/uk/articles-4982-interview-with-one-ok-rock-in-tokyo.html |interviewer=Non-Non |author=One OK Rock| title=Interview with One Ok Rock in Tokyo |date=June 21, 2008 |work=JaME World| access-date=December 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>''[[Rockin'On Japan]]'' Magazine, June 2012 Edition: Interview with ONE OK ROCK</ref>

=== 2007–2009: Early releases and departure of Onizawa ===
Their debut single, "Naihishinsho", reached number 48 on the [[Oricon]] Charts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/395502/products/703506/1/|title=内秘心書|publisher=Oricon|access-date=August 10, 2016|language=ja}}</ref> and sold 15,000 copies. Their second single, Yume Yume, followed that success and charted at number 43. After those singles, they released their debut album ''[[Zeitakubyō]]'' in 2007 and had their first tour, the ''Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya Quattro Tour''. They released their second album ''[[Beam of Light]]''  in May 2008. In an interview with ''[[Rockin'On Japan]]'' magazine in June 2012, One Ok Rock said they didn't count this album as an album, but rather as a part of growing up as a band.<ref name="Rockin'On Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://ryeon.tumblr.com/post/28895843798/rockinon-japan-june-oor-interview-part-3 |title=蓮 - Rockin'On Japan: June OOR Interview part 3 |website=Ryeon.tumblr.com |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> When they made the album, they hadn't been in the right mood, but felt that they had to make it to grow as a band. The band came up with many sound sources and ended up making a punk album. The album's confused origins were the reason why they wouldn't play any songs from Beam of Light in live performances until now. Shortly after releasing ''Beam of Light'', they performed a gig at Shibuya AX.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-5870-one-ok-rock-at-shibuya-ax.html |title=ONE OK ROCK at Shibuya AX &#124; JaME U.S.A |website=Jame-world.com |date=October 18, 2008 |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref>

They had planned to release two albums in that one year, so they released ''[[Kanjō Effect]]'' in November 2008. At this point, the band had gained more experience and were able to do some more serious recording. They settled into the western sound they loved and followed by replacing all their engineers and introducing their music to new producers. This led to division within the band due to Moriuchi and Onizawa's disagreement about how to make the album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

On April 5, 2009, Onizawa was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a train.<ref name="tokyograh-arrest">{{cite web |title=ONE OK ROCK member arrested for groping |url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-4609 |publisher=TokyoGraph |access-date=July 21, 2010}}</ref> He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court.<ref name="tokyograph-summer">{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-4802 |title=ONE OK ROCK to return in summer, minus ALEX |publisher=Tokyograph |date=May 15, 2009 |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> The band's next single, "Around the World Shounen", which was planned for a May 6 release as the theme song for the [[Japanese television drama|TV drama]] ''[[GodHand Teru]]'', and their nationwide tour were both cancelled.<ref name="tokyograh-arrest"/> In May 2009, it was announced that One Ok Rock would continue on without Onizawa, who went back to the United States.<ref name="tokyograph-summer"/> Yamashita took his place as lead guitar, and the band re-arranged their songs to be played for one guitar.

=== 2010–2012: ''Niche Syndrome'', music festivals, and ''Zankyo Reference'' ===
With the new four-member formation, One Ok Rock released the single "Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer" on February 3, 2010. The song peaked at number nine on the ''Oricon'' Singles Chart in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/395502/products/852376/1/|title=ONE OK ROCK 完全感覚Dreamer·ランキング|trans-title=ONE OK ROCK - 'Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer' Ranking|work=Oricon|language=Japanese|date=February 15, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2020}}</ref> After four months, the band released their fourth studio album titled ''[[Niche Syndrome]]''.
