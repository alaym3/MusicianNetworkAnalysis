''' Jung Ho-seok ''' ({{Korean|hangul=정호석}}; born February 18, 1994), better known by his stage name '''J-Hope''' (stylized as '''j-hope'''), is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, dancer and record producer. In 2013, he made his debut as a member of South Korean boy band [[BTS]], under [[Big Hit Entertainment]].<!-- Big Hit Music is incorrect as the label was called Big Hit Entertainment when BTS debuted. Please do not change it -->

J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, ''[[Hope World]]'', in 2018. The album was met with a positive reception, and its subsequent debut and peak at numbers 63 and 38 respectively, made him the highest-charting solo Korean artist on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at the time. In September 2019, he released the single "[[Chicken Noodle Soup (J-Hope song)|Chicken Noodle Soup]]" featuring [[Becky G]]. It debuted at number 81 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], which made him the first member of BTS with a Hot 100 hit under his own name.<ref name=":1">Billboard Hot 100 chart references:
