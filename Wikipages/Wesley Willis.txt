'''Wesley Lawrence Willis''' (May 31, 1963&nbsp;–&nbsp;August 21, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter and visual artist. Diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] in 1989, Willis began a career as an [[underground music|underground]] singer-songwriter in the [[outsider music]] tradition. Willis' songs are typically partially spoken in an [[Master of ceremonies#Hip hop|MC style]], and partially sung in a nasal and out-of-tune manner reminiscent of [[punk rock]] vocals. They feature bizarre, humorous and sometimes obscene or absurd lyrics sung over melodies created by using the [[Electronic keyboard#Concepts and definitions|auto accompaniment]] feature on his [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] KN [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]]. His songs cover a wide variety of topics, with [[mental illness]] and [[consumerism]] being the most prominent themes.<ref name=joyrides>{{cite web |url=http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |title=Wesley Willis's Joy Rides · Wesley Willis Bio |publisher=Wesleywillissjoyrides.com |access-date=November 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231454/http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=alttent>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419030840/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 19, 2006 |title=Bands |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |access-date=November 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=ymarks>{{cite web |url=http://ymarksthespot.org/2010/07/31/say-rah-discussing-the-daddy-of-rock-n-roll-with-the-directors-of-wesley-williss-joy-rides-2/ |title=Say Rah!

Willis gained a large [[cult following]] in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 ''[[Greatest Hits (Wesley Willis album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] label. [[Jello Biafra]] compiled the album's track list.<ref name=alttent /><ref name=ymarks /> In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own [[punk rock]] band, the [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]], during the 1990s.<ref name=ymarks /> He was a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings,<ref name=ymarks /> most of them depicting Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.<ref name=joyrides />

Despite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media. For example, music software company [[Nullsoft]] took their slogan "It really whips the llama's ass!" for [[Winamp]] from Willis's song "Whip the Llama's Ass".<ref name="AutoMZ-17">DEMO.MP3 15,592 bytes, 32 kbit/s, 22&nbsp;kHz, recorded in "1997" "Exclusively for Nullsoft" by JJ McKay.

During childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago [[public-access television|public access]] documentary feature created by Carl W. Hart titled ''Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets''.<ref name="Hart">{{cite news|title=Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets|last=Hart|first=Carl|publisher=Chicago Public Access TV}}</ref> In ''Artist of the Streets'', he was shown walking through Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] neighborhood, producing his [[fountain pen|ink pen]] drawings outside of the [[Marshall Field and Company Building]], and interacting with people curious about his art.<ref name="Hart"/> The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting.<ref name="Daddy"/> During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the [[Mohamed Khalil Museum]] of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled ''Drawn By Wesley Willis'' at [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]].<ref name="avc">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/its-drawn-by-wesley-willis,520/|title=It's drawn by Wesley Willis|last=Wolinsky|first=David|date=February 21, 2008|work=The A.V.

In 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago's alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]]. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Mike D.]], [[Jello Biafra]], and the members of [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]];<ref name="BG">{{cite news|url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7023&context=bg-news|title=Wesley Willis Fiasco uses music for inner peace|last=Weisbrod|first=Aaron|date=June 26, 1996|work=The BG News|page=6|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> and soon caught the attention of [[Rick Rubin]] at [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]],<ref name="BG"/> an independent label distributed by [[Warner Bros.|The Warner Group]]. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the Canadian [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Monster Voodoo Machine]] and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut album ''Suffersystem'' ([[RCA Records]]). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of [[novelty song|novelty rock]] (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on [[MTV]].<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1477150/wesley-willis-schizophrenic-street-singer-dies/|title=Wesley Willis, Schizophrenic Street Singer, Dies|work=MTV News}}</ref> On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on ''[[Howard Stern|The Howard Stern Show]]'' where he played nearly identical songs about [[Baba Booey]] and [[Howard Stern]]. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became "famous for greeting fans with a headbutt"; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.<ref name="mtv"/>

In early 2003 the documentary ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'' was released, chronicling Willis' daily life and interests.

In 2004, Willis's song "Rock N Roll McDonald's", about [[Rock N Roll McDonald's|the McDonald's restaurant of the same name]], was used in the soundtrack of the documentary ''[[Super Size Me]]''.

==Death==
On August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] in [[Skokie, Illinois]].<ref name=alttent />

==Song structure and themes==
"Hellride" was the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with "[[demon]]s" (delusions brought on by schizophrenia),<ref name=monzy>{{cite web|url=http://www.monzy.org/wesley/ |title=Wesley Willis |publisher=Monzy.org |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> which occurred mainly on the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] bus lines in Chicago.<ref name="Daddy"/> According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his "Harmony Joy Music" or "Joy Rides".<ref name=alttent /> He used the term in many of his songs, such as "I Deserve a Warhellride".

The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]] songs were [[punk rock]] songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs: [[Thin Lizzy]]'s "Jailbreak",<ref name="hbd">{{cite web |url=http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |title=Various Artists: Vagabonds of the Midwestern World: Fighting Songs by Thin Lizzy – A – HBDirect Rock |publisher=Hbdirect.com |date=January 3, 2003 |access-date=November 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030604/http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |archive-date=May 8, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Pure Prairie League]]'s "[[Bustin' Out|Amie]]", and [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[Girls on Film]]", the last of which was recorded for a 1997 Duran Duran [[tribute album]]. Another song by the Wesley Willis Fiasco, "The Bar Is Closed", recreates a section of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s "[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]"; the song "Casper the Homosexual Friendly Ghost" does the same with [[Van Halen]]'s "Jamie's Cryin'".

As a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with [[superhero]]es, commands for his "demons" to engage in [[bestiality]] (in ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'', Willis explained that these songs would "gross out" the demons enough to make them leave him alone),<ref name="Daddy"/> and praise for his favorite actors, friends, politicians, and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and rock artists. Songs about rock artists were usually confined to describing a show performed by the band that Willis had attended or opened for, recycling key phrases such as "The crowd roared like a lion", "A lot of people met the band", or "The band got down like a [[Magikist]]". Many songs end with the phrase "Rock over London, rock on, Chicago", followed by a product slogan, such as "[[Wheaties]]: Breakfast of Champions", "[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]: Quality is Job One", "[[Diet Pepsi]]: Uh-Huh!" or "[[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]]: Wow, What a Difference!"

Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote that despite Willis' prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: "It's certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Rock 'N' Roll Will Never Die – Wesley Willis |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rock-n-roll-will-never-die-mw0000183493 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt "exploitive".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Feel the Power – Wesley Willis |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/feel-the-power-mw0000648886 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=June 4, 2019}}</ref>
