They are possibly best known for their singles "Can't Stop Loving You", "Where the Boys At?", and "Gucci This (Gucci That)".

On December 31, 2017, OMG reunited to perform as a special guest during Zonnique's opening set on the Great Xscape Tour with [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]].

On January 3, 2018, the group updated their [[Facebook]] page. However, there has been no official word that the group will reunite.

==History==
=== 2009– 2010: Beginnings and departures ===
Prior to the group's debut, Zonnique Jailee Pullins (daughter of [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka "Tiny" Harris]] then Cottle)  was a member of the duo group QT Posse with QT Jazz. QT Posse later disbanded and OMG Girlz was formed. This new group consisted of four members Zonnique "Star" Pullins, sisters Bahja "Beauty" and Lourdes "Lolo" Rodriguez, and Reginae "Baby" Carter whose parents were all close friends with Zonnique's mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626979/tis-lil-waynes-daughters-start-group-omg-girlz.jhtml|title=T.I.'s And Lil Wayne's Daughters Start Group, OMG Girlz|website=mtv.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203094005/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626979/tis-lil-waynes-daughters-start-group-omg-girlz.jhtml|archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = T.I.'s And Lil Wayne's Daughters Start Group, OMG Girlz|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/1626979/tis-and-lil-waynes-daughters-start-group-omg-girlz/?device=1#openUserProfile=0A6EBF0101BF6E0A000101BF6E0A|website = MTV News|access-date = 2015-05-20|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083705/http://www.mtv.com/news/1626979/tis-and-lil-waynes-daughters-start-group-omg-girlz/?device=1#openUserProfile=0A6EBF0101BF6E0A000101BF6E0A|archive-date = 2015-05-23}}</ref>

Shortly after the release of their first single "Ain't Nobody" in 2010, Reginae "Baby Carter" Carter (daughter of rapper Lil Wayne and Toya Carter) departed from the group. A few months later, OMG Girlz's second single "Haterz" (stylized as H.A.T.E.R.Z) was released. OMG later performed the single on Good Day Atlanta.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Video: OMG Girlz Perform on 'Good Day Atlanta'|url = http://www.rap-up.com/2010/07/12/video-omg-girlz-perform-on-good-day-atlanta/|website = Rap-Up|access-date = 2015-05-20|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150521024912/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/07/12/video-omg-girlz-perform-on-good-day-atlanta/|archive-date = 2015-05-21}}</ref> The group downsized once more after Lourdes "Lolo" Rodriguez left the group given her young age. Afterwards this left the group as a duo consisting of members "Beauty" and "Star" only.

While searching for a third member, the fourth single "So Official" was released. Shortly after OMG had pinned the newest addition to the group Breaunna "Babydoll" Womack due to finding her on a YouTube video dancing to Beyoncé's song "Ego".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddyo.com/tinys-girl-group-omg-girlz-gets-new-group-member/uncategorized/|title=Tiny’s Girl Group "OMG Girlz"Gets New Group Member - FreddyO.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=freddyo.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206070700/http://freddyo.com/tinys-girl-group-omg-girlz-gets-new-group-member/uncategorized/|archive-date=6 February 2012}}</ref>

=== 2011– 2013: New Beginning, tours, signed, and breakthrough ===
In 2011, the girls were added to the Scream Tour: Next Generation line-up, by way of a national contest, which featured [[Diggy Simmons]], [[Mindless Behavior]], [[Jacob Latimore]], Jawan Harris, and TK-N-Cash. This tour helped the group get fans across the country. Their first single as a trio, "[[Gucci This (Gucci That)]]" was a featured song on the tour. After the tour was over in December 2011, the OMG Girlz were signed to Interscope/Streamline Records via Pretty Hustle/Grand Hustle (labels by [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka "Tiny" Harris]] & [[T.I.|Clifford "T.I.P" Harris]]). The following year on February 28, 2012, "Gucci This (Gucci That)" was released as their first official single under Interscope/Streamline Records, available for public download.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://musicremedy.com/o/omg-girlz/songs/gucci-this-gucci-that-56575.html|title = OMG Girlz - Gucci This (Gucci That)|date = February 11, 2012|access-date = May 20, 2015|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000817/http://musicremedy.com/o/omg-girlz/songs/gucci-this-gucci-that-56575.html|archive-date = May 22, 2015}}</ref> On April 28, 2012, it peaked at #59 on two of Billboard's charts [[R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/omg-girlz/chart-history/hot-r-and-b-hip-hop-airplay/song/714785|title=OMG Girlz's single "Gucci This (Gucci That)" peaks to #59 on Billboard's "R&B/Hip-Hip Airplay"|date=28 April 2012|website=billboard.com}}</ref> for 10 weeks and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/omg-girlz/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/714785|title=OMG Girlz's single "Gucci This (Gucci That)" peaks to #59 on Billboard's "Hot R&B/Hip-Hip Songs"|date=28 April 2012|website=billboard.com}}</ref> for 13 weeks.

Their second single "Where the Boys At?" which was written by fellow young artists Lil Will and Trevante was released on June 12, 2012. On July 14, 2012, it peaked at #77 on Billboard's [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart and stayed on the chart for 5 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/omg-girlz/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/747730|title=OMG Girlz's single "Where the Boys At?" peaks to #77 on Billboard's "Hot R&B/Hip-Hip Songs"|date=14 July 2012|website=billboard.com}}</ref>

While performing on tour they previewed a song called "Lover Boy", the unreleased song would later on become the group's most highly anticipated single.

OMG made several cameo appearances for various artists, one being in [[T.I.]]'s music video for "[[Hello (T.I. song)|Hello]]".

In Fall 2013, their singles "Can't Stop Loving You", and "Baddie" were released.

In Summer 2013, two days before they were scheduled to begin the [[All Around the World (Mindless Behavior album)|All Around The World]] tour with teen pop boy group [[Mindless Behavior]], they released three singles titled "Do You Remember", "Incredimazable", and "Ridin' Slow".

=== 2014– 2015: Maturity and disbandment ===
In Spring 2014, the group released their first mature single called "Boy It's Over" (which samples the R&B group [[Jagged Edge (American group)|Jagged Edge]] single "Girl It's Over" from their third studio album ''[[Jagged Little Thrill]]'').

On March 12, 2015, OMG had unexpectedly announced that they would not be pursuing a career as a group on their official [[Instagram]] account. Since the disbandment, each member has since put out personal solo projects.
