== History ==
The channel's creator, Dean Stobbart, originally a teacher from [[Norton, County Durham]], had in the past been a part-time voice actor who also did some animation for his lessons.<ref name="corking2016">{{cite news|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/former-teacher-norton-850000-subscribers-11783864|title=This former teacher from Norton has 850,000 subscribers on YouTube|last=Corking|first=Graham|date=23 August 2016|work=TeessideLive|publisher=Reach plc|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> He said he saw a gap in the market that "no one had really done football cartoons before", so he made his first animated video, a parody of Uruguayan footballer [[Luis SuÃ¡rez]] and then-[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[ArsÃ¨ne Wenger]] in a cartoon parody of a scene from ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in August 2013.<ref name="corking2016" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqK68BMnnc|title=LUIS SUAREZ BITE ðŸŽ¬Silence of the Lambs RemakeðŸŽ¬! by 442oons (football cartoon parody)|author=442oons|date=8 August 2013|website=YouTube|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> The video currently has 2.6&nbsp;million views and was followed up with another SuÃ¡rez-themed video which has received more than 17.5&nbsp;million views.

Dunscombe and Stobbart have also been featured in some other videos, where they play mobile games such as Online Soccer Manager.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} In 442oons' 3-million-subscribers video in July 2020, Sam confirmed his departure from the channel. Currently with 4 animators, Lauren Bagstaff and Karl Hargreaves are the additional two animators with Myler and Williams.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} The current most popular video on the channel is the MSN SONG, published in 2015, with 27.7&nbsp;million views.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ðŸŽ¶MSN SONGðŸŽ¶ Bayern Munich vs Barcelona 3-2 PARODY (Champions League Semi-final 2015 Goals Neymar) - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62B4pIe6QZM|access-date=11 February 2021|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

In July 2017, Stobbart created a new YouTube channel parodying the celebrity world called Celebri2oons. The channel never really took off so he does not upload often.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4m9rhlOV1VCFbqZJXpVcFw|title=Celebri2oons|website=YouTube|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref> On 24 April 2019, he launched a game called "442oons Football Runner" which features fusions of football players:{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} On 4 July 2020, Stobbart launched a second mobile game called "442oons Football Shooter". He also has been in partnership with the [[Bundesliga]] YouTube channel (English), [[Onefootball]], The Football Republic, FREEbets and other YouTube channels.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
