'''Laibach''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaɪbax}}) is a Slovenian [[avant-garde music]] group associated with the [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Martial industrial|martial]], and [[Neoclassical dark wave|neo-classical]] genres. Formed in the [[mining town]] of [[Trbovlje]] (at the time in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) in 1980, Laibach represents the musical wing of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] (NSK) collective, a group which Laibach helped found in 1984. "Laibach" is the [[German language|German]] historical name for the Slovenian [[Capital city|capital]] [[Ljubljana]], itself an oblique reference to the [[Slovene Lands in World War II|Nazi occupation of Slovenia]] in [[World War II]].

From the early days, the band was subject to controversies and bans due to their elaborate use of iconography with ambiguously repugnant [[Parody|parodies]] and [[pastiches]] of elements from [[totalitarianism]], [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]], a concept they have preserved throughout their career. [[Censored]] and banned in Socialist Yugoslavia and receiving a kind of [[dissident]] status, the band embarked on international tours and gradually acquired international fame. After Slovenia became independent in 1991, Laibach's status in the country has turned from rejection to promotion into a national cultural icon, which included performances with the Slovenian symphony orchestra.

Early Laibach albums were pure industrial, with heavy rhythms and roaring vocals. Later in the mid-80s, the sound became more richly layered, featuring [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[classical music]]. The band's lyrics, variously written in German, [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[English language|English]], are usually delivered by the [[bass voice]] of the singer Milan Fras. Initially the lyrics handled war and military themes; later, the focus turned to any highly charged political issue of the moment, sending intentionally ambiguous messages. They recorded several cover versions of popular songs, often turning light melodies into sinister-sounding Gothic tunes.

The band has seen numerous line-up changes, with [[Dejan Knez]], Milan Fras, Ervin Markošek and Ivan "Jani" Novak forming the best-known line-up. They have worked with a number of collaborators and guest musicians. Laibach has also recorded film [[soundtracks]], theatre music, produced works of [[visual arts]], and band members have embarked on a number of side projects.

==History==

===Laibach with Tomaž Hostnik (1980–1982)===
Laibach was formed on 1 June 1980 in [[Trbovlje]], a mining-industry town. ''Laibach'' is the German language name of the city of [[Ljubljana]], a name used during the period when Slovenia was a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|World War II occupation of Yugoslavia]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127">{{harvnb|Janjatović|2007|p=127}}</ref> At the time, the group collaborated with art groups Irwin (painting) and Rdeči Pilot (theatre).<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> Since its formation, Laibach had been preparing a multimedia project "Rdeči revirji" ("Red District"), a piece intended to challenge and provoke the current political structures in Trbovlje.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The group's use of [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich's black crosses]] on their posters was determined to be "improper and irresponsible," leading to the cancellation of the performance of ''Red District,'' an action which was met with considerable negative reaction in the media and by the general public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> At this early stage of their career, Laibach's visuals employed mining iconography. Eventually, the group would add such symbols as [[Triglav]], deer horns and the Malevich's black cross encircled with a [[gear]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

The first live appearance and an exhibition entitled "Žrtve letalske nesreče" ("Victims of an Air Accident") took place in January 1982 at the Ljubljana club FV, followed by performances in [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> At the time, the group's musical style was characterized by critics as "[[industrial rock]]", and for their live performances they used gramophones, radio devices and electronic instruments constructed by themselves.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> Instead of the dry ice stage effect, the group used original military smoke bombs which was as unpleasant for themselves as for the audience.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> At the Novi Rock festival in Ljubljana during the same year, the frontman Tomaž Hostnik appeared in a military uniform and despite being hit by a bottle in the face, causing him serious injuries, he managed to bring the performance to an end.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> However, Hostnik committed ritual suicide in December 1982<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> by hanging himself from one of the most powerful Slovenian national symbols, a [[hayrack]], near his hometown of [[Medvode]]. Laibach disapproved of his act of suicide and posthumously expelled Hostnik from the group,<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33530538 |title=North Korea allows 'first foreign band to perform' |access-date=15 July 2015 |work=BBC News}}</ref> returning him to his private identity. Despite this, the group often referred to him and dedicated various projects to him, including an installation entitled ''Apologia Laibach'', created around Hostnik's self-portrait.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laibach.org/tomaz-hostnik/|title=Tomaž Hostnik 08. 11. 1961 – 21. 12. 1982|website=Laibach.org|access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref>

===Dissident status in Yugoslavia (1983–1985)===
[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 1983.jpg|thumb|Laibach press photo 1983]]

In April 1983 the group resumed its activities with a live appearance in Ljubljana, featuring guest performances by the English bands Last Few Days and [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]], for which recordings of dogs barking and snarling were used as the concert intro.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The day after the performance, the group received considerable media coverage for a concert at the Zagreb Biennale entitled "Mi kujemo bodočnost" ("We Forge the Future"), during which the group used simultaneous projections of a pornographic movie and the film ''Revolucija še traja'' (''The Revolution is Still Going On'').<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The performance was eventually interrupted by the police, forcing the group to leave the stage after the appearance of a penis and [[Josip Broz Tito]] at the same time on the screens.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The subsequent debut television appearance on 23 June 1983, in the informative-political program ''TV Tednik'', caused major negative reactions after which they were banned from using the name Laibach as well as performing in public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" />

The group then started an international ''The Occupied Europe Tour '83'', with the group Last Few Days, which included sixteen dates in eight Eastern and Western European countries.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The performances provoked a lot of interest in the European media, especially with the totalitarian musical and visual style.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The [[socialist realism]] background, effective live appearances and a dissident status in their home country provided the group with a swift increase of interest of the Western countries.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Their provocative usage of symbols from [[Nazi Germany]] firstly provoked the Slovene WW2 Veteran Organization in Yugoslavia.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> By combining the imagery of socialist realism, Nazism and Italian [[futurism]], the group created a unique aesthetic style which could not pass unnoticed by the public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The song lyrics were initially written in German, but having included cover versions of English-language songs, the group focused more on the latter.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

In 1984, the group moved to London and started working as labourers, acted as soldiers in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' and worked at a pier in [[Belfast]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Due to the fact that they were banned from using the name Laibach, the group held a secret concert at the Ljubljana Malči Belič hall dedicated to the deceased Tomaž Hostnik.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During that period, the group, with their early collaborators Irwin and Rdeči Pilot founded the informal art organization ''[[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]'' (German for ''New Slovene Art'').

The following year, the group released their debut studio album, ''[[Laibach (album)|Laibach]]'', through the Ljubljana ŠKUC Ropot label, which did not feature the group name on the album cover, due to its ban, and a sample from a speech by Tito on one of the album tracks was also censored.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During the same year, the German label WUS released a compilation album ''[[Rekapitulacija 1980–1984]]'' (''Recapitulation 1980–1984'').<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> With the Gledališče Sester Scipion Nasice, the group performed in their own play ''Krst pod Triglavom'' (''A Baptism Under Triglav'') at the Ljubljana Cankarjev dom.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> During 1985, the group also released its second album ''[[Nova Akropola]]'' (''The New Acropolis'') via [[Great Britain|British]] [[independent record label]] Cherry Red.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> After the album release, the group performed its first legal concert in Hum (Slovenia), entitled "Krvava gruda, plodna zemlja" ("Bloody Land, Fertile Soil"). They had asked the 12th congress of the SSO of Slovenia to be allowed to use the name Laibach and have public performances, a request which had been accepted. The group subsequently got the "Zlata ptica" ("The Golden Bird") award at the Yugoslav Youth Day.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" />

===International breakthrough (1986–1991)===
In London, The group recorded three songs for [[John Peel]] session, performed for the [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]] dance company's ''No Fire Escape from Hell''.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Having signed for [[Mute Records]], started recording their third studio album, ''[[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]'', with Slavko Avsenik Jr.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The inner sleeve of the cover featured a [[swastika]] consisting of four bloodied axes designed by [[John Heartfield]], an anti-Nazi artist. The record was sold secretly in some European countries,<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> as the meaning of the cover was not recognised. The usage of Nazi symbols and the name "Opus Dei" caused the [[Opus Dei|Catholic institution of the same name]] to sue the group but the case was eventually decided in favour of Laibach.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> Following the album release, the group embarked on a European tour, during which they stated at a press conference in [[France]] that their influences are [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], and [[Jacques Tati|Tati]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" />

[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 1989.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Laibach press photo 1989]]

In Hamburg, the group performed and wrote the music for an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' at the [[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]], which was eventually released in 1989 as ''[[Macbeth (album)|Macbeth]]''.<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> In 1988, the group released the album ''[[Let It Be (Laibach album)|Let It Be]]'', featuring cover versions of all the songs from the [[Beatles]] album [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|of the same name]], with the exception of the title track, which they did not record owing to lack of studio time, and "[[Maggie Mae]]", which was replaced by the German anthems "[[Auf der Lüneburger Heide]]" and "[[Der Freischutz|Was Gleicht Wohl Auf Erden]]".<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> A part of the recorded material from the album was broadcast by [[Paul McCartney]] before his concerts.

In 1989, their performance in Zagreb started with the Serbian instrument the [[gusle]] and in Belgrade, the NSK philosopher Peter Mlakar held a speech as a cynical parody of [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s speeches in [[SAP Kosovo]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The following year, the group released the EP ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (EP)|Sympathy for the Devil]]'', an album of different cover versions of the [[Rolling Stones]] [[Sympathy for the Devil|song of the same name]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> The group also achieved a commercial success with the cover versions of "[[Live Is Life]]" by [[Opus (Austrian band)|Opus]] and "[[One Vision]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" /> During the same year, on 21 December the group celebrated their 10th anniversary with a first ever live performance at the thermoelectric power station in Trbovlje. 16 years later Chris Bohn of [[the Wire magazine]] proclaimed this show as one of the 60 most powerful concerts of all times. After this concert, the group undertook a tour of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127" />

===Commercial success and after (1992–present)===

In 1992, the group released ''[[Kapital (album)|Kapital]]'' an album featuring their own vision of [[materialism]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The following year, Mute Records released the ''[[Ljubljana–Zagreb–Beograd]]'' live album, recorded at performances in the three cities in 1982, presenting a document of politically active rock from the group's early career, especially in the songs "Tito-Tito", "Država" ("The State"), and "Rdeči molk" ("Red Silence").<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> In 1994, they released the album ''[[NATO (album)|NATO]]'', which commented on the current political events in Eastern Europe, former Yugoslavia and the actions of the [[NATO]] pact, filtered through their vision of [[techno music|techno]] and [[pop music|pop]]. The album featured cover versions of [[Europe (band)|Europe]]'s "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]", [[Bolland & Bolland]]'s "[[In the Army Now (song)|In the Army Now]]", [[Don Fardon]]'s "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|Indian Reservation]]" (renamed to "National Reservation"), and the [[Stanislav Binički]] composition "[[Marš na Drinu]]" ("March on the [[Drina]]").<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

Following the album release, the group went on the ''Occupied Europe NATO Tour 1994-95'', resulting in the live and video album of the same name, which featured a selection of recordings from the two-year tour, including the performance in [[Sarajevo]] on the date of the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> In 1995, the group for a while considered splitting into several simultaneous lineups so that they could perform in different places at the same time, but the idea was abandoned.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The following year, the group released ''[[Jesus Christ Superstars]]'', a reference to the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s [[rock opera]] ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref name="Janjatovic 128">{{harvnb|Janjatović|2007|p=128}}</ref> The group promoted the album in the US with an eighteen-date tour, as well as a German tour.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>

[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 2003.jpg|thumb|Laibach press photo 2003]]

Laibach's [[cover song|cover version]]s are often used to subvert the original message or intention of the song—a notable example being their version of the song "[[Live Is Life]]" by [[Opus (Austrian band)|Opus]], an Austrian arena rock band. Laibach recorded two new interpretations of the song, titled "Leben heißt Leben" and "Opus Dei". The first, the opening song on the Laibach album ''[[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]'' (1987), was sung in German. The second was promoted as a single, and its promotional video (which used the title "[[Live Is Life#Laibach versions|Life Is Life]]") was played extensively on American cable channel [[MTV]].<ref>Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine: Laibach and NSK.  MIT Press, 2005. p 231</ref> "Opus Dei" retained some of the original song's [[English English lyrics, but was delivered in a musical style that left the meaning of the lyrics open to interpretation. Whereas the original is a feel-good pop anthem, Laibach's interpretation twists the melody into a triumphant military march. With the exception of the promotional video, the refrain is at one point translated into German, giving an example of the sensitivity of lyrics to their context. The ''Opus Dei'' album also features a cover of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[One Vision]]" with lyrics translated into German under the title '"Geburt einer Nation" ("Birth of a Nation"), revealing the ambiguity of lines like "One race one hope/One real decision". In ''NATO'' (1994), Laibach also memorably re-worked [[Europe (band)|Europe]]'s [[glam metal]] anthem "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]" as a bombastic disco epic.

Other notable covers include ''[[Let It Be (Laibach album)|Let It Be]]'' (1988), reinterpretation of the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|eponymous Beatles album]]. The ensuing maxi-single ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (EP)|Sympathy for the Devil]]'' (1988) [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] song of the same name with seven different interpretations.

Laibach not only references modern artists through reinterpretation, but also samples or reinvents older musical pieces. For example, their song "Anglia" is based on the national anthem of the United Kingdom, ''[[God Save the Queen]]'', released on ''[[Volk (album)|Volk]]'', a collection of Laibach's versions of several national anthems. On this album they also included an anthem for their NSK State in Time, based on their song ''The Great Seal'' from ''Opus Dei''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volk.htm |title=Volk |publisher=Laibach |date=9 October 2006 |access-date=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127175726/http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volk.htm |archive-date=27 November 2009 }}</ref>

They have also toured with an audio-visual performance centered on [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue|Die Kunst der Fuge]]''. Since this work has no specifications of acquired instruments and is furthermore [[The Art of Fugue#The permutation matrix|based on mathematical principles]], Laibach has argued that the music can be seen as proto-[[techno]]. Therefore, the band found ''Die Kunst der Fuge'' to be ideal for an interpretation using computers and software.

In 2009 Laibach reworked [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''Overture to [[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', ''Siegfried-Idyll'' and ''The Ride Of The Valkyries'' in collaboration with the symphonic orchestra RTV Slovenia, conducted by Izidor Leitinger. Laibach's version is titled "VolksWagner".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volkswagner/ |title=Laibach Volkswagner |website=Laibach.nsk.si |date=18 April 2009 |access-date=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128180539/http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volkswagner/ |archive-date=28 November 2009 }}</ref>

In addition to cover songs, Laibach has remixed songs by other bands. These include two songs by the Florida death metal band [[Morbid Angel]] that appear on the Morbid Angel EP ''Laibach Re-mixes''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morbidangel.com/laibach.html |title=Discography |website=MorbidAngel.com |access-date=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129075630/http://morbidangel.com/laibach.html |archive-date=29 January 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009 Laibach made new versions of their own songs from the early 1980s such as ''Brat moj'', ''Boji'' and ''Smrt za smrt''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/rec.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126001643/http://www.laibach.nsk.si/rec.htm |archive-date=26 November 2009 }}</ref>

==Aesthetics, image, and controversy==
[[File:Laibach riga 2015.03.19-melnaa piektdiena.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Laibach live in Riga, Latvia at the club "[[Melnā Piektdiena]]" on 19 March 2015]]

Although primarily a musical group, Laibach has sometimes worked in other media. In their early years, especially before the founding of [[Neue Slowenische Kunst|Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK)]], Laibach produced several works of visual art. A notable example was ''MB 84 Memorandum'' (1984) an image of a black cross that served as a way to advertise Laibach's appearances during a period in the 1980s when the government of Yugoslavia banned the name "Laibach".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artmargins.com/content/review/griffin.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312073938/http://www.artmargins.com/content/review/griffin.html |archive-date=12 March 2007 }}</ref> Cross imagery, and variations on the cross are apparent in many Laibach recordings and publications.

The visual imagery of Laibach's art (or 'Laibach Kunst', as it calls itself) has been described as "radically ambiguous".<ref>Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine.  MIT Press, 2005.  p76.</ref> An early example of this ambiguity would be the woodcut entitled ''The Thrower,'' also known as ''Metalec'' (''The Metal Worker''). This work features a monochrome silhouette of a figure with a clenched fist holding a hammer aloft. The work could be seen as promoting industrial protest or as a symbol of industrial pride. Another aspect of this woodcut is the large typefaced word 'LAIBACH', evoking memories of the [[Nazi]] occupation of Slovenia (when the capital city was briefly known by its German language name of Laibach). This piece was featured prominently during a TV interview of Laibach in 1983, during which the interviewer Jure Pengov called Laibach "enemies of the people."<ref>{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=Alexei|title=Interrogation Machine|publisher=MIT Press|date=2005|page=161}}</ref>

Laibach has frequently been accused of both [[far left]] and [[far right]] political stances due to their use of [[uniform]]s and [[totalitarian]]-style [[aesthetics]]. They were also accused of being members of the [[neo-nationalism]] movement, which reincarnates modern ideas of [[nationalism]]. When confronted with such accusations, Laibach is quoted as replying with the ambiguous response "We are [[fascist]]s as much as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was a [[Paintings by Adolf Hitler|painter]]".<ref name="VH1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/laibach/bio.jhtml|website=VH1.com|title=Laibach Biography|access-date = 22 April 2007}}</ref> However, Laibach also provided most of the soundtrack for [[Iron Sky]], a film that mocked Nazism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iron Sky (2012) Soundtracks|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/soundtrack|website=IMDb.com|access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>

The members of Laibach are notorious for rarely stepping out of character. Some releases feature artwork by the [[Communism|communist]] and early [[Dada]] artist and [[satire|satirist]] [[John Heartfield]]. Laibach concerts have sometimes aesthetically appeared as political rallies. When interviewed, they often answer in wry manifestos, showing a paradoxical lust for, and condemnation of, authority.<ref name="VH1"/>

Finnish author Tuomas Tähti tells in his 2019 book ''Nationalistin henkinen horisontti'' that Laibach member Ivan "Jani" Novak told him in March 2015 that Laibach is a communist group and most of Laibach's work is connected to communism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tähti |first=Tuomas |title=Nationalistin henkinen horisontti |language=fi |location=Espoo |publisher=Tuomas Tähti |publication-date=May 2019 |page=145 |isbn=978-952-94-1815-2}}</ref>

[[Richard Wolfson (musician)|Richard Wolfson]] wrote of the group:

{{quote|Laibach's method is extremely simple, effective and horribly open to misinterpretation. First of all, they absorb the mannerisms of the enemy, adopting all the seductive trappings and symbols of [[Sovereign state|state]] power, and then they exaggerate everything to the edge of parody... Next they turn their focus to highly charged issues &mdash; the West's fear of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the power games of the [[European Union|EU]], the analogies between Western [[democracy]] and [[totalitarianism]].<ref>Richard Wolfson, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3601856/Warriors-of-weirdness.html "Warriors of weirdness"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 4 September 2003</ref>}}

==Legacy, influence, and innovation==
===Martial music===
Some early material by Laibach and later [[neoclassical (Dark Wave)|neoclassical]] releases by the band, such as 1990's ''Macbeth'' release, were influential on certain artists within the [[martial industrial]] music genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/band/814762f818c7862ad5cb144b4aed6a2151dcc/biography|title=Radio Swiss Jazz - Music database - Band|website=Radioswissjazz.ch|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref>

===Rammstein===
Laibach is often cited as an influence for the popular German [[Neue Deutsche Härte]] band [[Rammstein]]. The parallel is regularly made between the bands regarding their aesthetics and deep male vocals both groups share and with their respective backgrounds of originating from former socialist countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9941678|title= Mitä tapahtuu, kun fasismia flirttaileva rock-bändi päätyy kommunistidiktatuuriin? |publisher= Yle |date= 2017 |website=yle.fi |access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://psychotroniccinema.com/2017/07/21/liberation-day-with-laibach-and-director-morten-traavik/ |title= LIBERATION DAY – INTERVIEW WITH LAIBACH AND DIRECTOR MORTEN TRAAVIK |publisher= The Psychotronic Cinema |date= 2017 |website=psychotroniccinema.com |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ry4356/laibach-cares-more-about-your-freedom-than-you-do|title= Laibach Cares More About Your Freedom Than You Do|publisher= Vice |date= 2014 |website=vice.com |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> When asked about the topic in an interview, the guitar player of Rammstein, [[Richard Kruspe]], claimed Rammstein to have a more emotional approach instead of the more "intellectual" style of Laibach. In the same interview the keyboard player of Rammstein [[Christian Lorenz]] drew a parallel between the deep voices of [[Till Lindemann]] and Milan Fras but considered this to be the only similarity between the two music groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Bdg9QVs54| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/d7Bdg9QVs54| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|title= Rammstein VIVA JAM Interview 1997 (English)  |publisher= VIVA JAM |date= 1997 |website=youtube.com |access-date=24 May 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The film "Liberation day" ends with a notice stating that a member of a certain industrial metal band was supposed to be interviewed for the film about the influence Laibach had on their earlier work, but it had to be removed due to the prospect of arrest or a fine from the district court of Berlin towards the makers of the film. This, and the early promotional material for the film<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liberationday.film/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LIBERATION-DAY-PRESS-KIT-2016.pdf |title= LIBERATION-DAY-PRESS-KIT-2016  |publisher= VFS FILMS |date= 2016 |website=liberationday.film/ |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> suggest that it was [[Paul Landers]] who was to appear in the film, thus to some extent confirming the connection between these two music groups. 
When members of Laibach were asked by an interviewer about Rammstein "stealing" from them, they responded: "Laibach does not believe in originality... Therefore, Rammstein could not 'steal' much from us. They simply let themselves get inspired by our work, which is absolutely a legitimate process. We are glad that they made it. In a way, they have proven once again that a good 'copy' can make more money on the market than the 'original'. Anyhow, today we share the territory: Rammstein seem to be a kind of Laibach for adolescents and Laibach are Rammstein for grown-ups."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsmagazine.net/139/laibach.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818164446/http://www.legendsmagazine.net/139/laibach.htm|url-status=usurped|archive-date=18 August 2004|title=Interview: Laibach|access-date = 22 April 2007}}</ref> Laibach would later provide a remix for the Rammstein single "[[Ohne dich]]".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Members==
[[File:Milan Fras.jpg|thumb|Milan Fras]]
In 1978, [[Dejan Knez]] formed his first band Salte Morale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/ferfolja.htm |title= Ferfolja|publisher=the Slovenian |access-date=6 November 2009}}</ref> which was essentially the first incarnation of Laibach. During the summer of 1980, following the suggestion of Knez's father, the well-known Slovenian painter and artist Janez Knez, the band renamed itself Laibach. This incarnation included Dejan Knez, Srečko Bajda, Andrej Lupinc, Tomaž Hostnik and Marko Košnik. Soon after that, Knez's relative Ivan "Jani" Novak and Milan Fras joined the band. First a quintet, Laibach quickly became a quartet and declared that the group had four members – "Vier Personen".

From mid-1980s to mid-1990s, while the core quartet included Dejan Knez, Milan Fras, Ervin Markošek and Ivan "Jani" Novak, the members frequently used the pseudonyms Dachauer, Keller, Saliger and Eber.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nskstate.com/laibach/reviews/laibachkunstderfuge.php |title=Laibach &#93; [ Konzert Fuer Das Kreuzschach Und Vier Schauspieler &#93; |website=Nskstate.com |access-date=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014112748/http://www.nskstate.com/laibach/reviews/laibachkunstderfuge.php |archive-date=14 October 2009 }}</ref> The pseudonym ''Ivo Saliger'' was originally used by original singer Tomaž Hostnik (since deceased) and more recently by Ivan Novak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laibach.org/tomaz-hostnik-08-11-1961-21-12-1982/|title=Tomaž Hostnik 08. 11. 1961 – 21. 12. 1982|website=Laibach.org|access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.km-k.at/en/event/ivan-novak-laibach/|title=Events – Ivo Saliger (Laibach) "LAIBACH: XY-UNSOLVED" :: KM– Künstlerhaus, Halle für Kunst & Medien|website=Km-k.at|access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> Former member Andrej Lupinc has continued to use the pseudonym Keller after leaving the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Keller+(2)|title=Keller (2)|website=Discogs|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> The pseudonym Elk Eber has been used by Dejan Knez.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letsceefilmfestival.com/film-detail2015/items/ivo_salinger_und_elk_eber_victory_under.html?lang=en |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090232/http://www.letsceefilmfestival.com/film-detail2015/items/ivo_salinger_und_elk_eber_victory_under.html?lang=en |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg-lj.si/en/events/1104/dejan-knez-and-ivan-novak-guided-tour/|title=NSK From Kapital to Capital - Dejan Knez and Ivan Novak - guided tour - MG+MSUM|website=Mg-lj.si|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> Occasionally, other musicians supplemented the core group, some of whom include Oto Rimele (from [[Lačni Franz]] band), Nikola Sekulović (bass player from the Demolition Group), Matej Mršnik, and tour drummer Roman Dečman.

* Von Bach, a fictional [[superhero|superpowered]] character modeled after Milan Fras, appears in the [[DC Comics]] graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]. In it, he appears dressed in Laibach-style uniform and displays the group's cross tattooed on his chest. He is described as follows: "German-speaking superhuman and would-be dictator is the example of the Hitleresque villain that had so much symbolic importance in the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. The blocky cross on his chest is evocative of the kind of bold symbols used by fascists. Von Bach has the words 'Liebe' (love) and 'Hass' (hate) tattooed on his arms and, in fact, his entire body has been covered with one large tattoo of that dark color that most tattoos become, with his natural flesh color only coming through in the designs on his body".
