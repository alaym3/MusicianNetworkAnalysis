'''Alcest''' is a French [[post-black metal]] band from [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]], founded and led by [[Neige (musician)|Neige]] (Stéphane Paut).<ref name="Ratliff"/> It began in 2000 as a [[black metal]] solo project by Neige, soon a trio, but following the release of [[Tristesse Hivernale|their first demo]] in 2001, band members Aegnor and Argoth left the band, leaving Neige as the sole member.<ref>Neige explained: ''"At the beginning, I created Alcest because I really loved Black Metal and I wanted to play some. With the help of Famine (Peste Noire), I wrote four tracks with a theme based on winter and the sad feelings this season conveys."''{{cite web | url=http://kaleidoscopemag.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/from-dream-kingdoms-to-metro-tunnels-alcest-amesoeurs/| title= Klemi, From dream kingdoms to metro tunnels: ALCEST / AMESOEURS, ''Kaleidoscope mag'', Issue number 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>Aegnor (aka La sale Famine) explained: ''"I played in ALCEST. In the beginning. I composed the best riff in 'Tristesse Hivernale', the searing riff of 'La Forêt du Cristal'. But at the behest of Neige, ALCEST became an Eden of elegant and overly nice fairies, the pastoral dream of a tender hobbit's brain. To put it bluntly, ALCEST became a fairytale country. So I had to carve out my own path...I took a shit in those cute flowery groves, sodomised the fairies, and put those elves to bed with a dose of rat poison to allow the song of the toads to flourish. Yes, I made PESTE NOIRE...because PESTE NOIRE was born only to fuck shit up.(Diary of PN)"''{{cite web|url=http://www.lamesnieherlequin.com/2013/04/interview-kpn-v-english-version/ |title=KPN-V interview, April 1st, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117023514/http://www.lamesnieherlequin.com/2013/04/interview-kpn-v-english-version/ |archive-date=17 January 2014 }}</ref> In 2009 drummer Winterhalter from [[Les Discrets]] joined Alcest's line-up, after eight years with Neige as the sole full-time member. Since its creation, Alcest has released six [[studio albums]] and a number of EPs and split releases. Their fourth album, 2014's ''[[Shelter (Alcest album)|Shelter]]'', marked a dramatic shift towards a distinctly shoegaze sound, however their subsequent album ''[[Kodama (album)|Kodama]]'' marked a return to their earlier [[blackgaze]] sound.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18901-alcest-shelter/|title=Alcest: Shelter Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-08-22/how-terror-attacks-and-spiritualism-helped-create-the-new-alcest-album|title=How terror attacks and spiritualism inspired the new Alcest album|date=22 August 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref> The band are widely credited with pioneering the [[blackgaze]]/post-black metal genre, particularly through their EP ''[[Le Secret (Reissue)|Le Secret]]'' released in 2005.<ref name=":2"/><ref name=":3"/>

== History ==
Alcest was formed as a solo project by Neige in 2000.<ref name="True">True, Chris "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alcest-mn0000725155/biography Alcest Biography]", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation. Retrieved 2 August 2014</ref> Soon after, the band became a three-piece [[black metal]] outfit, consisting of Neige on vocals, rhythm/acoustic guitar, and drums, Argoth on bass, and Aegnor.

In 2001, the band released a 4-track demo tape entitled ''[[Tristesse Hivernale]]'' on [[Drakkar Productions]] in which Famine wrote the main riff of the song "La Forêt de Cristal". Not long after the demo was released, the band once again became a one-man entity, with Neige taking Alcest in a more personal direction.<ref name="True" /> Neige, having originally formed Alcest as an outlet to create cold and raw black metal, moved away from the minimalist approach with the follow-up to ''Tristesse Hivernale'', entitled ''[[Le Secret (EP)|Le Secret]]''. This EP, released in May 2005, is an introduction of sorts to the new concept behind the reformed Alcest.

[[File:Alcest @ Prophecy Fest 2016 13.jpg|thumb|left|After being a one-man project for a long time, Alcest became a duo in 2009 when Winterhalter (pictured in 2016) joined as drummer.]]

In August 2007, ''Tristesse Hivernale'' was released by Northern Silence Productions as a split with French black metal band Angmar. The band also released a [[Alcest / Les Discrets|split EP]] with the French band [[Les Discrets]] on 30 November 2009.<ref name="True" />

Alcest's second album, ''[[Écailles de Lune]]'' (Scales of the Moon), was released 29 March 2010. It was a highly anticipated album, and was received with very warm reviews from music critics, with [[AllMusic]]'s Ned Raggett writing that the album "makes the most of its compelling fusion of black metal's theatricality and the after-echoes of shoegaze's propensity for utterly enveloping a listener, even if bandleader Neige approached that sound unconsciously at first."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/%25C3cailles-de-lune-mw0001968309|title=Écailles de Lune - Alcest {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref>

The band's third album, ''[[Les Voyages de l'Âme]]'', was released on 6 January 2012. The album also received positive reviews from music critics, with ''The New York Times'' describing it as "the best example yet of what it [the band] can do."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/arts/music/new-cds-from-jade-alston-jeremy-pelt-and-alcest.html|title=New CDs From Jade Alston, Jeremy Pelt and Alcest|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|date=13 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref>

Alcest's fourth effort entitled ''[[Shelter (Alcest album)|Shelter]]'' was released on 17 January 2014 via Prophecy Productions. It features [[Birgir Jón Birgisson]] as producer, [[Amiina]] for the string sections and a guest appearance by [[Neil Halstead]]. Stylistically the album is a radical departure for the band, dropping all traces of metal from their sound and fully committing to the shoegaze side of their sound. Neige later said in an interview that "We are proud of it, but I think it was maybe a bit too influenced by other things. I really was obsessed with [[Slowdive]] at that time. ''Shelter'' still sounds very 'Alcest', but maybe not as much as the other records."<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Alcest.jpg|thumb|right|Neige's (pictured in 2011) childhood memories are a recurring theme in Alcest's music.]]
On 15 January 2016, Neige published "New album.

== Musical style and concept ==
As a child, Neige had experiences of being in contact with a "far off country", which he generically refers to as "Fairy Land".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avantgarde-metal.com/content/stories2.php?id=202|title=ALCEST : Transcending Human Boundaries.

This change in concept was first introduced on Le Secret. ''Souvenirs d'un autre monde'' serves as a literal summation of the concept behind the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.todestrieb.co.uk/featured/Amesoeurs/ | title=Interview with Neige for Todestrieb Records | access-date=6 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008082643/http://www.todestrieb.co.uk/featured/Amesoeurs/ | archive-date=8 October 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Musically the band's sound has changed over time, beginning with their demo Tristesse hivernale that displays a very raw [[black metal]] sound,<ref name="True"/> before evolving into [[post-black metal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/black-metal-chronicles/black-metal-history-month/my-mom-likes-deafheaven-and-the-future-of-black-metal|title=My Mom Likes Deafheaven and the Future of Black Metal|date=25 February 2016|website=Metal Injection}}</ref> The EP, Le Secret is considered the origin of [[blackgaze]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Jurek, Thom |title=''The Secret'' review |url=http://allmusic.com/album/le-secret-r2172227/review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 January 2012}}</ref> and the band are widely credited with pioneering the genre.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1617782/deconstructing-alcests-shelter-and-metal-in-a-post-deafheaven-world/franchises/deconstructing/|title=Deconstructing: Alcest's Shelter And Metal In A Post-Deafheaven World|date=3 January 2014|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/translator-blackgaze|title=The Translator Blackgaze|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref> The band's sound is defined by a very atmospheric and uplifting tone, and is described as [[post-metal]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-january-2014-20140124/alcest-0034319 | title=Alcest | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | access-date=15 April 2015 | author=Grow, Kory}}</ref> [[shoegaze]],<ref name="allmusic Shelter">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shelter-mw0002600749|title=Shelter – Alcest : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Jurek|first=Thom|access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/r7dne6/alcests-new-track-shelter-delivrance | title=Check Out Alcest's New Shoegaze-y Track "Délivrance" | website=Noisey.vice.com | access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="popmatters">{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/178010-alcest-shelter/ | title=Alcest: Shelter | publisher=[[Popmatters]] | date=15 January 2014 | access-date=12 March 2014 | author=Brown, Dean}}</ref><ref name="exclaim Kodama">{{cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/alcest-kodama| title=Alcest: Kodama review | website=Exclaim.ca| date=28 September 2016 | access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref> and [[alternative metal]].<ref name="True"/> From ''Le Secret'' to ''Shelter'' the band drew on both black metal bands like [[Burzum]] and [[Ulver]] as well as shoegaze bands like [[Slowdive]] to create a huge [[wall of sound]] effect, using abrasive, screamed vocals, [[Blast beat|blastbeat]] sections, as well as fast tremolo-picked guitar passages.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Their 2014 album ''Shelter'' was a significant departure from this sound, a purely shoegaze album entirely eliminating any trace of metal influence.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shelter-mw0002600749|title=Shelter - Alcest {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref> However their following album ''Kodama'' was a partial return to their earlier blackgaze sound.<ref name=":1" />
