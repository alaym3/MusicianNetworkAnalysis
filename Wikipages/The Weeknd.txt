{{Main|House of Balloons|Thursday (album)|Echoes of Silence}}
In August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on [[YouTube]]. The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark [[contemporary R&B]] musical project<!-- not a typo; cited in the source -->. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician [[Curtis Santiago]], Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who [[freestyle rap]]ped over it, although Tesfaye's early work does not feature much rap. This led to the two collaborating on an album. Rose produced three songs – "What You Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that Rose would be credited for them.<ref name="Screwed">{{Cite news |last=McGuire |first=Patrick |date=March 22, 2012 |title=How the Producer of The Weeknd's Breakout Tracks Got Majorly Screwed |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-the-producer-of-the-weeknds-breakout-tracks-got-majorly-screwed |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224110035/http://www.vice.com/read/how-the-producer-of-the-weeknds-breakout-tracks-got-majorly-screwed |archive-date=December 24, 2012}}</ref> In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" to YouTube under the username "xoxxxoooxo".<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon | author-link=Jon Caramanica |title=Screams That Charmed, and Other Overlooked Highlights |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/arts/music/02playlist.html |url-status=live |date=December 31, 2010 | url-access=limited |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210094135/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/arts/music/02playlist.html?_r=4&ref=music |archive-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Stewart |first=Allison |date=March 14, 2011 |title=Singles File: Da Phuture, The Weeknd, Fever Ray |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/14/AR2011031403984.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208064202/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/14/AR2011031403984.html |archive-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]].<ref name=Screwed/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Shepherd |first=Julianne Escobedo |date=March 23, 2011 |title=Love and Other Drugs: The Weeknd's Altered-State R&B |url=https://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/music/love-and-other-drugs-the-weeknds-altered-state-rb/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129222613/https://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/music/love-and-other-drugs-the-weeknds-altered-state-rb/ |archive-date=November 29, 2020 |publisher=[[WNET]]}}</ref> The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |title=The Weeknd – ''What You Need'' |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-the-weeknd-what-you-need/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326174005/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need |archive-date=March 26, 2011 |date=March 4, 2011 | website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

Before adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under two aliases; the Noise and Kin Kane.<ref name="Fantasy" /> His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he, along with his best friend and now creative director [[La Mar Taylor]], dropped out of high school at seventeen years old, took his mattress, and "left one weekend and never came home". However, Rose claims the name was his idea.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 14, 2021|title=The Weeknd Reveals How He Got His Name...

We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before. Unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists. But as the only peer-voted music award, we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community. To be clear, voting in all categories ended well before the Weeknd's performance at the Super Bowl was announced, so in no way could it have affected the nomination process. All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence, and we congratulate them all.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Drury |first=Sharareh |date=November 24, 2020 |title=The Weeknd Lashes Out at Recording Academy: "The Grammys Remain Corrupt" |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-weeknd-lashes-out-at-recording-academy-the-grammys-remain-corrupt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107223936/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-weeknd-lashes-out-at-recording-academy-the-grammys-remain-corrupt |archive-date=January 7, 2021}}</ref></blockquote>

In April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of [[copyright infringement]] from plagiarising their song "I Need to Love" in order to create his song "[[A Lonely Night]]".
