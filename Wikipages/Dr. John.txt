'''Malcolm John Rebennack Jr.''' (November 20, 1941 – June 6, 2019), better known by his stage name '''Dr. John''', was an American singer and songwriter. His music combined [[blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[funk]], and [[rock and roll]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-john-mn0000205180/biography|title=Dr. John - Biography - AllMusic|first1=Richie|last1=Unterberger|work=AllMusic|access-date=January 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218200938/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-john-mn0000205180/biography|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Active as a [[session musician]] from the late 1950s until his death, he gained a following in the late 1960s after the release of his album ''[[Gris-Gris]]'' and his appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]]. He typically performed a lively, theatrical stage show inspired by [[medicine show]]s, [[Mardi Gras]] costumes, and [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ceremonies. Rebennack recorded thirty studio albums and nine live albums, as well as contributing to thousands of other musicians' recordings. In 1973, he achieved a top 10 hit single with "[[Right Place, Wrong Time (song)|Right Place, Wrong Time]]".

==Early life and career==
Rebennack was born in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] on November 20, 1941.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nola.com/music/2018/11/new-orleans-music-legend-dr-john-is-turning-78-or-is-he.html |title=New Orleans music legend Dr. John is turning 78!

He did not take music lessons before his teens and endured only a short stint in [[choir]] before getting kicked out.<ref name="Moss 1990 32–35">{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Stanley|title=Dr. John|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB Magazine]]|date=Fall 1990|volume=33|pages=32–35}}</ref> His father exposed him as a young boy to jazz musicians [[King Oliver]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], who later inspired his 2014 release, ''[[Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch]]''. Throughout his adolescence, his father's connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of rock artists, including [[Little Richard]] and [[Guitar Slim]]. Later he began to perform in New Orleans clubs, mainly on guitar, and played on stage with various local artists.{{sfn|Lichtenstein|Dankner|1993|page=143}}

When he was about 13 years old, Rebennack met [[Professor Longhair]]. Impressed by the professor's flamboyant attire and striking musical style,<ref name="Moss 1990 32–35"/> Rebennack soon began performing with him, and began his life as a professional musician.{{sfn|Lichtenstein|Dankner|1993|page=143}} He later recalled that his debut in the studio, in about 1955 or 1956, came when he was signed as a songwriter and artist by Eddie Mesner at [[Aladdin Records]]. He joined the musicians' union at the end of 1957, with the help of Danny Kessler, and then considered himself to be a professional musician.{{sfn|Broven|2019|page=181}}

At age 16, Rebennack was hired by [[Johnny Vincent]] as a producer at [[Ace Records (United States)|Ace Records]].{{sfn|Broven|2019|page=181}} There, he gained experience working with many artists, including [[James Booker]], [[Earl King]], and [[Jimmy Clanton]]. While a struggling student at [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]], he was already playing in night clubs, something the [[Jesuit]] fathers disapproved of. He formed his first band, The Dominoes, while at the school.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|page=49}} The priests told him to either stop playing in clubs or leave the school. Rebennack was expelled from the high school in 1954{{sfn|Lipsitz|2011|page=221}} and from then on focused entirely on music.

In late 1950s New Orleans, Rebennack gigged with local bands including Mac Rebennack and the Skyliners, (Paul Staehle/Dennis "Bootsie" Cuquet, drums; Earl Stanley, bass; Charlie Miller, trumpet; Charlie Maduell, sax; [[Roland Stone|Roland "Stone" LeBlanc]], vocals), [[Frankie Ford]] and the Thunderbirds, and [[Jerry Byrne (singer)|Jerry Byrne]] and the Loafers. By the age of 17, he had co-written his first rock and roll song "Lights Out", which was a regional hit for [[Jerry Byrne (singer)|Jerry Byrne]] on the [[Specialty Records|Specialty]] label in 1957.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|page=49}} He had a regional hit with a [[Bo Diddley]]-influenced instrumental called "Storm Warning" on Rex Records in 1959. At [[A&R]] he and Charlie Miller recorded [[monophonic]] singles on 45s for Johnny Vincent and Joe Corona for local labels Ace, Ron, and Ric. He oversaw the rhythm section while Miller wrote the horn arrangements and headed up the horns. This continued until Miller moved to New York to study music formally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nola.com/music/2009/12/trumpeter_charlie_miller_retur.html|title=Trumpeter Charlie Miller returns in time to celebrate 'Christmas in New Orleans'|first=Keith|last=Spera|date=December 4, 2009|website=nola.com|access-date=June 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609114217/https://www.nola.com/music/2009/12/trumpeter_charlie_miller_retur.html|archive-date=June 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rebennack became involved in illegal activities in New Orleans, using and selling narcotics and running a [[brothel]]. He was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to two years in the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth]]. When his sentence ended in 1965, however, a campaign was underway to clean up New Orleans by closing its clubs, which meant that he and his fellow musicians found work hard to get, so he left for [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|page=49}}<ref name=sweeting>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/07/dr-john-obituary|title=Dr John obituary|first=Adam|last=Sweeting|date=June 7, 2019|access-date=June 8, 2019|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607220208/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/07/dr-john-obituary|archive-date=June 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3673738/Dr-John-pimp-gunman-pianist.html|title=Dr John: pimp, gunman, pianist|first=Andrew|last=Perry|date=May 28, 2008|access-date=June 8, 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608181606/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3673738/Dr-John-pimp-gunman-pianist.html|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Once settled in Los Angeles{{sfn|Lichtenstein|Dankner|1993|page=143}} he became a "first call" [[session musician]] in the Los Angeles studio scene in the 1960s and 1970s and was part of the so-called [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|"Wrecking Crew"]] stable of studio musicians.<ref name="Greene"/> He provided backing for [[Sonny & Cher]] (and some of the incidental music for [[Cher]]'s first film, ''[[Chastity (1969 film)|Chastity]]''), for [[Canned Heat]] on their albums ''[[Living the Blues]]'' (1968) and ''[[Future Blues (Canned Heat album)|Future Blues]]'' (1970), and for [[Frank Zappa]] and [[the Mothers of Invention]] on ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966).<ref name="Greene"/>

==Voodoo influence==
As a young man, Rebennack was interested in [[Louisiana Voodoo|New Orleans voodoo]], and in Los Angeles, he developed the idea of the [[Louisiana Voodoo#Doctor John|Dr. John]] persona for his old friend [[Ronnie Barron]], based on the life of Dr. John, a [[Senegal]]ese prince, conjure man, herb doctor, and [[Energy medicine|spiritual healer]] who came to New Orleans from [[Haiti]]. This free man of color lived on Bayou Road and claimed to have 15 wives and over 50 children. He kept an assortment of snakes and lizards, along with embalmed scorpions and animal and human skulls, and sold ''[[Gris-gris (talisman)|gris-gris]]'', voodoo [[amulet]]s which supposedly protect the wearer from harm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conjuredoctors.com/dr-john-montanee.html|title=Conjure Doctor Profile: Dr. John Montenee|website=ConjureDoctors.com|access-date=June 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609114545/http://www.conjuredoctors.com/dr-john-montanee.html|archive-date=June 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Martinie|2010}}

Rebennack decided to produce a record and a stage show based on this concept, with Dr. John serving as an emblem of New Orleans heritage. Although initially, the plan was for Barron to front the act assuming the identity of "Dr. John", while Rebennack worked behind the scenes as Dr. John's writer, musician, and producer, this did not come to pass. Barron dropped out of the project, and Rebennack took over the role (and identity) of Dr. John.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Stanley|title=Dr. John|journal=[[BOMB Magazine]]|date=Fall 1990|volume=33|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/33/articles/1378|access-date=May 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517004406/http://bombsite.com/issues/33/articles/1378|archive-date=May 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Gris-Gris]]'' became the name of Dr. John's debut album, released in January 1968, representing his own form of "voodoo medicine".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tallant|first=Robert|title=Voodoo in New Orleans|year=1946|publisher=[[Pelican Publishing]] Company, Inc|location=Gretna, Louisiana|page=33}}</ref>

==1968–1971: Dr. John, the Night Tripper==
Beginning in the late 1960s, Rebennack gained fame as a solo artist after adopting the persona of "Dr. John, The Night Tripper". Dr. John's act combined New Orleans-style [[rhythm and blues]] with [[psychedelic rock]] and elaborate stage shows that bordered on [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. In 1970, when [[Howard Smith (director)|Howard Smith]] asked him where the name "Dr. John the Night Tripper" came from, he responded, "Before that I was Professor Bizarre. Cats used to call me things like "Bishop" or "Governor" or somethin' but they started callin' me "Doctor" for a while, so I just hung it on myself for keeps."{{sfn|Bookstein|2015|page=239}} On the earliest Dr. John records, the artist billing was "Dr. John, The Night Tripper", while the songwriting credits billed him as "Dr. John Creaux". Within a few years, the "Night Tripper" subtitle was dropped, and Rebennack resumed using his real name for writing and producing/arranging credits.

''[[Gris-Gris]]'', his 1968 debut album combining voodoo rhythms and chants with the New Orleans music tradition, was ranked 143rd on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''′s "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]" list.<ref name="top500">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/gris-gris-dr-john-19691231 |at=143 &#124; Gris-Gris - Dr. John |title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |access-date=May 10, 2008 |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=Special Issue |date=November 2003 |publisher=Straight Arrow |issn=0035-791X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220144606/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/gris-gris-dr-john-19691231 |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Three more albums, ''[[Babylon (Dr. John album)|Babylon]]'' (1969), ''[[Remedies (Dr. John album)|Remedies]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Sun, Moon & Herbs]]'' (1971), were released in the same vein as ''Gris-Gris''.

During early to mid-1969, Dr. John toured extensively, backed by supporting musicians Richard "Didymus" Washington (congas), Richard Crooks (drums), David L. Johnson (bass), Gary Carino (guitar), and singers Eleanor Barooshian, Jeanette Jacobs from [[The Cake]], and Sherry Graddie. A second lineup formed later in the year for an extensive tour of the East Coast with Crooks and Johnson joined by Doug Hastings (guitar) and Don MacAllister (mandolin). The same year, Dr. John contributed to the ''[[Music from Free Creek]]'' "supersession" project, playing on three tracks with [[Eric Clapton]]. Washington and Crooks also contributed to the project.

By the time ''The Sun, Moon, and Herbs'' was released, he had gained a notable cult following, which included artists such as [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Mick Jagger]], who both took part in the sessions for that album. This album served as a transition from his Night Tripper voodoo, psychedelic persona to one more closely associated with traditional New Orleans R&B and funk. His next album, ''Dr. John's Gumbo'', with drummer Fred Staehle serving as the band's backbone, proved to be a landmark recording and is one of his most popular to this day.

==1972–1974: ''Gumbo'', ''In the Right Place'', and ''Desitively Bonnaroo''==
Along with ''[[Gris-Gris]]'', Dr. John is perhaps best known for his recordings in the period 1972–74. 1972's ''[[Dr. John's Gumbo]]'', an album covering several New Orleans R&B standards with only one original, is considered a cornerstone of New Orleans music. In his 1994 autobiography, ''Under a Hoodoo Moon'', Dr. John writes, "In 1972, I recorded ''Gumbo'', an album that was both a tribute to and my interpretation of the music I had grown up with in New Orleans in the late 1940s and 1950s. I tried to keep a lot of little changes that were characteristic of New Orleans, while working my own funknology on piano and guitar." The lead single from the album, "[[Iko Iko]]", broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, eventually reaching No. 71. In 2003, ''[[Dr. John's Gumbo]]'' was ranked number 404 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

With ''Gumbo'', Dr. John expanded his career beyond the psychedelic voodoo music and theatrics which had driven his career since he took on the Dr. John persona, although it always remained an integral part of his music and identity. It was not until 1998's ''Anutha Zone'' that he again concentrated on this aspect of his music wholly for a full album. "After we cut the new record", he wrote, "I decided I'd had enough of the mighty-coo-de-fiyo hoodoo show, so I dumped the Gris-Gris routine we had been touring with since 1967 and worked up a new act—a [[Mardi Gras]] revue featuring the New Orleans standards we had covered in ''Gumbo''."

In early 1973 [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] produced an album featuring a collaboration with Dr. John, [[Mike Bloomfield]] and [[John P. Hammond|John Paul Hammond]]. This album, ''Triumvirate'', was recorded in Columbia Studios, San Francisco, and Village Recorders, Los Angeles.

In 1973, with [[Allen Toussaint]] producing and [[The Meters]] backing, Dr. John released the seminal New Orleans funk album ''[[In the Right Place]]''. In the same way that ''Gris-Gris'' introduced the world to the voodoo-influenced side of his music, and in the manner that ''[[Dr. John's Gumbo]]'' began his career-long reputation as an esteemed interpreter of New Orleans standards, ''In the Right Place'' established Dr. John as one of the main ambassadors of New Orleans funk. In describing the album, Dr. John stated, "The album had more of a straight-ahead dance feel than ones I had done in the past, although it was still anchored solid in R&B."{{Citation needed|reason=No source provided for this quote|date=April 2017}} It rose to No. 24 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. In July 1973, the single "Right Place, Wrong Time" peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, as well as peaking at No. 19 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=166}}</ref> A second single, "Such a Night", peaked at No. 42. Still in heavy rotation on most classic rock stations, "Right Place Wrong Time" remains his most recognized song. Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[Doug Sahm]] contributed single lines to the lyrics, which lists several instances of ironic bad luck and failure.

Dr. John attempted to capitalize on ''[[In the Right Place]]''{{'}}s successful formula, again collaborating with Allen Toussaint and The Meters, for his next album, ''[[Desitively Bonnaroo]]'' – from part of which a [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Tennessee festival]] took as its name – released in 1974. Although similar in feel to ''[[In the Right Place]]'', it failed to catch hold in the mainstream as its predecessor had done. It did produce the single "(Everybody Wanna Get Rich) Rite Away", which peaked at No. 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, and to date is the last time he hit the Hot 100. It was his last pure funk album until 1994's ''Television'',<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/473940910/ "Dr. John treats the blues with funky sound"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005316/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/473940910/ |date=December 1, 2018 }}. ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', Edmonton, Ontario, May 30, 1994, Page: 12</ref> although like his voodoo and traditional New Orleans R&B influences, funk continued to heavily influence most of his work to the end, especially his live concerts.

In the mid-1970s Dr. John began an almost 20-year-long collaboration with the R&R Hall of Fame/Songwriters Hall of Fame writer [[Doc Pomus]], to create songs for Dr. John's releases ''City Lights'' and ''Tango Palace'', and for B.B. King's Stuart Levine-produced ''There Must Be a Better World Somewhere'', which won a Grammy for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording in 1982. Dr. John also recorded "I'm On a Roll" – the last song written with Pomus prior to his death in 1991 – for the now out-of-print Rhino/Forward Records 1995 tribute to Pomus titled ''Til the Night Is Gone: A Tribute to Doc Pomus''. The tribute included covers of Pomus-penned songs by [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Hiatt]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[The Band]], [[Los Lobos]], [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Solomon Burke]], and [[Lou Reed]]. According to Pomus' daughter, Dr. John and her father were very close friends as well as writing partners. Dr. John delivered one of a number of eulogies and performed with singer [[Jimmy Scott]] at Pomus' funeral on March 17, 1991 in New York City.

On Thanksgiving Day 1976 he performed "Such a Night" at the farewell concert for [[The Band]], which was filmed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and released as ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.

By the mid-1970s, Rebennack had begun focusing on a blend of music that touched on blues, New Orleans R&B, [[Tin Pan Alley]] standards, and more. In 1975, his manager, Richard Flanzer, hired producer [[Bob Ezrin]], and ''[[Hollywood Be Thy Name]]'' was recorded live at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hollywood-be-thy-name-mw0000204752|title=Hollywood Be Thy Name - Dr. John - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607155543/https://www.allmusic.com/album/hollywood-be-thy-name-mw0000204752|archive-date=June 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The studio was transformed into a New Orleans nightclub for the sessions. In 1981 and 1983, Dr. John recorded two solo piano albums, Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack and The Brightest Smile in Town, for the [[Baltimore]]-based Clean Cuts label.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that it showed Dr. John "exiting a period of relative creative stagnation by creating something magical, the embodiment of everything he's done but pushed in a clear new direction". It won a Grammy Award, as did Auerbach for producing it.<ref name=roberts>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/04/album-review-dr-johns-locked-down.html|title=Pop & Hiss|first1=Randall|last1=Roberts|website=Latimesblog.latimes.com|access-date=January 20, 2015|date=April 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184622/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/04/album-review-dr-johns-locked-down.html|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dr. John described the inspiration of the album as Louis Armstrong coming to him in a dream and telling him "do my music your way". The ''Los Angeles Times'' said, "Tribute albums come and go, but it's a real rarity that can snap a listener to attention like Dr. John's new salute to jazz founding father Louis Armstrong."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-dr-john-spirit-of-satch-20140819-story.html|first1=Randy|last1=Lewis|title=Dr. John infuses Louis Armstrong tribute album with 'Spirit of Satch'|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 19, 2014|access-date=January 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229092904/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-dr-john-spirit-of-satch-20140819-story.html|archive-date=December 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> That spring, "The Musical Mojo of Mac", a New Orleans concert to honor Dr. John, was introduced by [[Brian Williams]] and kicked off by [[Bruce Springsteen]] singing "Right Place, Wrong Time", with Dr. John and an all-star band which included event producer [[Don Was]] on bass.
