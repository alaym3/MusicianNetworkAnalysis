==Biography==
===Early years===
Peterson was born in [[Montreal, Quebec]], to immigrants from the [[West Indies]]; his father worked as a porter for [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1573622/Oscar-Peterson.html|title=Obituaries: Oscar Peterson|date=26 December 2007|access-date=February 6, 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref>Michelot, Pabli. [http://lencrenoir.com/le-jazz-doscar-peterson/ "Le Jazz d’Oscar Peterson"]. ''L'Encre Noir'', February 8, 2017.</ref> Peterson grew up in the neighbourhood of [[Little Burgundy]] in [[Montreal]]. It was in this predominantly [[Black Canadians|black]] neighbourhood that he encountered the jazz culture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Burgundy|access-date=December 25, 2007|publisher=McGill University |url=http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/mellin/arch671/winter2001/marcan/drm/html/littleburgundy.htm}}</ref> At the age of five, Peterson began honing his skills on trumpet and piano, but a bout of [[tuberculosis]] when he was seven prevented him from playing the trumpet again, so he directed all his attention to the piano. His father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter and pianist, was one of his first music teachers, and his sister [[Daisy Sweeney|Daisy]] taught him classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practising [[Scale (music)|scales]] and classical [[étude]]s.

As a child, Peterson studied with Hungarian-born pianist Paul de Marky, a student of [[István Thomán]], who was himself a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]], so his early training was predominantly based on classical piano. But he was captivated by traditional jazz and [[boogie-woogie]] and learned several [[ragtime]] pieces. He was called "the [[Joe Louis|Brown Bomber]] of the Boogie-Woogie".<ref name=theglobeandmail>{{cite news|author=J. D. Considine|title=King of the keys made jazz a pleasure |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071226.oscar-appreciation26/BNStory/Entertainment/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20071226.oscar-appreciation26 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=December 26, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226211911/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071226.oscar-appreciation26/BNStory/Entertainment/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20071226.oscar-appreciation26 |archive-date=December 26, 2007|location=Toronto|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the age of nine, Peterson played piano with a degree of control that impressed professional musicians. For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice. Only in his later years did he decrease his practice to one or two hours daily. In 1940, at fourteen years of age, he won the national music competition organized by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. After that victory, he dropped out of the [[High School of Montreal]], where he played in a band with [[Maynard Ferguson]].<ref name=telegraph>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1527257/Maynard-Ferguson.html Maynard Ferguson] (obituary) dated 26 Aug 2006 at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' online, accessed 30 December 2017</ref> He became a professional pianist, starring in a weekly radio show and playing at hotels and music halls. In his teens he was a member of the Johnny Holmes Orchestra. From 1945 to 1949 he worked in a trio and recorded for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]]. He gravitated toward boogie-woogie and [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] with a particular fondness for [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Teddy Wilson]].<ref name="Yanow">{{cite web |last1=Yanow |first1=Scott |title=Oscar Peterson |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/oscar-peterson-mn0000489316/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref> By the time he was in his 20s, he had developed a reputation as a technically brilliant and melodically inventive pianist.<ref name="Chilton2002">{{cite book|author=John Chilton|title=Roy Eldridge, Little Jazz Giant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES0IAQAAMAAJ|date=5 August 2002 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-5692-2}}</ref>

===Duos, trios, and quartets===
In a cab, on the way to the [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal airport]], [[Norman Granz]] heard a radio program broadcasting from a local club. He was so impressed that he told the driver to take him to the club so he could meet the pianist. In 1949 he introduced Peterson in New York City at a [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert at [[Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=theglobeandmail/> He remained Peterson's manager for most of his career. This was more than a managerial relationship; Peterson praised Granz for standing up for him and other black jazz musicians in the segregationist south US of the 1950s and 1960s. In the documentary video ''Music in the Key of Oscar'', Peterson tells how Granz stood up to a gun-toting Southern policeman who wanted to stop the trio from using "whites-only" taxis.<ref>View Video, 2004.</ref>

In 1950, Peterson worked in a duo with double bassist  [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]]. Two years later they added guitarist [[Barney Kessel]]. Then [[Herb Ellis]] stepped in after Kessel grew weary of touring. The trio remained together from 1953 to 1958, often touring with Jazz at the Philharmonic.<ref name="Yanow" />

{{Listen|filename=The Way You Look Tonight.ogg|title="The Way You Look Tonight" (1965)|description=The Way You Look Tonight sample|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Peterson also worked in duos with [[Samuel Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]], [[Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Irving Ashby]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-2000352400|title=Peterson, Oscar |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.j352400|access-date=2018-01-15|year=2003 |last1=Dobbins |first1=Bill |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry |isbn=978-1-56159-263-0 }}</ref> [[Count Basie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-1002240170|title=Basie, Count|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.a2240170|access-date= 2018-01-15|year=2013|last1=Knauer|first1=Wolfram|isbn=978-1-56159-263-0}}</ref>  and [[Herbie Hancock]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oscar-peterson/|title=Oscar Peterson |last=King |first=Betty Nygaard|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>

He considered the trio with Brown and Ellis "the most stimulating" and productive setting for public performances and studio recordings. In the early 1950s, he began performing with Brown and drummer [[Charlie Smith (drummer)|Charlie Smith]] as the Oscar Peterson Trio. Shortly afterward Smith was replaced by guitarist [[Irving Ashby]], who had been a member of the Nat King Cole Trio. Ashby, who was a swing guitarist, was soon replaced by Kessel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarpeterson.com/op/career.html |title=A look at Oscar Peterson's career |publisher=oscarpeterson.com |access-date=May 23, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428040229/http://www.oscarpeterson.com/op/career.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = April 28, 2007}}</ref> Their last recording, ''[[On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio]]'', recorded live at the [[Town Tavern]] in [[Toronto]], captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding between three players.<ref>[[Nat Hentoff]]. Co-editor, ''[[The Jazz Review]]''.</ref>

When Ellis departed in 1958, they hired drummer [[Ed Thigpen]] because they felt no guitarist could compare to Ellis.<ref name="Yanow" /> Brown and Thigpen worked with Peterson on his albums ''[[Night Train (Oscar Peterson album)|Night Train]]'' and ''[[Canadiana Suite]]''. Both left in 1965 and were replaced by bassist Sam Jones and drummer [[Louis Hayes]] (and later, drummer [[Bobby Durham (jazz musician)|Bobby Durham]]). The trio performed together until 1970. In 1969 Peterson recorded ''[[Motions and Emotions]]'' with orchestral arrangements of "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" and "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" by [[The Beatles]]. In the fall of 1970, Peterson's trio released the album ''[[Tristeza on Piano]]''. Jones and Durham left in 1970.

In the 1970s Peterson formed a trio with guitarist Joe Pass and bassist [[Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen]]. This trio emulated the success of the 1950s trio with Brown and Ellis and gave acclaimed performances at festivals. Their album [[The Trio (1973 album)|''The Trio'']] won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. On April 22, 1978, Peterson performed in the interval act for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]] that was broadcast live from the [[Palais des congrès de Paris]]. In 1974 he added British drummer [[Martin Drew]]. This quartet toured and recorded extensively worldwide. Pass said in a 1976 interview, "The only guys I've heard who come close to total mastery of their instruments are Art Tatum and Peterson".<ref>{{Cite book|title=25 Great Jazz Piano Solos : Transcriptions * Lessons * Bios * Photos|last=White|first=Huy|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4950-6530-9|pages=96|oclc=974891066}}</ref>

Peterson was open to experimental collaborations with jazz musicians such as saxophonist [[Ben Webster]], trumpeter [[Clark Terry]], and vibraphonist [[Milt Jackson]]. In 1961, the Peterson trio with Jackson recorded the album ''[[Very Tall]]''. His solo recordings were rare until  ''[[Exclusively for My Friends]]'' ([[MPS Records|MPS]]), a series of albums that were his response to pianists such as [[Bill Evans]] and [[McCoy Tyner]]. He recorded for [[Pablo Records|Pablo]], led by Norman Granz, after the label was founded in 1973, including the [[The Silent Partner (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the 1978 thriller ''[[The Silent Partner (1978 film)|The Silent Partner]]''.<ref name="Yanow2000">{{cite book |last=Yanow|first=Scott |title=Bebop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs_8j7s8xdoC&pg=PA333 |access-date=14 August 2018|year=2000|publisher=Miller Freeman |isbn=978-0-87930-608-3|pages=333–}}</ref> In the 1980s he played in a duo with pianist Herbie Hancock. In the late 1980s and 1990s, after a stroke, he made performances and recordings with his protégé [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]]. In the 1990s and 2000s he recorded several albums accompanied by a combo for [[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]].

===Ill health and later years===
[[File:Grave of Oscar Peterson - St. Peter's Anglican Church.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone of Oscar Peterson at St. Peter's Anglican Church in Mississauga]]
Peterson had arthritis from his youth, and in later years he had trouble buttoning his shirt. Never slender, his weight increased to {{convert|125|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, hindering his mobility. He had hip replacement surgery in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/p/P62.HTM |title=Peterson, Oscar |access-date=December 25, 2007 |encyclopedia=MusicWeb Encyclopaedia of Popular Music |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522192039/http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/p/P62.HTM |archive-date=May 22, 2006 }}</ref> Although the surgery was successful, his mobility was still hampered. In 1993 a  stroke  weakened his left side and removed him from work for two years. During the same year incoming prime minister [[Jean Chrétien]], his friend and fan, offered him the position of  [[Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario]]. According to Chrétien, Peterson declined the job due to ill health related to the stroke.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alexander Panetta |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/12/24/4739694-cp.html |title=Chrétien calls Peterson 'most famous Canadian', says Mandela was moved to meet him |publisher=The Canadian Press |work=CANOE |access-date=December 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071226030443/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/12/24/4739694-cp.html |archive-date=December 26, 2007 }}</ref>

Although he recovered some dexterity in his left hand, his piano playing was diminished, and his style relied principally on his right hand. In 1995 he returned to occasional public performances and recorded for Telarc. In 1997 he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award. His friend, Canadian politician and amateur pianist [[Bob Rae]], said, "a one-handed Oscar was better than just about anyone with two hands."<ref name=radio2best>{{cite news|work=Concerts On Demand |title=Oscar Peterson Tribute - Simply The Best |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/singleConcert.html?20080112oscar |publisher=CBC Radio Two |date=January 12, 2008 |access-date=January 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115133046/http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/singleConcert.html?20080112oscar |archive-date=January 15, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2003, Peterson recorded the DVD ''A Night in Vienna'' for [[Verve Records|Verve]] with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, [[Ulf Wakenius]], and Martin Drew. He continued to tour the U.S. and Europe, though at most one month a year, with rest between concerts.

In 2007 his health declined. He canceled his plans to perform at the [[Toronto Jazz Festival]] and a Carnegie Hall all-star concert that was to be given in his honour. Peterson died on December 23, 2007 of kidney failure at his home in [[Mississauga|Mississauga, Ontario]].<ref name="death">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/12/24/obit-peterson-oscar.html | title=Canadian jazz great Oscar Peterson dies | publisher=CBC News |access-date=December 24, 2007 | date=December 24, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Doug |last=Levine |title=Jazz World Mourns Oscar Peterson |date=December 27, 2007 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-26-voa62.cfm |work=VOA News |access-date=December 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129200208/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-26-voa62.cfm |archive-date=January 29, 2009}}</ref>

In 2021, Director Barry Avrich produced a documentary on Peterson's life ( Oscar Peterson: Black + White) that had its world premiere on September 12, 2021 at The Toronto International Film Festival and featured luminaries such as Billy Joel, Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones and Jon Batiste weighing in on Peterson's career.

==Composer and teacher==
[[File:Oscar Peterson.jpg|thumb|Peterson in 1977]]

Peterson taught piano and improvisation in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto for five years during the 1960s, but it closed because touring called him and his associates away, and it did not have government funding.<ref>{{cite web | author=Al Levy | title=Oscar Peterson | url=http://www.alevy.com/peterson.htm | publisher=alevy.com | date=21 November 2004  | access-date=2008-01-12}}</ref> Later, he mentored the [[York University]] jazz program and was the Chancellor of the university for several years in the early 1990s.<ref name="oliverjones">{{cite news | title='I don't think we'll ever see another Oscar Peterson': Oliver Jones |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/01/11/oscar-tributes.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | date=January 11, 2008 | access-date=January 12, 2008}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=YFile » Ron Westray appointed as Oscar Peterson Chair |url=http://yfile-archive.news.yorku.ca/2009/09/24/ron-westray-appointed-as-oscar-peterson-chair/ |website=Yfile-archive.news.yorku.ca |access-date=14 August 2018 |date=24 September 2009}}</ref> He published jazz piano etudes for practice. He asked his students to study the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], especially ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'', and ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', considering these piano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Among his students were pianists [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]] and [[Oliver Jones (pianist)|Oliver Jones]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Several of jazz world's top names to honour Oscar Peterson at free concert |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5j8cM3pe_Ji_ef_AccG8IpSHXAPsw |publisher=The Canadian Press |date=January 12, 2008 |access-date=January 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231081203/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5j8cM3pe_Ji_ef_AccG8IpSHXAPsw |archive-date=December 31, 2007 }}</ref>

==Peterson and Tatum==
Peterson was influenced by [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[James P. Johnson]], and [[Art Tatum]], to whom many compared Peterson in later years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oscarpeterson.com/bio/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226112154/http://oscarpeterson.com/bio/|url-status=dead|title=Oscar Peterson &#124; Bio<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=December 26, 2007}}</ref> After his father played a record of Tatum's "[[Tiger Rag]]", he was intimidated and disillusioned, quitting the piano for several weeks. "Tatum scared me to death," said Peterson, adding that he was "never cocky again" about his ability at the piano.<ref>{{cite news|author=Don Heckman|title=Oscar Peterson, 82; pianist dazzled jazz world with technique, creativity|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-me-peterson25dec25,0,7024176.story?coll=la-home-center|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 25, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228023925/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-me-peterson25dec25%2C0%2C7024176.story?coll=la-home-center|archive-date=December 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tatum was a model for Peterson's musicianship during the 1940s and 1950s. Tatum and Peterson became good friends, although Peterson was always shy about being compared to Tatum and rarely played the piano in Tatum's presence.

Peterson also credited his sister&mdash;a piano teacher in Montreal who also taught several other Canadian jazz musicians&mdash;with being an important teacher and influence on his career. Under his sister's tutelage, Peterson expanded into classical piano training and broadened his range while mastering the core classical pianism from scales to preludes and fugues by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>William R Cunningham and [[Sylvia Sweeney]], [http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/index.php?id=28498, ''In the Key of Oscar''], National Film Board of Canada, 1992.</ref>

Building on Tatum's pianism and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum's musical influences, notably from piano concertos by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. Rachmaninoff's harmonizations, as well as direct [[Musical quotation|quotations]] from his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|2nd Piano Concerto]], are scattered throughout many recordings by Peterson, including his work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] and guitarist [[Herb Ellis]]. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances; they reveal more of his eclectic style, absorbing influences from various genres of jazz, popular, and classical music.

According to pianist and educator Mark Eisenman, some of Peterson's best playing was as an understated accompanist to singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and trumpeter [[Roy Eldridge]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Shsante Infantry|title=Oscar Peterson, 82: Jazz giant|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/288762|work=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=December 26, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2008}}</ref>
