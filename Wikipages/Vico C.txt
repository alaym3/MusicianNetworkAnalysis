==Biography==
===Early life and influence===
He was born in New York and raised in [[Puerto Rico]]. Nicknamed ''El Filósofo del Rap'', ("The Philosopher of Rap"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.univision.com/entretenimiento/vico-c-dicta-los-terminos-de-su-recta-final-por-mas-larga-que-sea|title=Vico C dicta los términos de su 'Recta Final' por más larga que sea|website=Univision|language=es}}</ref> Luis Armando Lozada Cruz adopted the professional name '''Vico C'''.  Vico C describes reggaeton as "essentially hip-hop but with a flavor more compatible to the Caribbean."<ref name="Rivera Marshall Hernandez Radano 2009 p. 28">{{cite book | last1=Rivera | first1=R.Z. | last2=Marshall | first2=W. | last3=Hernandez | first3=D.P. | last4=Radano | first4=R. | last5=Kun | first5=J. | last6=Flores | first6=J. | title=Reggaeton | publisher=Duke University Press | series=Refiguring American Music | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-8223-9232-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koaINmF8l5kC&pg=PA28  | access-date=January 7, 2020 | page=28}}</ref> Though he maintains they are of the same essence, Vico C believes the difference lies in the quintessential music style; the beat or rhythm of the music. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Vico C – Timeline featuring albums and other highlights from his career and personal life.|url=https://www.bing.com/k/celebrities/vico-c/timeline|access-date=November 25, 2020|website=www.bing.com}}</ref>

As one of the founders of hip hop in Spanish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinolife.co.uk/articles/top-10-latin-hip-hop-artists|title=TOP 10 Latin Hip Hop Artists|website=Latino Life}}</ref> Vico C was able to show that it was possible for one to be able to rap entirely and compellingly in Spanish using just occasional English phrases or slang terms. He can be seen in the rap movement as far back as its "underground" days ghostwriting and producing music for other young performers in the Puerto Rican rap scene.<ref name="holdsitdown">[http://www.latinrapper.com/featurednews54.html Interview: Vico C Still Holds it Down for Puerto Rico]</ref>

Vico C grew up in the ''Puerta de Tierra'' barrio in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].<ref name="holdsitdown" /> He got enrolled in acting classes by the age of nine and began his professional rapping career in 1985. At first, he used to go to bodegas (grocery stores) or pharmacies, buy home recording tapes, record himself singing his songs and then sell the tapes to friends or family.  Vico C was discovered by DJ Negro in 1985 whom immediately saw the great potential of hip hop in Spanish and chose to record Vico's earliest demos.  Upon the positive reaction from the barrio, DJ Negro brought Vico to the most successful hip hop promoter in Puerto Rico, Jorge Oquendo (also known as 'El Sexy Boy').  Jorge Oquendo formed the record label 'Prime Records' with Vico C as the lead artist of the label.  Prime Records eventually received a distribution deal via Sony BMG Latin.  Prime Records is one of the most successful and influential record labels in the history of Spanish rap and reggaeton known for being the home to legendary acts such as DJ Negro, Vico- C, [[El General]], [[Lisa M]], Falo, Brewley MC and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJi0SgjvPo|title=Entrevista al Sexy Boy – Ep 137 Masacote|last=Chente Ydrach|date=November 16, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvCrLDIX7g|title=Entrevista a Dj Negro – Masacote ep 136|last=Chente Ydrach|date=November 9, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In May 2019 he suffered seizures resulting from an allergic reaction to medication and was hospitalized but recovered.<ref name="seizure">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8512253/vico-c-hospitalized-puerto-rico|title=Rapper Vico C Rushed to the Hospital After Several Seizures|last=Fernandez|first=Suzette|work=Billboard|date=May 20, 2019|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>

===Career===
In 1988, Spanish rap in Puerto Rico was not at a popular high,<ref name="holdsitdown" /> and Vico-C was the first one to rap in Spanish in Puerto Rico, considered the Godfather of Spanish Hip Hop and the pioneer of this genre, there were others who followed in his footsteps, rapping in the ghettos. Brewley MC, Piro JM, Jimmy MC, Bimbo, (Lisa M, Jelly Dee Franceska, came afterward) [[Ruben DJ]] was the first rapper to sound on the radio by releasing "La Escuela" after Vico C fame was already known on the whole island for his underground lyrics. Brewley MC also recorded "El Sida Rap with Green Records". Vico C entered the charts with his song "La Recta Final" which he personally designed the album cover for, with his artistic talents. Vico C was signed to Prime Records and started touring to venues in New York, [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], Mexico, [[Venezuela]], El Salvador, [[Panama]], the [[Dominican Republic]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

Vico C, in 1992 released his singles "Saborealo" and "María" which became gold and [[platinum album]]s, respectively{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. In 1994, he established his own record company VC Records, promoting such singers as Lissy Estrella, Francheska, and [[Lisa M]] who were originally his back up dancers. In 1990, Vico C was involved in a near-fatal motorcycle accident. His injuries led to his abuse of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol.<ref name="Playphone">{{cite web|url=http://www.playphone.com/Artist/Vico+C/20248|title=Vico C Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/escenario/motivado-por-la-rabia-vico-c/article_7b92c6a0-4416-11e8-b6a8-83b61f0ad621.html|title=Motivado por la rabia Vico C|first=Yomaris |last=Rodríguez|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es}}</ref>

Soon after, he became an evangelical Christian and went into a voluntary semi-retirement. In 1998, he resurfaced, with the "rambunctious", Christian rap CD ''[[Aquel Que Había Muerto]]''.<ref name="babilla">[http://www.latinrapper.com/vico-c-second-interview.html Courage Defined: Vico C Interview]</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/latin/8498239/bad-bunny-billboard-cover-story-2019|title=How Bad Bunny Took Over Pop – Singing Exclusively In Spanish|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> The new CD went gold and in 1999, he returned to the touring scene with his concert ''Antes y después''. Soon after, he released a sequel to ''Aquel Que Había Muerto''. With that, he earned the Latino Rap of the year award by [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]].

In 2003, Vico C released an album titled ''[[En Honor A La Verdad]]''. While it was not a major hit it still sold well and one of the album's singles "El Bueno, El Malo y El Feo", referring to [[Eddie Dee]], himself and [[Tego Calderón]] respectively. The single was widely heard. The single was a great combination of the best "Conscience" subgenre of rap artists.

Vico C's recent albums include ''[[Desahogo (Vico C album)|Desahogo]]'', in early 2005. The album was a success and born June 3, 2006, he came back with another concert, ''El Encuentro''.

Many consider Vico C to be a pioneer of [[rap]]{{weasel words inline|date=September 2014}}. Music industry figures{{who|date=September 2014}} called him the "father and creator of rap".<ref name="babilla" /> He has worked alongside artists including Big Boy, Eddie Dee, [[Héctor & Tito]], [[Tego Calderón]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. He has also worked with producers [[Baby Ranks]], [[Tony Touch]] and [[Luny Tunes]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

He has sung alongside [[Salsa music|salsa]] singer [[Gilberto Santa Rosa]] and [[cumbia]] group [[Kumbia Kings]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

Vico C tries to maintain a Christian theme throughout his music{{original research inline|date=September 2014}}. His brother [[Jay Lozada]] is a salsa musician.

In 2020 music by Vico C was part of the annual Banco Popular Christmas songs compilation album.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8546525/latin-christmas-songs-2020|title=Latin Christmas Songs Sleighing The Season in 2020: Throwbacks, Twists & Good Tidings That Rock!|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>
