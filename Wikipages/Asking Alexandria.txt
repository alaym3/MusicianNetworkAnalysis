'''Asking Alexandria''' <!-- Please do not change "are" to "is", this article is written in EU-English wherein the standards of organizations are stated through the word "are" and not "is" --> are a British [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[York]], [[North Yorkshire]], consisting of guitarists [[Ben Bruce]] and Cameron Liddell, drummer James Cassells, lead vocalist [[Danny Worsnop]], and bassist Sam Bettley.

Initially formed in 2006 by Ben Bruce, the band officially established as a six-piece in 2008 with the founding line-up consisting of Bruce, Worsnop, Cassells, Liddell, Joe Lancaster and Ryan Binns. After the departure of Lancaster and Binns, as well as the recruitment of bassist Sam Bettley in 2009, the band released their debut album ''[[Stand Up and Scream]]'' (2009). The band released two studio albums ''[[Reckless & Relentless]]'' (2011) and ''[[From Death to Destiny]]'' (2013), before the departure of Worsnop in January 2015. He was replaced by [[Denis Stoff]] and the band released ''[[The Black (album)|The Black]]'' (2016). Stoff departed from the band in October that year, and Worsnop subsequently returned to the band. The band released their [[Asking Alexandria (album)|self-titled]] fifth album in late 2017, which was a marked stylistic departure from their previous works. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Like a House on Fire]]'', which was released on 15 May 2020, shows the group's continuity of a more straightforward and melodic [[hard rock]] sound, while also shift into different genres. Its follow-up and their seventh studio album, ''[[See What's on the Inside]]'', was released on 1 October 2021.

Bruce carried the name of his previous band over to his new one, due to not wanting the bother of coming up with a new one. However, he insists that despite having the same name, it is not the same band.<ref name="Asking Alexandria formation interview" /> When asked why he chose that particular name, he explained that "'''Most bands have a pretty shit band name, so I just came up with something.

[[File:Asking Alexandria - Rock am Ring 2015-8929.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Denis Stoff]] was a part of Asking Alexandria from early 2015 until his departure in late 2016.]]

On 22 January 2015, lead singer Danny Worsnop announced his departure from the band to focus on rock music with his new band [[We Are Harlot]].

When Bruce was asked regarding the sound of the fourth album, he stated that while it will feature influences of [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Van Halen]] it will also feature influences from modern bands such as [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], stating that since the third album was such an unexpected change in musical style he believes that fans will expect further experimentation on the next, therefore having less backlash from their fan base.<ref name="Bruce interview loudwire Sept 2014">{{cite web|last1=Jackie|first1=Full Metal|title=Asking Alexandria's Ben Bruce on New Album Plans, His Own Record Label + More|url=http://loudwire.com/asking-alexandria-ben-bruce-new-album-plans-his-own-record-label-more/|website=Loudwire.com|publisher=Loudwire|access-date=9 March 2015}}</ref> He has also stated that they started writing material for the album while on tour in summer of 2014 and had written around 18 tracks, and estimates that it will be released between July and August 2015.<ref name="2015 album intentions">{{cite news|title=The 2015 Hotlist|url=http://www.kerrang.com/26790/k1550-2015-secrets-ultimate-preview/|access-date=16 March 2015|work=Kerrang!|agency=Kerrang!|issue=1550|publisher=Kerrang!|date=7 January 2015}}</ref>

On 26 May 2015, [[Denis Stoff]], formerly the guitarist and vocalist of Ukrainian metalcore bands [[Make Me Famous]] and Down & Dirty, was revealed as the new lead vocalist when the band released "[[I Won't Give In]]", their first single with him, on 27 May.<ref name="I Won't Give In Kerrang report">{{cite web|title = Asking Alexandria Reveal Frontman, Stream New Song I Won't Give In|url = http://www.kerrang.com/31929/asking-alexandria-reveal-frontman-stream-new-song-i-wont-give/|first = Emily|website = [[Kerrang!]]|date = 27 May 2015|access-date = 27 May 2015|last = Carter}}</ref> Speculation regarding Stoff's involvement started shortly after Worsnop's departure due to similarities between Asking Alexandria and Make Me Famous (who were said to have been ripping off the band's sound); the fact that they were label mates would have made the transition easy for Stoff to make, and on his personal YouTube account he had covered multiple Asking Alexandria songs.<ref name="I Won't Give In Kerrang report"/><ref name="Denis Stoff speculation">{{cite web|last1=Crane|first1=Matt|title=Is this Asking Alexandria's new singer|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/is_this_asking_alexandrias_new_singer|website=Altpress.com|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> Bruce was asked if he considered anyone else for the role and he stated that "It has to be Denis" going on to praise his much greater vocal range and since he was inspired by Worsnop in the earlier stages of Asking Alexandria he can perform their songs live much better than Worsnop could, however when Stoff himself was asked how he would distinguish himself from him, he stated he would not make any comparison since he is a completely different person.<ref name="Ben Bruce 1570 Kerrang interview"/>

In mid-October 2016, it was speculated that the band had settled their differences with original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop and that some sort of collaborative effort would be made after several pictures were posted of Worsnop and Bruce in the studio together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/what_are_asking_alexandria_teasing_with_ex_frontman_danny_worsnop|title=What are Asking Alexandria teasing with ex-frontman Danny Worsnop?|website=Alternative Press|access-date=31 October 2016}}</ref> However, it was revealed two days later that Worsnop had actually returned to the band as an official member after the departure of Denis Stoff.

=== Lyrical style ===
Ben Bruce has expressed the feeling that the band's lyrical style before ''Reckless & Relentless'' was immature. According to Bruce, the band wanted to move on from yelling out lyrics like "fuck" and "you stupid fucking whore" to a more mature style with more meaning.<ref name="Phoenix New Times March 2011">{{cite web|last1=Fossum|first1=Melissa|title=Asking Alexandria's Ben Bruce on Evergreen Terrace, Maturing as a Band, and Appealing to a Wider Fanbase|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/03/asking_alexandrias_ben_bruce_o.php|website=blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com|publisher=Phoenix New Times|access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref> He stated that ''From Death to Destiny'' is lyrically their most mature album, no longer focusing on subjects such as drugs and women, and much more meaningful than their older lyrics.<ref name="Guitar World November 2013">{{cite web|last1=Bienstock|first1=Richard|title=Asking Alexandria's Ben Bruce: "It's Time for Us to Move Upward"|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/asking-alexandrias-ben-bruce-it-s-time-us-move-upward|website=Guitarworld.com|publisher=Guitar World|access-date=30 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202033631/http://www.guitarworld.com/asking-alexandrias-ben-bruce-it-s-time-us-move-upward|archive-date=2 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Danny Worsnop has claimed that the band's lyrics are never written before entering the studio and are always improvised during the recording of an album.<ref name="Improv lyrics">{{cite web|last1=Jackie|first1=Full Metal|title=Asking Alexandria's Danny Worsnop Talks Spontaneous Songwriting, Day Drinking + More|url=http://loudwire.com/asking-alexandria-danny-worsnop-spontaneous-songwriting-day-drinking/|website=Loudwire.com|publisher=Loudwire|access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
