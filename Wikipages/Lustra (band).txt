'''Lustra''' is an American rock band originally from [[Boston]] and later from [[Los Angeles]].

Band members Chris Baird, Nick Cloutman, Jon Baird, and Jason Adams first played together in 1996 under the name Seventeen, releasing two full-lengths and an EP under this name. Bruce Fulford joined the group shortly before the release of their 1999 EP. Legal challenges from ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine eventually led the band to change names in 2001; Jon Baird also left the group that same year.<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p777489|pure_url=yes}} Lustra] at [[Allmusic]]</ref>

Their first full-length as Lustra was issued in 2003, and soon after the group landed the song "[[Scotty Doesn't Know]]" on the soundtrack to the 2004 film ''[[EuroTrip]]''. The band also appears briefly in the film, with [[Matt Damon]] acting (and lip-synching) as their lead vocalist.<ref name=amg/> The film was not a box office success but sold well on [[DVD]], raising the band's profile long after its theatrical run.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57698/lustra Lustra], [[Billboard.com]]</ref> "Scotty Doesn't Know" was included on Lustra's 2006 full-length, ''[[Left for Dead (Lustra album)|Left for Dead]]'', and became a hit single that year almost entirely as a result of download sales, eventually peaking at No.&nbsp;75 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;39 on the Digital Songs chart,<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=soundtrack|chart=all}} "Scotty Doesn't Know"], [[Billboard.com]]</ref> and No.&nbsp;53 on the [[Pop 100]] in the United States.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p777489|pure_url=yes}} Charts], Allmusic</ref> ''What You Need & What You Get'' was released in September 2008.<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/what-you-need-what-you-get-mr0004367853</ref>
