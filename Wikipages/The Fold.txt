'''The Fold''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. The Fold formed in 2002 but broke up in 2003 due to personal issues. Two years later, in 2005, they reunited and began work on their album ''[[This Too Shall Pass]]''. In 2018 the band took a break and came back in 2019. They have released five albums and three EP's since 2002. The latest full-length, '''''Moving Past''''', came out on October 15, 2013. Career highlights include reaching 100 million views on their YouTube channel and a nomination ''[[Secrets Keep You Sick]]'' for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category of "Best Recording Package". Their single "Gravity" from the album ''This Too Shall Pass'' reached No.&nbsp;1 on the CHR Rock charts. The band has more recently written much themed music for sports and television.

==History==
Their debut album ''[[This Too Shall Pass (The Fold album)|This Too Shall Pass]]'' was released February 22, 2006 on [[Tooth & Nail Records]]. The follow-up ''[[Secrets Keep You Sick]]'' was released May 22, 2007. ''Secrets Keep You Sick'' was nominated for a Grammy under the "Best Recording Package" category, but the band lost to ''[[Cassadaga (album)|Cassadaga]]'' by [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_show/list.aspx#24] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Directly following the release of ''Secrets'', the band spent their summer on the Vans Warped Tour. The Fold played alongside friends [[Plain White T's]] and [[The Spill Canvas]] on their own dollar to support their 2008 sold-out UK tour. Upon returning to the U.S., The Fold parted ways with [[Tooth & Nail Records|Tooth & Nail]], and completed their third studio album ''Dear Future, Come Get Me'' with Zack and Kenneth ([[Cartel (band)|Cartel]], [[All Time Low]], [[Mayday Parade]]), who also recorded ''[[Secrets Keep You Sick]]''.

In December 2009, the band released a self-shot music video for "Every Band in the USA"'','' a parody of the [[Miley Cyrus]] hit "[[Party in the U.S.A.]]". The video has been viewed on [[YouTube]] nearly 500,000 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAowjjHgKks |title=Miley Cyrus — Party in the USA — Every Band in the USA — Parody by The Fold |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> On June 29, 2010 the band released a video for the song "Neverender" off ''Dear Future, Come Get Me''. The video was filmed at [[Willowbrook High School]], the former high school of frontman Dan Castady and also of [[Tom Higgenson]], the lead singer of the [[Plain White T's]].

In November 2010, The Fold released the song "This Christmas" on [[iTunes]], along with two unofficial, self made videos. One of which featured all of the best crowd reactions from Oprah's Ultimate Favorite Things, 2010. The video can be seen here on their [[YouTube]] channel.

In January 2011, the band recorded a song titled "The Weekend Whip", the theme song for the ''[[Ninjago (TV series)|Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]'' [[television series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvu5ET3MRt8|title=Ninjago theme song "The Weekend Whip" as performed by The Fold|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The band announced in early 2012 that they would release a full EP of ninja-themed pop rock songs aimed at the Ninjago demographic; rolling it out a single at a time via digital outlets, and then completing the process in late Summer 2012 with a full EP release, along with karaoke sing-a-long versions, and various other exclusive content entitled "For The Spinners".

In 2012, The Fold wrote and released "Let's Go Cubbies" which was adopted as the official song of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. It continues to be played during every Cubs broadcast on WGN Radio 720AM. The Fold performed live at [[Wrigley Field]] on opening day April 5, 2012.

The Fold's fourth album, ''Moving Past'', was co-produced by the band and [[Sean O'Keefe (producer)|Sean O'Keefe]], and mixed by J.R. McNeely. The album came out October 15, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/MovingPast.asp|title=The Fold, "Moving Past" Review|website=Jesusfreakhideout.com}}</ref>

In 2016, The Fold was tasked with writing more music for the Cubs, including a song called "Let The Games Begin", which they played at Opening Day at Wrigley Field, and again at the final rally before the post-season. The Cubs went all the way and won the [[2016 World Series|World Series]] that year, the first time in 108 years.

The Fold continue to write and record music in 2017, mostly for [[Lego Ninjago|LEGO Ninjago]], but there has been talk of late of a new full-length album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyS3TALkNxk|title=Dan answers fan questions |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In the season 9 finale of ''Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu'', The Fold appear as LEGO Minifigures to congratulate the Ninja for defeating Lord Garmadon. Appearing as characters from the show, they sing "The Weekend Whip", also in short of Season 10 named "The Weekend Drill", they appeared in Prison.

"The Weekly Whip" is a series on YouTube, bringing new Episode every week starting 2 August with Episode "Arcadian Whip lost title + artwork".

On November 13, 2020, The Fold released a song titled “Young & Free”, their first song unrelated to Ninjago in seven years. On April 16, 2021 The Fold released “World Gone Mad” another song that is unrelated to Ninjago.
