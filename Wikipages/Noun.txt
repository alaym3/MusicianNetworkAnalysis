{{short description|Word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects}}

A '''noun''' ({{ety|la|nōmen|name}})<ref>{{L&S|nomen|nōmen|ref}}</ref> is a [[word]] that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Noun|year=2014|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online)|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noun}}</ref><ref group=note>Example nouns for:

* Ideas or abstract entities: ''musicianship, cooperativeness, perfection, ''The New York Times'', mathematics, impossibility,'' etc.</ref> However, ''noun'' is not a [[semantic]] category, so it cannot be characterized in terms of its meaning. Thus, actions and states of existence can also be expressed by [[verb]]s, qualities by [[adjective]]s, and places by [[adverb]]s. [[Linguistics|Linguistically]], a noun is a member of a large, [[open class (linguistics)|open]] part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[clause]], the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a [[verb]], or the object of a [[preposition]].<ref>Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

Lexical categories ([[Part of speech|parts of speech]]) are defined in terms of the ways in which their members combine with other kinds of expressions.  The [[syntactic]] rules for nouns differ between [[language]]s. In [[English language|English]], nouns are those words which can occur with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[adjective|attributive adjectives]] and can function as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[noun phrase]]. "As far as we know, every language makes a grammatical distinction that looks like a noun verb distinction."<ref>{{cite book|title=Language Unlimited: The science behind our most creative power|author=David Adger |author-link1=David Adger |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882809-9|page=78}}</ref>

== History <span id="Substantive as a word for noun"></span>==
{{hatnote|See also [[Part of speech#History|History of parts of speech]]}}
[[Word class]]es (parts of speech) were described by [[Sanskrit]] grammarians from at least the 5th century BC. In [[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'', the noun (''nāma'') is one of the four main categories of words defined.<ref name=Matilal>[[Bimal Krishna Matilal]], ''The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language'', 1990 (Chapter 3)</ref>

The [[Ancient Greek]] equivalent was ''ónoma'' (ὄνομα), referred to by [[Plato]] in the [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialog]], and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in ''[[The Art of Grammar]]'', attributed to [[Dionysius Thrax]] (2nd century BC). The term used in [[Latin grammar]] was ''nōmen''. All of these terms for "noun" were also words meaning "name".<ref>{{L&S|nomen|nōmen|ref}}; {{LSJ|o/noma|ὄνομα|ref}}</ref> The English word ''noun'' is derived from the Latin term, through the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''noun''.

The word classes were defined partly by the grammatical [[morphology (linguistics)|forms]] that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by [[grammatical gender|gender]] and inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Because [[adjective]]s share these three [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]], adjectives are placed in the same class as nouns.

Similarly, the Latin ''nōmen'' includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word ''noun'', the two types being distinguished as ''nouns substantive'' and ''nouns adjective'' (or ''substantive nouns'' and ''adjective nouns'', or short ''substantives'' and ''adjectives''). (The word ''[[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]]'' is now sometimes used to denote a class that includes both nouns and adjectives.)

Many European languages use a [[cognate]] of the word ''substantive'' as the basic term for ''noun'' (for example, Spanish ''sustantivo'', "noun"). Nouns in the dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation ''s.'' or ''sb.'' instead of ''n.'', which may be used for proper nouns or neuter nouns instead. In English, some modern authors use the word ''substantive'' to refer to a class that includes both nouns (single words) and [[noun phrase]]s (multiword units, also called noun equivalents).<ref name="CMOS">{{Citation |author = Chicago Manual of Style |author-link = The Chicago Manual of Style |title = The Chicago Manual of Style |section = 5.10: Noun-equivalents and substantives |publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch05/ch05_sec010.html |postscript=.}}</ref> It can also be used as a counterpart to ''attributive'' when distinguishing between a noun being used as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] (main word) of a noun phrase and a noun being used as a [[noun adjunct]]. For example, the noun ''knee'' can be said to be used substantively in ''my knee hurts'', but attributively in ''the patient needed knee replacement''.

== Examples ==
* The ''cat'' sat on the ''chair''.
* Please hand in your ''assignments'' by the ''end'' of the ''week''.
* ''Cleanliness'' is next to ''godliness''.
* ''Plato'' was an influential ''philosopher'' in ancient ''Greece''.
* Revel the ''night'', rob, murder, and commit/The oldest ''sins'' the newest ''kind'' of ''ways''? Henry IV Part 2, act 4 scene 5.

A noun can co-occur with an [[article (grammar)|article]] or an [[adjective|attributive adjective]]. Verbs and adjectives cannot. In the following, an asterisk (*) in front of an example means that this example is ungrammatical.

* ''the name'' (''name'' is a noun:  can co-occur with a definite article ''the'')
* ''*the baptise'' (''baptise'' is a verb: cannot co-occur with a definite article)
* ''constant circulation'' (''circulation''  is a noun: can co-occur with the attributive adjective ''constant'')
* ''*constant circulate'' (''circulate''  is a verb: cannot co-occur with the attributive adjective ''constant'')
* ''a fright'' (''fright'' is a noun: can co-occur with the indefinite article ''a'')
* ''*an afraid'' (''afraid'' is an adjective: cannot co-occur with the article ''a'')
* ''terrible fright'' (the noun ''fright'' can co-occur with the adjective ''terrible'')
* ''*terrible afraid'' (the adjective ''afraid'' cannot co-occur with the adjective ''terrible'')

== Definitions ==

Nouns have sometimes been defined in terms of the grammatical categories to which they are subject (classed by gender, inflected for case and number). Such definitions tend to be language-specific, since nouns do not have the same categories in all languages.

Nouns are frequently defined, particularly in informal contexts, in terms of their [[semantics|semantic]] properties (their meanings). Nouns are described as words that refer to a ''person'', ''place'', ''thing'', ''event'', ''substance'', ''quality'', ''quantity'', etc. However this type of definition has been criticized by contemporary linguists as being uninformative.<ref name=jackendoff>{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=Ray|author-link=Ray Jackendorff|date=2002|title=Foundations of language: brain, meaning, grammar, evolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Foundations%20of%20Language.pdf|isbn= 0-19-827012-7|chapter=§5.5 Semantics as a generative system}}</ref>

There have been offered several examples of English-language nouns which do not have any reference: ''drought'', ''enjoyment'', ''finesse'', ''behalf'' (as found in ''on behalf of''), ''dint'' (''in dint of''), and ''sake'' (''for the sake of'').<ref>pages 218, 225 and elsewhere in {{cite book|last=Quine|first=Willard Van Orman|title=Word and Object|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=MIT Press|date=2013|orig-year=1960 print|chapter=7 Ontic Decision|pages=215–254|author-link=Willard Van Orman Quine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference/#NonRefExp |title=Reference §3.4 Non-Referring Expressions |last1=Reimer |first1= Marga|date=May 20, 2009 |website= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition)|editor1-first=Edward N. |editor1-last=Zaita|access-date=15 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[[wikt:Appendix:English nouns with restricted non-referential interpretation in bare noun phrases|English nouns with restricted non-referential interpretation in bare noun phrases]]</ref> Moreover, there may be a relationship similar to reference in the case of other parts of speech: the verbs ''to rain'' or ''to mother''; many adjectives, like ''red''; and there is little difference between the adverb ''gleefully'' and the noun-based phrase ''with glee''.<ref group=note>Nouns occur in idioms with no meaning outside the idiom: ''rock and roll'' does not describe two different things named by ''rock'' and by ''roll''; someone who falls for something ''lock, stock and barrel'' does not fall for something ''lock'', for ''stock'', and for ''barrel''; a trick using ''smoke and mirrors'' does not separate into the effect of ''smoke'' and each ''mirror''. See [[hendiadys]] and [[hendiatris]].</ref>

There are placeholder names, such as the [[legal fiction]] ''[[reasonable person]]'' (whose existence is not in question), an experimental ''[[Artifact (error)|artifact]]'', or [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] such as ''[[gremlin]]''.

[[Linguistics|Linguists]] often prefer to define nouns (and other lexical categories) in terms of their formal properties. These include [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] information, such as what [[prefix]]es or [[suffix]]es they take, and also their [[syntax]]&nbsp;– how they combine with other words and expressions of particular types. Such definitions may nonetheless still be language-specific since syntax as well as morphology varies between languages. For example, in English, it might be noted that nouns are words that can co-occur with definite articles (as stated at the start of this article), but this would not apply in [[Russian language|Russian]], which has no definite articles.

There have been several attempts, sometimes controversial, to produce a stricter definition of nouns on a semantic basis.

== Gender ==
{{main|Grammatical gender}}

In some languages, genders are assigned to nouns, such as masculine, feminine and neuter. The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often entail [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in words that modify or are related to it. For example, in [[French language|French]], the singular form of the definite article is ''le'' for masculine nouns and ''la'' for feminine; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (with the addition of {{nowrap|''-e''}} for feminine). Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] most nouns ending {{nowrap|''-a''}} are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the [[sex]] of the noun's referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals). Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex (or ''social gender''), and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The ''girl'' lost ''her'' spectacles.)

== Classification ==

=== Proper and common nouns ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Czech language]] -->
{{anchor|Proper nouns and common nouns|reason=Old, redundant section heading; has incoming links to it.}}
{{main|Proper noun}}

A ''proper noun'' or ''proper name'' is a noun representing unique entities (such as ''India'', ''[[Pegasus]]'', ''[[Jupiter]]'', ''[[Confucius]]'', or ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]''), as distinguished from ''common nouns'', which describe a class of entities (such as ''country'', ''animal'', ''planet'', ''person'' or ''ship'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lester|Beason|2005| page = 4}}</ref>

=== Countable nouns and mass nouns ===
{{Main|Count noun|Mass noun}}

''Count nouns'' or ''countable nouns'' are common nouns that can take a [[plural]], can combine with [[numeral system|numerals]] or counting [[Quantifiers (linguistics)|quantifiers]] (e.g., ''one'', ''two'', ''several'', ''every'', ''most''), and can take an indefinite article such as ''a'' or ''an'' (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are ''chair'', ''nose'', and ''occasion''.

''Mass nouns'' or ''uncountable'' (or ''non-count'') ''nouns'' differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers.  For example, it is not possible to refer to ''a furniture'' or ''three furnitures''. This is true even though the pieces of furniture comprising ''furniture'' could be counted. Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made in terms of what sorts of things the nouns refer to, but rather in terms of how the nouns ''present'' these entities.<ref>[[Manfred Krifka|Krifka, Manfred]]. 1989. "Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Quantification in Event Semantics". In R. Bartsch, J. van Benthem, P. von Emde Boas (eds.), Semantics and Contextual Expression, Dordrecht: Foris Publication.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Borer|2005}}</ref>

Many nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, ''soda'' is countable in "give me three sodas", but uncountable in "he likes soda".

=== Collective nouns ===
{{Main|Collective noun}}

''Collective nouns'' are nouns that – even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] – refer to ''groups'' consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include ''committee'', ''government'', and ''police''. In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun,  the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members.<ref name="Gowers 2014">{{harvnb|Gowers|2014|pages=189–190}}</ref> Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in ''Plain Words'' include:<ref name="Gowers 2014"/>
{{block indent|"A committee ''was'' appointed to consider this subject." (singular)}}
{{block indent|"The committee ''were'' unable to agree." (plural)}}
{{block indent|* "The committee were of one mind when I sat in on them." (unacceptable use of plural)}}

=== Concrete nouns and abstract nouns ===
{{Further|Physical body|Abstract object}}

''Concrete nouns'' refer to [[physical bodies|physical entities]] that can, in principle at least ''(i.e. different schools of philosophy and sciences may question the assumption, but, for the most part, people agree to the existence of something. E.g. a rock, a tree,  universe)'', be observed by at least one of the [[sense]]s (for instance, ''chair'', ''apple'', ''Janet'' or ''atom''). ''Abstract nouns'', on the other hand, refer to [[abstract object]]s; that is, ideas or concepts (such as ''justice'' or ''hatred''). While this distinction is sometimes exclusive, some nouns have multiple senses, including both concrete and abstract ones: for example, the noun ''art'', which usually refers to a concept (e.g., ''Art is an important element of human culture.'') but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain contexts (e.g., ''I put my daughter's art up on the fridge.'')

Some abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots. These include ''drawback'', ''fraction'', ''holdout'' and ''uptake''. Similarly, some nouns have both abstract and concrete senses, with the latter having developed by figurative extension from the former. These include ''view'', ''filter'', ''structure'' and ''key''.

In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding a suffix (''-ness'', ''-ity'', ''-ion'') to adjectives or verbs. Examples are ''happiness'' (from the adjective ''happy''), ''circulation'' (from the verb ''circulate'') and ''serenity'' (from the adjective ''serene'').

=== Alienable vs. inalienable nouns ===
{{Main|Inalienable possession}}
Some languages, such as the [[Awa language (Papua New Guinea)|Awa language]] spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glossary.sil.org/term/inalienable-noun |title=Inalienable Noun |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=[[SIL International]] |access-date= 6 February 2020}}</ref> refer to nouns differently, depending on how ownership is being given for the given noun. This can be broken into two categories: alienable possession and [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] possession. An alienably possessed noun is something that can exist independent of a possessor: for example 'tree' can be possessed ('Lucy's tree') but need not be ('the tree'), and likewise for 'shirt' ('Mike's shirt', 'that shirt') and 'roads' ('London's roads', 'those roads') . Inalienablly possessed nouns, on the other hand, refer to something that does not exist independently of a possessor; this includes kin terms such as 'father', body-part nouns such as 'shadow' or 'hair', and part-whole nouns such as 'top' and 'bottom'.

== Noun phrases ==
{{main|Noun phrase}}

A noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun, pronoun, or other noun-like words (nominal) optionally accompanied by modifiers such as [[determiner]]s and [[adjective]]s. A noun phrase functions within a clause or sentence in a role such as that of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], or [[complement (grammar)|complement]] of a verb or preposition. For example, in the sentence "The black cat sat on a dear friend of mine", the noun phrase ''the black cat'' serves as the subject, and the noun phrase ''a dear friend of mine'' serves as the complement of the preposition ''on''.

== Pronouns ==
{{main|Pronoun}}

Nouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by [[pronoun]]s, such as ''he'', ''it'', ''which'', and ''those'', in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons. For example, in the sentence ''Gareth thought that he was weird'', the word ''he'' is a pronoun standing in place of the person's name. The word ''one'' can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun.  An example is given below:

{{block indent|John's car is newer than ''the one'' that Bill has.}}

But ''one'' can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, ''one'' can stand in for ''new car''.

{{block indent|This new car is cheaper than ''that one''.}}

== Nominalization ==
{{main|Nominalization}}
Nominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun.
In French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:

{{block indent|This legislation will have the most impact on the ''poor''.}}
{{block indent|The race is not to the ''swift'', nor the battle to the ''powerful''.}}
{{block indent|The Socialist ''International'' is a worldwide association of political parties.}}
