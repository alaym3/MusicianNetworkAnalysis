Her career has spanned almost eight decades, much of it in the United States. Her work has received much international attention and she is recognised as the earliest surviving [[Academy Award]] nominee and one of the last surviving stars from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]] cinema.

<!-- Lansbury's life from her birth to ''Mame'' -->
Lansbury was born to an upper-middle-class family in central London, the daughter of Irish actress [[Moyna Macgill]] and English politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]]. To escape [[the Blitz]], in 1940 she moved to the United States, there studying acting in [[New York City]]. Proceeding to Hollywood in 1942, she signed to [[MGM]] and obtained her first film roles, in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), earning her two [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She appeared in 11 further MGM films, mostly in minor roles, and after her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although largely seen as a [[B-list]] star during this period, her appearance in the film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) received widespread acclaim and is cited as being one of her finer performances. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury first worked with [[Stephen Sondheim]] in ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964), before Lansbury finally gained stardom for playing the leading role in [[Jerry Herman]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966), which earned her her first [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] and established her as a [[gay icon]].

<!--Lansbury's life from the 1970s to the present-->
Amid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to [[County Cork]], Ireland in 1970, and continued with a variety of theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout that decade. These included leading roles in the stage musicals ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', and ''[[The King and I]]'', as well as in the hit [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971). Moving into television in 1984, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth [[Jessica Fletcher]] in the American [[whodunit]] series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', which ran for 12 seasons until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through [[Corymore Productions]], a company that she co-owned with her husband [[Peter Shaw (producer, born 1918)|Peter Shaw]], Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, thereby contributing to animated films like Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) and [[Don Bluth]]'s ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997). Since then, she has toured in a variety of international productions and continued to make occasional film appearances.

<!--Reception and legacy-->
Lansbury has received an [[Honorary Oscar|Honorary Academy Award]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and has won five [[Tony Award]]s, six [[Golden Globes]], and an [[Olivier Award]]. She has also been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] on three occasions, and various [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s on 18 occasions, and a [[Grammy Award]]. In 2014, Lansbury was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27047088|title= Angela Lansbury 'proud' to be made a Dame by the Queen|work= BBC News|date= April 16, 2014|access-date= May 6, 2021}}</ref> She has been the subject of three biographies.

==Early life and childhood==
Lansbury was born to an [[upper middle class]] family on 16 October 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=3|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3}} Although her birthplace has often been given as [[Poplar, London|Poplar, East London]],{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=3}} she has rejected this, asserting that while she had ancestral connections to Poplar, she was born in [[Regent's Park]], Central London.<ref name=Frontrow>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03srj0y |title=Interview with Mark Lawson |website=BBC Radio 4 |date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908204624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03srj0y |archive-date=September 8, 2016}} "I want to make one thing clear: I was not born in Poplar, that's not true, I was born in Regent's Park, so I wasn't born in the East End, I wish I could say I had been. Certainly my antecedents were: my grandfather, my father." (mins 3–4)</ref> Her mother was Belfast-born actress [[Moyna Macgill]] (born Charlotte Lillian McIldowie), who regularly appeared on stage in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and who had also starred in several films.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=3–4|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=5–10|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=8}} Her father was the wealthy English timber merchant and politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and former mayor of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=4|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3}} Her paternal grandfather was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader and anti-war activist [[George Lansbury]], a man whom she felt "awed" by and considered "a giant in my youth".{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=4–5|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=15–20|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=9–10}} Angela had an older half sister, Isolde, who was the daughter of Moyna's previous marriage to writer and director [[Reginald Denham]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=5|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=7}} In January 1930, when Angela was four, her mother gave birth to twin boys, [[Bruce Lansbury|Bruce]] and [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar]], leading the Lansburys to move from their Poplar flat to a house in [[Mill Hill]], North London; on weekends they would vacate to a rural farm in [[Berrick Salome]], near Wallingford, Oxfordshire.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=4|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=11–15}}

When Lansbury was nine, her father died from stomach cancer; she retreated into playing characters as a coping mechanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=12|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=21}} Facing financial difficulty, her mother became engaged to a Scottish colonel, Leckie Forbes, and moved into his house in Hampstead, with Lansbury receiving an education at [[South Hampstead High School]] from 1934 until 1939.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=11–12, 21|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=26–28}} She nevertheless considered herself largely self-educated, learning from books, theatre and cinema.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=14|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=24}} She became a self-professed "complete movie maniac", visiting the cinema regularly and imagining herself as certain characters.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=13–14}} Keen on playing the piano, she briefly studied music at the Ritman School of Dancing, and in 1940 began studying acting at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art|Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art]] in Kensington, West London, first appearing onstage as a lady-in-waiting in the school's production of [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=6|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=22|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=28–31}}

That year, Angela's grandfather died, and with the onset of [[the Blitz]], Macgill decided to take Angela, Bruce and Edgar to the United States; Isolde remained in Britain with her new husband, the actor [[Peter Ustinov]]. Macgill secured a job supervising 60 British children who were being evacuated to North America aboard the ''Duchess of Athol'', arriving with them in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, in mid-August.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=7|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=24–25|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=31–35}} From there, she proceeded by train to New York City, where she was financially sponsored by a [[Wall Street]] businessman, Charles T. Smith, moving in with his family at their home at Mahopac, New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=25–26|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=35–36}} Lansbury gained a scholarship from the [[American Theatre Wing]] allowing her to study at the [[Feagin School of Dramatic Art|Feagin School of Drama and Radio]], where she appeared in performances of [[William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''. She graduated in March 1942, by which time the family had moved to a flat in Morton Street, Greenwich Village.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=8–9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=26|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=36–41}}

====Career beginnings and breakthrough (1940–50)====
Macgill secured work in a Canadian touring production of ''[[Tonight at 8.30]]'', and was joined in Canada by her daughter, who gained her first theatrical job as a nightclub act at the Samovar Club, Montreal. Having gained the job by claiming to be 19 when she was 16, her act consisted of her singing songs by [[Noël Coward]], and earned her $60 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=29|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=44}} She returned to New York City in August 1942, but her mother had moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, in order to resurrect her cinematic career; Lansbury and her brothers followed.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=29–30|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=44}} Moving into a bungalow in Laurel Canyon, both Lansbury and her mother obtained Christmas jobs at the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] department store in Los Angeles; Moyna was sacked for incompetence, leaving the family to subsist on Lansbury's wages of $28 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=32–33|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=46–47}} Befriending a group of gay men, Lansbury became privy to the city's underground gay scene,{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=50}} and with her mother, attended lectures by the spiritual guru [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]; at one of these, she met [[Aldous Huxley]].{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=50}}

[[File:Angela Lansbury in The Picture of Dorian Gray trailer.jpg|thumb|Lansbury in the trailer for ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'']]
At a party hosted by her mother, Lansbury met [[John van Druten]], who had recently co-authored a script for ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), a mystery-thriller based on [[Patrick Hamilton (writer)|Patrick Hamilton]]'s 1938 play ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]''. Set in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, the film was being directed by [[George Cukor]], and starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect for the role of Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], earning $500 a week and using her real name as her professional name.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=11–12|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=36–41|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=53–57, 59–62}} Already her casting received attention, with ''Variety'' magazine in August 1943 claiming Lansbury to have gone from unknown to movie star in just four days.<ref>"From Gaslight to spotlight", Variety Magazine, August 11, 1943, page 6</ref><ref name="varietybio">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/angela-lansbury-murder-she-wrote-biography-1234772907/|title=Angela Lansbury: 'Murder, She Wrote' Star Still Going Strong in Amazing Career|date=October 16, 2020|magazine= Variety|access-date=October 16, 2020|first=Gray|last=Tim}}</ref>  Upon release, ''Gaslight'' received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Lansbury.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=13|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=42|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=62}}

Her next film appearance was as Edwina Brown, the older sister of Velvet Brown in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944); the film proved to be a major commercial hit, with Lansbury developing a lifelong friendship with co-star [[Elizabeth Taylor]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=13|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=43|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=63}} Lansbury next starred in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), a cinematic adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1890 [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|novel of the same name]], which was again set in Victorian London. Directed by [[Albert Lewin]], Lansbury was cast as Sibyl Vane, a working-class [[music hall]] singer who falls in love with the protagonist, [[Dorian Gray]] ([[Hurd Hatfield]]). Although the film was not a financial success, Lansbury's performance once more drew praise, earning her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture]], and she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, losing to [[Anne Revere]], her co-star in ''National Velvet''. {{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=14–15|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=45–47|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=52–62, 66–69}}

On September 27, 1945, Lansbury married [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]], an artist and decorator whose acting career had come to a standstill. Their marriage was troubled; Cromwell was gay, and had married Lansbury in the unsuccessful hope that it would [[Sexual orientation change efforts|turn him heterosexual]]. The marriage ended in less than a year when she filed for divorce on September 11, 1946, but they remained friends until his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=15|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=48–55|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=77–79, 81–83}} In December 1946, she was introduced to fellow English expatriate [[Peter Shaw (producer, born 1918)|Peter Pullen Shaw]] at a party held by former co-star Hurd Hatfield in [[Ojai Valley]]. Shaw was an aspiring actor, also signed to MGM, and had recently left a relationship with [[Joan Crawford]]. He and Lansbury became a couple, living together before she proposed marriage.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=23–24|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=81–85|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=87–91}}

The couple were intent on getting married back in Britain, but the Church of England refused to marry two divorcees. Instead, they wed in a Church of Scotland ceremony at St. Columba's Church in Knightsbridge, London in August 1949, followed by a honeymoon in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=24–26|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=85–87|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=96–97}} Returning to the U.S., where they settled into Lansbury's home in Rustic Canyon, [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=76|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=85}} in 1951 both became naturalised U.S. citizens and retained their British citizenship via dual nationality.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=90|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=101}}

==== Established character actress (1950–60) ====
Following the success of ''Gaslight'' and ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'', MGM cast Lansbury in 11 further films until her contract with the company ended in 1952. Keeping her among their B-list stars, MGM used her less than their similar-aged actresses; biographers Edelman and Kupferberg believed that the majority of these films were "mediocre", doing little to further her career.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=57–62, 64}} This view was echoed by Cukor, who believed Lansbury had been "consistently miscast" by MGM.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=57}} She was repeatedly made to portray older women, often villainous, and as a result became increasingly dissatisfied with working for MGM, commenting that "I kept wanting to play the [[Jean Arthur]] roles, and [[Louis B. Mayer|Mr Mayer]] kept casting me as a series of venal bitches."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=65–66}} The company themselves were suffering from the post-1948 slump in cinema sales, as a result slashing film budgets and cutting their number of staff.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=65–66}}

Lansbury played her first American character as "Em", a tough honky-tonk saloon singer who slaps Judy Garland's character in the Oscar-winning [[Wild West]] musical ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=18–19|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=59|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=71–75}} She appeared in ''[[The Hoodlum Saint]]'' (also 1946), ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1947), ''[[If Winter Comes]]'' (1947), ''[[Tenth Avenue Angel]]'' (1948), ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1948), ''[[State of the Union (film)|State of the Union]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Red Danube]]'' (1949). She was loaned by MGM first to [[United Artists]] for ''[[The Private Affairs of Bel Ami]]'' (1947), and then to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=19–21, 27–33|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=69–71, 75|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=79–80, 84, 87, 91–94, 97–99}} She appeared as a villainous maidservant in ''[[Kind Lady (1951 film)|Kind Lady]]'' (1951) and a French adventuress in ''[[Mutiny (1952 film)|Mutiny]]'' (1952).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=34–35, 37, 41|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=92–93}} Turning to radio, in 1948 she appeared in an audio adaptation of [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' for ''[[NBC University Theatre]]'' and the following year she starred in their adaptation of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=98}} Moving into television, she appeared in a 1950 episode of ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]]'' adapted from [[A. J. Cronin|A.J. Cronin]]'s ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=98–99}}

Unhappy with the roles she was being given by MGM, Lansbury instructed her manager, Harry Friedman of [[MCA Inc.]], to terminate her contract in 1952,{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=100}} in the same year that her son Anthony was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=37|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=101–102}} Soon after the birth, she joined the East Coast touring productions of two former-Broadway plays: [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]]'s ''Remains to Be Seen'' and [[Louis Verneuil]]'s ''Affairs of State.''{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=41|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=101–102}} Biographer Margaret Bonanno later stated that at this point, Lansbury's career had "hit an all-time low".{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=41}}

In April 1953, her daughter Deirdre Angela Shaw was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=37|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=102}} Shaw had a son by a previous marriage, David, and after gaining legal custody of the boy in 1953, brought him to California to live with the family; with three children to raise, the Shaws moved to a larger house on San Vincente Boulevard in Santa Monica, California.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=89|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=104}} However, Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later asserting that as a result of her British roots, "in Hollywood, I always felt like a stranger in a strange land."{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=122}} In 1959, the family moved to Malibu, settling into a house on the Pacific Coast Highway that had been designed by [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]]; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and were able to send their children to a local public school.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=38|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=115–116}}

Returning to cinema as a freelance actress, Lansbury found herself typecast as women older (sometimes far older) than herself in many films in which she appeared during this period.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=106}} As she later stated, "Hollywood made me old before my time," noting that in her 20s she was receiving [[fan mail]] from people who believed her to be in her 40s.{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=50}} She obtained minor roles in the  films ''[[A Life at Stake]]'' (1954), ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Purple Mask]]'' (1955), later describing the last as "the worst movie I ever made".{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=42|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=93–95|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=103}} She played Princess Gwendolyn in the comedy film ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956), then took the role of a wife who kills her husband in ''[[Please Murder Me]]'' (1956). She appeared as Minnie Littlejohn in ''[[The Long Hot Summer]]'' (1958), and as Mabel Claremont in ''[[The Reluctant Debutante (film)|The Reluctant Debutante]]'' (1958), which she filmed in Paris.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=42–44, 49–51|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=95–97|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=103–105, 111–112}} Biographer [[Martin Gottfried]] said that it was these latter two cinematic appearances which restored Lansbury's status as an "A-picture actress".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=111}} Throughout this period, she continued making appearances on television, starring in episodes of ''Revlon Mirror Theatre'', ''[[Ford Theatre]]'' and ''[[The George Gobel Show]]'', and became a regular on game show ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=36|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=98–99|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=103}}

==== Independent films and further acclaim (1960–80)====
Her rare sympathetic role as Mavis in ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (film)|The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]'' (1960) drew critical acclaim, as did her performances as sinister characters in ''[[All Fall Down (1962 film)|All Fall Down]]'' (1962), as a manipulative, destructive mother, {{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=52–53, 58–59|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=112–116|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=112–114, 125–127}} and the [[Cold War]] thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) as the scheming ideologue Mrs. Iselin.<!-- forename never mentioned in film version --> In the latter, she was cast for the role by [[John Frankenheimer]] based on her performance in ''[[All Fall Down (1962 film)|All Fall Down]]''. Lansbury was only three years older than actor [[Laurence Harvey]] who played her son in the film.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=59–62|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=117–121|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=127–130}} She had agreed to appear in the film after reading the original novel, describing it as "one of the most exciting political books I ever read".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=127}} Biographers Edelman and Kupferberg considered this role "her enduring cinematic triumph",{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=116}} while Gottfried stated that it was "the strongest, the most memorable and the best picture she ever made&nbsp;... she gives her finest film performance in it."{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=130}} Lansbury received her third Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for the film, and was bothered by the fact that she lost, losing to [[Patty Duke]] for ''[[The Miracle Worker (1962 film)|The Miracle Worker]]'' (1962).{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=120|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=130}}

She followed this with a performance as Sybil Logan in ''[[In the Cool of the Day]]'' (1963), a film she renounced as awful, and appeared as wealthy Isabel Boyd in ''[[The World of Henry Orient]]'' (1964) and the widow Phyllis in ''[[Dear Heart]]'' (1964).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=63–64, 65–66|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=109–111}}

Lansbury declined several cinematic roles, including the lead in ''[[The Killing of Sister George (film)|The Killing of Sister George]]'' (1968) and the role of Nurse Ratched in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975).{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=153}} Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an aging German aristocrat who falls in love with a younger man, in ''[[Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), for which she filmed on location in Hohenschwangen, Bavaria.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=96–98|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=155–157|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=195–197}} The same year, she appeared as the middle-aged English witch Eglantine Price in the Disney film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971); this was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicising the film on television programmes like the ''[[David Frost|David Frost Show]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=98–100|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=157–159|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=197}} She later noted that as a big commercial hit, this film "secured an enormous audience for me".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=197}}

Working prolifically in cinema, Lansbury appeared as Miss Froy in ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1979 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1979), a remake of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s earlier [[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|film released in 1938]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=125–27|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=205|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=230}} The following year's ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' featured her in another film based on [[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side|an Agatha Christie novel]], this time as [[Miss Marple]], a sleuth in 1950s Kent. Lansbury hoped to get away from the depiction of the role by [[Margaret Rutherford]], instead returning to Christie's description of the character; in this she created a precursor to her later role of Jessica Fletcher. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these never were made.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=140–144|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=207–210|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=247, 248}} Lansbury's next film was the animated ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'' (1982), for which she provided the voice of the witch Mommy Fortuna.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=147|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=205}}

==== ''Beauty and the Beast'' and other roles (1990–2000) ====
Throughout the run of ''Murder, She Wrote'', Lansbury had continued making appearances in other television films, miniseries and cinema.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=251}} In 1986, she co-hosted the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s televised tribute to the centenary of the [[Statue of Liberty]] with [[Kirk Douglas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn|title=Liberty Receives Classical Salute|website=Sun Sentinel|first=Bill|last=Keley|date=July 5, 1986|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223012824/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn|archive-date=February 23, 2015|access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> She appeared as the protagonist's mother in ''Rage of Angels: The Story Continues'' (1986) {{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=251}} and portrayed Nan Moore – the mother of a victim of the real-life [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] plane crash – in ''[[Shootdown (film)|Shootdown]]'' (1988); being a mother herself, she had been "enormously touched by the incident".{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=251–53}} She was featured in ''[[The Shell Seekers (1989 film)|The Shell Seekers]]'' (1989) as an Englishwoman recuperating from a heart attack,{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=253}} and starred in ''The Love She Sought'' (1990) as an American school teacher who falls in love with a Catholic priest while visiting Ireland; Lansbury thought it "a marvelous woman's story".{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=253–54}} She next starred as the [[Cockney]] Mrs Harris in a film adaptation of the novel ''[[Mrs 'Arris Goes to Paris#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|Mrs 'Arris Goes to Paris]]'' (1992), which was directed by her son and executive produced by her stepson.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=255|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=292–94}} Her highest profile cinematic role since ''The Manchurian Candidate'' was as the voice of the singing teapot [[Mrs. Potts]] in the [[Disney]] animation ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), an appearance that she considered to be a gift to her three grandchildren. Lansbury performed the [[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|title song]] to the film, which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=254–255|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=294–96}} In 2021, Lansbury made a surprise appearance referencing her role as Mrs. Potts on the audio guide of "Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts", The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first ever exhibition about Walt Disney and his Studios.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2021|title=Press Release for Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2021/inspiring-walt-disney|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-15|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>

==== Career beginnings and breakthrough (1957–61) ====
In April 1957, she debuted on Broadway at the [[Henry Miller Theatre]] in ''[[Hotel Paradiso]]'', a French [[burlesque]] set in Paris, directed by [[Peter Glenville]]. The play only ran for 15 weeks, although she earned good reviews for her role as "Marcel Cat". She later stated that had she not appeared in the play, her "whole career would have fizzled out"/{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=39, 45–48|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=100|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=105–110}} She followed this with an appearance in 1960s Broadway performance of ''[[A Taste of Honey]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]], directed by [[Tony Richardson]] and [[George Devine]]. Lansbury played Helen, the boorish, verbally abusive, otherwise absentee mother of Josephine (played by [[Joan Plowright]], only four years Lansbury's junior), remarking that she gained "a great deal of satisfaction" from the role.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=54–55|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=102–104|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=117–122}} During the show's run, Lansbury developed a friendship with Plowright, as well as with Plowright's lover and future husband, [[Laurence Olivier]]. It was from Lansbury's rented flat on East 97th Street that Plowright and Olivier eloped to be married.{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|pp=120–121}}
After a well-reviewed appearance in ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (1959 film)|Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1959) – for which she had filmed in Sydney, Australia – and a minor role in ''[[A Breath of Scandal]]'' (1960), she appeared in 1961's ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' as an overbearing mother, whose son was played by [[Elvis Presley]], despite his being her junior by only nine years.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=51, 53, 56–57|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=107–108|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=114–115, 124–125}} Acknowledging that the film was of poor quality, she commented that she agreed to appear in it because "I was desperate."{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=57}}
[[File:Angela Lansbury Joan Plowright A Taste of Honey Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|Lansbury and [[Joan Plowright]] in ''A Taste of Honey'' on Broadway in 1961]]

Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'', written by [[Arthur Laurents]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]. An experimental work, it opened at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] on Broadway in April 1964, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances.

Returning to musical cinema, she starred as Ruth in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1983), a film based on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[The Pirates of Penzance|comic opera of the same name]], and while filming it in London sang on a recording of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=145–147|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=206}} as a [[mezzo-soprano]].<ref name="Rosenberg1987">{{cite book|author=Kenyon C.

In 1966, Lansbury took on the title role of Mame Dennis in the musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', [[Jerry Herman]]'s musical adaptation of the novel ''[[Auntie Mame]]''. The director's first choice for the role had been [[Rosalind Russell]], who played Mame in the non-musical film adaptation ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'', but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role in the hope that it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty-one years old, and it was her first starring role.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=77–79|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=128–132|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=149–159}} Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved ten songs and dance routines which she trained extensively for.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=133–134|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=161–163}} First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, ''Mame'' opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in May 1966.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=134|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=170–172}} ''Auntie Mame'' was already popular among the gay community,{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=151}} and ''Mame'' gained Lansbury a cult gay following, something that she later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was "every gay person's idea of glamour&nbsp;... Everything about Mame coincided with every young man's idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely."<ref name="gayicon">{{cite news |first=Lydia |last=Richardson |url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/139022/Im-Proud-To-Be-A-Gay-Icon-Angela-Lansbury-Opens-Up-In-New-Interview |title='I'm Proud To Be A Gay Icon!': Angela Lansbury Opens Up in New Interview |website=Entertainment Wise |date=January 25, 2014 |access-date=January 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704125109/http://archive.entertainmentwise.com/news/139022/Im-Proud-To-Be-A-Gay-Icon-Angela-Lansbury-Opens-Up-In-New-Interview |archive-date=July 4, 2015 }}</ref>

But my husband recognised the signals in me which said 'I've been doing enough gardening, I've cooked enough good dinners, I've sat around the house and mooned about what more interior decoration I can get my fingers into.' It's a curious thing with actors and actresses, but suddenly the alarm goes off. My husband is a very sensitive person to my moods and he recognised the fact that I had to get on with something. ''Mame'' came along out of the blue just at this time. Now isn't that a miracle?"

Reviews of Lansbury's performance were overwhelmingly positive.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=135}} In ''The New York Times'', [[Stanley Kauffmann]] wrote: "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not a singer or dancer who also acts&nbsp;... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth and a very taking [[wikt:coolth|coolth]]."<ref>[[Stanley Kauffmann|Kauffmann, Stanley]] (May 25, 1966). "Theatre: ''Mame'' Is Back with a Splash as Musical". ''[[The New York Times]]''. p. 41.</ref> The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=86|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=136}} Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that ''Mame'' made Lansbury a "superstar",{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=79}} with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys it as much as you do. And it lasts as long as you are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=137}}

The stardom achieved through ''Mame'' allowed Lansbury to make further appearances on television, such as on [[Perry Como]]'s Thanksgiving special in November 1966.{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=88}} Her fame also allowed her to engage in a variety of high-profile charitable endeavors, for instance appearing as the guest of honor at the 1967 [[March of Dimes]] annual benefit luncheon.{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=88}} She was invited to star in a musical performance for the [[40th Academy Awards|1968 Academy Awards]] ceremony, and co-hosted that year's Tony Awards with former brother-in-law Peter Ustinov.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=138–139}} That year, Harvard University's [[Hasty Pudding Club]] elected her "Woman of the Year".{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=139}} When the film adaptation of ''Mame'' was put into production, Lansbury hoped to be offered the part, but it instead went to [[Lucille Ball]], an established box-office success.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=88, 110|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=140–141}} Lansbury considered this to be "one of my bitterest disappointments".{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=140–141}} Her personal life was complicated when she learned that both of her children had become involved with the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and had been using [[recreational drug]]s; as a result, Anthony had become addicted to cocaine and heroin.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=83–84|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=165–166}}

Lansbury followed the success of ''Mame'' with a performance as Countess Aurelia, the 75-year-old Parisian eccentric in ''Dear World'', a musical adaptation of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]''. The show opened at Broadway's [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] in February 1969, but Lansbury found it a "pretty depressing" experience. Reviews of her performance were positive, and she was awarded her second Tony Award on the basis of it. Reviews of the show more generally were critical, however, and it ended after 132 performances.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=91–95|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=148–151|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=191–195}} She followed this with an appearance in the title role of the musical ''[[Prettybelle]]'', which was based upon Jean Arnold's ''The Rape of Prettybelle''. Set in the [[Deep South]], it dealt with issues of racism, with Lansbury as a wealthy alcoholic who seeks sexual encounters with black men. A controversial play, it opened in Boston but received poor reviews, being cancelled before it reached Broadway.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=104–106|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=148–151|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=202–204|4a1=Gilvey|4y=2005|4pp=208–11, 214–17}} Lansbury later described the play as "a complete and utter fiasco", admitting that in her opinion, her "performance was awful".{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=106}}

The year 1970 was traumatic for the Lansbury family, as Peter underwent a hip replacement, Anthony suffered a heroin overdose and entered a coma, and in September, the family's Malibu home was destroyed in a brush fire.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=101–102|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=169|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=197–202}} They then purchased Knockmourne Glebe, a farmhouse constructed in the 1820s which was located near the village of Conna in rural County Cork, and, after Anthony quit using cocaine and heroin, took him there to recover from his drug addiction. To help her children out, the family had moved to Ireland. Lansbury didn't work for a whole year so she could be there for Anthony and Deidre while they were recovering from their addiction.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=103|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=167|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=205–208}} He enrolled in the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art|Webber-Douglas School]], his mother's alma mater, and became a professional actor, then moved into television directing.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=106|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=170|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=308, 309}} Lansbury and her husband did not return to California, instead dividing their time between County Cork and New York City.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=170}}

In 1972, Lansbury returned to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] to perform in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s theatrical production of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''All Over'' at the [[Aldwych Theatre]]. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=109|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=170, 181–182|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=209–212}} This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of ''Mame'', which was then touring the United States,{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=109–111|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=182|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=190–191, 217}} after which she returned to the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of [[Ethel Merman]], who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and rave reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=112–116|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=183–187|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=219–223}} Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=183–187}} Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 ''Gypsy'' went on a tour of the U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=117–119, 121|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=187–190|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=219–223}} After several months' break, ''Gypsy'' then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=190–192}}

Desiring to move on from musicals, Lansbury decided that she wanted to appear in a production of one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. She obtained the role of [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] in the [[National Theatre Company]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', staged at the [[Old Vic]]. Directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]], the production ran from December 1975 to May 1976, receiving mixed reviews; Lansbury later commented that she "hated" the role, believing it too restrained.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=122–123|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=191–193|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=224–227}} Her mood was worsened by the news that in November 1975 her mother had died in California; Lansbury had her mother's body cremated and the ashes scattered near her own County Cork home.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=121|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=170, 192|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=227}} Her next theatrical appearance was in two one-act plays by [[Edward Albee]], ''Counting the Ways'' and ''Listening'', performed side by side at the Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut. Reviews of the production were mixed, but Lansbury was again singled out for praise.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=124–125|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=193–194|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=231}} This was followed by another revival tour of ''Gypsy''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=194}}

In April 1978, Lansbury appeared in 24 performances of a revival of ''[[The King and I]]'' musical staged at Broadway's [[Uris Theatre]]; Lansbury played the role of Mrs Anna, replacing [[Constance Towers]], who was on a short break.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=127–131|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=194–195|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=231}} Her first cinematic role in seven years was as novelist and murder victim Salome Otterbourne in  ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978), an adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Death on the Nile|1937 novel of the same name]] that was filmed in both London and Egypt. In the film, Lansbury starred alongside [[Peter Ustinov]] and [[Bette Davis]], who became a close friend. The role earned Lansbury the [[National Board of Review]] award for Best Supporting Actress of 1978.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=125–126|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=204–205|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=230}}

In March 1979, Lansbury first appeared as [[Mrs. Lovett|Nellie Lovett]] in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', a [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical directed by [[Harold Prince]]. Opening at the [[Gershwin Theatre|Uris Theatre]] on Broadway, she starred alongside [[Len Cariou]] as [[Sweeney Todd]], the murderous barber in 19th century London. After being offered the role, she jumped on the opportunity due to the involvement of Sondheim in the project; she commented that she loved "the extraordinary wit and intelligence of his lyrics".{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=132–136|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=196–199|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=228–245}} She remained in the role for fourteen months before being replaced by [[Dorothy Loudon]]; the musical received mixed critical reviews, although it earned Lansbury her fourth Tony Award and ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' magazine's Ruby Award for Broadway Performer of the Year.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=136, 138|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=201–202}} She returned to the role in October 1980 for a ten-month tour of six U.S. cities, with [[George Hearn]] playing the title character; the production was also filmed and broadcast on the Entertainment Channel.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=145|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=203}}
In 1982, she took on the role of an upper middle class housewife who champions workers' rights in ''A Little Family Business'', a farce set in Baltimore in which her son Anthony also starred. It debuted at Los Angeles' [[Ahmanson Theatre]] before heading on to Broadway's [[Martin Beck Theatre]]. It was critically panned and induced accusations of racism from the [[Japanese-Americans|Japanese-American]] community.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=149–154|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=210–211|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=250–251}} That year, Lansbury was inducted into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]],{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=2}} and the following year appeared in a ''Mame'' revival at Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]. Although Lansbury was praised, the show was a commercial flop, with Lansbury noting that "I realised that it's not a show of today. It's a [[period piece]]."{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=158–160|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=211–212|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=251–253}}

Following the end of ''Murder, She Wrote'', Lansbury returned to the theatre.

In 1983, Lansbury was offered two main television roles, one in a [[Norman Lear]] sitcom opposite [[Charles Durning]] and the other in a detective series by co-creators [[William Link]] and [[Richard Levinson]] of ''[[Columbo]]'' fame. Unable to do both, she chose to do the detective series despite the fact her agents had advised her to accept the sitcom.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=161|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=217|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=258}} The series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' centered on the character of [[Jessica Fletcher]], a retired school teacher from the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine, who became a successful detective novelist after her husband's death, also solving murders encountered during her travels. Lansbury described the character as "an American [[Miss Marple]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=162|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=217|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=261}} The series was created by [[Peter S. Fischer]], [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]], who had earlier had success with ''[[Columbo]]'' and the role of Jessica Fletcher had been first offered to [[Jean Stapleton]], who declined the role, as did [[Doris Day]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=161–163|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=217–218|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=254–59}} The pilot episode "The Murder of Sherlock Holmes" premiered on on September 30, 1984, with the rest of the first season airing on Sundays from 8 to 9 p.m. Although critical reviews were mixed, it proved highly popular, with the pilot having a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 18.9 and the first season being rated top in its time slot.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=219–22}} Designed as inoffensive family viewing, despite its topic the show eschewed depicting violence or gore, following the "[[whodunit]]" format rather than those of most contemporary U.S. crime shows; Lansbury herself commented that "best of all, there's no violence. I hate violence."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=226–27}}

Lansbury was defensive about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair and rejecting pressure from network executives to put her in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=165–166, 167|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=230–34}} When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=230–34}} She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=234}} Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as "a television landmark" in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like ''[[The Golden Girls]].''{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=218}} Lansbury herself noted that "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience,"{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=222}} and although it was most popular among [[senior citizens]], it gradually gained a younger audience. By 1991, one third of viewers were under age 50.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=225–27}} It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=224–25}} In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, ''[[The Law & Harry McGraw]]'', although it was short-lived.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=223}}

As the show's run continued, Lansbury assumed a larger role behind the scenes.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=241}} In 1989, her company [[Corymore Productions]] began co-producing the show with Universal.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=244|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=288–289}} Nevertheless, she began to tire of the series and in particular the long working hours, stating that the 1990–91 season would be the show's last.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=241–242, 244–245}} She changed her mind after being appointed executive producer for the 1992–93 season, something that she felt "made it far more interesting to me".{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=248}} For the 8th season, the show's setting moved to New York City, where Jessica had taken a job teaching criminology at Manhattan University. The move was an attempt to attract younger viewers and was encouraged by Lansbury.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=245|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=285–86, 290}} Having become a "Sunday-night institution" in the U.S., the show's ratings improved during the early 1990s, becoming a Top Five programme.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=247}} However, CBS executives, hoping to gain a larger audience, moved it to Thursdays at 8pm, opposite NBC's sitcom ''[[Friends]]''. Lansbury was angry at the move, believing that it ignored the show's core audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=248|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=297–298}} The final episode of the series aired in May 1996, and ended with Lansbury voicing a "Goodbye from Jessica" message at the end.{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|pp=299–300}} Tom Shales wrote in ''The Washington Post'': "The title of the show's last episode, "Death by Demographics", is in itself something of a protest.

Lansbury's higher profile gained from ''Murder, She Wrote'' resulted in her being employed to appear in advertisements and infomercials for [[Bufferin]], [[MasterCard]] and the [[Beatrix Potter]] Company.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=256}} In 1988, she released a video titled ''Angela Lansbury's Positive Moves: My Personal Plan for Fitness and Well-Being'', in which she outlined her personal exercise routine, and in 1990 published a book with the same title co-written with Mimi Avins, which she dedicated to her mother.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=178, 257–258}} As a result of her work, she was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], awarded to her in a ceremony by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] at the British consulate in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=296}} While living most of the year in California, Lansbury spent Christmases and summers at Corymore House, her farmhouse overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Ballywilliam, near Churchtown South, Cloyne, County Cork, which she had specially built as a family home in 1991.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=292}}
