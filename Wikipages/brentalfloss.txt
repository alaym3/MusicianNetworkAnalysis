In early 2011, he released ''The Super-Secret EP'' under the pseudonym "DJ Super Secret", which was revealed to members of his mailing list first, and was released to public afterwards. Black later set up a fundraising page on his site to try to garner funds for a second CD, which reached its goal of $4000. The CD was completed in March 2012, but was unable to be released until June 2012 due to printing errors. He released digital downloads for ''Bits of Me'' on June 8, 2012. In February 2014, Black released his third studio album, ''Flossophy''.

Black also appeared in three ''[[Nostalgia Critic]]'' reviews of ''[[Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'', as well as Paw Dugan's review of ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]''.
