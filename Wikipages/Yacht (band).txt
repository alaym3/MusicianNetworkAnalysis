'''Yacht''' (stylized as '''YACHT''', '''Y△CHT''' or '''Y▲CHT''') is an American [[dance-pop]] band from [[Portland, Oregon]], currently based in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The core group consists of [[Jona Bechtolt]] and [[Claire L. Evans]], and when touring expands to include [[Bobby Birdman]].

Yacht has released albums on [[States Rights Records]], [[Marriage Records]], [[DFA Records]], and [[Downtown Records]].

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Bechtolt chose the name YACHT in reference to Y.A.C.H.T., an alternative school in Portland, Oregon. Bechtolt told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', "It stands for Young Americans Challenging High Technology. It refers to an education program that was held in Portland, Oregon. I was enrolled when I was 16, back in 1996."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2010/08/how-they-became-yacht/ |title= How They Became YACHT |work= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |author= David Marchese |date=August 16, 2010 |access-date= April 18, 2014}}</ref>

=== 2002–2007 ===
YACHT was Bechtolt's solo project from 2002 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/11/yacht-interview-sxsw-2010/ |title= YACHT Interview: SXSW 2010 |publisher= [[Spinner.com]]|access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref> During this period, he released three albums, ''[[Super Warren MMIV]]'', ''[[Mega (Yacht album)|Mega]]'' and ''[[I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real]]'', on record labels in the Pacific Northwest area.

In January 2006, YACHT was commissioned for two performances for the [[New York City|New York]] based art and technology platform [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]], as part of its ''Crap-tops vs Laptops'' show. In February 2006, YACHT performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s [[P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center]] and produced an hour-long Internet radio program with [[Clear Cut Press]], a Northwest-based publisher of new literary work. In April 2006, the Aurora Picture Show commissioned a YACHT performance as part of its Media Archeology Festival in Houston, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://aurorapictureshow.org/pages/media_archeology_festival_archive_581.asp |publisher= Aurora Picture Show |date= April 2006 |title= Media Archeology: Software Cinema}}</ref>

For the 2007 release of ''I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real'' by [[Marriage Records]], Bechtolt performed a concert on an actual yacht<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42793-photos-yacht-on-yacht-portland-or-050507 |title= Photos: YACHT on Yacht (Portland, OR; 05/05/07) |publisher= [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |access-date= March 31, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406095038/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42793-photos-yacht-on-yacht-portland-or-050507 |archive-date= April 6, 2008 |url-status= dead }}</ref> on the [[Willamette River]] in Portland, Oregon. In October the same year, YACHT played at one of China's earliest music festivals, Yue, organised by [[Split Works]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Live performances during this period included dancing along to music<ref>{{cite web |work=NME News |title=YACHT destroys the stage at NME SXSW show |date=March 14, 2008 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/sxsw/35154}}</ref> as well as elaborate [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentations.

=== 2008–2010 ===
[[File:Yacht @ Wellington Square (1 3 2009) (3336273343).jpg|thumb|right|[[Claire L. Evans]] performing with Yacht in 2009]]
In 2008, YACHT became a duo with the introduction of longtime collaborator [[Claire L. Evans]] as a full member. She contributed vocals to many of the songs on the 2009 album ''[[See Mystery Lights]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=135&csid2=4&fid1=40136 |access-date= April 3, 2010 | work= [[Exclaim!]] |date= August 2009 |title= YACHT Do More Than Rock | first=Cam | last=Lindsay}}</ref> YACHT first full-length release on DFA Records. The album cover was designed by the Texas-based artist [[Boyd Elder]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.printmag.com/Article/Boyd-Elders-album-cover-for-Yacht#axzz17Ahu4bQC|access-date= April 3, 2010 | work= [[Print (magazine)|Print]] |date= August 2009 |title= Boyd Elder's album cover for YACHT | first=Douglas | last=Wolk}}</ref> who had previously designed album art for [[The Eagles]]. Pitchfork rated ''See Mystery Lights'' an 8.5, calling it "a triumph", and ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that YACHT "split the different between Talking Heads and electro pop, and make a breakthrough album of digital ear candy." It was chosen as a "Critic's Choice" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Nate Chinen.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/arts/music/03choi.html?_r=1 | work= [[The New York Times]] |date= August 2, 2009 |title= New CDs | first=Nate | last=Chinen}}</ref>

During this period, YACHT began publicly discussing their personal philosophy, and published a book called ''The Secret Teachings of the Mystery Lights: A Handbook on Overcoming Humanity and Becoming Your Own God'' which explained their beliefs,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2009/07/qa-with-jona-bechtolt-and-claire-evans-of-yacht.html | work= [[Teen Vogue]] |date= July 30, 2009 |title= Q&A with Jona Bechtolt and Claire Evans of YACHT | first=Lindsey | last=Talbot}}</ref> a list of which is maintained on their website.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://teamyacht.com/what/ | publisher= Teamyacht.com |year= 2012 |title= YACHT Today}}</ref>

In January 2010, YACHT added a live band, The Straight Gaze, consisting of the musicians Rob "[[Bobby Birdman]]" Kieswetter and Jeffrey Brodsky to their live show. This incarnation is known as YACHT and the Straight Gaze.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2010/01/yacht_becomes_yacht_the_straig.html| work= [[The Oregonian]] |date= January 26, 2010 |title= YACHT becomes YACHT & the Straight Gaze |author=Ryan White}}</ref>

=== 2010–2013 ===
In November 2011, YACHT worked with the Youtuber and longtime YACHT supporter Mitchell Davis on their music video for the song "I Walked Alone".

In June 2011, YACHT released ''[[Shangri-La (Yacht album)|Shangri-La]]'', their second album on DFA Records. They made a double video for its first two singles, "Utopia" and '"Dystopia (The Earth Is on Fire)", directed by the experimental filmmaker and documentary maker [[Rene Daalder]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nme.com/nme-video/yacht---utopiadystopia-music-video/1016213058001 | work= [[NME]] |date= June 2010 |title= YACHT 'Utopia/Dystopia' Music Video}}</ref> In 2012, they recorded "Le Goudron", a cover version of the [[Brigitte Fontaine]] song (1969). In early 2013, the retailer [[Kohls]] used YACHT typeface imagery and lyrics from "Shangri-La" on a series of T-shirts made available online, until the band notified the company about possible legal liabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-kohls-designer-might-have-ripped-off-yacht-20130308,0,2996311.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 8, 2013 |title=Kohl's designer might have ripped off YACHT| author=August Brown}}</ref>

In an August 2012 interview with ''New York Music News'', Evans explained the YACHT band, business and belief system: "YACHT is the name we give to all the projects we do together. Usually that’s recording and performing music, but as we emphasize in our axiom of "band, business, and belief system," there are both materialistic and metaphysical dimensions to our work. It's full-spectrum."<ref name="NYMN August 2012">{{cite web|title=NYMN Interview – Claire Evans of YACHT |url=http://nymn.com/nymn-interview-claire-evans-of-yacht/ |publisher=Nymn.com |date=August 30, 2012 |access-date=September 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902073540/http://nymn.com/nymn-interview-claire-evans-of-yacht/ |archive-date=September 2, 2012 }}</ref>

In December 2012, the band celebrated its 10th anniversary by releasing the single "Second Summer".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1214111/yacht-second-summer-video/video/ |title=YACHT – "Second Summer" Video |publisher=Stereogum |date=2012-12-06 |access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref> The video was produced by the Fox animation studio, [[Animation Domination]].

In August 2013, the band released "[[Party at the NSA]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partyatthensa.com |title=YACHT — Party at the NSA |publisher=Partyatthensa.com |date=2013-06-20 |access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref> a song satirizing the [[National Security Agency]]'s unwarranted surveillance of private citizens, and donated all proceeds from sales of the song online to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].

=== 2014–2015 ===
In 2014, YACHT signed to [[Downtown Records]], and released an EP, "Where Does This Disco". To accompany the release, YACHT designed a limited-edition compact disc that served as commentary on the obsolescence of the medium. They discussed the project at [[WIRED]]'s WIREDxDesign conference in October 2014.<ref>Kyle Vanhemert, [https://www.wired.com/2014/12/bands-obsessive-ode-compact-disc/ "A Band's Obsessive Ode to the Compact Disc"], ''WIRED'', December 16, 2014</ref> WIRED called the project "music not as a thing in itself, but the beginning of a chain of experiences which had no edge."<ref>Cliff Kuang, [https://www.wired.com/2014/10/6-ideas-define-design-2014/ "6 Ideas That Define Design in 2014"], ''WIRED'', October 7, 2014</ref>

On October 16, 2015, YACHT released ''I Thought The Future Would Be Cooler'', their first full-length album on [[Downtown Records]]. The release was preceded by a series of technological subversions, including a drone-captured video of a billboard,<ref>Zoe Camp, [https://pitchfork.com/news/60574-yacht-announce-new-album-i-thought-the-future-would-be-cooler-via-billboard/ "YACHT Announce New Album I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler Via Billboard"], ''Pitchfork'', July 29, 2015</ref> a website which sent fans faxes of the album artwork,<ref>Lizzie Plaugic, [https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/11/9130155/yacht-band-album-i-thought-the-future-would-be-cooler-fax-machine "YACHT want to send you their new album art by fax"], ''The Verge'', August 11, 2015</ref> and video that only played when [[Uber]] prices were surging in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>Evan Minsker, [https://pitchfork.com/news/61308-yacht-premiere-la-plays-itself-video-in-conjunction-with-uber-surge-pricing/ "YACHT Premiere 'L.A.
