'''Fanny''' was an American rock band, active in the early to mid 1970s. They were one of the first [[all-female band|all-female]] rock groups to achieve critical and commercial success, including two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top 40 singles.

The group was founded by guitarist [[June Millington]] and her sister, bassist Jean, who had been playing music together since they moved from the [[Philippines]] to California in the early 1960s. After playing through several variations of the band, they attracted the interest of producer [[Richard Perry]] who signed them to [[Reprise Records]] in 1969 as Fanny. The band recorded four albums together before June Millington quit the group, leading to the original line-up splitting. Following a final album, Fanny disbanded in 1975. The Millington sisters have continued to play music together since the split, and with a former drummer, Brie Howard Darling, formed the spin-off group Fanny Walked the Earth in 2018.

The group has continued to attract critical acclaim for rejecting typical [[girl group]] styles and expectations of women in the rock industry generally, and emphasizing their musical skills. Later groups such as [[the Go-Go's]], [[the Bangles]], and [[the Runaways]] cited Fanny as a key influence.

==Career==
Sisters [[June Millington|June]] and Jean Millington moved with their family from the [[Philippines]] to [[Sacramento]], California in 1961. They began to play music together on [[ukulele]]s, which helped them gain friends. In high school they formed an [[all-female band]] called the Svelts with June on guitar, Jean on bass, Addie Lee on guitar, and [[Brie Howard|Brie Brandt]] on drums. Brandt left to get married and was later replaced by Alice de Buhr. When the Svelts disbanded, de Buhr and Lee formed another all-female group called Wild Honey. The Millington sisters later joined this band, which played [[Motown Records|Motown]] covers, and eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=fwte/><ref name="GoCR">{{cite web|url=http://fannyrocks.com/about-2/how-it-began/ |title=How It Began &#124; |publisher=Fannyrocks.com |access-date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>

Frustrated by a lack of success or respect in the male-dominated rock scene, Wild Honey decided to disband after one final [[Open mic|open-mic]] appearance at the [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|Troubadour Club]] in Los Angeles in 1969.<ref name="GoCR"/> They were spotted at this gig by the secretary of producer [[Richard Perry]], who had been searching for an all-female rock band to mentor.{{sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2015|p=85}} Perry convinced [[Warner Bros. Records]] to sign the band, still known as Wild Honey, to [[Reprise Records]].<ref name="GoCR"/> The group won the contract without the label hearing them play, on the grounds of being a novelty act, despite their genuine musical talent.<ref name=fwte/> Prior to recording their first album, the band recruited keyboardist [[Nickey Barclay]].<ref name="Berklee">{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/news/2007/01/0125.html|title=ROCKRGRL Honors Fanny, Legendary Female Band, at Berklee|publisher=[[Berklee College of Music]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515101605/http://www.berklee.edu/news/2007/01/0125.html |archive-date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref>

The band was then renamed Fanny, not with a [[Fanny (disambiguation)#In slang|sexual connotation]] but to denote a female spirit.{{sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2015|p=85}} The initial lineup consisted of June Millington on guitar, Jean Millington on bass, de Buhr on drums, Barclay on keyboards, and Brandt on lead vocals and percussion. Perry dismissed Brandt because he wanted the group to be a self-contained four piece band like [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brie Howard Darling – From Rock Star To Cake Diva|url=http://www.rivetingriffs.com/Brie%20Howard%20Darling.html|website=Riveting Riffs|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> The Millingtons and Barclay all assumed lead vocal duties on alternating songs, while de Buhr sang lead occasionally on later albums.<ref name=mp>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mothers-pride-mw0000839611|title=Mother's Pride – Fanny|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref>

Perry produced the band's first three albums, beginning with ''[[Fanny (album)|Fanny]]'' in 1970.<ref name=album>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fanny-mw0000841027|title=Fanny – Fanny|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref> Because of the connection to Perry and Reprise Records, Barclay was invited to tour with [[Joe Cocker]] as a backing singer, and consequently appeared on the album ''[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]''.<ref name=unico>{{cite web|last1=Unico|first1=Grethcen|title=Rock Photographer Linda Wolf at Home With Fanny and on the Road With Joe Cocker|url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/rock-photographer-linda-wolf-at-home-with-fanny-and-on-the-road-with-joe-cocker/|website=Rebeat|access-date=February 25, 2018|date=October 3, 2016}}</ref> The group's cover of [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s "[[Badge (song)|Badge]]" from the first album had significant radio airplay.<ref name=am>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fanny-mn0001467262/biography|title=Fanny – Biography|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> The follow-up album, ''[[Charity Ball]]'' was released the following year, and its title track reached #40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Chart Awards: Fanny"/> The members of Fanny also worked as session musicians, and played on [[Barbra Streisand]]'s 1971 album ''[[Barbra Joan Streisand (album)|Barbra Joan Streisand]]'',<ref name="Berklee"/><ref>{{cite news |last= Anderman|first=Joan |title =Rocking the Boat| newspaper=The Boston Globe|date =April 20, 2007 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/04/20/rocking_the_boat/?page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/barbra-joan-streisand-r24151/credits |title=Barbara Joan Streisand: Credits |work=Allmusic |access-date=January 31, 2012}}</ref> after Streisand had wanted to record with a small band.<ref name=fwte/> The group continued to pick up well-known fans; [[David Bowie]] sent the group a letter admiring their work and invited the band to a post-show party where he showed them [[mime]] techniques.<ref name=fwte/> With young engineer [[Leslie Ann Jones]] as their road manager and live sound mixer,{{sfn|Gaar|2002|p=142}} Fanny toured worldwide, opening for [[Slade]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]],<ref name="Berklee"/> gaining widespread popularity in the United Kingdom. A 1971 article in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' remarked that the group "seems that they are the [[Opening act|support group]] to everyone these days".<ref>{{cite news |title= Military Madness |newspaper=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |publisher= Spotlight Publications |date= August 28, 1971|page= 3}}</ref> The group made several live television appearances during tours, including ''[[The Sonny and Cher Show]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' and ''[[Beat-Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fannyrocks.com/about-2/|title=About Fanny|website=fannyrocks.com|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref>

The group's third album, ''[[Fanny Hill (album)|Fanny Hill]]'' (1972) featured the Beatles' engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] in addition to Perry's production. It included a cover of the Beatles' "[[Hey Bulldog]]" and [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[Ain't That Peculiar]]". The latter featured regular [[Rolling Stones]] saxophonist [[Bobby Keys]], and was released as a single, reaching #85 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=rebeat/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fanny-hill-mw0000837823|title=Fanny Hill – Fanny|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref> Fellow Stones sideman [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]] also played brass on the album.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Fanny Hill|publisher=Reprise Records|id=K44174|year=1972}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote a rave review of the album, praising the group's musical skills and particularly June Millington's ability to play both lead and rhythm guitar.<ref name=rs/>

Their fourth album, ''Mothers Pride'' (1973), was produced by [[Todd Rundgren]].<ref name="GoCR"/> By the time ''Mothers Pride'' was released, June Millington was feeling constrained by the group format. The record label wanted her to wear certain designer clothes and adopt a [[hard rock]] image, which she resisted. She decided to quit the group, later saying "I needed to figure out who I was"<ref name=fwte/> and regularly clashed with Barclay, who had a different personality to her.<ref name=unico/> June moved to [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] to study [[Buddhism]], but insisted the group continue without her.<ref name=fwte/>

De Buhr also left the band, with a returning Brandt replacing her on drums. Patti Quatro (sister of [[Suzi Quatro]]) replaced June on guitar. This lineup signed with [[Casablanca Records]] and released the final Fanny album, ''Rock and Roll Survivors'', in 1974.<ref name="GoCR"/> The first single, "I've Had It" reached #79 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fanny|title=Fanny|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref>  Brandt left the band shortly after the album's completion when she married composer [[James Newton Howard]], and was briefly replaced by Cam Davis. Barclay quit the group at the end of 1974, thinking it was not working without June Millington.<ref name=eotr/> The second single, "Butter Boy" was written by Jean Millington about Bowie, and became their biggest hit, reaching #29 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in April 1975.<ref name=fwte/><ref name="Chart Awards: Fanny"/> By the time that was released, the group had split.<ref name=eotr>{{cite web|url=http://www.fannyrocks.com/about-2/the-end-of-the-road/|title=The End of the Road|publisher=Fanny (official website)|access-date=February 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name=fwte/>

==Post-split activities==
After the breakup, in 1975 the Millington sisters put together a new line-up of Fanny for a short tour, though no older Fanny material was played. This group ultimately morphed into a new all-women band called the L.A. All-Stars, which generated some interest from record labels, but with the stipulation that the band tour as Fanny and play only old Fanny songs, which June Millington opposed.<ref name="GoCR"/>

June Millington subsequently released three solo albums in the 1980s and has had a career as a [[record producer|producer]] for artists including [[Holly Near]], [[Cris Williamson]] and [[Bitch and Animal]]. She operates the Institute for Musical Arts, a non-profit organization supporting girls and women in music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Roberta|last=Russell|title=June Millington's Attitude of Fearlessness|magazine=Expository Magazine|date=August 3, 2004|url=http://www.expositorymagazine.net/2004/june-millington.php|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403140849/http://www.expositorymagazine.net/2004/june-millington.php|archive-date=April 3, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Elizabeth Hinkle-Turner 2006">{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Hinkle-Turner|title=Women Composers and Music Technology in the United States: Crossing the Line|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|page=213}}</ref> Jean Millington was married to Bowie's guitarist [[Earl Slick]] for a time and later became an [[herbalist]].<ref name="Berklee"/> The Millingtons continued to record together after Fanny as well, most recently on the 2011 album ''Play Like a Girl'' on June's label Fabulous Records.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bryan |first=Beverly |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/reviews/play-like-a-girl-by-june-and-jean-millington/ |title=Play Like A Girl By June And Jean Millington |publisher=Mtv Iggy |date=August 18, 2011 |access-date=July 25, 2014}}</ref> Nickey Barclay released a solo album titled ''Diamond in a Junkyard'' in 1976<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/diamond-in-a-junkyard-mw0000836813|title=Diamond in a Junkyard – Nickey Barclay – Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> then withdrew from the music industry.

In 2002, [[Rhino Records]] released the limited edition 4-CD box set ''First Time in a Long Time'', which collected Fanny's first four studio albums along with live recordings, outtakes, and promotional items. A reunion concert featuring the Millington sisters and de Buhr (Barclay declined to appear for health reasons) was held at [[Berklee College of Music]] on April 20, 2007,<ref name="Berklee"/> where the band members received the ''[[ROCKRGRL|Rockrgrl]]'' Women of Valor award for their achievements.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROCKRGRL To Present Women Of Valor Award To Fanny, The First All Female Band To Release Major Label Album|url=http://www.mi2n.com/print.php3?id=96988|website=Music Industry News Network|access-date=February 25, 2018|date=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The first four original Fanny albums are available on Real Gone records, with updated liner notes, pictures, and new mixes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Real Gone Reissues Fanny's Mother's Pride|url=http://www.thatdevilmusic.com/2016/06/real-gone-reissues-fannys-mothers-pride.html|website=That Devil Music|access-date=February 25, 2018|date=June 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Musical style and legacy==
Though Fanny was not the first all-female band to sign with a major label (after [[Goldie & the Gingerbreads]] and [[the Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|the Pleasure Seekers]]), they were the first to release an album on a major label<ref name="Berklee"/> and one of the first to achieve top 40 success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Chart Awards: Fanny">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fanny-p17433/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Chart Awards: Fanny |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Fanny's music was influenced by [[the Beatles]] and the [[Funk Brothers]], the loose studio musician collective on [[Motown]] records.<ref name=vg/>

The band resisted suggestions by the record company to dress in a typical [[girl group]] style, or emphasise any sex appeal, and rehearsed regularly, wanting to acquire a reputation based on their musical talent.<ref name=unico/><ref name=barton>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/fanny-the-untold-story-of-the-original-queens-of-noise|title=Fanny: The Untold Story Of The Original Queens Of Noise|first=Geoff|last=Barton|author-link=Geoff Barton|magazine=Classic Rock|date=September 4, 2015|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Jean Millington later said that Fanny had to have a strong live presence in order to overcome audience's perceptions that women could not play rock music well.{{sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2015|p=84}} June added, "We knew we had to prove we could play and deliver live. Otherwise, no one would believe it."<ref name=vg/> The group were more successful in the UK and Europe, where audiences appreciated their music and respected their work, as opposed to the US. De Buhr was disappointed to discover that some record company executives merely treated Fanny as a gimmick and should not be taken seriously.<ref name=barton/> Promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] was reluctant to give the group a headlining slot at venues, for fear the group would split up as the members got married and had children, though the group have stressed this was due to business pragmatics and not chauvinism. During tours, female fans would ask the group how to form a band.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard+fanny&pg=RA1-PA12|title=There aren't many girls in hard rock, but a new day (and attitude) is dawning|magazine=Billboard|page=12|date=November 6, 1971|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Later all-female bands such as [[the Runaways]] and [[the Bangles]] have cited Fanny as a key influence.<ref name=npr/>
