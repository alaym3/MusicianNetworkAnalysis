{{quote|Hell, our chief executive, the guy that ran our team, uh, that communicated [with] Charlie Finley, the top man there, was a 13-year old kid. I nicknamed him "Hammer," because he looked like [[Hank Aaron]] [whose nickname was "The Hammer"].<ref name="rebels"/>}}

{{quote|He was an informant in the clubhouse, an informant for Charlie, and he got the nickname "Pipeline."<ref name="rebels"/>}}

According to Hammer:

In the mid-1980s while rapping in small venues and after a record deal went sour, Hammer borrowed US$20,000 each from former [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]] players [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]] and [[Dwayne Murphy]] to start a record label business called Bust It Productions.<ref name="Ebony" /> He kept the company going by selling records from his basement and car. Bust It spawned Bustin' Records, the independent label of which Hammer was CEO. Together, the companies had more than 100 employees.<ref name="Ebony" /> Recording singles and selling them out of the trunk of his car, he marketed himself relentlessly. Coupled with his dance abilities, Hammer's style was unique at the time.

Now billing himself as "M.C. Hammer", he recorded his debut album, ''[[Feel My Power]]'', which was produced between 1986 and 1987 and released independently in 1987 on his Oaktown Records label (Bustin').<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mc hammer|chart=all}} ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> It was produced by [[Felton Pilate]] (of [[Con Funk Shun]]). It sold over 60,000 copies and was distributed by City Hall Records. In the spring of 1988, Tony Valera, a 107.7 KSOL Radio DJ, played the track "Let's Get It Started" in his mix-shows—a song in which Hammer declared he was "second to none, from [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[LL Cool J]], or [[Joseph Simmons|DJ Run]]"—after which the track began to gain popularity in [[nightclub|clubs]]. (He would continue to call out other [[East Coast rap]]pers in future projects as well.)

Hammer also released a single called "Ring 'Em", and largely on the strength of tireless [[street marketing]] by Hammer and his wife, plus continued radio mix-show play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area. Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians, and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer's stage show, and his infectious stage presence, that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an [[Oakland]] club. There he impressed a record executive who "didn't know who he was, but knew he was somebody", according to the ''New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll''. Though Hammer had previously received and declined offers from major record labels before, he agreed to a multi-album contract with Capitol with a $1,750,000 advance. It didn't take long for Capitol to recoup its investment.<ref name="answers1"/>

Once signed to [[Capitol Records]], Hammer re-issued his first record (a revised version of ''[[Feel My Power]]'') with additional tracks added and sold over 2 million copies. "Pump It Up" (also performed during ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'' on September 16, 1989),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0612962/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312202245/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0612962/|url-status=dead|title=Episode dated 16 September 1989|archive-date=March 12, 2016|website=IMDb.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> "Turn This Mutha Out", "Let's Get It Started" and "They Put Me in the Mix" were the most popular singles from this album, all of which charted. Not entirely satisfied with this first [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] success, Hammer's music underwent a metamorphosis, shifting from the standard rap format. "I decided the next album would be more musical," he said at the time. Purists chastised him for being more dancer than rapper. Sitting in a leopard-print bodysuit before a concert, he defended his style: "People were ready for something different from the traditional rap style. The fact that the record has reached this level indicates the genre is growing."<ref name="Ebony" />

M.C. Hammer was very good friends with [[Arsenio Hall]] (as well as a then-unknown teen named Robert Van Winkle, aka [[Vanilla Ice]], [[#DanceJamtheMusic (2008–2009)|despite later rumors]] that there was a "beef" between the two rappers which was addressed during the height of both their careers on Hall's show, and whom he would later reunite with in a 2009 concert in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Video of MC Hammer |url=http://vodpod.com/watch/567233-arsenio-hall-turns-54-today-dog-pound-still-woofing |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718041646/http://vodpod.com/watch/567233-arsenio-hall-turns-54-today-dog-pound-still-woofing |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="newsweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/188027 |title=MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice Rock Utah |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=March 16, 2009 |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> and as such, Hammer was first invited to perform the song "[[U Can't Touch This]]", prior to its release, on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/yt-ZIB4GB8Olss/mc_hammer_u_cant_touch_this_live_arsenio_hall/ |title=MC Hammer - U Can't Touch This(Live @ Arsenio Hall) - Video |publisher=Metacafe.com |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> He also performed "Dancing Machine" in a version that appeared in the [[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em#Film|same-titled movie]].

Hammer used some of the proceeds from this album to install a rolling [[recording studio]] in the back of his [[Tour bus service|tour bus]], where he recorded much of his second album.<ref name="answers1"/>

In 1989, Hammer was featured on "You've Got Me Dancing" (with [[Glen Goldsmith]]), which appeared on the Glen Goldsmith album ''Don't Turn This Groove Around'' ([[RCA Records]]). The track was Hammer's first release in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]]. Hammer also appeared in Glen Goldsmith's [[music video]] for this song. The single failed to chart.

Follow-up successes included a cover of [[the Chi-Lites]]' "[[Have You Seen Her#MC Hammer version|Have You Seen Her]]"  and "[[Pray (MC Hammer song)|Pray]]" (a beat sampled from [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] "[[When Doves Cry]]" and [[Faith No More]]'s "[[We Care a Lot]]"),<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/mchammer/albums/album/214027/review/5943181/please_hammer_dont_hurt_em |title=MC Hammer: Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em : Music Reviews|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Michael|last=Corcoran|date=May 17, 1990 |access-date=March 31, 2010|archive-date=April 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428010112/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/mchammer/albums/album/214027/review/5943181/please_hammer_dont_hurt_em}}ead</ref> which was his biggest hit in the US, peaking at No. 2. "Pray" was also a major UK success, peaking at No. 8. The album went on to become the first hip-hop album to earn [[Music recording sales certification|diamond status]], selling more than 18 million units to date.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="prnewswire" /><ref name="time" /><ref name="newyorker" /> During 1990, Hammer toured extensively in Europe which included a sold-out concert at the [[National Exhibition Centre]] in [[Birmingham]]. With the sponsorship of [[PepsiCo]] International, [[Pepsi]] CEO [[Christopher A. Sinclair]] went on tour with him during 1991.

The album was notable for sampling other high-profile artists and gave some of these artists a new fanbase. "Dancin' Machine" sampled [[The Jackson 5]], "Help the Children" (also the name of an [[outreach]] [[foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] Hammer started)<ref name="macysinc">{{cite web|url=http://www.macysinc.com/pressroom/macys/macyseast/media_kits.asp?strAction=ShowItem&itemid=8131 |title=Recent Press Releases |publisher=Macysinc.com |access-date=March 31, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> interpolates [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]]", and "She's Soft and Wet" also sampled Prince's "[[Soft and Wet]]". All of these songs proved to be successful on radio and video television, with "U Can't Touch This," "Pray" (most successful), "Have You Seen Her," "Here Comes the Hammer," and "Yo!! Sweetness" ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] only) all charting. The album increased the popularity of hip-hop music. It remains the genre's all-time best-selling album.<ref name="sing365">{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/MC-Hammer-Biography/4E0F2063AA089C6748256E0700170A6C |publisher=sing365.com |title=MC Hammer Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715115902/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/MC-Hammer-Biography/4E0F2063AA089C6748256E0700170A6C |archive-date=July 15, 2012 }}</ref>

A movie also accompanied the album and was produced in 1990, called ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em#Film|Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie]]'' (with portions of his [[music videos]] included within the movie).<ref name="imdb0390374">{{IMDb title|0390374|Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie}}</ref> At the same time, he also appeared in The [[West Coast Rap All-Stars]] [[posse cut]] "[[We're All in the Same Gang]]." Music videos from this album and the previous albums began to receive much airplay on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]].

M.C. Hammer also contributed the tracks "This is What We Do" on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|movie soundtrack]] and "That's What I Said" on the ''[[Rocky V]]'' [[Rocky V: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture|soundtrack]].

A critical backlash began over the repetitive nature of his lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for the basis of his singles—criticisms also directed to his contemporary, [[Vanilla Ice]]. He was mocked in music videos by [[3rd Bass]] (including a [[battle rap|rap battle]] with [[MC Serch]]), [[The D.O.C.]], DJ Debranz, and [[Ice Cube]]. [[Oakland]] hip-hop group [[Digital Underground]] criticized him in the CD insert of their ''[[Sex Packets]]'' album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q Tip]] criticized him in "Check the Rhyme," asking, "What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop." [[LL Cool J]] dissed him in "To tha Break of Dawn" (from the ''[[Mama Said Knock You Out]]'' album), calling Hammer an "amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag [his pants]," and saying, "My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in "Let's Get it Started", when he was mentioned along with [[Run-DMC]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]] as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on [[VH-1]]'s'' 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', which aired in 2008). However, [[Ice-T]] came to his defense on his 1991 album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]'': "A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous." Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were [[pop-rap]] from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against [[Master of Ceremonies|emcees]] who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.

Despite the criticisms, Hammer's career continued to be highly successful including tours in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Russia. Soon after, M.C. Hammer [[Mattel]] dolls, lunchboxes, and other merchandise were marketed. He was also given his own Saturday morning cartoon, called ''[[Hammerman]]'', which he hosted and voiced.<ref name="AWL">[https://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/25/1537472/mc-hammer-cincinnati-reds-game-1990-world-series-celebration MC Hammer To Perform At Reds Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818065927/http://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/25/1537472/mc-hammer-cincinnati-reds-game-1990-world-series-celebration |date=August 18, 2016 }} SB-Nation</ref>

===''Too Legit to Quit'' (1991)===
{{Main|Too Legit to Quit}}
After publicly dropping the "M.C." from his stage name, Hammer released ''[[Too Legit to Quit]]'' (also produced by [[Felton Pilate]]) in 1991. Hammer answered his critics within certain songs from the album. Sales were strong (over five million copies),<ref name="findarticles1">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n6_v49/ai_14969852/ |title=Hammer's hilltop mansion &#124; Ebony &#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |access-date=May 10, 2011 |year=1994}}</ref> with the [[2 Legit 2 Quit|title track]] being the biggest [[hit single]] from this record. The album peaked in the Top 5 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another hit came soon after, with "[[Addams Groove]]" (which appeared on both ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' [[The Addams Family (1991 film)#Music|motion picture soundtrack]] and the vinyl and cassette versions of ''2 Legit 2 Quit''), reaching No. 7 in the U.S. and No. 4 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. His video for the song appeared after the movie.

Hammer set out on a high-profile tour promoting the album which included a stage show ⁠loaded with singers, dancers, and backup musicians. In 1992, [[Boyz II Men]] joined the tour as an opening act. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in [[Chicago]], and the group's future performances of "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]" were dedicated to him. As a result of this unfortunate experience, the song would help advance their success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=60634 |title=Ep. 180 &#124; Boyz II Men &#124; Behind The Music &#124; Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |publisher=VH1.com |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> Ultimately, however, the lavish show proved too expensive to support through album sales and it was cancelled partway through its scheduled run.<ref name="zvents">{{cite web |url=http://www.zvents.com/performers/show/7070-mc-hammer# |title=MC Hammer - Upcoming Shows & Performances |publisher=Zvents |date=March 17, 2010 |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324072906/http://www.zvents.com/performers/show/7070-mc-hammer |archive-date=March 24, 2010 }}</ref>

During 1991, Hammer was featured on the single "The Blood" from the [[BeBe & CeCe Winans]] album, ''[[BeBe & CeCe Winans#Different Lifestyles|Different Lifestyles]]''. In 1992, the song [[BeBe & CeCe Winans#Singles|peaked at No. 8]] on the [[Hot Christian Adult Contemporary#Christian|Christian charts]].

===New venture with Oaktown/Giant Records (1992–1993)===
In 1992, after a four-year hiatus, [[Doug E. Fresh]] signed with Hammer's label, Bust It Records and issued one album, ''[[Doin' What I Gotta Do]]'', which (despite some minor acclaim for his single "Bustin' Out (On Funk)" which sampled the [[Rick James]] 1979 single "Bustin' Out") was a commercial failure.

Prior to Hammer's next album, ''[[The Funky Headhunter]]'', [[rumor]]s from critics and fans began claiming Hammer had quit the music/entertainment business or had suffered a financial downfall (since a couple of years were passing between his two records), which Hammer denied. Hammer claimed [[fallacy|rumors falsely]] [[Mc hammer#Bankruptcy, lawsuits and media reaction|heralded his downfall]] were most likely a result of the fact he turned over his "trimmed-down" Bust It Records to his brother and manager Louis Burrell Jr., and his [[horse racing]] interests to his brother Chris and their father, Louis Burrell Sr.<ref name="latimes1991"/>

During his hiatus between albums, Hammer consequently signed a multimillion-dollar deal with a new record company. He said there were a lot of bidders, but "not too many of them could afford Hammer". Therefore, Hammer parted ways with [[Felton Pilate]] (who had previously worked with the successful vocal group [[Con Funk Shun]]) and switched record labels to [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]], taking his Oaktown label with him. Hammer was [[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em#Legal issues|eventually sued by Pilate]]. Additionally, Hammer launched a new enterprise, called [[MC Hammer discography#Roll Wit It Entertainment|Roll Wit It Entertainment & Sports Management]], with clients such as [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Deion Sanders]] and [[Reggie Brooks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Evander_Holyfield.aspx |title=Evander Holyfield |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=December 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Roll+Wit+It+Entertainment |title=Roll Wit It Entertainment |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=December 25, 2012}}</ref> In 1993, his production company released a hit rap song by [[DRS (band)|DRS]].

By this time, he also parted ways with his only female executive, music business administration consultant and songwriter, Linda Lou McCall (who previously worked with [[The Delfonics]] and her husband [[Louis A. McCall, Sr.]]'s band [[Con Funk Shun]]). She went on to work with artists such as [[Puff Daddy]], [[Faith Evans]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Mýa]], [[Black Eyed Peas]] and [[Eminem]].  A music industry vet who attended Howard University's College of Fine Arts and the University of California-Davis School of Law,  McCall was hired by Hammer's brother and manager, Louis K. Burrell,  in 1990 to help set up his corporate operations and administration at Bust It Management and Productions Inc.  in [[Oakland, California]]. She later became Vice President of Hammer's talent management company, overseeing artists like [[Heavy D]], [[B Angie B]] and [[Ralph Tresvant]]. While at Bust It, she and her husband [[Louis A. McCall, Sr.]] brought their artist [[Keith Martin (musician)|Keith Martin]] to Felton's attention who hired him as a backup musician and vocalist for Hammer's ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]'' and ''[[Too Legit to Quit]]'' world tours.  In 1993 and 1994, Linda Lou was also involved in several lawsuits against Hammer which were eventually settled out of court.

With a new home and daughter, a new record soon to be released, and his new business, Hammer claimed he was happy and far from being broke during a tour of his mansion for ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''. "Today there is a more aggressive Hammer, because the '90s require you to be more aggressive", Hammer said of his music style. "There is a harder edge, but I'm no ''gang member''. Hammer in the '90s is on the offense, on the move, on the attack. And it's all good".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n6_v49/ai_14969852/pg_2/?tag=content;col1 |title=Hammer's hilltop mansion - page 2 &#124; Ebony |publisher=Findarticles.com |access-date=May 10, 2011 |year=1994}}</ref>

===''The Funky Headhunter'' and ''Prime Time'' (1994)===
{{Main|The Funky Headhunter}}
In 1993, Hammer began recording his fifth official album. To adapt to the changing landscape of hip-hop, this album was a more aggressive sounding album entitled ''[[The Funky Headhunter]].'' He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek. While Hammer's appearance changed to keep up with the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor profanity. Yet, as with previous records, Hammer would continue to call out and [[disrespect]] other rappers on this album. As with some earlier songs such as "Crime Story" (from the album ''Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em''),<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Sandow |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316708,00.html |title=Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em &#124; Music |publisher=EW.com |date=February 16, 1990 |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> the content and reality about "street life" remained somewhat the same, but the sound was different, resulting in Hammer losing favor with fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/crime-story-lyrics-mc-hammer.html |title=Mc Hammer - Crime Story Lyrics |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> This album peaked at number two on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B charts]] and remained in the Top 30 midway through the year.<ref name="answers2"/>  The album was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Hammer&ti=The+Funky+Headhunter#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum: RIAA|access-date=August 29, 2020|publisher=RIAA}}</ref>

Hammer debuted the video for "[[Pumps and a Bump]]" during another appearance on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' during the mid-1990s. Host [[Arsenio Hall]] said to M.C. Hammer, "Women in the audience want to know, what's in your speedos in the 'Pumps and a Bump' video?" A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience. Hammer didn't give a direct answer, but instead laughed. Arsenio then said, "I guess that's why they call you 'Hammer.'

The video to the album's first single, "Pumps and a Bump", was banned from heavy rotation on [[MTV]] with censors claiming that the depiction of Hammer in [[Speedos]] (and with what appeared to be an erection) was too graphic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Damien|title=Hip Hop Had a Dream: Vol. 1 the Artful Movement|year=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-0204-3|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i2WXKXECJwC&q=mc+hammer+Pumps+and+a+Bump+mtv&pg=PA141}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2005-06-29/summer-guide/bang-thy-head-carefully/|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|title = Bang Thy Head Carefully}}</ref> This led to an alternative video being filmed (with Hammer fully clothed) that was directed by [[Bay Area]] native Craig S. Brooks.

"[[The Funky Headhunter#Release and reception|It's All Good]]" was the second single released and was the [[It's All Good (disambiguation)#Songs|most successful song by this title]].
Within this album, Hammer disses rappers such as [[A Tribe Called Quest]] ([[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]), [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Run DMC]] for previous attacks they made against him on wax. This quite possibly led to a decrease in his popularity after this record responded to his critics.

On December 20, 1994, [[Deion Sanders]] released ''[[Prime Time (Deion Sanders album)|Prime Time]]'', a rap album on Hammer's Bust It Records label which featured the minor hit "Must Be the Money". "Prime Time Keeps on Tickin'" was also released as a single. Sanders, a friend of Hammer's, had previously appeared in his "[[Too Legit to Quit (song)#Music video|Too Legit to Quit]]" music video, and his [[Deion Sanders#"Prime Time" personality|alter-ego "Prime Time"]] is also used in Hammer's "[[Pumps and a Bump (video)|Pumps and a Bump]]" video.

The song "Help Lord (Won't You Come)" appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (2001 film)|Kingdom Come]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246002/soundtrack|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104183600/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246002/soundtrack|url-status=dead|title=Kingdom Come (2001) - IMDb|archive-date=January 4, 2016|website=IMDb.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

===''Inside Out'', Death Row Records and ''Too Tight'' (1995–1996)===
{{Main|Inside Out (MC Hammer album)}}

In 1995, Hammer released the album ''[[Inside Out (MC Hammer album)|Inside Out V]]'' (or ''inside out V''). The album sold poorly compared to previous records (peaking at 119 on the Billboard Charts) and [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] dropped him and Oaktown Records from their roster. Songs "Going Up Yonder" and "Sultry Funk" managed to get moderate radio play (even charting on national radio station countdowns).

Along with a fickle public, Hammer would go on to explain in this album that he felt many of his so-called friends he helped staff, used and betrayed him which contributed to a majority of his financial loss (best explained in the song "Keep On" and the [[Liner notes#Biographies|bio]] from this album).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000025ZX0 |title=Inside Out: Hammer: Music |website=Amazon |access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref>  He would also hint about this again in interviews, including ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2009/03/its_hammer_time.php |title=It's Hammer Time |publisher=warnerbros.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429060017/http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2009/03/its_hammer_time.php |archive-date=April 29, 2009 }}</ref>

In 1995, Hammer released "Straight to My Feet" (with [[Deion Sanders]]) from the ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' [[Street Fighter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK.

Hammer's relationship with [[Suge Knight]] dates back to 1988. Hammer signed with [[Death Row Records]] by 1995, then home to [[Snoop Dogg]] and his close friend, [[Tupac Shakur]].<ref name="daveyd1">{{cite web|url= http://www.daveyd.com/hammer.html|title= MC Hammer Interview - part 1|access-date=March 20, 2009|date=June 1997|publisher = daveyd.com}}</ref> The label did not release the album of Hammer's music (titled ''Too Tight'') while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429907/19990805/mc_hammer.jhtml|title = MC Hammer|publisher = MTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429908/19990421/mc_hammer.jhtml|title = MC Hammer|publisher = MTV}}</ref> However, Burrell did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song "[[MC Hammer discography#Singles|Too Late Playa]]" (along with [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/2Pac__Too_Late_Playa__feat_MC_Hammer,_Big_Daddy_Kane,_Nutt-So_Danny_Boy |title=2pac Too Late Playa Feat Mc Hammer, Big Daddy Kane, Nutt-so Danny Boy |publisher=Wn.com |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Burgess |first=Omar |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1320/title.death-row-records-the-pardon |title=Death Row Records: The Pardon &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |publisher=HipHop DX |date=March 18, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526170048/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1320/title.death-row-records-the-pardon |archive-date=May 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the death of Shakur in 1996, Burrell left the record company.<ref name="daveyd2">{{cite web|url= http://www.daveyd.com/hammerpt2.html|title= MC Hammer Interview - part 2|access-date=March 20, 2009|date=June 1997|publisher = daveyd.com}}</ref> He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] since he was in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with Tupac the night of his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2009/03/what_had_happened_was_mc_hammer/ |title=What had happened was MC Hammer |publisher=vibe.com |date=March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106032958/http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2009/03/what_had_happened_was_mc_hammer |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

===Return to EMI and ''Family Affair'' (1996–1998)===
[[File:MC_Hammer_1999.jpg|thumb|MC Hammer at [[Larry King]]'s charity event, 1999]]
In October 1996, Burrell and Oaktown signed with [[EMI]], which saw the release of a [[compilation album]] of Hammer's [[Hit single|chart topping songs]] prior to ''The Funky Headhunter''. The album, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (MC Hammer album)|Greatest Hits]]'', featured 12 former hits.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dealtime.com/xPF-Greatest_Hits_M_C_Hammer|title= Greatest Hits by M.C. Hammer Specs|publisher = DealTime}}</ref> In 1998, another "greatest hits" album, called ''[[Back 2 Back Hits]]'', was produced and released by [[CEMA (record label distributor)|CEMA]]. (Another compilation version of ''Back 2 Back'' was later released by [[Capitol Records]] in 2006.) As Hammer's empire began to collapse when his last album failed to match the sales of its predecessors, and since he unsuccessfully attempted to recast himself in the "[[hardcore hip hop|streetwise/hardcore rap]]" mold of the day, Hammer turned to a [[gospel music|gospel]]-friendly audience.<ref name="answers1"/>

In 1998, M.C. Hammer released his first album in his new deal with EMI, titled ''Family Affair'', because it was to introduce the world to the artists he had signed to his Oaktown Records (Geeman, Teabag, and Common Unity) as they made their recording debut. Technically his seventh album since his debut [[extended play|EP]], this record was highly promoted on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (performing a more gospel version of "Keep On" from his album ''[[Inside Out (MC Hammer album)|Inside Out V]]''), yet featured no [[Hit single|charting singles]] and selling about 1,000 copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://new.music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/albums/family-affair--188884598|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120711053520/http://new.music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/albums/family-affair--188884598|url-status = dead|archive-date = July 11, 2012|title = MC Hammer Albums: Family Affair|publisher = yahoo.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/mc+hammer|title = MC Hammer|publisher = pandora.com}}</ref>

The album also features a song written for Hammer by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] called "[[Unconditional Love (Tupac Shakur song)|Unconditional Love]]".<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/mc-hammer/chart-history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215231216/https://www.billboard.com/music/mc-hammer/chart-history |url-status=live |archive-date=February 15, 2019 |title=Discography |publisher=billboard.com }}</ref> Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first ''[[Hip Hop Honors|VH1 Hip Hop Honors]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasblack.com/entertainment/hammertime |title=MC Hammer To Perform Hip Hop Honors |publisher=DallasBlack.com |date=September 22, 2004 |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222347/http://www.dallasblack.com/entertainment/hammertime |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/vh1-hip-hop-honors/hip-hop-honors--2004/episode/979577/summary.html |title=VH1 Hip Hop Honors: Hip Hop Honors : 2004 episode on |publisher=Tv.com |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref>

A [[double album]] mostly about [[Faith (religion)|faith]] and [[family values]], additional tracks from ''Family Affair'' are: "Put It Down", "Put Some Stop in Your Game", "Big Man", "Set Me Free", "Our God", "Responsible Father Shout", "He Brought Me Out", (Geeman Intro), "Eye's Like Mine", "Never Without You", "Praise Dance Theme Song", "Shame of the Name", (Smoothout Intro), (Teabag Intro), "Silly Heart", "I Wish U Were Free", (Common Unity Intro), "Someone to Hold to You", "Pray" (1998), "Let's Get It Started" (1998), and with "Hammer Music/Shouts/Tour Info" announcements between songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/albums/family-affair--188884598 |title=Family Affair &#124; MC Hammer Album &#124; Yahoo!

===''The Hits'' and ''Active Duty'' (2000–2001)===
{{Main|Active Duty (MC Hammer album)}}
In 2000, another compilation album was released, titled ''[[The Hits (MC Hammer album)|The Hits]]''. It contains 17 tracks from his first four albums.

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], M.C. Hammer released his 8th studio album, ''[[Active Duty (MC Hammer album)|Active Duty]]'', on his own World Hit Music Group label (the musical enterprise under his Hammertime Holdings Inc. umbrella) to pay homage to the ones lost in the [[terrorist attacks]].<ref name="cnn112201">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/11/22/hammer/ |title=MC Hammer releases message to America |date=November 22, 2001 |access-date=May 12, 2009 |publisher=CNN |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602202929/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/11/22/hammer/ |archive-date=June 2, 2009 }}</ref> The album followed that theme, and featured two singles (with accompanying videos), "No Stoppin' Us (USA)" and "[[Pop Ya Collar|Pop Yo Collar]]" (featuring Wee Wee) which demonstrates "The Phat Daddy Pop", "In Pop Nito", "River Pop", "Deliver The Pop" and "Pop'n It Up" dance moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issykitty.videosift.com/video/MC-Hammer-and-Wee-Wee-Pop-Your-Collar |title=MC Hammer and Wee Wee - Pop Your Collar • VideoSift: Online Video *Quality Control |publisher=Issykitty.videosift.com |access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref> The album, like its predecessor, failed to chart and would not sell as many copies as previous projects.

This patriotic album, originally planned to be titled ''The Autobiography Of M.C.

===''Full Blast'' (2004)===
{{Main|Full Blast (album)}}
After leaving Capitol Records and EMI for the second time in his career, M.C. Hammer decided to move his Oaktown imprint to an independent distributor and released his ninth studio album, ''Full Blast'' (which was completed in late 2003 and released as a complete album in early 2004). The album would feature no charting singles and was not certified by the [[RIAA]]. A video was produced for "Full Blast", a song that attacks [[Eminem]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] for previous disrespect towards him.

Some of the original songs didn't end up making the final album release. Guest artists included The Stooge Playaz, Pleasure, Rain, JD Greer and DasIt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapnews.net/0-202-258656-00.html |title=Rap News Network - Hip-Hop News: MC Hammer is Back 'Full Blast' |publisher=Rapnews.net |date=January 29, 2004 |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref>

{{Main|Look Look Look}}
After going [[Independent record label|independent]], Hammer decided to create a [[Digital distribution|digital label]] to release his tenth studio album, ''Look Look Look.'' The album was released in February 2006 and featured production from [[Scott Storch]]. The album featured the title-track single (''[[Look Look Look]]'') and a [[music video]]. It would sell much better than his previous release (300,000 copies worldwide).

"YAY" was produced by [[Lil Jon]]. "What Happened to Our Hood?" (featuring Sam Logan) was originally from ''[[Active Duty (album)|Active Duty]]''. "I Got It From The Town" was used in the [[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift|movie]] but is only present in one scene instead of the originally planned two on ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift#Music|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (soundtrack)]]''.

Between 2006 and 2007, Hammer released a military-inspired rap song with a political message to President [[George W. Bush]] about sending American troops back home from war, called "Bring Our Brothers Home".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mchammer.blogspot.com/2007/06/bring-our-brothers-home-hannitys.html |title=MC Hammer Blog: Bring Our Brothers Home: Hannity's America |publisher=Mchammer.blogspot.com |date=June 11, 2007 |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> The video was filmed at the [[Santa Monica Pier]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/videos/hammer/151333/bring-our-brothers-home.jhtml|title = MC Hammer: Bring Our Brothers Home| format = video| publisher = mtv.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vh1classic.com/view/artist/1173681/151333/M_C_Hammer/Bring_Our_Brothers_Home/index.jhtml|title = MC Hammer: Bring Our Brothers Home|format = video|publisher = vh1classic.com|access-date = May 11, 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090702000933/http://www.vh1classic.com/view/artist/1173681/151333/M_C_Hammer/Bring_Our_Brothers_Home/index.jhtml|archive-date = July 2, 2009|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2008, ''[[MC Hammer discography#Compilation albums|Platinum MC Hammer]]'' was released by [[EMI Records]]. The compilation consists of 12 tracks from Hammer's previous albums, with a similar playlist as former "greatest hits" records (with the exception of including a remix of "[[MC Hammer discography#Singles|Hammer Hammer, They Put Me In A Mix]]" which includes rap lyrics that "[[Let's Get It Started (album)|They Put Me In A Mix]]" originally did not). An import was released by [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/albums/platinum--184690724 |title=Platinum &#124; MC Hammer Album &#124; Yahoo!

Released through licence on Whippet Digital Recordings, media reviews were said to be "disappointing". However, the song "I Got Gigs" from this album was used in a 2009 ESPN commercial and performed during ''[[Hammertime]]'' (as well as played while he danced just prior to introducing [[Soulja Boy#2007–08: Souljaboytellem.com and iSouljaBoyTellem|Soulja Boy]] during [[YouTube Live]] on November 22, 2008).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i999ebd327d1b0f727cffb348e4b5229d |title=MC Hammer Puts New Single in ESPN Commercial |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=August 15, 2008 |access-date=May 10, 2011 |archive-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113213413/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i999ebd327d1b0f727cffb348e4b5229d |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer.jpg|thumb|MC Hammer performing with [[Vanilla Ice]] in July 2009.]]

In February 2009, M.C. Hammer and [[Vanilla Ice]] had a one-off concert at the [[UCCU Center|McKay Events Center]] in [[Orem, Utah]].<ref name="newsweek" /> This concert aided in the promotion of Hammer's new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of ''Hammertime''), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since the time when they were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: "Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, we are like long lost friends. I've known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract and before I had a record contract. It is a great reunion." Vanilla Ice said: "It's like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day ...

===Most recent releases (2010–present)===
Hammer has occasionally released singles over the past few years. Below are the most publicized:

===="Better Run Run" (2010)====
M.C. Hammer promised to release a [[diss track|track]] (expected on October 31, 2010) responding to a song by [[Kanye West]] featuring [[Jay-Z]] which attacked him. On the "[[So Appalled]]" track, which features [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[RZA]], Jay-Z raps a verse targeting Hammer about his [[#Bankruptcy, lawsuits and media reaction|financial dilemma in the 1990s]]. On it Jay says: 'Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused / I lost 30 mil' so I spent another 30 / 'Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me'. Hammer addressed his displeasure about the diss on [[Twitter]], claiming he will react to Jay-Z on [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2010/09/29/mc-hammer-promises-jay-z-diss-track-for-hovs-lines-on-so-appalled-track/ |title=MC Hammer Promises Jay-Z Diss Track For Hov's Lines On 'So Appalled' Track |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=September 29, 2010 |access-date=October 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theurbantwist.com/topics/news/2010/09/30/mc-hammers-comeback-may-have-jay-z-in-his-sights/ |title=MC Hammer's Comeback: May have Jay-Z in his sights!! |publisher=TheUrbanTwist.com |date=September 30, 2010 |access-date=October 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Steele |url=http://kluc.radio.com/2010/09/27/mc-hammer-vs-jay-z/ |title=MC Hammer VS.

On November 1, Hammer's song with video called "Better Run Run!" hit the [[Internet|web]] in retaliation to Jay-Z's September 2010 diss towards him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/952096/mc-hammer-releases-jay-z-diss-video |title=MC Hammer Releases Jay-Z Diss Video |publisher=Billboard.com |date=September 14, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Danielle |last=Canada |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2010/11/01/mc-hammer-releases-jay-z-diss-%E2%80%9Cbetter-run-run%E2%80%9D/ |title=MC Hammer Releases Jay-Z Diss "Better Run Run" [Video&#93; |publisher=Hiphopwired.com |date=November 1, 2010 |access-date=May 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180621/http://hiphopwired.com/2010/11/01/mc-hammer-releases-jay-z-diss-%E2%80%9Cbetter-run-run%E2%80%9D/ |archive-date=July 24, 2011  }}</ref> M.C. accuses Jigga of being in league (and in the studio) with Satan—and then Hammer defeats the devil and forces Jay to be baptized. Speaking on the video, Jacob O'Gara of ''[[Ethos Magazine]]'' wrote: "What's more likely is that this feud is the last chapter in the tragic cautionary tale of M.C. Hammer, a tale that serves as a warning to all present and future kings of hip-hop.

In an interview with [[BBC]]'s [[DJ Semtex]], Jay said he didn't mean the verses as a personal attack.  "I didn't know that [Hammer's financial status] wasn't on the table for discussion!" he said. "I didn't know I was the first person ever to say that..." He continued, "When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [''Decoded''] — that wasn't a cheap plug," he laughed. "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/news/jay-z-responds-to-mc-hammer-slam--62007036 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721182450/http://new.music.yahoo.com/mc-hammer/news/jay-z-responds-to-mc-hammer-slam--62007036 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 21, 2012 |title=MC Hammer News |publisher=Yahoo!

==Additional business ventures==
In 1991, M.C. Hammer established Oaktown Stable that would eventually have nineteen [[Horse racing#Thoroughbred racing in the United States|Thoroughbred racehorses]]. That year, his outstanding filly [[Lite Light]] won several Grade I stakes races including the prestigious [[Kentucky Oaks]]. His [[D.

In 2002, Hammer signed a book contract with publishing company [[Simon & Schuster]] which called for a release the following year. However, a manuscript for an inspirational book called ''Enemies of the Father: Messages from the Heart on Being a Family Man'' (addressing the situation of African American men), for which Hammer received advance money to write, was never submitted in 2003. This resulted in Hammer being sued by the book company over claims that he never finished the book as promised. The company's March 2009 lawsuit sought return of the US$61,000 advance given to Hammer for the unwritten book about fatherhood.<ref name="answers1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur51667.cfm |title=Black Entertainment &#124; Black News &#124; Urban News &#124; Hip Hop News &#124; Black Entertainment |publisher=EURweb.com |date=March 16, 2009 |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505050706/http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur51667.cfm |archive-date=May 5, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/entertainment/NYC-Publisher-Sues-MC-Hammer-Over-61K-Advance.html |title=NYC Publisher Sues MC Hammer Over US$61K Advance |publisher=NBC San Diego |date=March 14, 2009 |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref>

Despite his financial status being publicly attacked, after meeting at the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] convention in [[Las Vegas]] in April 2001, Hammer (credited as a producer)<ref name="sing365" /> provided the much needed funding to filmmaker [[Justin Lin]] for ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'' (2002).

Hammer appeared in two cable television movies.<ref name="answers1"/> At the age of 39, he was one of the producers for the [[VH1]] movie ''Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story'', starring [[Romany Malco]] and [[Tangi Miller]] as his wife, which aired on December 19, 2001. The film is a biopic which chronicles the rise and fall of the artist. ''2 Legit To Quit: The Life Story of M.C. Hammer'' became the second highest-rated original movie in the history of VH1 and broadcast simultaneously on BET.<ref name="sing365" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/toolegit:themchammerstory_v270579/summary |title=Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story Synopsis |publisher=Fandango.com |date=December 19, 2001 |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210012446/http://www.fandango.com/toolegit%3Athemchammerstory_v270579/summary |archive-date=February 10, 2010 }}</ref> "The whole script came from me," says Hammer, "I sat down with a writer and gave him all the information."<ref name="VH1 interview" />

In 2003, Hammer appeared on [[The WB]]'s first season of ''[[The Surreal Life]]'', a reality show known for assembling an eclectic mix of celebrities to live together.  He was also a [[Competitive dance#Judging|dance judge]] on the 2003 [[Freeform (TV channel)#Sale to Disney and rebranding as ABC Family (2001–2006)|ABC Family]] TV series ''[[Dance Fever (2003 TV series)|Dance Fever]]''. Additionally, he appeared on VH1's ''[[And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip-Hop]]'' (2004) as well as in ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'' (2008), a countdown which he was also commentator on. His eldest child, A'Keiba Burrell, was a contestant on MTV's ''[[Rock the Cradle]]'' in April 2008 (which Hammer also made appearances on).

Hammer had shown an interest in having his own reality show with specific television networks at one point. Already being a part of shows for VH1 and The WB (''[[I Married...]] M.C. Hammer'' and ''The Surreal Life''), it was later confirmed he would appear in ''[[Hammertime]]'' on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E Network]] in the summer of 2009.<ref name="AE_Hammertime" /> This reality show was about his personal, business and family life.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/02/19/2009-02-19_rapper_mc_hammer_bringing_new_show_hamme.html|title = Rapper MC Hammer bringing new show|publisher = nydailynews.com|date = February 19, 2009 | location=New York | first1=Cristina | last1=Kinon | first2=Richard | last2=Huff}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2009/02/mc-hammer-family-to-star-in-ae-reality-series-this-year.html |title=MC Hammer, family to star in A&E reality series this year – The TV Guy – Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Blogs.orlandosentinel.com |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420191547/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2009/02/mc-hammer-family-to-star-in-ae-reality-series-this-year.html |archive-date=April 20, 2009 }}</ref> The following year, Hammer appeared on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan#2001–11: Live! with Regis and Kelly|Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' June 3, 2009, to promote his show which began June 14, 2009, at 10 PM [[Eastern Time Zone]] (EST).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aetv.com/news/?id=448488 |title=A&E News - "Hammertime" premieres Sunday, June 14 at 10 PM ET/PT on A&E |publisher=Aetv.com |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526045059/http://www.aetv.com/news/?id=448488 |archive-date=May 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="abc5769413">{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=5769413&rss=rss-wabc-article-5769413 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124165654/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=5769413&rss=rss-wabc-article-5769413 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |title=This Week on Live with Regis and Kelly - 3/26/10 - New York News and Tri-State News - 7online.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=March 26, 2010 |access-date=March 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b100451_ashton_trades_tweets_football_owen.html?sid=rss_topstories |title=Ashton Trades Tweets for Football; Owen & Reese Hook Up |publisher=E!

In addition to appearing in television commercials, M.C.

Additionally, "This Is What We Do" was a 1990 track by Hammer (featuring [[B Angie B]]) for the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' film and [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]]. Tracks "That's What I Said" and "[[Feel My Power]]" were used for the ''[[Rocky V]]'' film and [[Rocky V (album)|soundtrack]]. Some examples of other raps by Hammer used in movies and television were "[[Addams Groove]]" (''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]''), "Pray" (''[[License to Wed]]''), "2 Legit 2 Quit" (''[[Hot Rod (2007 film)|Hot Rod]]''), "I Got It From The Town" (''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]''), "Help Lord, Won't You Come" (''[[Kingdom Come (2001 film)|Kingdom Come]]''), "Let's Go Deeper" (''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'') and "Straight to My Feet" (''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]''), among others.

===Dancer, choreographer and entertainer===
M.C. Hammer's [[History of hip hop dance#Social dancing|dance style]] not only helped pave the way for the [[Bay Area]] movement called [[Hyphy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/ghostridethewhip:thehyphymovement_v450499/summary |title=Ghostride the Whip: The Hyphy Movement |format=Synopsis |publisher=fandago.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528215729/http://www.fandango.com/ghostridethewhip%3Athehyphymovement_v450499/summary |archive-date=May 28, 2009 }}</ref> but also helped to bring hip-hop and rap to the Bay Area. His dancing skills are still taught to this day. With his popular trademark Hammer Pants, one phenomenal difference from Hammer versus other performers during his heyday was that he was an entertainer, both during live shows and in music videos. His flamboyant dancing was as much a part of his performances as rapping and musical instruments were. With high-energy dance routines, he is often considered one of the greatest dancers. While adding his own techniques, Hammer adopted styles from [[James Brown]] and [[The Nicholas Brothers]] such as the [[Split (gymnastics)|splits]], and feverish choreographed dance routines including [[Split leap|leaps]] and [[slide (dance)|slide]]s, most notably. His creation of such dances as "Hammer Dance"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancejam.com/dances/hammerdance |title="Hammerdance" .dancejam.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118105354/http://dancejam.com/dances/hammerdance |archive-date=November 18, 2011 }}</ref> (or the "Typewriter Dance"), "The Bump" (from "[[U Can't Touch This]]") and the use of "[[The Running Man (dance)|The Running Man]]" and the "Butterfly," among others, made his flashy and creative dance skills unlike any others at the time.

Hammer's [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] and elaborate stage [[Choreography (dance)|choreography]], involving fifteen dancers, twelve backup singers, seven live musicians and two disc jockeys, gave him a powerful visual appeal. Hammer was the first rap artist to put together a choreographed show of this type, and his visual flair attracted heavy airplay for his videos on MTV, which at the time had a predominantly white viewership that had aired little rap music before Hammer.<ref name="answers1"/>

During a 1990 visit from M.C. Hammer (accompanied by his friend [[Fab Five Freddy]]) on ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'', one of the dancers whom Hammer was holding auditions for was a then-unknown [[Jennifer Lopez]].

At the height of his career, Hammer had his legs insured for a substantial amount of money (into the millions), as mentioned in an interview by [[Maria Shriver]] in the early 1990s. He later suffered an injury to his knee that halted his dancing career for a period of time.<ref name="connectionmag">{{cite web|url = http://www.connectionmagazine.org/archives_old/mchammer.htm|title = MC Hammer|publisher = connectionmagazine.org}}</ref> Eventually, BET ranked Hammer as the 7th Best Dancer Of All Time.<ref name="BETmediaroom" /> Some of Hammer's entourage, or "posse" as he called them, were also trained/skilled dancers (including Tiffany Patterson). They participated in videos and at concerts, yet too many dancers and band members eventually contributed to Hammer's downfall, proving to be too much for him to finance.<ref name="dabelly" />

Hammer stayed active in the dance media/genre, both on television shows and as co-founder of DanceJam.com (which showcased dance competitions and instructional videos on all the latest dance styles) until he and his partner [[Geoffrey Arone]] sold it to Grind Networks.<ref name="popmech" /> Well known for bringing choreography to hip-hop, many of his dancing skills can still be seen on dance-focused and social networking sites. "Dance is unlike any other social medium. It's the core of our culture", Burrell told [[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired News]].<ref name="bet1" />

In addition to his websites and other Internet appearances,<ref name="techcrunch" /> Hammer has also appeared demonstrating much of his dancing abilities on talk shows such as ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' (performing [[List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien sketches#Celebrity Secrets|O'Brien's famous]] "[[String dance#Monologue digressions|string dance]]" together as well), ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' and was a [[Competitive dance#Judging|dance judge]] on ''[[Dance Fever (2003 TV series)|Dance Fever]]''. On June 3, 2009, he performed the "Hammer dance" on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan#2001–11: Live! with Regis and Kelly|Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' with [[Will Ferrell]] as co-host.<ref name="abc5769413" /><ref name="ae-hammertime">{{cite web|url=http://www.aetv.com/news/?tag=Hammertime |title=News |publisher=Aetv.com |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507031753/http://www.aetv.com/news/?tag=Hammertime |archive-date=May 7, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://regisandkelly.go.com/guest_guide.html |title=Live with Regis and Kelly - Guest Guide |publisher=Regisandkelly.go.com |access-date=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212210358/http://regisandkelly.go.com/guest_guide.html |archive-date=February 12, 2010 }}</ref>

While Hammer may have challenged and competed with [[Michael Jackson]] during the height of his career, they were friends, proven by a phone call Hammer had with Jackson about his "Too Legit to Quit" video which he shared on ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'' (July 2009). Hammer wanted to ensure he was not offended by the ending of the video where a purported Michael Jackson (seen only from behind) does the "2 Legit 2 Quit" hand gesture with his famous glove.<ref name=spudart/><ref name="wendyshow" /> They also appeared together at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006, where Hammer danced in honor of ''[[List of honorific titles in popular music|The Godfather of Soul]]''.<ref name="MTV-brown_james" /> After Jackson's death, Hammer posted his remembrance and sympathy of the superstar on Twitter. Michael's friend and fellow pop culture icon Hammer told [[Spinner.com|Spinner]] that, "now that the [[List of honorific titles in popular music|King of Pop]] has passed, it's the duty of his fans and loved ones to carry Jackson's creative torch." He went on to say, "Michael Jackson lit the fuse that ignited the spirit of dance in us all. He gave us a song and a sweet melody that will never die. Now we all carry his legacy with joy and pride."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/06/26/mc-hammer-remembers-his-friend-michael-jackson/ |title=MC Hammer Remembers His Friend Michael Jackson |publisher=Spinner |date=June 26, 2009 |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref>

===Bankruptcy, lawsuits and media reaction===
Contrary to public rumor, Hammer claimed he was really never "down-and-out" as reported by the media (eventually expressed on ''[[Opie and Anthony|The Opie & Anthony Show]]'' and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' in 2009). Originally having an estimated net worth of over $33 million according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, speculations about Hammer's status first emerged during delays between albums ''[[Too Legit to Quit]]'' and ''[[The Funky Headhunter]]'', with Hammer having spent much of his money on staff and personal luxuries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson |first=Gordon T. |url=https://money.cnn.com/2003/05/30/pf/debt/broke_celebs/index.htm |title=Celebs who go broke - May. 31, 2003 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=May 31, 2003 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref> In addition to excessive spending while supporting friends and family,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rhapsody.com/mc-hammer|title = MC Hammer|publisher = Rhapsody}}</ref> Hammer ultimately became $13 million in debt.

In 1992, Hammer had admitted in depositions and court documents to getting the idea for the song "Here Comes the Hammer" from a [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian recording artist]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] named Kevin Christian. Christian had filed a 16 million dollar lawsuit against Hammer for [[copyright infringement]] of his song entitled "Oh-Oh, You Got the Shing". This fact, compounded with witness testimony from both Hammer's and Christian's entourages, and other evidence (including photos), brought about a settlement with [[Capitol Records]] in 1994.

===Obstruction charges===
M.C. Hammer was arrested in 2013 in [[Dublin, California]], for allegedly [[Obstruction of justice|obstructing an officer]] in the performance of his duties and resisting an officer (according to [[Stop and identify statutes|"stop and identify" statutes]]). Hammer claims he was a victim of [[racial profiling]] by the police, stating an officer pulled out his gun and randomly asked him: "Are you on parole or probation?" Hammer stated that as he handed over his [[Identity document|ID]], the officer reached inside the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], said Hammer was "blasting music" in a vehicle with expired [[Vehicle registration|registration]] and he was not the registered owner. "After asking Hammer who the registered owner was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions," police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to [[CNN]]. Hammer was booked and released from [[Santa Rita Jail]] in Dublin. A court date was scheduled, however, all charges were dropped in early March.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wonderwall.msn.com/music/mc-hammers-obstruction-charges-dropped-1739233.story |title=MC Hammer's obstruction charges dropped &#124; Story &#124; Wonderwall |publisher=Wonderwall.msn.com |date=March 10, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729044223/http://wonderwall.msn.com/music/mc-hammers-obstruction-charges-dropped-1739233.story |archive-date=July 29, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/mc-hammer-charges-dropped_n_2847783.html |title=MC Hammer Charges Dropped After Arrest Last Month |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= March 10, 2013|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> Hammer tweeted that he was not bitter and considered what happened "a teachable moment."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/23/showbiz/california-mc-hammer-arrest |title=MC Hammer arrested in obstructing officer case |publisher=CNN.com |access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2013/02/23/mc-hammer-arrested-obstruction/ |title=MC Hammer - Arrested for Obstruction, But Claims Profiling |publisher=TMZ.com |date=February 23, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/02/24/mc-hammer-arrested-in-california/?intcmp=trending |title=MC Hammer arrested in California |publisher=Fox News |date=February 24, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/24/mc-hammer-arrested_n_2754939.html?amp |title=MC Hammer Arrested For Obstructing An Officer, Claims He's A Victim Of Racial Profiling |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=February 24, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>
