'''The Kinks''' were an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Muswell Hill]], north London, in 1963 by brothers [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies]]. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |title=The Kinks Biography on All Music.com |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4690|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="Hall Bio">{{cite web |title=The Kinks |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-kinks |year=2007 |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref> The band emerged during the height of [[British rhythm and blues]] and [[Merseybeat]], and were briefly part of the [[British Invasion]] of the United States until their touring ban in 1965.

The Kinks' music drew from a wide range of influences, including American [[R&B]] and [[rock and roll]] initially, and later adopting British [[music hall]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[country music|country]]. The band gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style,<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Blender"/><ref name="RollinStone">{{cite web |title=The Kinks Biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/biography |access-date=20 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621074342/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/biography |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and made apparent in albums such as ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' (1966), ''[[Something Else by the Kinks|Something Else]]'' (1967), ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society|The Village Green Preservation Society]]'' (1968), ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|Arthur]]'' (1969), ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One|Lola Versus Powerman]]'' (1970), and ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' (1971), along with their accompanying singles. After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums ''[[Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)|Sleepwalker]]'' (1977), ''[[Misfits (The Kinks album)|Misfits]]'' (1978), ''[[Low Budget (album)|Low Budget]]'' (1979), ''[[Give the People What They Want (The Kinks album)|Give the People What They Want]]'' (1981) and ''[[State of Confusion]]'' (1983). In addition, groups such as [[Van Halen]], [[the Jam]], [[the Knack]], [[the Pretenders]], [[The Raincoats]] and [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] cited the band as a major influence.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Ray Davies (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the band's 33-year run. Longest-serving member [[Mick Avory]] (drums and percussion) was replaced by [[Bob Henrit]], formerly of [[Argent (band)|Argent]], in 1984. Original bass guitarist [[Pete Quaife]] was replaced by [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] in 1969. After Dalton's 1976 departure, [[Andy Pyle]] briefly served as the band's bassist before being replaced by [[Argent (band)|Argent]] bassist [[Jim Rodford]] in 1978. Session keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]] accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. The band became an official five-piece in 1970, when keyboardist John Gosling joined them. Gosling quit in 1978; he was first replaced by ex-[[Pretty Things]] member Gordon Edwards, then more permanently by [[Ian Gibbons (musician)|Ian Gibbons]] in 1979. The band gave its last public performance in 1996 and broke up in 1997 as a result of creative tension between the Davies brothers.<ref name="Hinman 340–342">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |pages=340–342}}</ref>

===Formation (1962–1963)===
[[Image:Kinks Denmark Terrace Davies.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A brown brick building. Visible is a door at left, with a bowfront window at right.|6 Denmark Terrace, the childhood home of the Davies brothers. The front room is where the family's frequent Saturday night parties were held.]]

The Davies brothers were born in suburban [[North London]] on Huntingdon Road, [[East Finchley]], the youngest and the only boys among their family's eight children.<ref name="Hinman 6">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |page=6}}</ref> Their parents, Frederick and Annie Davies, moved the family to 6{{nbsp}}Denmark Terrace, [[Fortis Green]], in the neighbouring suburb of [[Muswell Hill]].<ref name="Kitts 1-3">{{cite book |pages=1–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2 |first=Thomas M. |last=Kitts |date=2008 |title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135867959}}</ref> At home the brothers were immersed in a world of varied musical styles, from the [[music hall]] of their parents' generation to the [[jazz]] and early [[rock and roll]] their older sisters enjoyed.<ref name="Kitts 1-3"/> Both Ray and his brother Dave, younger by almost three years, learned to play guitar, and they played [[skiffle]] and rock and roll together.<ref name="Hinman 6"/>

The brothers attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later merged with [[Tollington School|Tollington Grammar School]] to become [[Fortismere School]]), where they formed a band, the Ray Davies Quartet, with Ray's friend and classmate Pete Quaife and Quaife's friend John Start (although they would also be known as the Pete Quaife Quartet, if the bass player landed a gig for them instead). Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists, including [[Rod Stewart]],<ref name="Hinman 8-9">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |pages=8–9}}</ref> another student at William Grimshaw,<ref>Ewbank, Tim and Stafford Hildred.

In late 1962, Ray Davies left home to study at [[Hornsey College of Art]]. He pursued interests in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music, including jazz and blues.<ref>{{cite book |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23 |first=Thomas M. |last=Kitts |date=2008 |title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135867959}}</ref> When [[Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated]] played at the college in December, he asked advice from [[Alexis Korner]], who recommended [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], the former [[Yardbirds]] manager, who put Davies in touch with the [[Soho]]-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B.<ref>{{cite book |pages=28–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28 |first=Thomas M. |last=Kitts |date=2008 |title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135867959}}</ref> A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported [[Cyril Stapleton]] at the [[Lyceum Ballroom]] on New Year's Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included [[Charlie Watts]] on drums.<ref name=Kitts29>{{cite book |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA29 |first=Thomas M. |last=Kitts |date=2008 |title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135867959}}</ref> In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had [[Peter Bardens]] as pianist.<ref name=Kitts29/> At the end of the spring term he left Hornsey College with a view to study film at the [[Central School of Art and Design]], around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods.<ref name=Kitts30>{{cite book |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 |first=Thomas M. |last=Kitts |date=2008 |title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135867959}}</ref> Davies has referred to a show the fledgling Kinks played (again as the Ray Davies Quartet) at [[Hornsey Town Hall]] on Valentine's Day 1963 as their first important gig. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up,<ref name=Kitts30/> though the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band, and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens.<ref name="Blender"/><ref name="Hinman 9-20">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |pages=9–20}}</ref> The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer [[Larry Page (singer)|Larry Page]] became their third manager. American record producer [[Shel Talmy]] began working with the band, and [[the Beatles]]' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows.<ref name="Savage 15-19">Savage, Jon (1984). pp. 15–19</ref> The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with [[Pye Records]]. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye.<ref name="Hinman 9-20"/> The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="Hinman 17-20">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |pages=7–20}}</ref> Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name="Hinman 17-20"/>

Around this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In [[Jon Savage]]'s analysis, they "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage."<ref name="Savage Name">Savage, Jon (1984). p. 17</ref> Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: "I had a friend{{nbsp}}... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity{{nbsp}}... When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were{{nbsp}}... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky!{{'"}}<ref name="Savage Name"/> Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their "kinky" fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks."<ref name="Savage Name"/> "I've never really liked the name," Ray stated.<ref name="Savage Name"/>

===Early years (1964–1965)===
The band's first single was a cover of the [[Little Richard]] song "[[Long Tall Sally#The Kinks version|Long Tall Sally]]". [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]], a friend of the band,<ref>{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |page=20}}</ref> was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles, including the early hits "You Really Got Me", "All Day and All of the Night" and "Tired of Waiting for You".<ref>{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |pages=20–46}}</ref> "Long Tall Sally" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored. When their second single, "[[You Still Want Me]]", failed to chart,<ref name="Hinman 18-22">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn= 0-87930-765-X |pages=18–22}}</ref> Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was successful.

Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the [[American Federation of Musicians]] refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the [[British Invasion]].<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Who Let">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.kindakinks.net/misc/articles/kinksin.html |first=Loraine |last=Alterman |title=Who Let the Kinks In? |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=18 December 1969}}</ref> Although neither the Kinks nor the union revealed a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.<ref name="Who Let"/> It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping [[Dick Clark]]'s TV show ''[[Where the Action Is]]'' in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself.'"; subsequently a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39665367 |title=To Ray Davies, America is a 'beautiful but dangerous' place |last=Savage |first=Mark |date=23 April 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 April 2017}}</ref>

Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks.

Beginning early in 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead focusing on work in the studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success.<ref name="4-10">Miller, Andy (2003). pp. 4–10</ref> The Kinks' next single, "[[Wonderboy (The Kinks song)|Wonderboy]]", released in the spring of 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers.<ref name="Rogan 1a">Rogan, Johnny (2004). p.&nbsp;20</ref> In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centering on a slowly developing project of Ray's called ''Village Green''.<ref name="AllMusic"/> In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was [[Peter Frampton]]'s group [[The Herd (UK band)|The Herd]]. "In general, the [[teenybopper]]s were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances",<ref name="Miller 27">Miller, Andy (2003). p. 27</ref> commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward{{nbsp}}... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again."<ref name="Miller 27"/> At the end of June, the Kinks released the single "[[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]]", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. "I played it to Brian, who used to be our [[roadie]], and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.&nbsp;... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone."<ref name="Savage Days">Savage, Jon (1084). pp. 97–100</ref> "Days" reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.<ref name="Rogan 20">Rogan, Johnny (1998). p. 20</ref>

''Village Green'' eventually morphed into their next album, ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', released in late 1968 in the UK.

=== Decline in popularity and split (1986–1997) ===
In early 1986, the group signed with [[MCA Records]] in the United States and London Records in the UK.<ref name="Disc"/><ref name="Rogan 142"/> Their first album for the new labels, ''[[Think Visual]]'', released later that year, was a moderate success, peaking at number 81 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Disc"/><ref name="Rogan 142a">Rogan, Johnny (2004). pp.&nbsp;142–154</ref> Songs like the ballad "Lost and Found" and "Working at the Factory" concerned blue-collar life on an assembly line, while the title track was an attack on the very MTV video culture from which the band had profited earlier in the decade.<ref name="Allmusic Think Visual">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r11034|pure_url=yes}}|title=Think Visual|first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=27 November 2009}}</ref> The Kinks followed ''Think Visual'' in 1987 with another live album, ''The Road'', which was a mediocre commercial and critical performer.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/> In 1989, the Kinks released ''[[UK Jive]]'', a commercial failure, making only a momentary entry into the album charts at number 122.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/> MCA Records ultimately dropped them, leaving the Kinks without a label deal for the first time in over a quarter of a century. Longtime keyboardist Ian Gibbons left the group and was replaced by Mark Haley.<ref name="Hinman 320">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|pages =300–320 }}</ref>

In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the Kinks were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Hall Bio"/> Mick Avory and Pete Quaife were present for the award.<ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Hinman 320"/> The induction, however, did not revive the Kinks' stalled career. A compilation from the [[MCA Records]] period, ''[[Lost & Found (1986–1989)]]'', was released in 1991 to fulfil contractual obligations, and marked the official end of the group's relationship with MCA.<ref name="Disc"/> The band then signed with [[Columbia Records]] and released the five-song EP ''Did Ya'' in 1991 which, despite being coupled with a new studio re-recording of the band's 1968 British hit "Days", failed to chart.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Disc"/>

The Kinks reverted to a four-piece band for the recording of their first Columbia album, ''[[Phobia (The Kinks album)|Phobia]]'', in 1993.<ref name="Hinman 320"/><ref name="Hinman 325">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page =325 }}</ref> Following Mark Haley's departure after the band's sellout performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Gibbons rejoined the Kinks for a US tour.<ref name="Hinman 320"/> ''Phobia'' managed only one week in the US ''Billboard'' chart at number 166;<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Hinman 320"/> as had by then become usual for the band, it made no impression in the UK.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> One single, "[[Only a Dream (The Kinks song)|Only a Dream]]", narrowly failed to reach the British chart. "[[Scattered (The Kinks song)|Scattered]]", the album's final candidate for release as a single, was announced, followed by TV and radio promotion, but the record was unavailable in stores—several months later a small number appeared on the collector market.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> The group was dropped by Columbia in 1994.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> In the same year, the band released the first version of the album ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]'' on their own [[Konk (recording)|Konk]] label in the UK. This live acoustic album was partly recorded on the highly successful UK tours of 1993 and 1994 and partly in the Konk studio, before a small, invited audience.<ref name="Hinman 340">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page = 340}}</ref> Two years later the band released a new, improved, live double CD set in the US, which retained the same name and contained two new studio tracks, "Animal" and "To The Bone". The CD set also featured new treatments of many old Kinks hits.<ref name="Hinman 340"/> The record drew respectable press but failed to chart in either the US or the UK.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Hinman 340"/>

The band's profile rose considerably in the mid-1990s, primarily as a result of the "[[Britpop]]" boom.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hinman 340"/> Several of the most prominent bands of the decade cited the Kinks as a major influence. Despite such accolades, the group's commercial viability continued to decline.<ref name="AllMusic"/> They gradually became less active, leading Ray and Dave Davies to pursue their own interests. Each released an autobiography; Ray's ''X-Ray'' was published in early 1995, and Dave responded with his memoir ''Kink'', published a year later.<ref name="Hinman 333">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page =333 }}</ref> The Kinks gave their last public performance in mid-1996,<ref name="Hinman 325-350">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|pages =325–350 }}</ref> and the group assembled for what would turn out to be their last time together at a party for Dave's 50th birthday. Kinks chronicler and historian Doug Hinman stated, "The symbolism of the event was impossible to overlook. The party was held at the site of the brothers' very first musical endeavour, the Clissold Arms pub, across the street from their childhood home on Fortis Green in North London."<ref name="Hinman 337">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page =337 }}</ref>

=== Solo work and recognition (1998–present) ===
[[Image:Dave Davies.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man, wearing blue, plays an electric guitar and gazes down on the ground.|Dave Davies at the Dakota Creek Roadhouse, 2002]]

The band members subsequently focused on solo projects, and both Davies brothers released their own studio albums.<ref name="Hinman 333"/> Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion of the original band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in playing together again.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer [[Dave Clarke (musician)|Dave Clarke]] as [[the Kast Off Kinks]].<ref name="Allmusic Mick Avory">{{cite web|title=Mick Avory|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p53104|pure_url=yes}}|first=Bruce |last=Eder |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=27 November 2009}}</ref>

Ray Davies released the solo album ''Storyteller'', a companion piece to ''X-Ray'', in 1998. Originally written two years earlier as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother.<ref name="Davies"/> Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network [[VH1]] launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''.<ref name="Davies">{{cite web|title=Ray Davies|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p35394|pure_url=yes}}|first1=William|last1=Ruhlman|first2=Stephen |last2=Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=27 November 2009}}</ref> Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again.<ref name="Hinman 342">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page =342 }}</ref> However, hopes for a reunion were dashed in June 2004 when Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar.<ref name=WellRespected>{{cite news|title=Ray Davies' well-respected legacy|first=James|last=McNair|date=23 September 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ray-davies-wellrespected-legacy-1709342.html|work=The Independent |access-date=27 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in November 2005, with all four of the original band members in attendance. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of ''[[The Ultimate Collection (The Kinks album)|The Ultimate Collection]]'', a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.<ref name="Strong 1">Strong, Martin (2006). p. 608</ref> Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, at the age of 66.<ref name="Quaife Death">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/121429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626001107/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/121429 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 June 2010 |title=Original Kinks Bassist Pete Quaife Dead at 66 |author=Greene, Andy |date=24 June 2010 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref> On 20 January 2018, long-time bassist Jim Rodford died at the age of 76.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/20/zombies-bassist-and-former-kinks-member-jim-rodford-dies-at-76|title=Zombies bassist and former Kinks member Jim Rodford dies at 76|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 January 2018|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> In July 2019, keyboardist Ian Gibbons died of cancer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-kinks-keyboardist-ian-gibbons-has-died-2534772|title=The Kinks keyboardist Ian Gibbons has died|date=2 August 2019}}</ref>

=== Possible reunion ===
In June 2018, the Davies brothers said they were working on a new The Kinks' studio album with Avory.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/26/ray-davies-kinks-officially-getting-back-together/|title=Ray Davies: The Kinks are officially getting back together|first=Alice|last=Vincent|date=26 June 2018|access-date=9 October 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> In July 2019, the band again said they were working on new music<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/07/the-kinks-recording-new-album-ray-davies-dave-davies/|title=The Kinks Are Recording New Music, According to Ray and Dave Davies|date=17 July 2019|website=SPIN}}</ref> however in a December 2020 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Ray Davies did not indicate that much work has been done, saying "I'd like to work with Dave again — if he'll work with me."<ref name="nytimes.com"/> When asked about a reunion in an interview published January 2021, Dave Davies said "We've been talking about it. I mean there's a lot of material and, you know, it could still happen."<ref name="Edgers"/>

==Live performances==
The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964.<ref name="Blender"/><ref name="Hinman 9-20"/> Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born.

The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a "package" bill that included [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Honeycombs]].<ref name="All Day 47"/> They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]].<ref name="Kitts58"/> Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, [[Cardiff]], Wales on 19 May.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16&nbsp;stitches to his head.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> Following their summer 1965 American tour, the [[American Federation of Musicians]] refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years,<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref>Alterman, Loraine. ''Who Let the Kinks In?''. ''Rolling Stone'', 18 December 1969</ref> possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.<ref>Crouse, Timothy. ''The British Scourge'' . ''Show Guide'' Magazine, 1969.</ref>

In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group,<ref name="Hinman 128"/> which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was "sick of it all" at a gig in [[White City Stadium]], London in 1973.<ref name="Hinman 173">{{cite book |first=Doug |last=Hinman |date=2004 |title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-765-X |page=173}}</ref> A review of the concert published in ''Melody Maker'' stated: "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F......{{sic}} sick of the whole thing'&nbsp;... He was 'Sick up to here with it'&nbsp;... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer{{sic}} on through 'Waterloo Sunset.{{'"}}<ref name="Days"/> Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up as the band were leaving the stage, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.<ref name="Hinman 173"/><ref name="Days"/>

==Musical style==
The Kinks started out playing the then popular [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] styles; then, under the influence of [[The Kingsmen]]'s "[[Louie Louie]]" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds. Due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as "the original [[Punk rock|punks]]".<ref name="Hinman p. 1">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page = 1}}</ref><ref name="Hall of Fame Rocks">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hall-of-fame-anniversary-rocks-on-with-second-all-star-night-20091030|title=Hall of Fame Anniversary Rocks on With Second All-Star Night |author=Ganz, Caryn |date=30 October 2009 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=8 February 2010}}</ref> [[Dave Davies]] was "really bored with this [[guitar]] sound—or lack of an interesting sound" so he purchased "a little green [[amplifier]]{{nbsp}}... an Elpico" from a radio spares shop in [[Muswell Hill]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davedavies.com/guitars/guitars2.htm|title=Elpico Amp (The 'Green Amp') – 1962|first=Dave|last=Davies|work=davedavies.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425162920/http://www.davedavies.com/guitars/guitars2.htm|archive-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> and "twiddled around with it", including "taking the wires going to the [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and putting a [[Phone connector (audio)|jack plug]] on there and plugging it straight into my [[Vox AC30|AC30]]" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and "got a single-sided [[Gillette]] [[razor]]blade and cut round the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|cone]] [from the centre to the edge]{{nbsp}}... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact.

From 1966 onwards,<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of [[Music of the United Kingdom|English music]] and [[Culture of England|culture]], during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and [[Pop music|pop]] styles.<ref name="AllMusic"/> [[Ray Davies]] recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. "I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote '[[A Well Respected Man]]'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote{{nbsp}}... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]."<ref name="Hinman">{{cite book|first= Doug|last= Hinman|date=2004|title= The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-765-X|page =61 }}</ref> The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the [[American Federation of Musicians]]. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market,<ref name="AllMusic"/> forcing them to focus on Britain and [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the [[1960s]], incorporating elements of [[music hall]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[baroque music]] through use of [[harpsichord]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[mellotron]], and [[horn instrument|horns]], in albums such as ''Face to Face'', ''Something Else by the Kinks'', ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'', and ''Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)'', creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Beginning with ''Everybody's In Show-biz'' (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album ''Preservation Act 1'' and continued through ''Schoolboys In Disgrace'' (1976).<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks were less commercially successful with these conceptual works, and were dropped by [[RCA]] which had signed them in 1971. In 1977 they moved to Arista Records, who insisted on a more traditional rock format. ''Sleepwalker'' (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a [[mainstream]], relatively slick [[Record producer|production]] style that would become their norm.<ref name="Sleepwalker"/> The band returned to hard rock for ''Low Budget'' (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career,<ref name="AllMusic"/> however, they took a detour for pop music in the 1980s, which can be heard on almost all of their albums beginning with ''[[Give the People What They Want (The Kinks album)|Give the People What They Want]]'' and continuing to their breakup. Songs featuring a pop sound include "[[Better Things (song)|Better Things]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/06/the-30-day-song-selection-spectacular-4-favorite-breakup-song/|title=The 30-Day Song Selection Spectacular: #4, Favorite Breakup Song|first=Paula|last=Carino|date=2011|website=American Songwriter}}</ref>
