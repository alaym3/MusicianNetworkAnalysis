== History ==

===Beginnings and ''Horn of Plenty'' (2002–2005)===
Grizzly Bear began as a moniker for songwriter [[Ed Droste]]'s music in the early 2000s. Regarding the band's origins as a solo project, Droste noted, "It was just like doing a little home project, and I thought "oh, this is fun, I'm just going to call this stuff Grizzly Bear. [...] Our name was actually just a nickname for an old boyfriend of mine."<ref name="brooklynvegan.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/09/an_interview_wi_10.html|title=An interview with Ed Droste of Grizzly Bear|date=September 8, 2006|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, Droste released Grizzly Bear's debut album, ''[[Horn of Plenty (Grizzly Bear album)|Horn of Plenty]]''. Predominately a solo album, the album featured contributions from future drummer [[Christopher Bear]].<ref name="spin.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2009/05/grizzly-bear-soap-opera/|title=Grizzly Bear: Soap Opera|date=May 22, 2009|publisher=SPIN.com|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine wrote of the first album, "the pure atmospheric power of the songs is more than enough to hypnotize."<ref name="wbur">{{cite web |url=http://www.wbur.org/npr/16022050 |title=Grizzly Bear: An Old 'House,' a New 'Friend' |last1=Ganz |first1=Jacob |date=November 6, 2007 |website=90.9 [[WBUR]] |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>

Droste and Bear were subsequently joined by bass guitarist and producer [[Chris Taylor (Grizzly Bear musician)|Chris Taylor]], and performed four shows together as a three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, "We've never played without the four of us, really. The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan [Rossen], we did with three of us and they kind of sucked. From the get-go, when we were trying to put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why I think that was the beginning of the band."<ref name="cokemachine">{{cite web|url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/feature/2281/grizzly-bear |title=Interview / Grizzly Bear |first=David |last=Greenwalk |work=cokemachineglow.com |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924051037/http://www.cokemachineglow.com/feature/2281/grizzly-bear |archive-date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref>

Guitarist and vocalist [[Daniel Rossen]], a friend of Bear's from jazz-camp,<ref name="brooklynvegan.com"/><ref name="spin.com"/> joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just happened that I lived with [[Chris Taylor (Grizzly Bear musician)|Chris Taylor]] during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then after a while he suggested I come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris [Bear], but I didn’t know Ed [Droste] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/interviews/a/grizzlybear.htm|title=An Interview with Daniel Rossen of Grizzly Bear|publisher=Altmusic.about.com |date=May 8, 2009|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>
 
Regarding the decision to turn Grizzly Bear into a full band, Droste noted "I was quite happy to relinquish the idea of being a solo artist. I hate the thought of being under a spotlight with my guitar, mumbling into a microphone. It's horribly scary to me."<ref name="scotsman"/>

In 2005, ''The Remixes'', a collection of remixed songs from ''Horn of Plenty'', was released by [[Kanine Records]]. Contributors include [[Simon Bookish]], [[Owen Pallett|Final Fantasy]], [[Soft Pink Truth]], [[DNTEL]], [[Efterklang]], and [[Ariel Pink]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3667-the-remixes/ |title=Grizzly Bear: The Remixes |last1=Hogan |first1=Marc |date=November 5, 2005 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>

===''Yellow House'' (2006–2007)===
Their first record as a quartet and to feature material written by Rossen, ''[[Yellow House (album)|Yellow House]]'', was released on Warp Records in September 2006. It was named for Droste's mother's house where it was recorded<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/folk-without-the-beards/15687/ ''LA Weekly'' Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515152914/http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/folk-without-the-beards/15687/|date=May 15, 2007|title=}}</ref> and ranked as one of the top albums of 2006 by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]. In 2007, Rossen recorded a cover of [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]]'s single "[[Too Little Too Late]]" for Droste's twenty-ninth birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digboston.com/boston-music-concerts/2013/06/run-for-cover-jojo-vs-daniel-rossen-of-grizzly-bear-too-little-too-late/ |last1=Corcoran |first1=Nina |date=June 28, 2013 |title=Run for cover: Jojo vs. Daniel Rossen (of Grizzly Bear): Too Little Too Late |website=[[DigBoston]] |access-date=August 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713015229/http://digboston.com/boston-music-concerts/2013/06/run-for-cover-jojo-vs-daniel-rossen-of-grizzly-bear-too-little-too-late/ |archive-date=July 13, 2014 }}</ref> Also in 2007, the band released ''[[Friend (EP)|Friend]]'', an [[extended play|EP]] which features outtakes, alternate versions of songs, and covers of Grizzly Bear material done by [[CSS (band)|Cansei de Ser Sexy]] (CSS), [[Band of Horses]], and [[Atlas Sound]]. In addition, members of the [[Dirty Projectors]] and [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]] collaborated with the band on "Alligator" and the EP's hidden track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10871-friend-ep/ |last1=Schreiber |first1=Ryan |title=Grizzly Bear: Friend EP |date=November 6, 2007 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>

===''Veckatimest'' (2008–2010)===
In summer of 2008, Grizzly Bear opened for [[Radiohead]] on the second leg of their North American tour.<ref>Gormely, Ian.[https://exclaim.ca/music/article/grizzly_bear_under_pressure "Grizzly Bear Under Pressure"], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', May 2009.</ref> In [[Toronto]], on their last date of the tour together, [[Radiohead]] guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] spoke of his love for Grizzly Bear, on stage, calling them his favorite band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00334-radiohead-speak-of-love-for-grizzly-bear|title=Jonny Greenwood: Grizzly Bear Are My Favourite Band|publisher=The Quietus|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref> Of the experience, Taylor has commented: “It was shocking, and kind of unbelievable. It still is unbelievable. Opening for Radiohead was a huge honor for us, as a band and as individuals. We’ve all had long-term relationships with Radiohead’s music, so we didn’t want to take that opportunity for granted, and do anything less than the best we could."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/grizzly-bear-interview|title=Grizzly Bear Interview|date=May 27, 2009|publisher=Clashmusic.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021070609/http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/grizzly-bear-interview|archive-date=October 21, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref> Christopher has also commented that it "was like a dream."<ref name="musicfeeds.com.au">{{cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/cover-story/cover-story-grizzly-bear/|title=Grizzly Bear - Cover Story|publisher=Musicfeeds.com.au|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

The group then convened at a house on Cape Cod to solidify their third full-length album, ''[[Veckatimest]]'', which released in May 2009 and was named "after a tiny, uninhabited island on Cape Cod that the band visited and was inspired by, particularly liking its Native American name."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grizzly-bear.net/blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603074703/http://grizzly-bear.net/blog/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 3, 2006|title=Blog|publisher=Grizzly Bear|access-date=September 18, 2012}}</ref> Upon release the album reached No.&nbsp;8 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and met with widespread critical acclaim. Chris Bear has noted that compared to ''Yellow House'', the 2009 release ''Veckatimest'' is more of an accessible pop record. He said: "I think that it’s kinda clearer, clearer equals more accessible I feel like clearer equals more accessible in general as a rule."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/05/tlobf-interview-grizzly-bear/|title=TLOBF Interview :: Grizzly Bear|author=Peter Bloxham|publisher=The Line Of Best Fit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003131555/http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/05/tlobf-interview-grizzly-bear/|archive-date=October 3, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Veckatimest'' made many Top Album lists for 2009 (#1 Wall Street Journal, No.&nbsp;6 Pitchfork, No.&nbsp;6 New York Times, No.&nbsp;8 Time).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grizzly-bear.net/news/2734/veckatimest-dominates-2009s-top-year-end-lists/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316200524/http://grizzly-bear.net/news/2734/veckatimest-dominates-2009s-top-year-end-lists/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 16, 2010|title=Veckatimest on 2009's Top Year-End Lists « Grizzly Bear|date=December 21, 2009|publisher=Grizzly-bear.net|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

In 2009 Grizzly Bear played at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on February 28 with [[Owen Pallett]], backed by an [[orchestra]] arranged by [[Nico Muhly]] and conducted by [[Michael Christie (conductor)|Michael Christie]]. They played new songs from ''[[Veckatimest]]'' as well as songs from ''[[Yellow House (album)|Yellow House]]''. [[Ed Droste]] has stated that many songs (such as "Central and Remote", "Reprise" and "Campfire") will not be played again unless backed by an orchestra. In March 2009, they played two showcases at [[South by Southwest]] Festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. In July 2009, they played at the [[Pitchfork Music Festival]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmusicfestival.com/index.php?d=sunday|title=Pitchfork Music Festival 2010|publisher=Pitchforkmusicfestival.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128002303/http://pitchforkmusicfestival.com/index.php?d=sunday|archive-date=November 28, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

In 2009, Grizzly Bear collaborated with singer Victoria Legrand on the song "Slow Life" for ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon (soundtrack)|The Twilight Saga: New Moon]]''. The song is featured in the film as Bella sees an illusion of Edward underwater.

In 2009, Grizzly Bear contributed "Service Bell" (with [[Feist (singer)|Feist]]) and "Deep Blue Sea" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34395-dark-was-the-night-full-tracklist-announced/ |last1=Dombal |first1=Ryan |date=January 15, 2009 |title=Dark was the night: Full tracklist announced |website=Pitchfork Media |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref> That same year they also released a charity T-shirt via the [[Yellow Bird Project]], to raise money for the Brighter Planet Foundation.<ref>{{cite news

Grizzly Bear was scheduled to headline and curated [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP]]'s I'll Be Your Mirror festival at Alexandra Palace in London, UK on May 5, 2013. However, after the event was initially postponed to November 2013, I'll Be Your Mirror was cancelled in August due to "problems with the venue and new date".<ref>{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear ATP Festival Cancelled|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/51765-the-rescheduled-grizzly-bear-atp-event-has-been-cancelled/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc|access-date=November 7, 2013|author=Carrie Battan|date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2014, Grizzly Bear closed out their international ''Shields'' tour with a sold-out performance at the Sydney Opera House. The performance was streamed live internationally on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2014/01/grizzly-bear-shields-tour-two-hour-concert-video/ |title=Watch Grizzly Bear's last gig ahead of possible hiatus |last1=McGovern |first1=Kyle |website=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]] |date=January 6, 2014 |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>

===''Painted Ruins'' (2014–2019)===
Following the completion of the ''Shields'' tour, Daniel Rossen embarked upon a solo tour performing tracks from his debut EP, and his other band, [[Department of Eagles]]. During the tour, Rossen commented on the future of Grizzly Bear, stating: "We don't have a clear plan. We tend to like to let the records come together naturally. I think everyone wants a little bit of a break and everyone's scattered around the globe. I think towards the end of the year, if it feels natural, we'll start again." In a more recent interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, singer Ed Droste explained that a new album was in the works. Unlike the recording process for Shields, where Grizzly Bear ensconced themselves at studios in Marfa, Texas and Cape Cod, Massachusetts to construct a truly collaborative album, Droste says the creative process was "more fractured." While two members still live in New York, the other half, including Droste, have traded coasts and now reside in Los Angeles. As of June 2016, Droste had been working on the next album with the rest of Grizzly Bear.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/04/10/daniel-rossen-interview-grizzly-bear-sixth-and-i/|title=Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen stops at Sixth and I on his first solo tour|last1=Greenberg|first1=Rudi|date=April 10, 2014|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grizzly-bear-start-work-on-more-adventurous-fifth-album-20150415|title=Grizzly Bear Start Work on 'More Adventurous' Fifth Album|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|date=April 15, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 4, 2015}}</ref>

Later, they uploaded a number of clips (all brief and without lyrics) with increasing frequency. On May 5, 2017, the song "Three Rings" was released onto Vevo.
