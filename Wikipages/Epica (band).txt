They primarily write their own lyrics, which often deal with philosophical, psychological, spiritual, moral, scientific, environmental, socio-political, global and topical and personal themes. Epica is also known for their wide use of orchestra and opera choirs.

In 2003, Epica's debut album ''[[The Phantom Agony]]'' was released through Transmission Records. ''[[Consign to Oblivion]]'' followed in 2005, and debuted at No. 12 in the [[Dutch Albums Chart|Dutch charts]]. They moved labels to [[Nuclear Blast]] following Transmission's bankruptcy, and in 2007, released their third studio album ''[[The Divine Conspiracy]]'', which charted at No. 9 in the Netherlands. 2009's ''[[Design Your Universe]]'' was met with yet greater success, debuting at No. 8 in the [[Dutch Albums Chart]], and charting across Europe, also garnering much critical acclaim. Epica's fifth studio album ''[[Requiem for the Indifferent]]'' was released in 2012. Well received by critics, it achieved international success, entering the US's [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at No. 104, and Japan's [[Oricon]] Albums Chart at No. 172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epica.nl/news/495-requiem-for-the-indifferent-chart-positions |title=Requiem for the Indifferent – Chart positions / News / Epica |website=Epica.nl |date=2012-03-21 |access-date=2013-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000422/http://www.epica.nl/news/495-requiem-for-the-indifferent-chart-positions |archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref>

At the beginning of May 2014 the band released their sixth album, ''[[The Quantum Enigma]]'', which was a huge international success, debuting on No. 110 on [[US Billboard 200]] and peaking at No. 4 in Epica's homeland Netherlands.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://epica.nl/news/2014-02-2014-02-17-epica-the-quantum-enigma-cover-art-release-date-tracklisting-revealed|title=Epica – 'The Quantum Enigma' – Cover Art, Release Date + Tracklisting Revealed – Epica Official Website|website=Epica.nl}}</ref><ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301789/epica/chart?f=305|title=Epica|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref name="dutchcharts.nl">{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Epica&titel=The%20Phantom%20Agony&cat=a|title=Epica – The Phantom Agony|first=Steffen|last=Hung|website=Dutchcharts.nl}}</ref> In June 2015 Epica was awarded the Music Export Awards, which is given to the Dutch act with the most international success in the past year.<ref name="epica.nl1">{{cite web|url=http://epica.nl/news/2015-06-epica-receives-dutch-music-export-award|title=Epica Receives Dutch Music Export Award! – Epica Official Website|website=Epica.nl}}</ref> Their seventh album, ''[[The Holographic Principle]]'', was released in September 2016 to continued international success, equalling the peak chart position set by its predecessor in the Netherlands.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Epica/status/738768846467792896|title=Epica on Twitter|website=Twitter.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}</ref> The band released their eighth album, ''[[Omega (Epica album)|Omega]]'', in February 2021.

==History==
===''Cry for the Moon'' (2002)===
[[File:Simone Simons - Epica - Wacken Open Air 2018(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Simone Simons]], Epica's lead singer and frontwoman]]
In early 2002, at only 22 years old, [[Mark Jansen]] left [[After Forever]] over creative differences.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Begai |first1=Carl |title=EPICA - THE ECSTASY OF AGONY |url=https://bravewords.com/features/epica-the-ecstasy-of-agony |website=Bravewords |access-date=25 August 2021}}</ref>  He then began looking for musicians who would work towards a more classical/symphonic type of music project; this was initially named '''Sahara Dust'''.<ref name = Metalstorm>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/band.php?band_id=208&bandname=Epica|title=Epica – Metal Storm|website=Metalstorm.ee}}</ref> In late 2002, the band courted [[Helena Michaelsen]]<ref name = Metalstorm/> (from [[Trail of Tears (band)|Trail of Tears]]) as its frontwoman, but shortly after she was replaced by the then unknown [[Simone Simons]], who was Jansen's girlfriend at the time. The band's line-up was completed by guitarist Ad Sluijter, drummer Jeroen Simons, bassist Yves Huts, and keyboard player Coen Janssen. The name was later changed to Epica, inspired by [[Kamelot]]'s [[Epica (Kamelot album)|album of the same name]].

Epica then assembled a [[choir]] (made up of two men and four women) and a [[string orchestra]] (three [[violin]]s, two [[viola]]s, two [[cello]]s and an [[upright bass]]) to play along with them. Still under the name ''Sahara Dust'', they produced a two-song [[demo (music)|demo]] entitled ''Cry for the Moon''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfan.nl/reviews.php?id=524|title=Metalfan.nl Review: Sahara Dust – Cry For The Moon|date=2003-02-12|website=Metalfan.nl}}</ref> in 2002. As a result, they were signed to Transmission Records.

===''The Phantom Agony'' (2002–2004)===
''[[The Phantom Agony]]'' is the first full-length studio album by Epica. It is the first album recorded by guitarist [[Mark Jansen]] after his departure from the band [[After Forever]]. The album was produced by [[Sascha Paeth]] (known for having produced bands such as [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Rhapsody of Fire]] and [[Kamelot]]) and released in June 2003. This album, Mark Jansen continues with the collection of songs that make up "The Embrace That Smothers". The first three parts can be found on ''[[Prison of Desire]]'' (2000), After Forever's debut album, and the following three parts can be found on ''[[The Divine Conspiracy]]'' (2007), Epica's third album. These songs deal with the dangers of organized [[religion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=22459 |title=Epica (Nld) – The Phantom Agony |access-date=2010-05-10 |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]] }}</ref> The song "Façade of Reality" on the album was written about the [[September 11 attacks]] and includes fragments from speeches by [[Tony Blair]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/epica.htm|title=Epica The Phantom Agony Review and Interview at Musical Discoveries|website=Musicaldiscoveries.com|access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref>

The album was followed by three singles: “The Phantom Agony”, “Feint” and “Cry for the Moon”.

===''Consign to Oblivion/The Score – An Epic Journey'' (2004–2006)===
Their second release, entitled ''[[Consign to Oblivion]]'', was influenced by the culture of the [[Maya civilization]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/epica2005.htm|title=Epica Consign To Oblivion and Interview at Musical Discoveries|website=Musicaldiscoveries.com|access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref> which can be noticed on songs in the "A New Age Dawns" series. "A New Age Dawns" refers to the time system of the Mayan people, which extends up to 2012, and makes no reference of what may happen past said year. ''Consign to Oblivion'' was composed with [[film score]]s as a basis, with [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Danny Elfman]] cited as major inspirations. The album features guest singing by [[Roy Khan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=3254&band_id=&bandname=Epica|title=Epica – Consign To Oblivion – Metal Storm|website=Metalstorm.ee}}</ref> (from [[Kamelot]]) on the song "Trois Vierges". Epica also joined [[Kamelot]] as a support band on parts of their tour for promotion of ''[[The Black Halo]]'' album, to which [[Simone Simons|Simons]] had contributed her vocals on the track "The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=2302&band_id=136&bandname=Kamelot|title=Kamelot – The Black Halo – Metal Storm|website=Metalstorm.ee}}</ref>
Two singles were released from the album, "[[Solitary Ground]]" and "[[Quietus (Silent Reverie)|Quietus]]".{{fact|date=November 2021}}

Epica's non-metal album ''[[The Score – An Epic Journey]]'' was released in September 2005 and is the [[soundtrack]] for a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] movie called ''[[Joyride (2005 film)|Joyride]]'', though it could also be considered to be their third album. [[Mark Jansen]] describes the album as typical Epica, "only without the singing, without the guitars, no bass and no drums".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |last=Jansen |first=Mark |year=2005 |title=The Score&nbsp;– An Epic Journey}}</ref>

In 2005 and 2006 Epica went on their first tour throughout [[North America]] with [[Kamelot]]. After the tour, drummer Jeroen Simons left the band because of his wish to pursue other musical interests. In Fall 2006, Simone once again contributed vocals to an album of [[Kamelot]], this time on the tracks "Blücher" and "Season's End" on the album ''[[Ghost Opera]]''. In December, [[Ariën van Weesenbeek]] from [[God Dethroned]] was announced via Epica's official website as the guest drummer for their new album, but not as a permanent band member.{{fact|date=November 2021}}

===''The Divine Conspiracy''/''The Classical Conspiracy'' (2007–2009)===
[[File:Epica Hellfest 2007 22.jpg|thumb|right|Lead vocalist Simone Simons and Grunt vocalist and guitarist Mark Jansen during ''The Divine Conspiracy World Tour''.]]
In September 2007, Epica headlined their first tour through North America and released their third album, ''[[The Divine Conspiracy]]'', this time on a new label, [[Nuclear Blast]]. That December, [[Ariën van Weesenbeek]] was announced to be Epica's permanent new drummer. The band toured North America again in April 2008 with [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]] and [[Symphony X]], this time with [[Amanda Somerville]] because Simone had contracted a staph infection ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]).  It was released on September 7, 2007 through [[Nuclear Blast]] in Europe. The concept that guides the songs is that God created many different religions for humanity to figure out and overcome them so as to discover that, in nature and essence, they were all in fact the same one (hence the name, "The Divine Conspiracy").<ref name="Simons interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/epica2008.htm | title = Simons interview, 2008 | access-date =25 June 2015}}</ref> Aside from the concept of such a conspiracy, ''The Divine Conspiracy'' finalizes The Embrace That Smothers, which began in [[After Forever]]'s ''[[Prison of Desire]]'' (Prologue and parts I-III) and continued in Epica's ''[[The Phantom Agony]]'' (parts IV-VI). In short, The Embrace That Smothers is a collection of 10 songs (Prologue and parts I-IX), which talks about the dangers of organized religion. 

The first single from the album was released on August 10, 2007 entitled "[[Never Enough (Epica song)|Never Enough]]", accompanied by a music video and the second single, "[[Chasing the Dragon (Epica song)|Chasing the Dragon]]," was released in 2008 without an accompanying video.

On December 16, 2008, Ad Sluijter left the band. He left a message on his Myspace page with his reasoning for leaving the band, which included frustration over being unable to enjoy composing music because of deadlines. Ad's successor on guitar was announced in January 2009 to be [[Isaac Delahaye]], who was a member of [[God Dethroned]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idio.ai/|title=Always on. Always 1:1.|website=Idio.ai|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>

Also in 2008, Epica recorded ''[[The Classical Conspiracy]]'', their first [[live album]]. The live show took place in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]] on June 14, 2008, in the framework of the [[Miskolc Opera Festival]] (where [[Therion (band)|Therion]] did a similar show a year before). It included a 40-piece orchestra and a 30-piece choir, and the setlist contained not only the band's songs but also covers of classical pieces of [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and of [[soundtrack]]s of the movies [[Star Wars]], [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]] and [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]. It was released on May 8, 2009 through [[Nuclear Blast Records]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Epica To Release 'The Classical Conspiracy' Double Live Album|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116011|date=2009-03-12|access-date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406023813/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116011|archive-date=2009-04-06}}</ref>

On March 4, 2009, Epica announced their return to the studio where they would begin the recording process for a new album. In April 2009, it was revealed that the new album's title would be ''[[Design Your Universe]]''. It continued the [[A New Age Dawns]] saga which started on [[Consign to Oblivion]]. The album was released on October 16, 2009. To promote this release, they performed in Amsterdam at Paradiso on October 10, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfan.nl/concertreviews.php?id=470|title=Metalfan.nl Concertreview: Epica en Kingfisher Sky in Amsterdam|date=2009-10-11|website=Metalfan.nl}}</ref> This is the first Epica album to feature Isaac Delahaye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/77281/epica|title=Epica: New Album Title Revealed?|access-date=2009-04-26|date=2009-04-20|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> The record also contains a guest appearance from [[Sonata Arctica]] vocalist [[Tony Kakko]] on the song "White Waters".

Several dates in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, were sold out. The band also did a South American Tour, performing in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Uruguay]].

===''Requiem for the Indifferent'' and ''Retrospect'' (2011–2013)===
In an interview in November 2010, Simone stated that the band was going to start writing music around February 2011 after their Latin American tour is over. She also stated that they were hoping for a release in the first quarter of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epica: New Album Release Party Announced|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=161389|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912002625/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=161389|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-12|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2011-07-31|access-date=2011-08-18}}</ref> 14 tracks were written without lyrics by May 2011. The band entered the studio later that year, with Sascha Paeth once again as the producer.

Epica uses a "trademark of many symphonic and gothic metal bands" in contrasting "two extremes, death grunts and brutality on one side, airy female melodiousness on the other."<ref name="Fox"/> Eduardo Rivadavia of [[AllMusic]] notes that the band's "attraction ultimately hinges on exploring the sonic contrasts of light and dark; the punishing intensity of those elephantine guitar riffs and hyperactive drumming cast against the soaring, layered sweetness of the orchestrated strings and keyboards."<ref>{{cite web |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |title=''Divine Conspiracy'' Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1183427|pure_url=yes}} |website=AllMusic|access-date=March 30, 2008}}</ref> Simone Simons delivers classical (operatic) vocals in a mezzo-soprano range,<ref name="AMG Consign"/> she's begun to sing in a more modern style with belted vocals too (Rock/Pop, as she described it with the release of Consign to Oblivion on an interview) over time, and she has also been known to sometimes sing "with a clear alto voice that has a flawless tone and a lot of emotion."<ref name="Chad"/> But, subsequently, Simone admitted that she was wrong and that she's not a mezzo-soprano, but a [[soprano]].<ref name="Epica - Live Fan Q&A Interview 2014">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Td1NK_fi6M| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/5Td1NK_fi6M?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Td1NK_fi6M| archive-date=2021-09-24|title=Simone confirms to be a soprano|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>  Mark Jansen delivers [[death growls]] "that are secondary to Simons' singing, but very important in terms of balance and variety."<ref name="Chad"/> The group is also known to employ human choirs and orchestras<ref name="AMG Consign"/> with additional embellishments such as spoken word recitals and lyrics in Latin and Arabic.<ref name="AMG Phantom"/>
