In 2008, Chairlift released their debut album ''[[Does You Inspire You]]''. Pfenning left the band in 2010, and as a duo, Polachek and Wimberly released two more albums: 2012's ''[[Something (Chairlift album)|Something]]'' and 2016's ''[[Moth (album)|Moth]]'' before announcing the end of Chairlift in December 2016.
