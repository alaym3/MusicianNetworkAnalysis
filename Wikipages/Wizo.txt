'''Wizo''' ({{IPA-de|ˈviːzo}}) is a German [[punk rock]] band from [[Sindelfingen]], that formed in 1985. Their messages run from political to humorous; the band espouses [[left-wing politics]] and describes themselves as "against [[Nazism|Nazis]], [[racism|racists]], [[sexism|sexists]], and other assholes!"<ref name=kleine>{{cite news |last=Heigl |first=Raimund |date=3 December 2014 |title=Für Wizo ist Punk nicht nur Musik |url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/weiz/4609991/WeizKonzert_Fuer-Wizo-ist-Punk-nicht-nur-Musik |work=[[Kleine Zeitung]] |access-date=28 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228151858/http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/weiz/4609991/WeizKonzert_Fuer-Wizo-ist-Punk-nicht-nur-Musik |archivedate=28 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The band split up in March 2005<ref name=english>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Wizo - English |url=http://www.wizo.de/english.htm |archivedate=5 February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205142538/http://www.wizo.de/english.htm |work=Wizo.de |date=November 2004 |access-date=28 December 2017 }}</ref> and reunited in November 2009.<ref name=reunion>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizo.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121022825/http://wizo.de:80/ |archivedate=21 November 2009 |via=wizo.de |title=wizo kommt zurück! |trans-title=wizo is coming back! |accessdate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> Wizo's music is characterised by a combination of humorous and political lyrics with a fast, melodic punk rock sound. Wizo is considered part of the German movement known as "[[Punk pathetique|Fun-Punk]]".

==History==
Jochen Bix founded the band "Wieso" (meaning "why?") with friends in Sindelfingen, a town in the vicinity of [[Stuttgart]]. In 1986, they altered their name to "Wizo" and got their first gig in 1987. In 1988, Wizo released their first demo tape, followed by a second in 1990. Jochen only sang a few songs, including the [[Judas Priest]] cover, "[[Breaking the Law]]". He then left and Axel Kurth became the front man.

Later that year, Wizo founded their own label, {{ill|Hulk Räckorz|de}} and released the ''Klebstoff'' ("Glue") EP, their first [[vinyl record]].

In 1991, ''[[für'n Arsch]]'' ("In vain", lit. "for the ass") was released. The band also gained attention for an illegal public performance on a truck outside of a courthouse while [[Manfred Krug]], a TV celebrity, was on trial for a [[road rage]] incident.<ref name=sterne>{{cite news |last=von York |first=Thomas |date=14 October 1991 |title=Sterne, dann schwarzer Vorhang |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13491484.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213649/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13491484.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=28 December 2017 }}</ref>

In 1992, their first CD, ''Bleib Tapfer'' ("Stay Brave") was released. On the first anniversary of German pop-star [[Gerd Höllerich|Roy Black]]'s death, Wizo released the single "Roy Black ist tot" ("Roy Black Is Dead") as a dubious tribute. The tribute in question was a [[punk cover]] of a children's song with the lyrics altered to a German version of "Roy Black is dead, Roy Black is dead." It was named the worst CD of the year by the ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'', a major German [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]].<ref name=löschen />

[[File:WIZO-2010-02 studio.jpg|thumb|right|Wizo in 2010]]
In 1994, their next CD, ''Uuaarrgh!'' (onomatopoeic, like a big "ouch", as in comics) was released, which sold 100,000 copies.<ref name=laut>{{cite web |url=http://www.laut.de/Wizo |title=Wizo - Laut.de |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=[[laut.de]] |access-date=28 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827221105/http://www.laut.de/Wizo |archivedate=27 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=kleine /> Later that year, due to the "glorification of violence" and "illegal anti-state statements" present in the song "Kein Gerede" ("No idle talk"), the album ''Bleib Tapfer'' was indexed<ref name=löschen /> by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] and was only available to be sold to adults through very restricted channels.<ref name=laut />

Wizo performed at the [[Chaos Days]] in 1994.

In 1995, Wizo released ''[[Herrenhandtasche]]'' ("Man purse") and performed on the [[Warped Tour]]. Later that year, the band opened for [[Die Ärzte]].<ref name=löschen />

In 1996, Wizo's lineup changed; Ingo Hahn replaced their long-standing drummer, Charly Zasko, and he and Axel "are fortunately no longer in contact." With Ingo, "Doof wie Scheiße" ("Dumb as Shit") was also recorded.

In 1997, the band released ''Weihnachten stinkt!'' ("Christmas stinks!"), a split EP with the Japanese punk band [[Hi-Standard]]. The band also received a criminal complaint from [[Wilhelm Gegenfurtner]], the [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Regensburg]] over their depiction of a crucified pig on their album ''Uuaarrgh!'' and on t-shirts, which he claimed violated Germany's [[blasphemy law#Germany|blasphemy law]], §166 [[Strafgesetzbuch|StGB]] for "Defamation of religious denominations, religious societies and World view associations".<ref name=schweinewahnsinn>{{cite web |url=http://www.punkrock.de/ladnak.html |title=Schweinewahnsinn - der Skandal um's T-Shirt: Zusammenstellung von Presseberichten zur Klage des Vikars |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=punkrock.de |publisher=Hulk Räckorz |access-date=28 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222174005/http://www.punkrock.de/ladnak.html |archivedate=22 December 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> The band offered to stop selling the T-Shirt if the Catholic Church put a sign on the ''[[Judensau]]'', an anti-semitic carving on the [[Regensburg Cathedral]] dating to 1330.<ref name=schweinewahnsinn /> The artwork is censored from later pressings of the album with a reference to a court decision.<ref name=löschen />

In 1998, WIZO released ''Kraut & Rüben EP'' ("Cabbage and Carrots", also "higgledy piggledy") on the label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], containing the songs that were already popular in Germany, but unknown to the rest of the world. That year, Herr Guhl replaced Ingo as drummer.

[[File:Wizo USB Stick.jpg|thumb|The ''Stick EP'', released in 2004, was the first album released on a USB stick.]]
In September 2004, WIZO made a first in the music industry by releasing a single on [[USB flash drive]], titled as the ''Stick EP''. In addition to five high [[bitrate]] MP3s, it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and [[Guitar tab|tabs]].<ref name=löschen>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/vorbespielter-usb-stick-musik-zum-loeschen-a-321682.html |title= Vorbespielter USB-Stick: Musik zum Löschen |last1=Patalong |first1=Frank |date=6 October 2004 |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=26 June 2014 |language=de}}</ref>

In November 2004, coinciding with the release of their album ''[[Anderster]]'' (lit. "differenter"), Wizo announced their intent to dissolve in March 2005, upon the conclusion of a farewell tour.

In November 2009, they announced a new album and a tour for 2010 on their official Homepage.<ref name=reunion />

Wizo released the album ''Punk gibt's nicht umsonst (Teil III)'' on 13 June 2014. In 2016, their album ''Der'' was released.

==Lineup==
For most of their history, the band has performed as a [[power trio]].
