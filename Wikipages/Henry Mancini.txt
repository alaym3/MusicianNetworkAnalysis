'''Henry Nicola Mancini''' (born '''Enrico Nicola Mancini'''; April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994)<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> was an American composer, conductor, arranger, pianist and flautist. Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film,<ref name="Fox2010">{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Charles |title=Killing Me Softly: My Life in Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwxijXxRtRAC&pg=PA150 |date=August 27, 2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6992-9 |page=150}}</ref><ref name="Akins2013">{{cite book |last=Akins |first=Thomas N. |title=Behind the Copper Fence: A Lifetime on Timpani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMgCvCuGH8kC&pg=RA1-PA14 |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=First Edition Design Pub. |isbn=978-1-62287-368-5 |page=1}}</ref> he won four [[Academy Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], and twenty [[Grammy Awards]], plus a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1995.

His works include the [[Peter Gunn (song)|theme]] and soundtrack for the [[Peter Gunn|''Peter Gunn'' television series]] as well as the music for ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' film series ("[[The Pink Panther Theme]]") and "[[Moon River]]" from ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. ''[[The Music from Peter Gunn]]'' won the inaugural [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. Mancini enjoyed a long collaboration composing film scores for the film director [[Blake Edwards]].  Mancini also scored a No. 1 hit single during the [[rock and roll|rock]] era on the [[Hot 100]]:  his arrangement and recording of the "[[Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet|Love Theme from ''Romeo and Juliet'']]" spent two weeks at the top, starting with the week ending June 28, 1969.

==Early life==
Henry Mancini was born Enrico Nicola Mancini in the [[Little Italy, Cleveland|Little Italy]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland]] and raised in [[Aliquippa, Pennsylvania|West Aliquippa, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-music-entertainment/2014/sonylegacy-recordings-launch-yearlong-celebration-of-henry-mancini-with-50th-anniversary-limited-edition-of-the-pink-panther-soundtrack-album-pressed-on-12-pink-vinyl-for-record-store-day-2014.html|title= Sony/Legacy Recordings Launch Year-Long Celebration of Henry Mancini with 50th Anniversary Limited Edition of The Pink Panther Soundtrack Album, Pressed on 12" PINK VINYL for Record Store Day 2014|publisher=Sony Music Entertainment|date=April 16, 2014|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=pabook>{{cite web|url=https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/Mancini__Henry|title=Henry Mancini|publisher=Pennsylvania Center for the Book, Penn State University|access-date=June 7, 2019|date=2005|last=Klemick|first=Valerie Anne}}</ref> Both his parents were Italian immigrants. Originally from [[Scanno, Abruzzo]], his father Quintiliano "Quinto" Mancini was a laborer at the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] and amateur musician who first came to the U.S. as a teenager around 1910.{{sfnp|Caps|2012|p=5}}<ref name=Scanno>{{cite web|url=https://italoamericano.org/story/2018-9-7/scanno|title=Mystical allure of scenic Scanno |last=Radaelli|first=Marielle|work=L'Italo-Americano|date=September 7, 2018|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref> His mother Anna (née Pece) came to the U.S. from [[Forli del Sannio]] as an infant.{{sfnp|Caps|2012|p=5}}

He later studied piano and orchestral arrangement under Pittsburgh concert pianist and Stanley Theatre (now [[Benedum Center]]) conductor Max Adkins. Not only did Mancini produce arrangements for the Stanley Theatre bands, but he also wrote one for [[Benny Goodman]], an up-and-coming bandleader introduced to him by Adkins.<ref name=pabook />{{sfnb|Caps|2012|pp=9-10}} According to Mancini biographer John Caps, the young Mancini "preferred music arranging to any kind of musical performance, but taking apart a [[Chopin]] [[mazurka]] or [[Schumann]] [[sonata]] in order to play it helped him see...how the puzzle of form, meter, melody, harmony, and counterpoint had been solved by previous composers."{{sfnb|Caps|2012|p=9}}

After graduating from [[Aliquippa Senior High School|Aliquippa High School]] in 1942, Mancini first attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) in Pittsburgh.<ref name=Oliver>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-henry-mancini-19940615-20160609-snap-htmlstory.html|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Henry Mancini, Composer of Elegant Music, Dies|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 15, 1994|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Mancini|title=Enrico Mancini|date=April 12, 2019|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref> Later that year, Mancini transferred to the [[Juilliard School of Music]] in New York City following a successful audition in which he performed a [[Beethoven]] sonata and improvisation on "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" by [[Cole Porter]].{{sfnb|Caps|2012|pp=10-11}}<ref name=pabook /> Because he could only take orchestration and composition courses in his second year, Mancini studied only piano in his first year at Juilliard, in a condition Caps called "aimless and oppressed—a far cry from Adkins's enabling protective environment."{{sfnb|Caps|2012|p=10}}

After turning 18, Mancini enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in 1943. While in [[basic training]] in [[Atlantic City Training Center|Atlantic City, New Jersey]], he met musicians being recruited by [[Glenn Miller]]. Owing to a recommendation by Miller, Mancini was first assigned to the 28th Air Force Band before being reassigned overseas to the 1306th Engineers Brigade in France. In 1945, he helped liberate the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in Austria.{{sfnb|Caps|2012|pp=10-11}}

==Career==
Newly discharged, Mancini entered the music industry. In 1946, he became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]], led by 'Everyman' [[Tex Beneke]]. After World War II, Mancini broadened his skills in composition, counterpoint, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers [[Ernst Krenek]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]].{{sfnp|Mancini|Lees|2001|p=51}}

In 1952, Mancini joined the [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]]'s music department. During the next six years, he contributed music to over 100 movies, most notably ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'', ''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]'', ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', ''[[This Island Earth]]'', ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (for which he received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination), ''The Benny Goodman Story'' and [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]''. During this time, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by [[Guy Lombardo]] and His Royal Canadians titled ''I Won't Let You Out of My Heart''.

Mancini left Universal-International to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon afterward, he scored the television series ''[[Peter Gunn]]''<ref name=pc23/> for writer/producer [[Blake Edwards]]. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years. Along with [[Alex North]], [[Elmer Bernstein]], [[Leith Stevens]] and [[Johnny Mandel]], Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini's scores for Blake Edwards included ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (with the standard "[[Moon River]]")<ref name=pc23/> and ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (with the title song, "[[Days of Wine and Roses (song)|Days of Wine and Roses]]"), as well as ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (and all of its sequels), ''[[The Great Race]]'', ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'', ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (including "It's Easy to Say") and ''[[Victor Victoria]]''. Another director with whom Mancini had a longstanding partnership was [[Stanley Donen]] (''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', ''[[Arabesque (1966 film)|Arabesque]]'', ''[[Two for the Road (1967 film)|Two for the Road]]''). Mancini also composed for [[Howard Hawks]] (''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'', ''[[Hatari!]]'' – which included the "[[Baby Elephant Walk]]"), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[The Molly Maguires (film)|The Molly Maguires]]''), [[Vittorio de Sica]] (''[[Sunflower (1970 film)|Sunflower]]''), [[Norman Jewison]] (''[[Gaily, Gaily]]''), [[Paul Newman]] (''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (film)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'', ''[[The Glass Menagerie (1987 film)|The Glass Menagerie]])'', [[Stanley Kramer]] (''[[Oklahoma Crude (film)|Oklahoma Crude]]''), [[George Roy Hill]] (''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]''), [[Arthur Hiller]] (''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]''),{{sfnp|Mancini|Lees|2001|p=239}} [[Ted Kotcheff]] (''[[Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?]]''), and others. Mancini's score for the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) in Bachian organ andante, for organ and an orchestra of strings was rejected and replaced by [[Ron Goodwin]]'s work.

Mancini scored many TV movies, including ''[[The Moneychangers]]'', ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' and ''[[The Shadow Box]]''. He wrote many television themes, including ''[[Mr. Lucky (TV series)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (starring [[John Vivyan]] and [[Ross Martin]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-from-mr-lucky-mw0000653135 |title=Henry Mancini: Music from Mr. Lucky |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'',{{sfnp|Mancini|Lees|2001|p=240}} ''[[Tic Tac Dough]]'' (1990 version),<ref>{{cite book |last=Terrace |first=Vincent |title=Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937–2012 |year=2013 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-7864-7445-5 |page=380}}</ref> ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'', and ''[[What's Happening!!]]''  In the 1984–85 television season, four series featured original Mancini themes:  ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Remington Steele]]'', and ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not]]''. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.{{sfnp|Mancini|Lees|2001|p=240}} Mancini composed the theme for ''NBC Nightly News'' used beginning in 1975, and a different theme by him, titled ''Salute to the President'' was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992.  ''Salute to the President'' was published only in a school-band arrangement, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours.

Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the [[easy listening]] genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Mancini's style symbolized the bright, confident, hospitable voice of bourgeois, inspired by the idealistic Kennedy-era of the 1960s.{{sfn|Caps|2012}} Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include [[Andy Williams]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Anita Bryant]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Perry Como]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Eydie Gorme]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Trini Lopez]], [[George Maharis]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Jerry Vale]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[The Lennon Sisters]], [[The Lettermen]], [[Herb Alpert]], [[Eddie Cano]], [[Frank Chacksfield]], [[Warren Covington]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Shelly Manne]], [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]], [[Percy Faith]], [[Ferrante & Teicher]], [[Horst Jankowski]], [[Andre Kostelanetz]], [[Peter Nero]], [[Liberace]], [[Mantovani]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Julie London]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Arthur Fiedler]], Secret Agent and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]],  [[Peggy Lee]], and [[Matt Monro]]. The [[Anita Kerr]] Quartet won a Grammy award (1965) for their album ''We Dig Mancini'', a cover of his songs. [[Lawrence Welk]] held Mancini in very high regard, and frequently featured Mancini's music on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' (Mancini made at least two guest appearances on the show). Mancini briefly hosted his own musical variety TV show in a similar format to Welk's, ''The Mancini Generation'', which aired in syndication during the 1972–73 season.{{sfnp|Caps|2012|page=149}}

Mancini recorded over 90 albums, in styles ranging from [[big band]] to light classical to [[popular music|pop]]. Eight of these albums were certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. He had a 20-year contract with [[RCA Victor]], resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music. Mancini's earliest recordings in the 1950s and early 1960s were of the jazz idiom; with the success of ''Peter Gunn'', ''Mr. Lucky'', and ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', Mancini shifted to recording primarily his own music in record albums and film soundtracks. (Relatively little of his music was written for recordings compared to the amount that was written for film and television.) Beginning with his 1969 hit arrangement of Nino Rota's ''A Time for Us'' (as his only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 entry, the No. 1 hit "Love Theme from [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|''Romeo and Juliet'']]") and its accompanying album ''A Warm Shade of Ivory'', Mancini began to function more as a piano soloist and easy-listening artist recording music primarily written by other people. In this period, for two of his best-selling albums he was joined by trumpet virtuoso and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' bandleader [[Doc Severinsen]].

Among Mancini's orchestral scores are (''Lifeforce'', ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', ''Sunflower'', ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie'', ''Molly Maguires'', ''[[The Hawaiians (film)|The Hawaiians]]''), and darker themes (''Experiment in Terror'', ''The White Dawn'', ''Wait Until Dark'', ''The Night Visitor'').

Mancini was also a concert performer, conducting over fifty engagements per year, resulting in over 600 symphony performances during his lifetime. He conducted nearly all of the leading symphony orchestras of the world, including the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Israel Philharmonic]], the [[Boston Pops]], the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. One of his favorites was the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], where he debuted the ''Thorn Birds Suite'' in June 1983. He appeared in 1966, 1980 and 1984 in command performances for the [[British Royal Family]]. He also toured several times with Johnny Mathis and also with Andy Williams, who had both sung many of Mancini's songs; Mathis and Mancini collaborated on the 1986 album ''The Hollywood Musicals''. In 1987 he conducted an impromptu charity concert in London in aid of [[Children In Need]]. The concert included [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' with firework accompaniment over the [[River Thames]].

===Cameos===
Shortly before his death in 1994, he made a one-off cameo appearance in the first season of the sitcom series ''[[Frasier]]'', as a call-in patient to Dr. Frasier Crane's radio show. Mancini voiced the character Al, who speaks with a melancholy drawl and hates the sound of his own voice, in the episode "Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.destinyland.org/Secret-Henry-Mancini-Cameo-on-Frasier.htm |title=Henry Mancini's cameo on Frasier |website=Destiny-land.org |access-date=September 16, 2008}}</ref> Moments after Mancini's cameo ends, Frasier's radio broadcast plays "Moon River".

Mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 movie ''[[Gunn (film)|Gunn]]'', the movie version of the series ''Peter Gunn'', the score of which he had composed.

In the 1966 Pink Panther cartoon ''[[Pink, Plunk, Plink]]'', the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct Mancini's theme for the series. At the end, the shot switched to rare live action, and Mancini was seen alone applauding in the audience. Mancini also made a brief appearance in the title sequence of 1993's ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'', allowing the panther to conduct [[Bobby McFerrin]] in performing the film's theme tune.

==Death and legacy==
Mancini died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in Los Angeles on June 14, 1994.<ref name="Severo" /> He was working at the time on the Broadway stage version of [[Victor/Victoria (musical)|Victor/Victoria]], which he never saw on stage. Mancini was survived by his wife of 43 years, singer Virginia "Ginny" O'Connor, with whom he had three children.

===Soundtracks===

Note: Most of Mancini's scores were not released on LP soundtrack albums. His TV movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled "Music from ..." or "Music from the Motion Picture ..." He routinely retained the rights to his music. Mancini's contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater.  Actual film scores using players from Hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release on LP (ex: the soundtrack for ''Our Man Flint'' (not a Mancini score) cost $1 more than other LP albums of the day).  Many soundtrack albums used to claim "Original Soundtrack" or words to that effect, but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings. These albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring (ex: Dimitri Tiomkin's score to ''The Alamo''). However, many Hollywood musicians were featured on Mancini's albums recorded in RCA's Hollywood recording studios and faux "Original Soundtrack" albums. Eventually some of his scores and faux "Original Soundtrack" scores by numerous composers were released in limited edition CDs.
