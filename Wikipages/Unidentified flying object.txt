An '''unidentified flying object''' ('''UFO''') is any perceived aerial phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified or explained. On investigation, most UFOs are [[Identification studies of UFOs|identified]] as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained. 

Scientists and skeptic organizations such as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] have provided prosaic explanations for a large number of claimed UFOs being caused by natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes. Small but vocal groups of "[[ufologists]]" favour unconventional, [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] hypotheses, some of which go beyond the typical extraterrestrial visitation claims and sometimes form part of [[UFO religion|new religions]].

While unusual sightings have been reported in the sky throughout history, UFOs did not achieve their current cultural prominence until the period after [[World War II]], escalating during the [[Space Age]]. The 20th century saw studies and investigations into UFO reports conducted by governments (such as Projects [[Project Grudge|Grudge]] and [[Project Sign|Sign]] in the United States, and [[Project Condign]] in the United Kingdom), as well as by organisations and individuals.

==History==
===Early history before the 20th century===
[[File:Himmelserscheinung über Nürnberg vom 14. April 1561.jpg|thumb|The [[1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg]] as printed in an illustrated news notice. UFO enthusiasts have described the phenomenon as an aerial battle of extraterrestrial origin. Skeptics find the phenomenon likely to have been a [[sun dog]]]]
People have observed the sky throughout history, and sometimes seen unusual sights: such as [[comet]]s, bright [[meteors]], one or more of the [[Classical planet|five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye]], [[Conjunction (astronomy)|planetary conjunctions]], and atmospheric [[Optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] such as [[sun dog|parhelia]] and [[lenticular cloud]]s. One particularly famous example is [[Halley's Comet]]: this was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. As it reaches the inner solar system every 76 years, it was often identified as a unique isolated event in ancient historical documents whose authors were unaware that it was a repeating phenomenon. Such accounts in history often were treated as [[supernatural]] portents, [[angel]]s, or other religious [[omen]]s.<ref>Rev. Ed. [https://www.unity.org/resources/bible-interpretation/ezekiel-14-extraterrestrial-encounter Ezekiel 1:4: Extraterrestrial Encounter?] Unity Accessed 4 June 2021.</ref> While UFO enthusiasts have sometimes commented on the narrative similarities between certain religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/16589 |title=Do UFOs Exist in the History of Arts? |last=Giordano |first=Daniela |date=November 13, 2006 |work=American Chronicle |publisher=Ultio, LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819213933/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/16589 |archive-date=2012-08-19 |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref> the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cuoghi |first=Diego |date=2004 |title=The Art of Imagining UFOs |journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]] |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol11n01.html |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>

Some examples of pre-modern observations of unusual aerial phenomena:

* [[Julius Obsequens]] was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer who is believed to have lived in the middle of the fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the ''Liber de prodigiis'' (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by [[Livy]]; ''De prodigiis'' was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in [[Rome]] between 249 and 12 BCE. An aspect of Obsequens' work that has inspired excitement in some UFO enthusiasts is that he makes reference to things moving through the sky. It is possible that it is a description of meteors, and, since Obsequens is writing some 400 years after the events he describes, the text is not an eye-witness account.<ref>Julio Obsecuente, ''Libro de los Prodigios (restituido a su integridad, en beneficio de la Historia, por Conrado Licóstenes)'', ed. Ana Moure Casas (Madrid: Ediciones Clásicas, 1990)</ref><ref>Giulio Ossequente, ''Il Libro dei prodigi'', ed. Solas Boncompagni (Rome: Edizioni Mediterranee, 1992)</ref>
* On [[1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg|April 14, 1561]], residents of Nuremberg described the appearance of a large black triangular object. According to witnesses, there were also hundreds of spheres, cylinders and other odd-shaped objects that moved erratically overhead.<ref name="Vallee">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XINLC2ubHqwC&pg=PT71 | title=Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times | publisher=Tarcher |author1=Vallee, Jacques |author2=Aubeck, Chris | year=2010 | isbn=978-1585428205}}</ref> The accounts are consistent with [[Sun dog|sun dogs]] and other similar meteorological phenomena.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Frank Johnson|date=December 12, 2012|title=Nuremburg 1561 UFO "Battle" Debunked|url=http://ancientaliensdebunked.com/nuremburg-ufo-battle-debunked/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214172708/http://ancientaliensdebunked.com/nuremburg-ufo-battle-debunked/|archive-date=December 14, 2012|access-date=26 January 2017|website=Ancient Aliens Debunked}}</ref> A similar report comes from [[1566 celestial phenomenon over Basel|1566 over Basel]] and, indeed, in the 15th and 16th centuries, many leaflets wrote of "miracles" and "sky spectacles".
* On January 25, 1878, the ''[[Denison, Texas|Denison]] Daily News'' printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, had reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying "at wonderful speed". Martin, according to the newspaper account, said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word "saucer" in association with a UFO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/17732 |title=Before the Wright Brothers ...

Many signed [[affidavit]]s. Scores of people even reported talking to the pilots. Reports of strange ships and artificial lights in the sky were published in local newspapers for the next two decades culminating in a [[Mass psychogenic illness|mass panic]] in 1897 where some people feared that [[Thomas Edison]] had created an artificial star that could fly around the country. When asked his opinion of such reports, Edison said, "You can take it from me that it is a pure fake."<ref>[[#Keel 1996|Keel 1996]], pp. 29–31</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=New York Herald|date=April 12, 1897}}</ref>

===20th century and after===

In the Pacific and European theatres during [[World War II]], round, glowing fireballs known as "[[foo fighter]]s" were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. Some proposed Allied explanations at the time included [[St. Elmo's fire]], the planet [[Venus]], hallucinations from oxygen deprivation, or German secret weapons.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 15, 1945|title=Foo-Fighter|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775433,00.html|url-status=dead|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417042038/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775433,00.html|archive-date=April 17, 2008|access-date=2013-05-16}}</ref> In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Italy and Greece. The objects were referred to as "Russian hail" (and later as "[[ghost rockets]]") because it was thought the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] or [[V-2 rocket|V2]] [[rocket]]s. Most were identified as natural phenomena as meteors.<ref>[[#Swords & Powell|Swords & Powell 2012]], p. 63</ref>

The popular UFO craze by many accounts began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947 that a civilian pilot named [[Kenneth Arnold]] reported seeing nine objects flying in formation near [[Mount Rainier]] in the United States. At the time, he claimed he described the objects flying in a saucer-like fashion, leading to newspaper accounts of "flying saucers" and "flying discs".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Garber|first=Megan|title=The Man Who Introduced the World to Flying Saucers|newspaper=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-man-who-introduced-the-world-to-flying-saucers/372732/|access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Saturday Night Uforia Audioplex: Edward R.

The story received scant attention at the time, but interest in it revived in the 1990s with the publicity surrounding the television broadcast of an ''[[Alien autopsy]]'' video marketed as "real footage" but later admitted to be a staged "re-enactment". Various UFO claimants said that they had interacted with the aliens driving the spacecraft and a few said they had visited the crafts themselves. In 1961, the first [[alien abduction]] account was sensationalized when [[Barney and Betty Hill]] went under [[hypnosis]] after seeing a UFO and reported [[Recovered-memory therapy|recovered memories]] of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by.

As media accounts and speculation were running rampant in the US, by 1953 intelligence officials ([[Robertson Panel]]) worried that "genuine incursions" by enemy aircraft "over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination" of UFO reports.<ref name="Lewis-Kraus-30-4-21">{{cite magazine|last1=Lewis-Kraus|first1=Gideon|date=30 April  2021|title=How the Pentagon Started Taking U.F.O.s Seriously|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously|magazine=The New Yorker magazine}}</ref> Media were enlisted to help debunk and discourage UFO reports, culminating in a 1966 TV special, “UFO: Friend, Foe or Fantasy?”, in which [[Walter Cronkite]] "patiently" explained to viewers that UFOs were fantasy.<ref name="Lewis-Kraus-30-4-21" /> Cronkite enlisted [[Carl Sagan]] and [[J.

A 1969 National Academy of Sciences panel reviewed the [[Condon Report]] and concurred with its finding, observing that, “While further study of particular aspects of the topic (e.g., atmospheric phenomena) may be useful, a study of UFOs in general is not a promising way to expand scientific understanding of the phenomena.” Referencing the panel's conclusions, the Pentagon announced that it would no longer investigate UFO reports. According to [[Keith Kloor]], the "allure of flying saucers" remained popular with the public into the 1970s, spurring production of such sci-fi films, as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Alien]]'', which "continued to stoke public fascination". Kloor writes that by the late 1990s, "other big UFO subthemes had been prominently introduced into pop culture, such as the abduction phenomenon and [[Conspiracy theory|government conspiracy narrative]], via best-selling books and, of course, ''[[The X-Files]]''".<ref name="Kloor1" /> 
====Notable cases, incidents====
=====Britain=====
* The [[Rendlesham Forest incident]] was a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk, England in late December of 1980 which became linked with claims of UFO landings.

=====France=====

The most notable cases of UFO sightings in France include:
*the [[Valensole UFO incident]] in 1965.
*the [[Trans-en-Provence Case]] in 1981.

=====United States=====

* In the [[Kecksburg UFO incident]], Pennsylvania (1965), residents reported seeing an object crash in the area. 
* In 1975, [[Travis Walton (UFO witness)|Travis Walton]] claimed to be abducted by aliens. The movie ''[[Fire in the Sky]]'' (1993) was based on this event, but greatly embellished the original account.
* The "[[Phoenix Lights]]" on March 13, 1997

====Astronomer reports====

The USAF's Project Blue Book files indicate that approximately 1% of all unknown reports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cufos.org/BB_Unknowns.html |title=Comprehensive Catalog of 1,600 Project BLUE BOOK UFO Unknowns |date=October 2, 2009 |editor-last=Sparks |editor-first=Brad |website=CUFOS.org |publisher=Center for UFO Studies |location=Chicago |access-date=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630035534/http://www.cufos.org/BB_Unknowns.html |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> came from amateur and professional astronomers or other telescope users (such as missile trackers or surveyors). In 1952, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, then a consultant to Blue Book, conducted a small survey of 45 fellow professional astronomers. Five reported UFO sightings (about 11%). In the 1970s, astrophysicist [[Peter A. Sturrock]] conducted two large surveys of the AIAA and [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS). About 5% of the members polled indicated that they had had UFO sightings.

Astronomer [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who saw six UFOs, including three green fireballs, supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs and said scientists who dismissed it without study were "unscientific". Another astronomer, [[Lincoln LaPaz]], headed the United States Air Force's investigation into green fireballs and other UFO phenomena in New Mexico. LaPaz reported two personal sightings, of a green fireball and a disc. (Both Tombaugh and LaPaz were part of Hynek's 1952 survey.) Hynek took two photos through the window of a commercial airliner of a disc that seemed to keep pace with his aircraft.<ref>[[#Hynek 1972|Hynek 1972]], p. 52</ref>

Astronomer [[Andrew Fraknoi]] rejected the hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft and responded to the "onslaught of credulous coverage" in books, films and entertainment by teaching his students to apply critical thinking to such claims, advising them that "being a good scientist is not unlike being a good detective". According to Fraknoi, UFO reports "might at first seem mysterious", but "the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye".<ref name=Fraknoi>[[Andrew Fraknoi]], [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2010ASPC..431..514F|‘’Science Education and Outreach: Forging a Path to the Future’’]. Proceedings of a conference held September 12–16, 2009 in Millbrae, California, USA. Edited by Jonathan Barnes, Denise A. Smith, Michael G. Gibbs, and James G. Manning., p.514, August 2010</ref>

In a 1980 survey of 1800 members of amateur astronomer associations by Gert Helb and Hynek for CUFOS, 24% responded "yes" to the question "Have you ever observed an object which resisted your most exhaustive efforts at identification?"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herb |first1=Gert |last2=Hynek |first2=J.

====Famous hoaxes====

{{Main|List of UFO-related hoaxes}}
* The [[Maury Island incident]]
* [[George Adamski]], over the space of two decades, made various claims about his meetings with telepathic aliens from nearby planets. He claimed photographs of the [[far side of the Moon]] taken by the Soviet lunar probe [[Luna 3]] in 1959 were fake, and that there were cities, trees and snow-capped mountains on the far side of the Moon. Among copycats was a shadowy British figure named [[Cedric Allingham]].
* Ed Walters, a building contractor, in 1987 allegedly perpetrated a hoax in [[Gulf Breeze, Florida]]. Walters claimed at first having seen a small UFO flying near his home and took some photographs of the craft. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings over a period of three weeks and took several photographs. These sightings became famous, and are collectively referred to as the [[Gulf Breeze UFO incident]]. Three years later, in 1990, after the Walters family had moved, the new residents discovered a model of a UFO poorly hidden in the attic that bore an undeniable resemblance to the craft in Walters' photographs. Most investigators, like the forensic photo expert William G. Hyzer,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Posner |first=Gary P. |date=July 1992 |title=The Gulf Breeze 'UFOs' |journal=Tampa Bay Sounding |publisher=Tampa Bay Mensa |location=Seminole, FL |access-date=2013-07-13 |url=http://www.gpposner.com/Gulf_Breeze.html}}</ref> now consider the sightings to be a hoax.

==Terminology==

The term "UFO" (or "UFOB") was coined in 1953 by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to serve as a catch-all for all such reports. In its initial definition, the USAF stated that a "UFOB" was "any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object". Accordingly, the term was initially restricted to that fraction of cases which remained unidentified after investigation, as the USAF was interested in potential [[national security]] reasons and "technical aspects" (see [[s:Air Force Regulation 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting|Air Force Regulation 200-2]]).

During the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often referred to popularly as "[[flying saucer]]s" or "flying discs" due to the term being introduced in the context of the Kenneth Arnold incident. The [[Avro Canada]] [[Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar|VZ-9AV Avrocar]] was a concept vehicle produced during the 1950s, which was a functional aircraft with a saucer shape.<ref>{{cite web|date=9 October 2015|title=HOME > VISIT > MUSEUM EXHIBITS > FACT SHEETS > DISPLAY Avro Canada VZ-9AV Avrocar|url=https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/195801/avro-canada-vz-9av-avrocar/|work=www.nationalmuseum.af.mil [[United States Air Force]]|accessdate=22 June 2021}}</ref> UFOs were commonly referred to colloquially, as a "Bogey" by Western military personnel and pilots during the cold war. The term "bogey" was originally used to report anomalies in radar blips, to indicate possible hostile forces that might be roaming in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=what is a bogey|url=https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/bogie|access-date=2019-03-24|website=search security}}</ref>

The term UFO became more widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the [[Cold War]], an era associated with a heightened concerns about national security, and, more recently, in the 2010s, for unexplained reasons.<ref name="NYT-20170424">{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html |date=April 24, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=April 24, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="AMZ-20170324">{{cite book |last1=Costa |first1=Cheryl |last2=Costa |first2=Linda Miller |title=UFO Sightings Desk Reference: United States of America 2001-2015 |date=March 24, 2017 |isbn=978-1544219233 }}</ref> Nevertheless, various studies have concluded that the phenomenon does not represent a threat, and nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit (e.g., 1951 [[Flying Saucer Working Party]], 1953 [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Robertson Panel]], USAF [[Project Blue Book]], [[Condon Committee]]).

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines a UFO as "An unidentified flying object; a 'flying saucer'". The first published book to use the word was authored by [[Donald Keyhoe|Donald E. Keyhoe]].<ref name="Keyhoe1953">[[#Keyhoe 1953|Keyhoe 1953]]</ref>

As an acronym, "UFO" was coined by Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], who headed Project Blue Book, then the USAF's official investigation of UFOs. He wrote, "Obviously the term 'flying saucer' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced yoo-foe) for short."<ref>[[#Ruppelt|Ruppelt 1956]], Chapter 1: [http://www.nicap.org/rufo/rufo-01.htm "Project Blue Book and the UFO Story"]</ref> Other phrases that were used officially and that predate the UFO acronym include "flying flapjack", "flying disc", "unexplained flying discs", and "unidentifiable object".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%201%20of%2016/view |title=UFO Part 1 of 16 |work=The Vault |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1–20 |access-date=2013-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-922 |title=Unidentifiable objects, Williams Field; Chandler, Arizona |last=Aldrich |first=Lynn C. |date=July 14, 1947 |publisher=Project Blue Book Archive |type=Memorandum |id=NARA-PBB1-922 |access-date=2013-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928095640/http://www.bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-922 |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="AP-20130329">{{cite news |last=Contreras|first=Russell |title=FBI 'flying saucers' NM memo bureau's most viewed|url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20130329/DA5AVRAG0.html |date=March 29, 2013 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=2013-04-01}}</ref>

In popular usage, the term UFO came to be used to refer to claims of alien [[spacecraft]],<ref name="Keyhoe1953" /> and because of the public and media ridicule associated with the topic, some [[ufology|ufologists]] and investigators prefer to use terms such as "unidentified aerial phenomenon" (UAP) or "anomalous phenomena", as in the title of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narcap.org/newspage.htm |title=On The Radar |last=Roe |first=Ted |website=NARCAP.org |publisher= National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP) |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111914/http://www.narcap.org/newspage.htm |archive-date=2011-07-27 |access-date=2013-09-06}} See May 17, 2013, NARCAP.org news release: [https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=197024020359733&story_fbid=518978498164282 "'Aliens', 'Alien Spaceships' & Government Coverups"] on [[Facebook]].</ref> "Anomalous aerial vehicle" (AAV) or "unidentified aerial system" (UAS) are also sometimes used in a military aviation context to describe unidentified targets.<ref name="FighterSweep">[https://fightersweep.com/1460/x-files-edition/ 2015 FighterSweep.com account of the 2004 Nimitz UFO incident]</ref>

===Extraterrestrial hypothesis===

{{Main|Extraterrestrial hypothesis}}
While technically a ''UFO'' refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with [[alien spacecraft]];<ref>[[#Haines 1979|Haines 1979]], Chapter: "The Zeitgeist of the UFO Phenomenon" by Armando Simón</ref> however, the term ETV (ExtraTerrestrial Vehicle) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.<ref>{{Citation

==Investigations of reports==

UFOs have been subject to investigations over the years that varied widely in scope and scientific rigor. Governments or independent academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Peru, France, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Spain, and the [[Soviet Union]] are known to have investigated UFO reports at various times. No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.

Among the best known government studies are the ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946–1947), Project Blue Book, previously [[Project Sign]] and [[Project Grudge]], conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969, the secret U.S. Army/Air Force [[Green fireballs#Project Twinkle|Project Twinkle]] investigation into [[green fireballs]] (1948–1951), the secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ProjectBlueBookSpecialReport14 |title=Project Blue Book Special Report #14 |website=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher=[[United States Air Force]] |access-date=2013-09-07}}</ref> by the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], and the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s 1977 ''[[Operação Prato]]'' (Operation Saucer). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/[[GEIPAN]]) within its space agency [[CNES|Centre national d'études spatiales]] (CNES) since 1977; the [[Politics of Uruguay|government of Uruguay]] has had a similar investigation since 1989.

===Prosaic explanations===

{{Main|Identification studies of UFOs}}
[[File:Fata Morgana Example.jpg|[[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]], a type of mirage in which objects located ''below'' the astronomical [[horizon]] appear to be hovering in the sky just above the horizon, may be responsible for some UFO sightings.<ref name="Official UFO Investigations in France: the GEPAN/SEPRA Project">[[#Sturrock, et al. 1998|Sturrock, et al. 1998]], Appendix 4: "Electromagnetic-Wave Ducting" by V.

Studies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The most commonly found identified sources of UFO reports are:
* astronomical objects ([[List of brightest stars|bright stars]], [[Bolide|bolides]], [[Classical planet|bright planets]], and the [[Moon]])
* aircraft (including [[Military aircraft|military]], [[Civil aviation|civilian]], and [[Experimental aircraft|experimental]] aircraft as well as such peculiarities as [[aerial advertising]], [[missile]] and other [[Rocket launch|rocket launches]], [[Satellite|artificial satellites]], re-entering [[spacecraft]] including [[space debris]], [[kite]]s, and various [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aerial vehicles]] often popularly termed "drones")
* balloons ([[balloon#Decoration or entertainment|toy balloons]], [[weather balloon]]s, large [[research balloon]]s)
* other atmospheric objects and phenomena (birds, [[Lenticular cloud|unusual clouds]], [[flare]]s)
* light phenomena ([[mirage]]s, [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]], [[ball lightning]], [[moon dog]]s, [[searchlight]]s and other ground lights, etc.)
* psychological effects ([[pareidolia]], [[suggestibility]] and [[False memory|false memories]], [[Mass psychogenic illness|mass psychogenic disorders]], [[Optical illusion|optical illusions]], and [[hallucination]]s)
*hoaxes

A 1952–1955 [[Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14|study]] by the Battelle Memorial Institute for the USAF included these categories. An individual 1979 study by CUFOS researcher [[Allan Hendry]] found, as did other investigations, that fewer than one percent of cases he investigated were hoaxes and most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Hendry attributed most of these to inexperience or misperception.<ref>[[#Hendry|Hendry 1979]]</ref>

Thousands of documents released under [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] also indicate that many U.S. intelligence agencies collected (and still collect) information on UFOs. These agencies include the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), [[FBI]],<ref name="AP-20130329" /> CIA, [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), as well as military intelligence agencies of the Army and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], in addition to the Air Force.<ref group="note">Many of these documents are now online at the FOIA websites of these agencies such as the {{cite web |url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/ufo.htm |title=FBI FOIA site |access-date=2007-08-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524114748/http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/ufo.htm |archive-date=May 24, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}, as well as private websites such as [http://www.theblackvault.com/ The Black Vault], which has an archive of several thousand U.S. government UFO-related documents from the USAF, Army, CIA, DIA, DOD, and NSA.</ref>

The investigation of UFOs has also attracted many civilians, who in the U.S formed research groups such as NICAP (active 1956–1980), [[Aerial Phenomena Research Organization]] (APRO) (active 1952–1988), MUFON (active 1969–), and CUFOS (active 1973–).

On November 24, 2021, the Pentagon announced the formation of the ''Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group'', a new intelligence group to investigate unidentified objects that may compromise the airspace of the United States.<ref name="WP-20211124">{{cite news |last=Demirjian |first=Karoun |title=Pentagon will track unexplained airborne objects through new intelligence group |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/11/24/ufos-pentagon/ |date=24 November 2021 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=24 November 2021 }}</ref>

=====USAAF and FBI response to the 1947 sightings=====
{{Unbalanced section|date=November 2021}}
Following the large U.S. surge in sightings in June and early July 1947, on July 9, 1947, [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) intelligence, in cooperation with the FBI,<ref name="AP-20130329" /> began a formal investigation into selected sightings with characteristics that could not be immediately rationalized, such as Kenneth Arnold's. The USAAF used "all of its top scientists" to determine whether "such a phenomenon could, in fact, occur". The research was "being conducted with the thought that the flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon," or that "they might be a foreign body mechanically devised and controlled."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25706/25706.txt |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation FOIA Documents - Unidentified Flying Objects |website=[[Project Gutenberg]] |access-date=2013-09-07}} Internal FBI memo from E. G. Fitch to D. M. Ladd concerning a request by General George F. Schulgen, Chief of the Requirements Intelligence Branch of Army Air Corps Intelligence, for the FBI to help with their investigation of UFO reports.</ref> Three weeks later in a preliminary defense estimate, the air force investigation decided that, "This 'flying saucer' situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomenon. Something is really flying around."<ref>[[#Hall & Connors|Hall & Connors 1998]], p. 83</ref>

A further review by the intelligence and technical divisions of the [[Air Force Logistics Command|Air Materiel Command]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Field]] reached the same conclusion. It reported that "the phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious," and there were disc-shaped objects, metallic in appearance, as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by "extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability", general lack of noise, absence of a trail, occasional formation flying, and "evasive" behavior "when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar", suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.<ref group="note">The so-called [http://www.majesticdocuments.com/pdf/twiningopinionamc_23sept47.pdf Twining memo of Sept. 23, 1947], by future USAF Chief of Staff, General [[Nathan Farragut Twining|Nathan Twining]], specifically recommended intelligence cooperation with the Army, Navy, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], the Defense Department's Joint Research and Development Board, Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), Project [[RAND]], and the [[Nuclear aircraft|Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft]] (NEPA) project.</ref>

====== Projects Sign (1947–1949), Grudge (1948–1951), and Blue Book (1951–1970) ======
{{main|Project Sign|Project Grudge|Project Blue Book}}
Project Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft, there was not enough data to determine their origin.<ref name="Blum1990">Blum, Howard, Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials. Simon and Schuster, 1990</ref>

The Air Force's Project Sign was created at the end of 1947, and was one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate to that effect, but the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force Chief of Staff]] [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF's Project Blue Book.<ref>[[#Ruppelt|Ruppelt 1956]], Chapter 3: [http://www.nicap.org/rufo/rufo-03.htm "The Classics"]</ref>

Another highly classified U.S. study was conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) in the latter half of 1952 in response to orders from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read that "the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention&nbsp;... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles." The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/97unclass/ufo.html |title=CIA's Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947–90 |last=Haines |first=Gerald K. |date=1997 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |oclc=713270503 |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref>

Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge at the end of 1948. Angered by the low quality of investigations by Grudge, the Air Force Director of Intelligence reorganized it as Project Blue Book in late 1951, placing Ruppelt in charge. [[J. Allen Hynek]], a trained astronomer who served as a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, was initially skeptical of UFO reports, but eventually came to the conclusion that many of them could not be satisfactorily explained and was highly critical of what he described as "the cavalier disregard by Project Blue Book of the principles of scientific investigation".<ref>[[#Hynek 1972|Hynek 1972]], p. 76</ref> Leaving government work, he founded the privately funded [[Center for UFO Studies|CUFOS]], to whose work he devoted the rest of his life. Other private groups studying the phenomenon include the [[Mutual UFO Network|MUFON]], a grassroots organization whose investigator's handbooks go into great detail on the documentation of alleged UFO sightings.

====== USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) ======

[[s:Air Force Regulation 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting|Air Force Regulation 200-2]],<ref name="AFD-070703-004">{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070703-004.pdf |title=AFD-070703-004.pdf |work=Air Force Freedom of Information Act |publisher=United States Air Force |access-date=2013-09-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910051437/http://www.foia.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070703-004.pdf |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> issued in 1953 and 1954, defined an Unidentified Flying Object ("UFOB") as "any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object." The regulation also said UFOBs were to be investigated as a "possible threat to the security of the United States" and "to determine technical aspects involved." The regulation went on to say that "it is permissible to inform news media representatives on UFOB's when the object is positively identified as a familiar object" but added: "For those objects which are not explainable, only the fact that ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center] will analyze the data is worthy of release, due to many unknowns involved."<ref name="AFD-070703-004" />

===== Blue Book and the Condon Committee (1968–1970) =====
{{main|Condon Committee}}

A public research effort conducted by the Condon Committee for the USAF and published as the Condon Report arrived at a negative conclusion in 1968.<ref name="COMETA" /> Blue Book closed down in 1970, using the Condon Committee's negative conclusion as a rationale, thus ending official Air Force UFO investigations. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, along with later government documents, revealed that non-public [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] UFO investigations continued after 1970. The Bolender memo first stated that "reports of unidentified flying objects that could affect national security&nbsp;... are not part of the Blue Book system," indicating that more serious UFO incidents already were handled outside the public Blue Book investigation. The memo then added, "reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose."<ref group="note">For example, current USAF general reporting procedures are in [http://www.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/AFI10-206.pdf Air Force Instruction (AFI)10-206]. Section 5.7.3 (p. 64) lists sightings of "unidentified flying objects" and "aircraft of unconventional design" as separate categories from potentially hostile but conventional, unidentified aircraft, missiles, surface vessels, or submarines. Additionally, "unidentified objects" detected by missile warning systems, creating a potential risk of nuclear war, are covered by Rule 5E (p.35).</ref> In addition, in the late 1960s a chapter on UFOs in the Space Sciences course at the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] gave serious consideration to possible extraterrestrial origins. When word of the curriculum became public, the Air Force in 1970 issued a statement to the effect that the book was outdated and cadets instead were being informed of the [[Condon Committee|Condon Report]]'s negative conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cufon.org/cufon/afu.htm |title=Introductory Space Science |website=CUFON.org |publisher=Computer UFO Network (CUFON) |location=West Jacksonville, FL |access-date=2013-05-16}} Air Force Academy UFO material.</ref>

Controversy surrounded the report, both before and after its release. It has been observed that the report was "harshly criticized by numerous scientists, particularly at the powerful AIAA&nbsp;... [which] recommended moderate, but continuous scientific work on UFOs."<ref name="COMETA" /> In an address to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|AAAS]], [[James E. McDonald]] said he believed science had failed to mount adequate studies of the problem and criticized the Condon Report and earlier studies by the USAF as scientifically deficient. He also questioned the basis for Condon's conclusions<ref name="default">{{cite conference |first=James E. |last=McDonald |title=Science in Default: Twenty-Two Years of Inadequate UFO Investigations |conference=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 134th Meeting |book-title=UFO's: A Scientific Debate |editor1-last=Sagan |editor1-first=Carl |editor1-link=Carl Sagan |editor2-last=Page |editor2-first=Thornton |url=https://archive.org/details/ufosascientificd0000unse_n5n6 |edition=Reprint |orig-year=Originally published 1972 |date=1974 |publisher=[[W.

Allen Hynek, an astronomer who worked as a USAF consultant from 1948, sharply criticized the Condon Committee Report and later wrote two nontechnical books that set forth the case for continuing to investigate UFO reports.

Ruppelt recounted his experiences with Project Blue Book, a USAF investigation that preceded Condon's.<ref>[[#Ruppelt|Ruppelt 1956]]</ref>

====FOIA release of documents in 1978====
According to a 1979 [[New York Times]] report, "records from the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other Federal agencies" ("about 900 documents — nearly 900 pages of memos, reports and correspondence") obtained in 1978 through the Freedom of Information Act request, indicate that "despite official pronouncements for decades that U.F.O.'s were nothing more than misidentified aerial objects and as such were no cause for alarm ... the phenomenon has aroused much serious behind‐the‐scenes concern" in the US government. In particular, officials were concerned over the "approximately 10%" of UFO sightings which remained unexplained, and whether they might be Soviet aircraft and a threat to national security.<ref name="Huyghe-1979-NYT">{{cite news |last1=Huyghe |first1=Patrick |title=U.F.O.

===== White House statement of November 2011 =====
In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited this planet and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.

==== Italy (1933–2005) ====

Alleged UFO sightings gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005. The total number of sightings since 1947 are 18,500, of which 90% are identifiable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufo.it/ufo1bis.htm?l-l=en|title=And Ufology UFO Italy UFO sightings, not Flying Saucers, Aliens or Extraterrestrials|publisher=Ufo.it|access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

The UK's [[Flying Saucer Working Party]] published its final report in June 1951, which remained secret for over fifty years. The Working Party concluded that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentifications of ordinary objects or phenomena, optical illusions, psychological misperceptions/aberrations, or hoaxes. The report stated: "We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available."<ref name="FSWP">{{cite web |url=http://www.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/UK/DEFE44-119.pdf |title=Unidentified Flying Objects |date=June 1951 |website=The Black Vault |publisher=John Greenewald |id=DSI/JTIC Report No. 7 |location=Northridge, CA |access-date=2013-09-16}}</ref>

Eight file collections on UFO sightings, dating from 1978 to 1987, were first released on May 14, 2008, to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD).<ref name="nationalarchivesUFO">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/ |title=UFO files |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |location=Kew |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref> Although kept secret from the public for many years, most of the files have low levels of classification and none are classified Top Secret. 200 files are set to be made public by 2012.

The MoD released the files under the [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information Act]] due to requests from researchers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Files released on UFO sightings |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7398108.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=London |date=May 14, 2008 |access-date=2013-05-16}}</ref> These files include, but are not limited to, UFOs over [[Liverpool]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London.<ref>{{cite news |title=The truth is out there: Britons 'spotted' UFOs, records say |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j0OnawpQKsmDXbJAce-OI5EiUgHQ |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |location=London |date=May 13, 2008 |access-date=2013-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605221509/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j0OnawpQKsmDXbJAce-OI5EiUgHQ |archive-date=June 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On October 20, 2008, more UFO files were released. One case released detailed that in 1991 an Alitalia passenger aircraft was approaching [[London Heathrow Airport]] when the pilots saw what they described as a "[[cruise missile]]" fly extremely close to the cockpit. The pilots believed a collision was imminent. UFO expert David Clarke says this is one of the most convincing cases for a UFO he has come across.<ref>{{cite news |title=Airliner had near miss with UFO |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7679145.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=October 20, 2008 |access-date=2013-05-16}}</ref>

A secret study of UFOs was undertaken for the Ministry of Defence between 1996 and 2000 and was code-named Project Condign. The resulting report, titled "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Defence Region", was publicly released in 2006, but the identity and credentials of whomever constituted Project Condign remains classified. The report confirmed earlier findings that the main causes of UFO sightings are misidentification of man-made and natural objects. The report noted: "No artefacts of unknown or unexplained origin have been reported or handed to the UK authorities, despite thousands of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reports. There are no [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], [[Signals intelligence|ELINT]] or radiation measurements and little useful video or still [[Imagery intelligence|IMINT]]." It concluded: "There is no evidence that any UAP, seen in the UKADR [UK Air Defence Region], are incursions by air-objects of any intelligent (extraterrestrial or foreign) origin, or that they represent any hostile intent." A little-discussed conclusion of the report was that novel meteorological plasma phenomenon akin to [[ball lightning]] are responsible for "the majority, if not all" of otherwise inexplicable sightings, especially reports of [[Black triangle (UFO)|black triangle UFOs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/BA0DA42F-2C56-431E-98F6-19CD45EE7D43/0/uap_vol3_executive_summary_pg2_paras4_and_7.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/BA0DA42F-2C56-431E-98F6-19CD45EE7D43/0/uap_vol3_executive_summary_pg2_paras4_and_7.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-26 |title=Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defence Region |volume=3 |author=Defence Intelligence Staff |author-link=Defence Intelligence |date=December 2000 |publisher=The National Archives |location=Kew |page=2 |id=55/2/00 |access-date=2013-09-10}} See also The National Archives site: [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/PublicationScheme/SearchPublicationScheme/UapInTheUkAirDefenceRegionVolume3.htm "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) in the UK Air Defence Region"] for archived documents.</ref>

On December 1, 2009, the Ministry of Defence quietly closed down its UFO investigations unit. The unit's hotline and email address were suspended by the MoD on that date. The MoD said there was no value in continuing to receive and investigate sightings in a release, stating that "in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. The MoD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. There is no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MoD resources from tasks that are relevant to Defence." ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the MoD claimed the closure would save the Ministry around £50,000 a year. The MoD said it would continue to release UFO files to the public through The National Archives.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cost-cutting causes British gov't to shut down UFO investigations |first=Stephanie |last= Dearing |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/283265 |work=Digital Journal |location=Toronto |date=December 5, 2009 |access-date=2013-05-16}}</ref>

UFO reports, Parlimentary questions, and letters from members of the public were released on August 5, 2010 to the UK National Archives.

Novella says that instead of accepting the null hypothesis, UFO enthusiasts tend to engage in [[special pleading]] by offering outlandish, untested explanations for the validity of the ETH, which violate [[Occam's razor]].<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

[[Image:Allen Hynek Jacques Vallee 1.jpg|thumb|[[J. Allen Hynek|Allen Hynek]] (left) and [[Jacques Vallée]]]]
Studies of UFOs rarely appear in mainstream scientific literature. When asked, some scientists and scientific organizations have pointed to the end of official governmental studies in the U.S. in December 1969, following the statement by the government scientist [[Edward Condon]] that further study of UFOs could not be justified on grounds of scientific advancement.<ref name="COMETA"/><ref>[[#Swords & Powell|Swords & Powell 2012]], pp. 306–332</ref>

[[Jacques Vallée]], a scientist and ufologist, claimed there were deficiencies in most UFO research, including government studies. He criticized the mythology and cultism often associated with UFO sightings, but despite the challenges, Vallée contended that several hundred professional scientists — a group both he and Hynek termed "the invisible college" — continued to study UFOs quietly on their own time.<ref name="Revelations" />

UFOs have become a prevalent theme in modern culture,<ref name="Revelations">[[#Vallée 2008|Vallée 2008]]</ref> and the social phenomena have been the subject of academic research in sociology and psychology.<ref name=ufosociology>{{cite journal |last=Cross |first=Anne |date=March 2004 |title=The Flexibility of Scientific Rhetoric: A Case Study of UFO Researchers |journal=[[Qualitative Sociology]] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=3–34 |issn=0162-0436 |doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000015542.28438.41|s2cid=144197172 }}</ref>

====Sturrock panel categorization====

Besides anecdotal visual sightings, reports sometimes include claims of other kinds of evidence, including cases studied by the military and various government agencies of different countries (such as Project Blue Book, the Condon Committee, the French [[GEIPAN|GEPAN/SEPRA]], and Uruguay's current Air Force study).

A comprehensive scientific review of cases where physical evidence was available was carried out by the 1998 Sturrock panel, with specific examples of many of the categories listed below.
* Radar contact and tracking, sometimes from multiple sites. These have included military personnel and control tower operators, simultaneous visual sightings, and aircraft intercepts. One such example was the mass sightings of large, silent, low-flying black triangles in 1989 and 1990 over Belgium, tracked by [[NATO]] radar and jet interceptors, and investigated by Belgium's military (included photographic evidence). Another famous case from 1986 was the [[Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident]] over [[Alaska]] investigated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA).
* Photographic evidence, including still photos, movie film, and video.
* Claims of physical trace of landing UFOs, including ground impressions, burned or desiccated soil, burned and broken foliage, magnetic anomalies{{Specify|date=February 2009}}, increased radiation levels, and metallic traces. (See, e.&nbsp;g. Height 611 UFO incident or the 1964 [[Lonnie Zamora incident|Lonnie Zamora]]'s [[Socorro, New Mexico]] encounter of the USAF Project Blue Book cases.) A well-known example from December 1980 was the USAF Rendlesham Forest incident in England. Another occurred in January 1981 in Trans-en-Provence and was investigated by GEPAN, then France's official government UFO-investigation agency. Project Blue Book head Edward J. Ruppelt described a classic 1952 CE2 case involving a patch of charred grass roots.
* Physiological effects on people and animals including temporary paralysis, skin burns and rashes, [[cornea]]l burns, and symptoms superficially resembling [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]], such as the [[Cash-Landrum incident]] in 1980.
* Animal/[[cattle mutilation]] cases, which some feel are also part of the UFO phenomenon.
* Biological effects on plants such as increased or decreased growth, germination effects on seeds, and blown-out stem nodes (usually associated with physical trace cases or [[crop circle]]s)
* [[Electromagnetic interference]] (EM) effects. A famous [[1976 Tehran UFO incident|1976 military case]] over [[Tehran]], recorded in CIA and DIA classified documents, was associated with communication losses in multiple aircraft and weapons system failure in an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] jet interceptor as it was about to fire a missile on one of the UFOs.<ref>Fawcett & Greenwood, 81–89; [[#Good 1988|Good 1988]], pp. 318–322, 497–502</ref>
* Apparent remote radiation detection, some noted in FBI and CIA documents occurring over government nuclear installations at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 1950, also reported by Project Blue Book director Edward J. Ruppelt in his book.
* Claimed artifacts of UFOs themselves, such as 1957, [[Ubatuba]], Brazil, [[magnesium]] fragments analyzed by the [[Federal government of Brazil|Brazilian government]] and in the Condon Report and by others. The 1964 Lonnie Zamora incident also left metal traces, analyzed by NASA.<ref>[[#Good 1988|Good 1988]], pp. 371–373</ref><ref>[[#Stanford|Stanford 1976]], pp. 112–154</ref> A more recent example involves a teardrop-shaped object recovered by Bob White and was featured in a television episode of ''[[UFO Hunters]]''<ref>{{cite episode |title=UFO Relics |series=UFO Hunters |series-link=UFO Hunters |network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |airdate=May 6, 2009 |season=3 |number=33}}</ref> but was later found to be waste metal residue from a milling machine. 
* [[Angel hair (folklore)|Angel hair and angel grass]], possibly explained in some cases as nests from [[Ballooning (spider)|ballooning spiders]] or [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heaven and hell : a compulsively readable compendium of myth, legend, wisdom, and wit for saints and sinners|date=2004|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|others=Faustino, Mara.|isbn=0871136961|location=New York|oclc=55596198}}</ref>

====Scientific skepticism====

A [[scientific skepticism|scientifically skeptical]] group that has for many years offered critical analyses of UFO claims is the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI).

One example is the response to local beliefs that "extraterrestrial beings" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing in Indonesia, which the government and the [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) described as "man-made". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated: "We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven. Scientists have put UFOs in the category of [[pseudoscience]]."<ref name=Krismantari>{{cite news |title=Crop circles provide food for thought |first=Ika |last=Krismantari |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/2/6/focus/7978671&sec=focus |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |publisher=Star Publications |location=Petaling Jaya |date=February 6, 2011 |access-date=2013-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030122405/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F2%2F6%2Ffocus%2F7978671&sec=focus |archive-date=October 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Governmental===

One of hundreds of files resulting from US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1995 order to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CIA]] to declassify all documents with “historical value” that were at least 25 years old.]]
UFOs have been the subject of investigations by various governments who have provided extensive records related to the subject. Many of the most involved government-sponsored investigations ended after agencies concluded that there was no benefit to continued investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/17/pentagon-admits-running-secret-ufo-investigation-for-five-years|title=Pentagon admits running secret UFO investigation for five years|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|date=2017-12-17|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/secret-government-program-track-ufos-its-not-first-180967597/|title=That Secret Government Program to Track UFOs? It's Not the First|last=Eghigian|first=Greg|work=Air & Space Magazine|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref> These same negative conclusions also have been found in studies that were highly classified for many years, such as the UK's [[Flying Saucer Working Party]], [[Project Condign]], the U.S. CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, the U.S. military investigation into the green fireballs from 1948 to 1951, and the Battelle Memorial Institute study for the USAF from 1952 to 1955 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14).
Some public government reports have acknowledged the possibility of the physical reality of UFOs, but have stopped short of proposing extraterrestrial origins, though not dismissing the possibility entirely. Examples are the Belgian military investigation into [[Belgian UFO wave|large triangles over their airspace]] in 1989–1991 and the 2009 [[Uruguayan Air Force]] study conclusion (see below).

====Claims by military, government, and aviation personnel====

In May 2019, ''The New York Times'' reported that American Navy fighter jets had several instances of unidentified instrumentation and tracking data while conducting exercises off the eastern seaboard of the United States from the summer of 2014 to March 2015. The ''Times'' published a cockpit instrument video which appeared to show an object moving at high speed near the ocean surface as it appeared to rotate, and objects that appeared capable of high acceleration, deceleration and maneuverability. In two separate incidents, a pilot reported his cockpit instruments locked onto and tracked objects but he was unable to see them through his helmet camera. In another encounter, flight instruments recorded an image described as a sphere encasing a cube between two jets as they flew about 100 feet apart.<ref name="NYT-20190526">{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Helene |last2=Blumenthal |first2=Ralph |last3=Kean |first43=Leslie |title='Wow, What Is That?'

====Conspiracy theories====

{{See also|UFO conspiracy theory|Steven M. Greer|Men in black| Brookings Report}}
UFOs are sometimes an element of conspiracy theories in which governments are allegedly intentionally "covering up" the existence of aliens by removing physical evidence of their presence or even collaborating with extraterrestrial beings. There are many versions of this story; some are exclusive, while others overlap with various other conspiracy theories.

In the U.S., an opinion poll conducted in 1997 suggested that 80% of Americans believed the U.S. government was withholding such information.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Is the Government Hiding Facts On UFOs & Extraterrestrial Life?; New Roper Poll Reveals that More Than Two-Thirds of Americans Think So |date=October 15, 2002 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |location=New York |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Is+the+Government+Hiding+Facts+On+UFOs+%26+Extraterrestrial+Life%3F%3B+New...-a092843602 |access-date=2013-09-12}}</ref><ref name="cnn97">{{cite news |title=Poll: U.S. hiding knowledge of aliens |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/15/ufo.poll/index.html |work=CNN |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |location=Atlanta, GA |date=June 15, 1997 |access-date=2013-09-12}}</ref> Various notables have also expressed such views. Some examples are astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], Vice Admiral [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]] (the first CIA director), [[Peter Hill-Norton, Baron Hill-Norton|Lord Hill-Norton]] (former British Chief of Defense Staff and NATO head), the 1999 French COMETA study by various French generals and aerospace experts, and [[Yves Sillard]] (former director of CNES, new director of French UFO research organization GEIPAN).<ref name="geipan" />

It has also been suggested by a few paranormal authors that all or most human technology and culture is based on extraterrestrial contact (see also [[ancient astronauts]]).

On September 27, 2010, a group of six former USAF officers and one former enlisted Air Force man held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on the theme "U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects"<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Salas |first1=Robert |last2=Hastings |first2=Robert |title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects |date=September 15, 2010 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS166901+15-Sep-2010+PRN20100915 |access-date=2013-09-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127022656/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS166901+15-Sep-2010+PRN20100915 |archive-date=January 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} {{YouTube|id=lR3Fhyi14Pw|title="National Press Club: UFOs Tampering with Nukes - Part 1/7"|link=no}}</ref> in which they claimed they had witnessed UFOs hovering near missile sites and even disarming the missiles.

From April 29 to May 3, 2013, the Paradigm Research Group held the "Citizen Hearing on Disclosure" at the National Press Club. The group paid former U.S. Senator [[Mike Gravel]] and former Representatives [[Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick]], [[Roscoe Bartlett]], [[Merrill Cook]], [[Darlene Hooley]], and [[Lynn Woolsey]] $20,000 each to hear testimony from a panel of researchers which included witnesses from military, agency, and political backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-Rep.

===Fringe===
The void left by the lack of institutional or scientific study has given rise to independent researchers and fringe groups, including the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP) in the mid-20th century and, more recently, the [[Mutual UFO Network]] (MUFON)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mufon.com/ |title=Mutual UFO Network |website=MUFON.com |publisher=[[Mutual UFO Network|Mutual UFO Network, Inc.]] |location=Cincinnati, OH |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref> and the [[Center for UFO Studies]] (CUFOS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cufos.org/org.html |title=Center for UFO Studies |website=CUFOS.org |publisher=[[Center for UFO Studies]] |location=Chicago |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref> The term "[[Ufology]]" is used to describe the collective efforts of those who study reports and associated evidence of unidentified flying objects.<ref>{{cite news |title=UFO Sightings Increase 67 Percent In 3 Years, History Channel Investigates Unexplained Aerial Phenomena |first=Lee |last=Speigel |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/26/ufos-pilots-history-channel_n_935847.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 26, 2011 |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref>

===Private===
Some private studies have been neutral in their conclusions but argued that the inexplicable core cases call for continued scientific study. Examples are the Sturrock panel study of 1998 and the 1970 AIAA review of the Condon Report.

''Ufology'' is a [[neologism]] describing the collective efforts of those who study UFO reports and associated evidence.

====Categorization====

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Some ufologists recommend that observations be classified according to the features of the phenomenon or object that are reported or recorded. Typical categories include:
* Saucer, toy-top, or disk-shaped "craft" without visible or audible propulsion.
* Large triangular "craft" or triangular light pattern, usually reported at night.
* Cigar-shaped "craft" with lighted windows (meteor fireballs are sometimes reported this way, but are very different phenomena).
* Other: chevrons, (equilateral) triangles, crescent, boomerangs, spheres (usually reported to be shining, glowing at night), domes, diamonds, shapeless black masses, eggs, pyramids and cylinders, classic "lights".

Popular UFO classification systems include the Hynek system, created by [[J. Allen Hynek]], and the Vallée system, created by [[Jacques Vallée]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Hynek's system involves dividing the sighted object by appearance, subdivided further into the type of "close encounter" (a term from which the film director [[Steven Spielberg]] derived the title of his 1977 UFO movie, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'').

Jacques Vallée's system classifies UFOs into five broad types, each with from three to five subtypes that vary according to type.

==In popular culture==

{{Main|UFOs in fiction}}
[[File:Tenjo Estatua UFO.JPG|thumb|right|A UFO monument at [[Tenjo]], [[Colombia]]]]

UFOs have constituted a widespread international [[cultural phenomenon]] since the 1950s. [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Polls]] rank UFOs near the top of lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]] in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House.<ref>[[#Jacobs|Jacobs 2000]], Chapter: "UFOs: Lost in the Myths" by Thomas E. Bullard, p. 141</ref><ref>[[#Jacobs|Jacobs 2000]], Chapter: "UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War Era" by [[Michael D. Swords]], pp. 82–121</ref> A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 [[Elmo Roper|Roper Poll]] for the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] found similar results, but with more people believing UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/ufo/roper/ |title=The Roper Poll |work=Ufology Resource Center |publisher=[[Syfy|SciFi.com]] |date=September 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713204836/http://www.scifi.com/ufo/roper/ <!--Bot retrieved archive--> |archive-date=2006-07-13 |access-date=2006-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mufon.com/fastfacts.htm |title=UFO Fast Facts |website=MUFON.com |publisher=Mutual UFO Network, Inc. |location=Cincinnati, OH |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430100715/http://www.mufon.com/fastfacts.htm |archive-date=2008-04-30 |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref>

Another effect of the flying saucer type of UFO sightings has been Earth-made flying saucer craft in space fiction, for example the United Planets Cruiser [[C-57D|C57D]] in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956), the ''[[Lost in Space#Technology and equipment|Jupiter{{nbsp}}2]]''<!--No correction needed.--> in ''[[Lost in Space]]'', and the saucer section of the [[Starship Enterprise|USS ''Enterprise'']] in ''[[Star Trek]]''. UFOs and [[extraterrestrials]] have been featured [[List of films featuring extraterrestrials|in many movies]].

The intense secrecy surrounding the secret Nevada base, known as [[Area 51]], has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of UFO folklore. In July 2019, more than 2 million people responded to a [[Storm Area 51|joke proposal to storm Area 51]] which appeared in an anonymous Facebook post.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/storm-area-51-when-where-aliens-military-base-raid-facebook-event-a9005546.html|title=Storm Area 51: Are Alien-hunters Really Planning to 'Raid' the Secret U.S. Military Base?|first=Andrew|last=Griffin|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 July 2019}}</ref> Two music festivals in rural Nevada, "AlienStock" and "Storm Area 51 Basecamp", were subsequently organized to capitalize on the popularity of the original Facebook event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-area51/in-nevada-desert-area-51-raid-lures-festive-ufo-hunters-three-arrested-idUSKBN1W51H6|title=Area 51 raid lures festive UFO hunters to Nevada desert; five arrested|last=Richwine|first=Lisa|date=September 20, 2019|work=Reuters}}</ref>
