'''Mom Jeans''' (stylized as '''Mom Jeans.''') is an American [[emo]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-29|title=The New Age of Emo: Mom Jeans, Just Friends, and Unity in the Scene|url=https://tmn.truman.edu/blog/ktrm/the-new-age-of-emo-mom-jeans-just-friends-and-unity-in-the-scene/|access-date=2020-12-03|website=Truman Media Network|language=en-US}}</ref> band formed in [[Berkeley, California]] in 2014.

==History==
Mom Jeans. found their start at [[UC Berkeley]], with guitarist Austin Carango and lead singer Eric Butler in early 2014. This line-up would go on to record ''Spring Demo'' in May 2014, a six-track EP which would later be released as the band's self-titled debut on cassette tape by Northern California-based label, Fourth Row Records. Tracks on ''Spring Demo'' feature only Eric and Austin in an acoustic style, while the later released self-titled EP boasted an electric instrumentation with new additions, Josh Perline on bass/vocals, and David McDowall on drums (before his departure from the band shortly after release). Later that summer, the trio would record their last EP before their first full-length album, titled ''Allergic'' which featured Austin switching to drums, Josh switching to guitar, and bass recordings being handled by both members. Post-release, Gabriel (Gabe) Paganin joined the band as live bassist and Josh Perline exited the band on good terms.

Mom Jeans self-released their first full-length album, ''Best Buds,'' on July 3, 2016. Like their self-titled EP, the album was first released on cassette tape by [http://fourthrowrecords.storenvy.com/products/20689841-mom-jeans-best-buds-tape Fourth Row Records] in the summer of 2016. However, soon the group would sign with Massachusetts-based label Counter Intuitive Records, who then re-released the band's first full-length album on vinyl in November 2016.  

On March 7, 2017, Mom Jeans released a split EP with the Fresno-based band Graduating Life. It was during this period that Bart Thompson of Graduating Life and Meet Me in Montauk fame would become a guitarist for the band. 

On October 6, 2017, Counter Intuitive Records released a split EP titled ''NOW That's What I Call Music Vol. 420'', featuring music from Mom Jeans as well as the bands [[Pictures of Vernon]] and [[Prince Daddy & The Hyena]].<ref name="pittsburghcitypaper">{{cite web|last1=Enis|first1=Eli|title=Prince Daddy and the Hyena play Pittsburgh's Mr. Roboto Project|url=https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/prince-daddy-and-the-hyena-play-pittsburghs-mr-roboto-project/Content?oid=5231462|publisher=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="punktastic">{{cite web|title=Mom Jeans. sign to SideOneDummy Records and release split with Prince Daddy & the Hyena and Pictures of Vernon|url=http://www.punktastic.com/news/mom-jeans-sign-to-sideonedummy-records-and-release-split-with-prince-daddy-the-hyena-and-pictures-of-vernon/|publisher=Punktastic|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref> 

Also in October 2017, the band announced they had signed with [[SideOneDummy Records]], and had plans to release their second album through the label in 2018. However, in a [[reddit]] post, Eric Butler confirmed that they would no longer be working with the label and instead continue to work with Counter Intuitive Records to release their second album.<ref name="substream1">{{cite web|last1=Shotwell|first1=James|title=Everyone's favorite band, Mom Jeans., joins SideOneDummy Records|date=10 October 2017|url=https://substreammagazine.com/2017/10/mom-jeans-sideonedummy/|publisher=Substream Magazine|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="ozzi">{{cite web|last1=Ozzi|first1=Dan|title=What Happened to One of Indie Rock's Most Promising Record Labels?|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpxk5/what-happened-to-sideonedummy-records|publisher=Noisey|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>

The band's second full-length album, titled ''Puppy Love'', was released on July 3, 2018<ref name="punknews">{{cite web |title=Mom Jeans: Puppy Love (2018) |url=https://www.punknews.org/review/15961/mom-jeans-puppy-love |publisher=Punknews |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref> with Counter Intuitive Records, as well as a limited independent label run of the record and a select variant being put out by UK based label Big Scary Monsters. 

In early 2019 the band began recording demos for a new LP as well as naming the album, which will be titled ''Sweet Tooth.'', following the departure of Gabriel Paganin. In fall of 2019 it was announced the band would be touring with Hobo Johnson, featuring guest bassist Billy Bouzos (owner of the Oakland-based indie label Slang Church) filling in for Sam Kless. ''Sweet Tooth'' is currently scheduled to be released on February 22, 2022, with the first single ''What's Up?'' being released on September 28, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-mom-jeans-new-album-sweet-tooth|title=This is Everything You Need to Know About Mom Jeans' New Album 'Sweet Tooth' - News}}</ref>
