'''Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC''' is an American video production company headquartered in [[Austin, Texas]]. Founded in 2003 by [[Burnie Burns]], [[Matt Hullum]], [[Geoff Ramsey]], Jason Saldaña, [[Gus Sorola]], and [[Joel Heyman]],<ref name="InverseArticle">{{Cite web|last=Francisco|first=Eric|title=How 'Red vs. Blue' Built an Empire and Invented a Whole Genre|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/29928-red-vs-blue-rooster-teeth-season-15-interview|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413071528/https://www.inverse.com/article/29928-red-vs-blue-rooster-teeth-season-15-interview|archive-date=13 April 2017|access-date=12 April 2017|publisher=Inverse}}</ref> Rooster Teeth is a subsidiary of [[Otter Media]], which is itself a subsidiary of [[List of assets owned by WarnerMedia#WarnerMedia Sale and Distribution|WarnerMedia Sales and Distribution]], a division of [[AT&T]]'s WarnerMedia.

Rooster Teeth began with the production of ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'', which premiered in April 2003 and is still in production, making it the third longest-running episodic web series of all time.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Due to server and web hosting costs, the founders created "Sponsorships" which is now known as "FIRST", a subscription to exclusive and earlier access to content and discounts on their merchandise store, among other benefits. The company later branched out into [[live-action]] shorts, series, comedy, [[Let's Play]] videos, and full animated productions. Other projects include reality shows, video game development, entertainment news programs, and [[podcasts]]. In 2015, Rooster Teeth released its feature-film debut ''[[Lazer Team]]'', a [[science-fiction]] [[action comedy]]. The company hosts an annual convention, [[RTX (event)|RTX]], in several cities around the world.

The company's videos are regularly released on its own website and app while podcasts and Let's Plays are still released on their [[YouTube]] channel as well. As of September 2021, Rooster Teeth's primary YouTube channel has 9.31 million subscribers and has over 5.9 billion video views.<ref name="RoosterTeeTH - YouTube">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/RoosterTeeth/about |title=RoosterTeeth -YouTube |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527095039/https://www.youtube.com/user/RoosterTeeth/about |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref> Including all of their other channels, they maintain over 37 million subscribers.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|date=2019-09-12|title=WarnerMedia's Rooster Teeth Cuts 13% of Staff, Laying Off About 50|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/rooster-teeth-layoffs-13-percent-warnermedia-1203333556/|access-date=2021-01-31|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:Rooster Teeth Congress office (2548207067).jpg|thumb|right|Rooster Teeth's office on Congress Street in Austin in 2008]]
While attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum collaborated with actor Joel Heyman on a 1997 [[independent film]] called ''The Schedule''.<ref>Moltenbrey, Gross.</ref> The film helped Hullum and Heyman to find work in Los Angeles, but otherwise had limited success.<ref name="Moltenbrey">Moltenbrey</ref> Working for a local company named Telenetwork, Burns later met [[Geoff Ramsey]] (then named Geoff Fink), [[Gustavo Sorola]], Dan Godwin, and Jason Saldaña, and the five formed drunkgamers.com, a website where the five reviewed various video games while drunk.<ref>Gross; Konow, 1.</ref> According to Ramsey, the group tried to receive free games to review, but "incurred the wrath" of several game developers in doing so.<ref name="Konow1">Konow, 1.</ref>

One of the non-gameplay videos that the drunkgamers crew created during this time was a live-action parody of the [[Apple Switch ad campaign]]. This video featured Sorola as the main actor, used [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Peter Tchaikovsky]]'s "[[The Nutcracker|Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy]]" as background music, and focused on the lack of games available for the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computer.<ref name="Switch">Mac Gamer Switch Parody.</ref> Sorola and Burns said that the name change from 'Drunk Tank Podcast' to 'Rooster Teeth Podcast' was for the same reason that 'Drunk Gamers' was changed to 'Rooster Teeth': Nobody would give games or sponsor something with 'drunk' in the title "because it was so unprofessional."<ref name="roosterteeth.com">{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/podcast/episode.php?id=174 |title=Rooster Teeth · RT Podcast #174 |publisher=Rooster Teeth |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201120555/http://roosterteeth.com/podcast/episode.php?id=174 |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |access-date=December 9, 2013}}</ref> On settling on Rooster Teeth, Burns stated, "We named it something else to give people the idea that we were going to be doing more than that".<ref name="Online Video">{{Cite magazine |last=Brouwer |first=Bree |title=Rooster Teeth's Burnie Burns And Gavin Free Reminisce About The Brand, Online Video's Past |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/breebrouwer/2016/07/08/rooster-teeth-online-video-history-burnie-burns-gavin-free/#30e1806119b5 |magazine=Forbes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708174827/http://www.forbes.com/sites/breebrouwer/2016/07/08/rooster-teeth-online-video-history-burnie-burns-gavin-free/#30e1806119b5 |archive-date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> The name "Rooster Teeth" is a [[euphemism]] for "cockbite", an insult from the original ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' trailer that Burns described as a "touchstone for the audience".<ref name="Oliver">{{harvnb|Oliver|2005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2012/10/a-red-vs-blue-interview-burnie-burns-of-rooster-teeth-on-killstreaks-infonauts/ |title=A 'Red vs. Blue' Interview: Burns Burns of Rooster Teeth On Killstreaks & 'Infonauts' |date=October 24, 2012 |website=[[NewMediaRockstars]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317012630/http://newmediarockstars.com/2012/10/a-red-vs-blue-interview-burnie-burns-of-rooster-teeth-on-killstreaks-infonauts/ |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |access-date=July 27, 2016}}</ref>

Among the company's core philosophies, Burns stated, "we only make content that we would want to see ... it comes from a very genuine space. I think that our audience appreciates that voice".<ref name="Online Video"/> As of 2017, production costs for an episode vary from $15,000 to $100,000.<ref name="InverseArticle"/>

Rooster Teeth's business strategy is a hybrid model composed of subscriptions, preroll ads, YouTube preroll ads, licensed studio productions, branded merchandise, and annual live events.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=James |first=Geoffrey |title=Can These 2 Gen-X Founders Leapfrog Over Netflix? |url=https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/can-these-two-gen-x-entrepreneurs-leapfrog-over-netflix.html |magazine=Inc |access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

== Live-action production ==
=== ''Rooster Teeth Shorts'' ===
Rooster Teeth first ventured into [[live action]] in 2009 with ''Captain Dynamic'', a mini-series to promote the online game ''[[City of Heroes]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5165368/rooster-teeth-introduces-captain-dynamic-to-city-of-heroes |title=Rooster Teeth Introduces Captain Dynamic To City Of Heroes |last=Fahey |first=Mike |website=Kotaku.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220061410/http://kotaku.com/5165368/rooster-teeth-introduces-captain-dynamic-to-city-of-heroes |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |access-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> The series tells the story of a team of writers hired to use the new in-game content creation tools to promote the title character, Captain Dynamic, the 'worst superhero in the world'. Directed by [[Matt Hullum]] and written by [[Burnie Burns]], the series starred [[Ed Robertson]] of the [[Barenaked Ladies]], who is a long time friend and fan of Rooster Teeth. A number of Rooster Teeth employees were present throughout the series, notably [[Joel Heyman]] as Captain Dynamic's primary writer. Actor [[Shannon McCormick]] appears as the series' antagonist, Great Face.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roostertooths.com/crew.php?show=captaindynamic |title=Cast and Crew · Rooster Tooths |date=April 13, 1999 |publisher=Roostertooths.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025182029/http://roostertooths.com/crew.php?show=captaindynamic |archive-date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=December 9, 2013}}</ref> The series also led to the release of an [[iPhone]] app called the ''Awesome Button''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/awesome-button/id327555582?mt=8 |title=Awesome Button |publisher=Rooster Teeth |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012053853/https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/awesome-button/id327555582?mt=8 |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |access-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref>

Following the positive reception of ''Captain Dynamic'', Rooster Teeth began producing another live-action series, ''Rooster Teeth Shorts'', a [[sketch comedy]] which parodies life at their offices in a similar fashion to the webcomic. The series features the staff of Rooster Teeth, who all play caricatures of themselves, as well as occasional appearances from voice actors from some of their machinima series. The first season ran for twenty episodes, which along with ''Captain Dynamic'' has been released on DVD.

The second season of ''RT Shorts'' debuted on April 23, 2010, with new episodes released weekly via the Rooster Teeth website<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://redvsblue.com/archive/episode.php?id=1233 |title=Rooster Teeth · Prototype |publisher=Redvsblue.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201065215/http://redvsblue.com/archive/episode.php?id=1233 |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |access-date=December 9, 2013}}</ref> until a hiatus during late July 2010, during which the team focused all their efforts towards ''Red vs. Blue'' episodes. With production on ''Red vs. Blue'' complete, weekly ''RT Shorts'' episodes began again on August 28, 2010, until the second season's conclusion with its twenty-fourth episode and DVD release in early December. Shortly before season two's conclusion, Rooster Teeth collaborated with the team behind ''[[Mega64]]'', a video game-centered comedy series. Together they produced four ''Rooster Teeth Shorts'' episodes, which were released on the Rooster Teeth website as the beginning of season three.

Halfway through season four, Burns announced the cancellation of ''Rooster Teeth Shorts'' for several new series. However, on April 1, 2013, Rooster Teeth announced ''Rooster Teeth Shorts'' would return with a fifth season, on the same day, the season premiere episode ''Reunion'' was released and marked the tenth anniversary of the company.

On August 22, 2013, Rooster Teeth released six 6-second mini-episodes exclusively through the video sharing service [[Vine (software)|Vine]]. Six more were published on September 13, 2013. The third set was released on October 11, 2013, followed by a fourth set on November 8, 2013.

=== ''Immersion'' ===
''Immersion'' is a series in which [[Burnie Burns]] and Gus Sorola ([[Griffon Ramsey]] in the first season) test the concepts of video games in real life, such as whether the [[heckler|heckling]] that sometimes occurs in [[multiplayer video games]] would negatively affect the performance of real soldiers. Burns joked in the Rooster Teeth podcast that the series started as an "elaborate way for [them] to do fun stuff and get paid for it."<ref>Burns, The Rooster Teeth Podcast episode 89</ref> [[Geoff Ramsey]] and Gus Sorola were the [[Human subject research|test subjects]] throughout the first season. [[Gavin Free]] and [[Michael Jones (actor)|Michael Jones]] served as the test subjects for the second season. Various other Rooster Teeth employees have served as test subjects in certain episodes including Miles Luna, Kerry Shawcross, Blaine Gibson and Chris Demaris.

During [[PAX East]] in late March 2010, Rooster Teeth released a [[teaser trailer]] for a series with a [[television pilot|pilot]] episode that tested how easy it would be to drive a car from a [[third-person perspective]]. Nothing was mentioned of ''Immersion'' until October 2010, when [[Burnie Burns]] stated during the company's podcast, ''The Rooster Teeth Podcast'', that production had begun on further episodes.

Soon after, on November 23, 2010, the company released pictures on [[Reddit]] of a door in their office turned into a safe-room door from the video game ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' to build hype for the series' debut the following day. The post became the most popular post of the day on Reddit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/eau7w/we_turned_our_studios_exit_door_into_a_l4d_safe/ |title=We turned our studio's exit door into a L4D safe room door.: gaming |website=reddit |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529093616/https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/eau7w/we_turned_our_studios_exit_door_into_a_l4d_safe/ |archive-date=May 29, 2018 |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/post/2644219 |title=IMMERSION BEGINS WEDNESDAY! |last=Burns |first=Burnie |publisher=Rooster Teeth |access-date=February 11, 2016}}</ref> Rooster Teeth re-released a tweaked pilot episode the following day to begin the weekly series, which concluded with its seventh episode on January 5, 2011.

A new episode of ''Immersion'' premiered on June 17, 2011, after five months on hiatus. The episode's filming took place on May 29, 2011, during Rooster Teeth's convention, RTX, as well as 400 participants dressed as zombies. The episode shows Geoff Ramsey and Gus Sorola defending themselves from a horde of zombies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHBST1QZq0w |title=Immersion – Horde Mode |date=June 17, 2011 |publisher=Youtube.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217000312/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHBST1QZq0w |archive-date=February 17, 2013 |access-date=October 12, 2012}}</ref>

On June 17 Burns stated during a panel at Supanova Sydney, that they would be producing a second season, and they were developing concepts. They also confirmed that Gavin Free and Michael Jones of Achievement Hunter would be joining the cast in the second season, replacing Sorola and Ramsey as the test subjects. In the Rooster Teeth Podcast, it was confirmed that the second season began production in 2013. Burns stated in an episode of the ''Rooster Teeth Podcast''{{episode needed|date=October 2016}} that several television stations were interested in picking up the series for its second season.

During RTX 2015, Burns announced that there would be a third season of ''Immersion''. The third season premiered in November 2015.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Airing on August 3, 2019, Burns, Free, and Jones did an episode of ''Immersion'' for Discovery channel's ''[[Shark Week]].'' Along with being shown a demonstration of mechanical shark jaws, it involved them riding a mechanical shark, surfing on the back of a shark-like boat, and ultimately ended with both of them diving with sharks with shark expert Luke Tipple. The episode is available to watch on the Discovery website.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Episodes|url=https://www.discovery.com/shows/rooster-teeth-shark-week-special/episodes|access-date=2021-02-05|website=Discovery|language=en}}</ref>

===''Million Dollars, But ... ''===
''Million Dollars, But ...'' is an ongoing series in which three Rooster Teeth employees or a special guest each come up with a typically difficult scenario—which the cast comically re-enact—as a condition for which they will be given a million dollars; for example, the person has to date [[Adolf Hitler]] for a year. The early episodes usually featured [[Burnie Burns]], [[Gavin Free]], and [[Barbara Dunkelman]], but as time went on, the cast became more varied. The pilot episode premiered on May 21, 2015, with the series continuing on July 9, 2015. The series now features special episodes devoted to specific themes, such as animation, with all the scenarios revolving around animation. ''Million Dollars, But ...'' has developed a card game that had a very successful Kickstarter, reaching their goal of US$10,000 within 2 minutes. The card game was released in mid-June 2016.

=== ''On the Spot'' ===
[[File:On the Spot logo.png|thumb|left|140px|''On the Spot'' logo]]
''On the Spot'' is the name of the Rooster Teeth game show that involves members of the Rooster Teeth cast and crew, split into two teams of two people, playing various improvisational games to gain points awarded by the host Jon Risinger. The winning team is awarded a golden trophy that resembles Gustavo Sorola, affectionately called "The Golden Gus". Although promised to the winner, after being broken several times, the trophy now does not leave Risinger's desk. A frequent theme of the show is the chaotic humor; contestants will frequently attempt to annoy and antagonize Risinger, and to mock his show. The points are assigned arbitrarily and inconsistently based on the random whim of the host, as well as being assigned by the broadcast team that is running the show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?sid=ots&v=more |title=Rooster Teeth · On The Spot #10 |website=Rooster Teeth |access-date=March 9, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In an effort to bring variety to the show, the next few seasons have been themed, with the first themed season being "On the Spot goes to Hell!", where Jon, his show, and his contestants go to hell because his show was too bad. The second themed season is "On the Spot: Lost in Time" with each episode being set in a different time period due to a break in the space-time continuum caused by Chris Demaris. The third themed season involves a "family friendly" version of the show titled "On the Spot: The Happy Room", where each episode has a learning subject such as weather or family which the game prompts are based on. The latest themed season, "On the Spot and Chill", has a TV show theme.

=== Others===
In 2014 a bi-weekly series premiered called ''Happy Hour''. The series chronicles the drunken adventures of Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, and Griffon Ramsey. This series ended on September 24, 2017.

The first episode, The Body Bag Experiment, debuted on September 15, 2014, in which Demarais and Marquis had to drag each other around in a body bag trying to get bystanders to help them out. Points were awarded for making up reasons as to what was in the bag or why they were dragging the bag in the first place.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTq-BgAs0Fs&list=UUzH3iADRIq1IJlIXjfNgTpA |title=The Body Bag Experiment-SOCIAL DISORDER |date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=Youtube.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227122958/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTq-BgAs0Fs&list=UUzH3iADRIq1IJlIXjfNgTpA |archive-date=December 27, 2015 |access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref>

== Channels ==
=== Achievement Hunter ===
{{main|Achievement Hunter}}
Achievement Hunter is a [[video game culture|video gaming]] channel and division of Rooster Teeth, originally created in 2008 by [[Geoff Ramsey]] and Jack Pattillo as a new creative outlet during production of season 6 of [[Red vs. Blue]]. The channel was largely based on the [[Achievement (video games)|achievement]] mechanic found in [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh-generation video game consoles]] after being made popular with [[Microsoft]]'s release of the [[Xbox 360]] with the channels produced by a rotating cast Rooster Teeth employees. Achievement Hunter has since become its own division with a consistent cast and has become a core component of Rooster Teeth Productions. In addition to main live-action channel, Achievement Hunter hosts gameplay content on the company's LetsPlay channel. They formerly also managed GameFails and LetsPlay Community channels on YouTube, but those are no longer uploaded on and currently serve as an archive of past GameFails and LetsPlay Community content.

=== LetsPlay ===
The LetsPlay channel has served a variety of uses since its launch, being most consistently used as the [[Let's Play]] channel for Achievement Hunter.

==== LetsPlay Network ====
The LetsPlay Network is a former [[multi-channel network]] (MCN) operated by Rooster Teeth. It was founded by Rooster Teeth co-founder [[Geoff Ramsey]] and was run by Luis Medina alongside Ramsey. Under this new venture, partnerships with several other YouTube channels, in addition to its own Achievement Hunter and Funhaus, would be established to would provide merchandise, promotion, and other benefits for its partners.

On March 28, 2016, a partnership with [[Kinda Funny]] was announced. Members of the group appear in Rooster Teeth content, and Kinda Funny merchandise became available on the Rooster Teeth Store. ''Kinda Funny LIVE!'' was presented by Let's Play and hosted by Burnie Burns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/post/51259229 |title=Let's Play and Kinda Funny {{!}} Rooster Teeth |website=roosterteeth.com |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> A partnership with The Creatures was announced on April 4, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKBdmfa33FE |title=HUGE Announcement |date=April 4, 2016 |website=The Creatures |publisher=[[YouTube]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520191811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKBdmfa33FE |archive-date=May 20, 2018 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> Upon their separate formations, channels Cow Chop and Game Attack were separately confirmed to be part of the “LetsPlay family”.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/4gvvzi/its_confirmed_aleks_and_james_left_the_creatures/d2l5u6x |title=It's confirmed – Aleks and James left the creatures. |date=April 28, 2016 |website=CowChop Subreddit |publisher=[[Reddit]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528051918/https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/4gvvzi/its_confirmed_aleks_and_james_left_the_creatures/d2l5u6x/ |archive-date=May 28, 2018 |access-date=May 1, 2016}}</ref> Game Attack, which was initially spun off from ScrewAttack before becoming its own independent entity, and Cow Chop both had their own sections on Rooster Teeth's website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gameattack.roosterteeth.com/ |title=Game Attack |website=gameattack.roosterteeth.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502191042/http://gameattack.roosterteeth.com/ |archive-date=May 2, 2017 |access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cowchop.roosterteeth.com/ |title=Cow Chop |website=Rooster Teeth |publisher=Rooster Teeth |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903132422/http://cowchop.roosterteeth.com/ |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref> On May 11, Achievement Hunter announced a partnership between the LetsPlay Network and video game publisher [[Ubisoft]].

While Rooster Teeth still maintains relationships with [[Kinda Funny]] and JT Music, along with new deals with other entities, the “LetsPlay Network” has not been referenced since the mentioned departures. A similar kind of partnership with UK based [[The Yogscast]] has occurred, a deal that includes their own section on Rooster Teeth's website and apps, but the LetsPlay branding and channel has reverted to its function as the gameplay channel for Achievement Hunter.

=== Inside Gaming ===
Inside Gaming is the gaming news division of Rooster Teeth. Originally founded as The Know, an entertainment news division that discusses current events in movies, TV shows, gaming, technology, and media. It was mainly hosted by [[Ashley Jenkins]] and Brian Gaar, with a selection of other Rooster Teeth staff from each division within the company. It was initially a single news show hosted on Rooster Teeth's main YouTube channel before moving over to its own channel, where it has since expanded into several different categories of entertainment and tech news as well as several different shows,<ref>{{youtube|id=wb_6KgH1lqE|title=News: New Steam Controller Design + Titanfall PC Improved By Xbox One + A Big RT Announcement}}</ref> with the latest being ''Glitch Please'', a successor to their earlier podcast ''The Patch'', that was greenlit for a full series after six pilot episodes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/post/51301506 |title=Welcome to Glitch Please |website=Rooster Teeth |language=en |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/post/51303334 |title=What's Next for Glitch Please |website=Rooster Teeth |language=en |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref>
Previously The Know had hosted ''Leaderboard'', where [[Meg Turney]] had discussed [[esports]] news, ''The Patch Game Club'', where the hosts of ''The Patch'' would discuss a new video game they've played each week, and ''Screen Play'', a film and TV podcast. In June 2016, Turney announced on her vlog she was leaving Rooster Teeth to focus more on cosplay.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL5tRdnCpzo |title=I'm No Longer at Rooster Teeth - Meg Turney |last=Turney |first=Meg |publisher=YouTube |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810173410/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL5tRdnCpzo |archive-date=August 10, 2017 |access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref>

ScrewAttack was a video gaming website started in 2006 by Craig Skistimas (known as 'Stuttering Craig' on the site) and Thomas Hanley (known as 'Handsome Tom').{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} From 2009 to 2013, ScrewAttack hosted an annual gaming convention, which included a competition called "Iron Man of Gaming" to find the best all-rounded gamer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2007/08/i_am_iron_man_screwattack_anno/ |title=ScrewAttack Announces Iron-Man Of Gaming Tournament |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=August 6, 2007 |access-date=January 25, 2021 }}</ref> On November 4, 2015, it was announced that ScrewAttack would become a division of Rooster Teeth and Let's Play.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roosterteeth.com/post/51183382 |title=The Worst Secret Ever |website=Rooster Teeth}}</ref> Its website was updated to be consistent with Rooster Teeth's branding, along with all its previously existing users becoming Rooster Teeth users and its forums being absorbed into Rooster Teeth's forums.

The website is primarily known for the web series ''Death Battle'', in which they pit pop culture icons against each other in an extremely gory fight to the death and determine who would win and who would die based on research of the characters (notable examples include [[Optimus Prime]] against the [[Gundam (fictional robot)|RX-78 2 Gundam]], [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] against the [[Terminator (character)|T-800 Terminator]], and the [[Megazord]] against [[Voltron]], amongst many others), using 2 distinctive animation styles (the first being using 2D pixelated graphics and the second being 3D computer-generated animation models). The show is hosted by Wizard aka "Wiz" (played by Ben B. Singer, creator of the show), a mad scientist with a robotic arm, and Boomstick (played by Chad James), an alcoholic country man with a shotgun for a leg. Other content includes animated fight shows without research called ''DBX'' (''Death Battle Exhibition'') (which is mainly hosted by Marshall, aka "Ringmaster" (played by Billy B. Burson III) since season four, and uses [[Unreal Engine 4]] for the arena background. Boomstick hosted the show for the first three seasons, but later returned as a guest in season six, alongside Wiz) and One-Minute Melee, a behind-the-scenes podcast called ''Death Battle Cast'', an informative show called ''Desk of Death Battle'', and a limited show based on fictional vehicles racing called ''Death Race'' with Ringmaster as the host and Wiz and Boomstick as commentators. On February 4, 2019 the ScrewAttack [[YouTube]] channel was re-branded to Death Battle to better match the channel's main content.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/death-battle-cast-2019-good-bye-screwattack |title=We say Goodbye to ScrewAttack - DEATH BATTLE Cast - S4E113 |publisher=Rooster Teeth |access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> The ScrewAttack section of the Rooster Teeth website was turned into an incomplete archive for the channel's old content.

=== Game Kids ===

The podcast has strayed away from this main idea, and they generally end up talking about their personal lives, especially Panton who they describe as " guy with no social boundaries and too much time on his hands."<ref>{{Citation|title=F**KFACE - Roosterteeth|url=https://roosterteeth.com/series/f-kface?season=1|language=en|access-date=2021-02-04}}</ref>

=== Rooster Teeth FIRST ===
To host their own videos, Rooster Teeth paid a [[co-location facility]] $13,000.<ref name="InverseArticle"/> The cost from server fees prompted Rooster Teeth to implement a site wide program called "Sponsorships" in 2003 (later rebranded as Rooster Teeth FIRST members), which gave paying members access to content before being offered to the public, in addition to extra site features, exclusive videos and merchandise. Sponsorships have been credited with "keeping the lights on" in the company's early years and a "major reason" for Rooster Teeth's growth and the first way that they monetized content.<ref name="Entrepreneur profile">{{Cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238391 |title=Meet the Producers Behind Indiegogo's Highest-Funded Film |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=www.entrepreneur.com |publisher=Entrepreneur |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113003917/http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238391 |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Jarvey |first=Natalie |title=Fullscreen's Rooster Teeth Launches Mobile Video App |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fullscreens-rooster-teeth-launches-mobile-821970 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914005618/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fullscreens-rooster-teeth-launches-mobile-821970 |archive-date=September 14, 2015 |access-date=September 15, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="online-only video">{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/rooster-teeth-burnie-burns-qa/ |title=Rooster Teeth's Burnie Burns on pioneering online-only video |last=Williams |first=Felicia |publisher=Tech Crunch |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708142308/https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/rooster-teeth-burnie-burns-qa/ |archive-date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref>
