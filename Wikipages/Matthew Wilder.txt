'''Matthew Wilder''' ({{né}} '''Weiner'''; January 24, 1953)<ref name="News-Journal" /> is an American singer, musician, and record producer. In early 1984, his single "[[Break My Stride]]" hit No. 2 on the ''[[Cash Box]]'' chart and No. 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. He also did the singing voice for Ling in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film [[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]] and wrote the music for the songs featured in the movie.

==Early life==
Born in [[New York City]],<ref name="News-Journal">Farance, Jeff (June 16, 2006). "Seeing Stars: Where's Wilder? With Waldo?", ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]'', p. E14.</ref> Wilder graduated from the [[New Lincoln School]].

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2021}}
Wilder was one-half of the [[Greenwich Village]] [[folk rock]] group Matthew & Peter in the 1970s. In 1978, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], California, and sang for television commercials and as a backing vocalist for [[Rickie Lee Jones]] and [[Bette Midler]].

Wilder's debut album, ''[[I Don't Speak the Language]]'' (1983), reached No. 49 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], fueled by "[[Break My Stride]]".  Wilder had some continued success with the single "The Kid's American", which reached No. 33 in 1984, but the single failed to match the success of "Break My Stride".  Wilder's second album, ''Bouncin' Off the Walls'' (1984), failed to gain much momentum—even with an innovative music video for the single "Bouncin' Off the Walls", with only the title track making the charts (No.&nbsp;52), and was subsequently deemed a commercial failure.

Despite the downturn in his solo career, Wilder continued his career in the music industry as a songwriter and as a [[record producer]] for such acts as [[No Doubt]] (the hit album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''), [[702 (band)|702]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Miley Cyrus]] on her ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' song "G.N.O. (Girls Night Out)", [[The Belle Brigade]], [[King Charles (musician)|King Charles]], and [[Joanna Pacitti]]. He has also done production work on Australian singer-songwriter [[Mig Ayesa]]'s [[MiG (album)|self-titled album]] released in April 2007 and has helped with production on [[Hayden Panettiere]]'s unreleased album.

For the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', Wilder wrote the songs and co-wrote the score with composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. Wilder also lent his singing voice to the character of Ling. He won an [[Annie Award]] nomination for [[Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production|Music in an Animated Feature Production]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] (along with [[David Zippel]] and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]) for his work on that film.<ref name= News-Journal />

For theatre, Wilder once again paired with Zippel to provide the music and lyrics for ''Princesses'', a musical comedy update of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[A Little Princess]]''.  The production ran at the 5th Avenue Theatre in [[Seattle]] but has yet to open on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].
