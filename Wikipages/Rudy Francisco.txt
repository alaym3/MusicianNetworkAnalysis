Francisco became more involved with spoken word as he watched [[HBO|HBO's]] [[Def Poetry Jam|Def Poetry]]. He also began to go to open mics in his area until they were closed due to [[gentrification]].<ref name=":8" /> He then, with a group of local poets and activists called 'Collective Purpose,' opened an open mic known as ''Elevated'' in San Diego, which has been open for over ten years.<ref name=":1" />

Rudy attended [[Alliant International University]] in San Diego.<ref name=":5" /> He went on to complete his Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and pursue a master's degree in industrial and organizational psychology.<ref name=":5" /> Rudy was also an RA at his school and started hosting open mics.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" /> He got invited to other open mics and met other poets through them.<ref name=":5" /> As he became more involved with performing, he began to miss school a lot due to the demand of travel in order to perform.<ref name=":5" /> Rudy has said that it was a very hard decision for him to decide between school and poetry, but he was in love with poetry more than his program.<ref name=":5" /> He worked as a statistical analyst and completed three years of a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program before quitting to do poetry full-time.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" />

== Poetry career ==
Rudy first got into performance poetry after going to many open mics and also after watching a show that featured the poet Shihan and fell in love with the style afterwards.<ref name=":5" /> He also says reading the book ''The Music Lesson'' by [[Victor Wooten]] was pivotal moment in his life as a poet.<ref>{{Citation|last=Evan Sanford|title=Inside the Studio with Evan Sanford - Rudy Francisco Interview|date=2016-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGLI4bJfizA|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> At first, Rudy has said that he thought that performing your poems was weird since you were being judged for your art.<ref name=":5" /> Now, he enjoys getting a score at the end of competition performances.<ref name=":5" /> He found that slam combines his two favorite things: writing and performing.<ref name=":5" /> Rudy has performed in many competitions, as well as shows all around the country and out of the states.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" />

Rudy went on to write his debut poetry book ''Getting Stitches'' in 2013, ''Scratch'' in 2014, ''No Gravity'' in 2015, and his first full-length book ''Helium'' in 2017 which was published by [[Button Poetry]]. It took Rudy Francisco a year and a half to write the collection of 58 poems.<ref name=":5" /> ''Helium'' received positive reviews.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bupipedream.com/ac/89228/reaching-an-emotional-high-with-helium/|title=Reaching an emotional high with "Helium"|date=2017-11-27|work=Pipe Dream|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://crowsneststpete.com/2018/01/29/button-poetrys-rudy-franciscos-first-book-triumphs/|title=Button Poetry’s Rudy Francisco’s first book triumphs|work=The Crow's Nest|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref> When asked what ''Helium'' means in an interview, Francisco states that "helium allows you to defy gravity" and “in a lot of ways poetry always gave me that temporary escape.”<ref name=":5" /> Themes for Helium include: race, class, gender, love and self reflection.<ref name=":5" /> His style for his poems encompass "personal and political narratives through an honest and humorous approach."<ref name=":9" /> But Francisco say, "he is not finished yet, he is still learning."<ref name=":10" />
