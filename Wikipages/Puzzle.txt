A '''puzzle''' is a [[game]], [[Problem solving|problem]], or [[toy]] that tests a person's ingenuity or [[knowledge]]. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, and logic puzzles. 

Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious [[Mathematical problem|mathematical]] or [[logical]] problems. In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research.<ref>Kendall G.; Parkes A.; and Spoerer K. (2008) ''A Survey of NP-Complete Puzzles'', International Computer Games Association Journal, 31(1), pp 13–34.</ref>

==Etymology==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the word ''puzzle'' (as a [[verb]]) to the end of the 16th century. Its earliest use documented in the ''OED'' was in a book titled ''The Voyage of [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]...to the West Indies, 1594–95, narrated by Capt. Wyatt, by himself, and by Abram Kendall, master'' (published circa 1595). The word later came to be used as a [[noun]], first as an [[abstract noun]] meaning 'the state or condition of being puzzled', and later developing the meaning of 'a perplexing problem'. The ''OED''{{'}}s earliest clear citation in the sense of 'a toy that tests the player's ingenuity' is from Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s 1814 novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', referring to a toy known as a "reel in a bottle".<ref>"puzzle, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2019. Web. 21 January 2020.</ref>

The etymology of the verb ''puzzle'' is described by ''OED'' as "unknown"; unproven hypotheses regarding its origin include an Old English verb ''puslian'' meaning 'pick out', and a derivation of the verb ''pose''.<ref>"puzzle, v."

==Puzzle solving==
{{Original research section|date=November 2018}}
Solutions of puzzles often require the recognition of [[pattern]]s and the adherence to a particular kind of ordering. People with a high level of [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] may be better at solving such puzzles than others. But puzzles based upon [[inquiry]] and [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] may be solved more easily by those with good [[Deductive reasoning|deduction skills]]. Deductive reasoning improves with practice. Mathematical puzzles often involves BODMAS. [[BODMAS]] is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In certain regions, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS. It explains the order of operations to solve an expression. Some mathematical puzzle requires Top to Bottom convention to avoid the [[ambiguity]] in the order of operations. It is an elegantly simple idea that relies, as [[sudoku]] does, on the requirement that numbers appear only once starting from top to bottom as coming along.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==History of jigsaw puzzles==
{{Main article | Jigsaw puzzle}}
[[Jigsaw puzzle]]s are perhaps the most popular form of puzzle. Jigsaw puzzles were invented around 1760, when [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], a British engraver and [[cartographer]], mounted a map on a sheet of wood, which he then sawed around the outline of each individual country on the map. He then used the resulting pieces as an aid for the teaching of geography.

John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker, was also credited with inventing the first jigsaw puzzle in 1767.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.puzzlewarehouse.com/history-of-puzzles/|title=History of Puzzles {{!}} PuzzleWarehouse.com|website=www.puzzlewarehouse.com|access-date=2019-11-20}} </ref>

After becoming popular among the public, this kind of teaching aid remained the primary use of jigsaw puzzles until about 1820.<ref>[http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html History of Jigsaw Puzzles<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211155914/http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html |date=2014-02-11 }} The American Jigsaw Puzzle Society</ref>

The largest puzzle (40,320 pieces) is made by German game company [[Ravensburger]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ravensburger.us/discover/40-320-pieces-disney-puzzle/index.html|title=The worlds biggest Puzzle {{!}} Ravensburger|website=www.ravensburger.us|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref> The smallest puzzle ever made was created at LaserZentrum Hannover. It is only five square millimeters, the size of a sand grain.

==History of other puzzles==

The puzzles that were first documented are [[Riddle|riddles]]. In Europe, Greek mythology produced riddles like the [[riddle of the Sphinx]]. Many riddles were produced during the Middle Ages, as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.puzzlemuseum.com/puzzles/history-of-puzzles/brief-history.html|title=A Brief History of Puzzles|date=6 April 2017|website=Puzzle Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414194611/https://www.puzzlemuseum.com/puzzles/history-of-puzzles/brief-history.html|archive-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> 

By the early 20th century, magazines and newspapers found that they could increase their readership by publishing [[puzzle contest]]s, beginning with [[crosswords]] and in modern days [[sudoku]].

==Organizations and events==

There are organizations and events that cater to puzzle enthusiasts, such as:

* [[Nob Yoshigahara Puzzle Design Competition]]
* [[World Puzzle Championship]]
* [[National Puzzlers' League]]
* [[Puzzlehunt]]s such as the [[Maze of Games]]
