'''Jeffrey Dean Isbell''' (born April 8, 1962), best known as '''Izzy Stradlin''', is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter.
He was a co-founder and rhythm guitarist of the [[hard rock]] band [[Guns N' Roses]], which he left at the height of their fame in 1991, and with whom he recorded four studio albums.

Following his departure from Guns N' Roses, Stradlin fronted his own rock band [[#1992–1994: Ju Ju Hounds and first return to Guns N' Roses|Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds]], before continuing to record as a solo artist. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Guns N' Roses in 2012.

== Life and career ==

===  Early life ===
Stradlin was born as Jeffrey Dean Isbell in [[Indiana]].<ref name="Guitar World Interview">{{cite web | title = Slash and Izzy Stradlin Discuss Life In Guns N' Roses in 1989 Guitar World Interview | year = 1989 | url = https://www.guitarworld.com/amp/gw-archive/slash-and-izzy-stradlin-discuss-life-guns-n-roses-1989-guitar-world-interview}}</ref>
His father, Richard Clyde Isbell, was an engraver, and his mother, Sonja LaVern Isbell, née Reagan, worked for a phone company. They divorced when he was eight <ref name="Musician1992">{{cite journal | title = Interview with Musician | year = 1992 | journal = [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] | publisher = Billboard Publications Inc | url = http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=555 | access-date = 2011-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311211209/http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=555 |archive-date=March 11, 2012 }}</ref> and his mother moved with Stradlin and his two younger brothers, Kevin Thomas Isbell and Joseph “Joe” Isbell to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]].
His father remarried in 1975 and had two daughters with his new wife.
Of his hometown, Stradlin later said, "It was cool growing up there. There's a [[Tippecanoe County Courthouse|courthouse]] and a [[Purdue University|college]], a [[Wabash River|river]] and railroad tracks. It's a small town, so there wasn't much to do. We rode bikes, smoked pot, got into trouble - it was pretty ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' actually."<ref name="GeffenBio">{{cite web | title = Geffen - Izzy Stradlin Biography | publisher = [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] | year = 1998 | url = http://hem.passagen.se/snoqalf/art-1998-geffen.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030629060132/http://hem.passagen.se/snoqalf/art-1998-geffen.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2003-06-29 | access-date = 2011-05-25}}</ref>

Stradlin developed an interest in music early in life; by the age of eight, his musical favorites included [[Bob Dylan]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="GeffenBio"/> His biggest musical influence was his paternal grandmother, who played drums in a [[swing music|swing jazz]] band with her friends.<ref name="GeffenBio"/> Inspired, Stradlin talked his parents into buying him a drum kit.<ref name="GeffenBio"/>

In high school, Stradlin started a band with his friends, one of whom was singer William Bailey, later known as [[Axl Rose]].<ref name="GeffenBio"/> Stradlin recalled, "We were long-haired guys in high school. You were either a [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] or a [[Stoner (drug user)|stoner]]. We weren't jocks, so we ended up hanging out together. We'd play covers in the garage. There were no clubs to play at, so we never made it out of the garage."<ref name="GeffenBio"/> Despite his aversion to school, Stradlin graduated in 1980 with a [[Academic grading in the United States#Numerical and letter grades|D average]], the only original member of [[Guns N' Roses]] with a high school diploma.<ref name="Musician1992"/> Set on a career in music, he subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.<ref name="Musician1992"/>

=== 1980–1984: Career beginnings ===
Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Stradlin joined [[punk music|punk]] band Naughty Women.<ref name="Musician1992"/> During his ill-fated first show with the band, audience members began attacking the musicians; Stradlin recalled, "I just grabbed a cymbal stand and stood on the side trying to fend them off, yelling, 'Get the fuck away from me, man!' That was my introduction to the rock scene in L.A."<ref name="GeffenBio"/> His two-month tenure in Naughty Women was followed by a stint in punk band The Atoms, before his drum kit was stolen from his car and he switched to bass.<ref name="GeffenBio"/> Stradlin then joined the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band Shire, during which he took up rhythm guitar to aid his songwriting.<ref name="GeffenBio"/>

In 1983, Stradlin formed [[Hollywood Rose]] with his childhood friend [[Axl Rose]], who had moved to Los Angeles the previous year. In January 1984, the band recorded a five-song demo featuring the tracks "Killing Time", "[[Anything Goes (Guns N' Roses song)|Anything Goes]]", "Rocker", "Shadow of Your Love", and "[[Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide#Song information|Reckless Life]]", which were released in 2004 as part of the compilation album ''[[The Roots of Guns N' Roses]]''.<ref name="HTGTH">{{cite web | last = Luukkonen | first = Jarmo | title = The History of GN'R: The Shocking Truth | publisher = HereTodayGoneToHell.com | url = http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/history/index.html | access-date = 2011-05-25}}</ref> The group disbanded in August, following which Stradlin briefly joined [[Sunset Strip]] staple [[London (heavy metal band)|London]]. He also formed the short-lived band Stalin with singer [[Eric Leach]] and guitarist Taz Rudd of [[Symbol Six]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Symbol Six |journal=SugarBuzz |last=Duda|first=Christopher |date=2012-05-23 |url=http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/?p=4786 | access-date=2012-07-15}}</ref> In December, he reunited with Hollywood Rose.<ref name="HTGTH"/>

=== 1985–1991: Guns N' Roses ===
{{Main article|Guns N' Roses}}

In March 1985, Stradlin founded Guns N' Roses with Axl Rose and members of [[L.A. Guns]], [[Tracii Guns]], [[Ole Beich]] and [[Rob Gardner (musician)|Rob Gardner]],<ref name="HTGTH"/> as a favor to L.A. Guns manager, [[Raz Cue]], who had previously booked the act at the Troubadour.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Days-Guns-Razs-Raz-Cue/dp/0982710313/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2561TPMXAVXMR&keywords=raz+cue&qid=1551929967&s=gateway&sprefix=raz+cu%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-1] {{dead link|date=May 2019}}</ref> By June, the line-up consisted of Rose, guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist Stradlin, bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]].<ref name="HTGTH"/> They played nightclubs—such as the [[Whisky a Go Go]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]], and [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]]—and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. During this period, the band wrote much of its classic material, and Stradlin established himself as a key songwriter.<ref name="AllmusicGNR">{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | title = Allmusic - Guns N' Roses Biography | website = [[Allmusic]] | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/guns-n-roses-p4416/biography | access-date = 2011-05-26}}</ref><ref name="RS1998"/>

In July 1987, Guns N' Roses released their debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'', which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|title=Guns N' Roses To Release New Album - Axl Rose Is The Only Original Remaining Member |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=2008-10-23 |access-date=2011-06-05 |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Guns-N-Roses-To-Release-New-Album---Axl-Rose-Is-The-Only-Original-Remaining-Member/Article/200810415127112 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213122711/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Guns-N-Roses-To-Release-New-Album---Axl-Rose-Is-The-Only-Original-Remaining-Member/Article/200810415127112 |archive-date=2009-02-13 }}</ref> including 18 million in the United States alone.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web | title = Top 100 Albums | publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] | access-date = 2011-06-05 | url = http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums}}</ref> Stradlin wrote or cowrote most of its songs, including the hits "[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]" and "[[Paradise City]]". He also wrote the hit "[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]" on the follow-up ''[[G N' R Lies]]'', released in November 1988 to US sales of five million copies,<ref>{{cite web | title = RIAA's Gold & Platinum Program | publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] | access-date = 2011-06-05 | url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database}}</ref> despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP ''[[Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide]]''.

As their success grew, so did tensions within the band. In 1989, opening for [[The Rolling Stones]], Rose threatened to leave the band if Stradlin, Slash, and Adler didn't stop "dancing with Mr. Brownstone,"<ref name="HTGTH"/> a reference to their [[Mr. Brownstone|song of the same name]] about heroin. After being sentenced to a year's probation for [[urine|urinating]] in public aboard an airplane (after which the band nicknamed him "Whizzy"), Stradlin decided to attain sobriety; he returned to his house in Indiana, where he detoxed from drugs and alcohol.<ref name="Musician1992"/><ref name="Popular1">{{cite journal | title = Exclusively for Popular 1: Izzy Stradlin | journal = Popular 1 | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=477 | access-date = 2011-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215204732/http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=477 |archive-date=February 15, 2012 }}</ref> 
In September 1991, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively in the US chart – an unprecedented feat.<ref name="Sugerman91">{{cite book | last = Sugerman | first = Danny | title = Appetite for Destruction: The Days of Guns N' Roses | url = https://archive.org/details/appetitefordestr00suge_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-312-07634-7}}</ref> Stradlin cowrote the hits "[[Don't Cry]]" and "[[You Could Be Mine]]", and performed lead vocals on "[[Dust N' Bones]]", "[[You Ain't the First]]", "[[Double Talkin' Jive]]", and "[[14 Years]]". As with their previous records, his preferred guitar during recording was a [[Gibson ES-175]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heatley| first = Michael | title = Stars & Guitars | publisher = Chicago Review Press | year = 2010| isbn = 978-1-56976-535-7}}</ref>

By the release of the ''Use Your Illusion'' albums, Stradlin had become dissatisfied with life in Guns N' Roses: "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out."<ref name="RS1998">{{cite magazine  | title = Interview with Rolling Stone | year = 1998 | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | publisher = Wenner Media LLC | url = http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=525 | access-date = 2011-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225141704/http://www.chopaway.com/viewtopic.php?id=525 |archive-date=December 25, 2010}}</ref> On November 7, 1991, it was announced that he had left Guns N' Roses,<ref name="HTGTH"/> having played his final show as an official member on August 31 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref name="HTGTH"/>

Stradlin later said, "I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses,"<ref name="Musician1992"/> citing the [[Riverport riot]] and Axl Rose's chronic lateness and [[diva]] behavior on the [[Use Your Illusion Tour]] as examples.<ref name="Musician1992"/><ref name="GeffenBio"/> He also objected to a contract with which he was presented: "This is right before I left – demoting me to some lower position. They were gonna cut my percentage of royalties down. I was like, 'Fuck you! I've been there from Day One. Why should I do that? Fuck you, I'll go play the [[Whisky a Go Go|Whisky]].' That's what happened. It was utterly insane."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mick|last=Wall|author-link=Mick Wall|title=In too deep|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #28|date=June 2001|page=42}}</ref>

Stradlin added that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, "When you're fucked up, you're more likely to put up with things you wouldn't normally put up with."<ref name="Musician1992"/>

Following his departure from Guns N' Roses, Stradlin returned to his hometown of Lafayette, Indiana, where he began working on new material. He formed the band Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds, which consisted of Stradlin on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Rick Richards]] of [[Georgia Satellites]] on lead guitar, [[Jimmy Ashhurst]] of Broken Homes on bass, and [[Charlie Quintana]] on drums.<ref name="Musician1992"/> Their [[Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in October 1992 to positive reviews; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it "a ragged, blues-drenched, and thoroughly winning solo debut."<ref name="GeffenBio"/> Ju Ju Hounds played its first show in September at The Avalon in Chicago, before embarking on a tour of Europe, Australia, and North America.<ref name="IzzyOnTour1992">{{cite web | title = Izzy Stradlin on Tour 1992 | publisher = IzzyOnTour.com | url = http://www.izzyontour.com/1992.htm | access-date = 2011-05-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131204234108/http://www.izzyontour.com/1992.htm|archive-date=December 4, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="IzzyOnTour1993">{{cite web | title = Izzy Stradlin on Tour 1993 | publisher = IzzyOnTour.com | url = http://www.izzyontour.com/1993.htm | access-date = 2011-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204215428/http://www.izzyontour.com/1993.htm |archive-date=December 4, 2013 }}</ref>

In May 1993, Stradlin reunited with Guns N' Roses for five shows in Europe and the Middle East to fill in for his replacement, [[Gilby Clarke]], who had broken his wrist in a motorcycle accident.<ref name="GNROnTour1993">{{cite web | title = Guns N' Roses on Tour - 1993 Setlist Almanac | publisher = GNROnTour.com | url = http://www.gnrontour.com/setlistalm93.htm | access-date = 2011-05-26}}</ref> After Stradlin returned to the Ju Ju Hounds, Axl Rose dedicated the Stradlin-penned "Double Talkin' Jive" to him during several shows.<ref name="GNROnTour1993"/> In September, the Ju Ju Hounds undertook a tour of Japan, where the band played its final show at the [[Shibuya Public Hall]] in Tokyo.<ref name="IzzyOnTour1993"/> Stradlin then took time off from music, during which he traveled extensively and dedicated much of his time to his other passion - motor racing, even building a track close to his Indiana home.<ref name="GeffenBio"/>

=== 1995–2002: Solo career and Velvet Revolver ===
[[File:Izzy 010.jpg|thumb|Stradlin during a concert in 2006]]

In 1995, Stradlin began recording material for his first solo album, ''[[117 (album)|117°]]''.<ref name="RS1998"/> Released in March 1998, the album was recorded in fits and starts over a period of two years and featured his former bandmates Duff McKagan and Rick Richards, as well as former [[Reverend Horton Heat]] drummer [[Taz Bentley]], whose work Stradlin admired.<ref name="GeffenBio"/> As before, Stradlin had little interest in promoting his music; he did few interviews and played no live performances.<ref name="RS1998"/> The album turned out to be his last release on his long-time label [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]; as a result of the merge between Geffen and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]],<ref>{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = A Major Merger Shakes Up the World of Rock | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html?pagewanted=1 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | issn = 0362-4331 | date = 1998-12-21 | access-date = 2011-05-26}}</ref> Stradlin was dropped from the label's roster.

In December 1999, Stradlin's next solo album, ''[[Ride On (Izzy Stradlin album)|Ride On]]'', was released on the [[Victor Entertainment|Universal Victor]] label in Japan. It featured the same line-up as his previous release. To promote the album, Stradlin - with McKagan, Richards, and Bentley— played four shows in Japan the following April.<ref name="IzzyOnTour2000">{{cite web | title = Izzy Stradlin on Tour 2000 | publisher = IzzyOnTour.com | url = http://www.izzyontour.com/2000.htm | access-date = 2011-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204224702/http://www.izzyontour.com/2000.htm |archive-date=December 4, 2013 }}</ref> With the addition of keyboardist [[Ian McLagan]], the group recorded two more albums: ''[[River (Izzy Stradlin album)|River]]'', which was released in May 2001 on [[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary]], and a second Japan-only release, ''[[On Down the Road]]'', which followed in August 2002 on [[Victor Entertainment|JVC Victor]].<ref name="HTGTH-Izzy">{{cite web | last = Luukkonen | first = Jarmo | title = Izzy Stradlin Releases | publisher = HereTodayGoneToHell.com | url = http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/releases/izzy/index.html | access-date = 2011-05-27}}</ref><ref name="AllmusicDisco">{{cite web | title = Allmusic - Izzy Stradlin Discography | website = [[Allmusic]] | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/izzy-stradlin-p26100/discography | access-date = 2011-05-27}}</ref>
