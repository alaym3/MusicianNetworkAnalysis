'''Margot & the Nuclear So and So's''' is an American rock band from [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Between 2006 and 2014, the band released 6 full-length albums.

==History==

The band's founding members, Richard Edwards and Andy Fry, met while teens.<ref name=myplay>{{cite web|title=Margot and the Nuclear So and Sos Bio|url=http://www.myplay.com/artists/margot-and-the-nuclear-so-and-sos/bio|publisher=Myplay Direct|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010170439/http://myplay.com/artists/margot-and-the-nuclear-so-and-sos/bio#|archive-date=2008-10-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> Eventually, in 2004, the two formed Margot & the Nuclear So and So's, named after the character Margot in [[Wes Anderson|Wes Anderson's]] 2001 film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.<ref name="hybrid">{{cite web|title=Margot And The Nuclear So And So's: The Dust Of Retreat|url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/reviews/0606/margot.shtml|website=Hybrid Music|publisher=Hybrid Magazine|access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref>

Over time, many friends of Edwards and Fry in the Indianapolis area joined the band.<ref name="myplay" /> By the time their first album ''The Dust of Retreat'' was released in 2006, the band contained eight full-time members.

After a move to [[Chicago]] in 2009, Edwards began to experiment with a new band lineup, and eventually decided on a six-man group made up of some former members and some Chicago-area musicians. This new lineup allowed Edwards to take the band in a more [[rock music|rock-based]] direction, which could be seen in their next two studio albums ''Buzzard'' (2010), and ''Rot Gut, Domestic'' (2012).<ref name="iTunes">{{cite web|title=Margot & The Nuclear So and So's|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/margot-the-nuclear-so-and-sos/id128117913|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with blogger Adam Vitcavage, Edwards discussed his battle with [[Clostridium difficile colitis]] as well as the future of the band. Edwards proclaimed, "I've threatened to break up this stupid band so many times, I don't want to continue crying wolf. That said, I don't currently see any real reason for Margot to continue."<ref name="Vitcavage">{{cite web|title=Richard Edwards on his rotted gut and a decade of rarities|url=http://www.vitcavage.com/2015/11/30/richard-edwards-on-his-rotted-gut-and-a-decade-of-rarities|publisher=Adam Vitcavage|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/richard-edwards-of-margot-the-nuclear-so-and-sos-a.html|title=Richard Edwards of Margot & The Nuclear So and So's Announces Solo LP with "Disappeared Planets"|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref>

==Releases==

The band's first full album, ''The Dust of Retreat'', was released in 2005 through Standard Recording Company. It was remastered and re-released on March 26, 2006 by [[Artemis Records]].<ref name=iTunes /> The style was described by MacKenzie Wilson as "cinematic chamber pop" that "both the casual music fan and music perfectionist will enjoy".<ref>{{cite web|title = The Dust of Retreat - Margot & the Nuclear So and So's {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-dust-of-retreat-mw0000516001|website = AllMusic|access-date = 2015-07-04}}</ref>

Two full lengths were released on October 7, 2008, ''Animal!'' and ''Not Animal''. All releases were by [[Epic Records]]. Four intimate live recordings of songs, two of which are exclusive to ''Animal!'', were available for free download on the website [[Daytrotter]].

There were delays in the release of the band's second full length due to disagreements between the band and Epic Records regarding the song selection of the album. ''Animal!'' is Margot's preferred version of the album, while ''Not Animal'' is Epic Records's. Five songs appear on both releases, out of the 12 tracks on each album. On their MySpace page, the band said they would like fans to listen to ''Animal!'' first. The band was a featured musical guest on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] in November 2008. They played their new song "As Tall As Cliffs", one of the songs on both records.

The band released their third album, ''Buzzard'', on September 21, 2010, via Mariel Recordings, their own label with distribution through [[Redeye Distribution|Redeye]]. The album features many Chicago musicians and friends of the band, including [[Tim Rutili]], [[Joe Adamik]], Cameron McGill, Katie Todd, [[Brian Deck]], and Ronnie Kwasman.

Their fourth album, ''Rot Gut, Domestic'', produced by [[John Congleton]], was released early to pledges for digital download via [[PledgeMusic]] on March 12, 2012. The CD and vinyl versions were released nationally on March 20, 2012.

Margot's fifth album, ''Sling Shot to Heaven'' was released on April 22, 2014 through the Mariel Records. Also released with this was a movie shot on [[16 mm film]] entitled ''Tell Me More About Evil: A Film about Margot & the Nuclear So and So's''. This film included stripped down versions of many album tracks and also included some voice narration. On November 4, 2014, the soundtrack to the film was released as a digital download, on vinyl, and on cassette tape.

Richard Edwards worked on compiling a rarities box set that encompassed all of their studio albums. In 2015, the band released ''The Bride On The Boxcar – A Decade of Margot Rarities: 2004–2014'', through [[Joyful Noise Recordings]]. is broken up into five different eras on different albums. The five parts of the set are: "Hybristophilia", "PANIC ATTACKS (Low Level Bummer)", "Now, Let's Risk Our Feathers", "Dark Energy in the Spotlight", and "You Look Like the Future, Baby". Each disc represents an era in the band. It was released on vinyl and digital download.

On January 24, 2017, Edwards officially announced the release date of his first solo album, ''Lemon Cotton Candy Sunset''. The album was released on March 31, 2017 via Joyful Noise Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vitcavage.com/2017/01/24/richard-edwards-announces-debut-solo-album-premieres-disappeared-planets-single/ |title=Richard Edwards announces debut solo album, premieres "Disappeared Planets" single – Adam Vitcavage |website=Vitcavage.com |date=2017-01-24 |access-date=2017-04-12}}</ref> The first single, "Disappeared Planets", was made available to stream on the album's website.
