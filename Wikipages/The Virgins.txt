'''The Virgins''' were an American [[indie rock]] band formed in 2006 in [[New York City]]. The band split up in November 2013.

==History==
===2006–2007: Formation===
Frontman Donald Cumming began writing music by himself in his New York apartment. He then recruited friends to fill out the band.
 
Almost immediately they made a five-song [[Extended play|EP]] titled "[[The Virgins '07]]", compiled of the band's early recordings, and songs Donald had already recorded himself. Upon completion, Cumming passed out the EP to friends and DJs causing the music to pervade the New York club scene. Soon after, the demo came across [[Atlantic Records]] who signed Cumming before the band was fully formed.<ref>Koshkin, Brett.[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2008/03/sxsw_tomorrows_it_band_the_vir.php/ SXSW: Tomorrow's It Band: The Virgins], HoustonPress, March 14, 2008</ref> The band's debut LP came out in 2008 and the band toured for several years following its release.

===2008–2011: ''The Virgins''===
Their first album titled ''The Virgins'' was met with mixed success critically. To promote the record they played at the [[All Points West Festival]], [[SXSW]] festival, [[Lollapalooza]], [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Leeds]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[T in the Park]] festivals, among other major French, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian festivals in the summer of 2009.  In the fall of 2009 they were invited to perform in Moscow.
