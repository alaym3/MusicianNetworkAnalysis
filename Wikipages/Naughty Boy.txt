'''Shahid Khan''' ({{lang-ur|شاهد خان}}; born 1 January 1981), better known by his stage name '''Naughty Boy''', is a British DJ, [[record producer]], songwriter and musician. In 2012, Shahid Khan signed a three–year publishing deal with [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|Sony ATV]], as well as a recording contract to release one album under [[Virgin EMI Records]]. Shahid Khan launched himself as a record producer under the moniker "Naughty Boy" and runs his own production company called Naughty Boy Recordings.

He has produced two records for rappers [[Chip (rapper)|Chipmunk]] and [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], both featuring [[Emeli Sandé]]. Naughty Boy and Sandé later formed a writing and production partnership, leading to Sandé landing her own record deal with Virgin and EMI. Sandé went on to be named the Critics Choice for the [[2012 BRIT Awards]], and release her debut album ''[[Our Version of Events]]'' (2012), a record co-written and produced with Naughty Boy. Shahid Khan spent 2011 and 2012 working on records for [[Leona Lewis]], [[JLS]], [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Alesha Dixon]] and [[Tinie Tempah]], among others.

In 2013, Naughty Boy released his debut album ''[[Hotel Cabana]]''. The set features prominent collaborator Sandé, as well as [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] and others. It was preceded by the release of the top-ten single "[[Wonder (Naughty Boy song)|Wonder]]" (featuring Sandé), the number one hit "[[La La La (Naughty Boy song)|La La La]]", featuring [[Sam Smith]] and "[[Lifted (Naughty Boy song)|Lifted]]", another collaboration with Sandé. His debut album peaked at number two in the UK.

On 19 October 2013, Naughty Boy's "La La La" was awarded 'Best Song' and 'Best Video' at the [[MOBO Awards]]' 18th Anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|title=Naughty Boy Wins Two MOBO's at the 18th Anniversary Awards |url=http://whatsgoodonline.co.uk/events/mobo-award-winners-2013-announced/ |access-date=19 October 2013 |newspaper=What's Good?
