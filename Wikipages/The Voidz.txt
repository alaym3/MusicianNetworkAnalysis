==History==

=== Formation, ''Tyranny'' (2013–2016) ===
Jeff Kite, Alex Carapetis and Jake Bercovici had all worked with Casablancas previously. Kite and Carapetis appeared as part of the Sick Six live band (which also featured [[Danielle Haim]]), that backed Casablancas when touring his first solo album, ''[[Phrazes for the Young]]''. Kite and Carapetis, along with Bercovici, also worked on "I Like the Night", a song Casablancas recorded as part of an advertising campaign he fronted for the [[France|French]] fashion label, [[Loris Azzaro|Azzaro]]. Casablancas enjoyed working with the band and chose to collaborate with other musicians, in a similar format to the Sick Six, when recording his next album. Casablancas, Carapetis, Bercovici, and Kite, along with mutual friends Jeramy Gritter and Amir Yaghmai formed The Voidz and began writing music together.<ref name="theguardian1"/><ref name="YouTube"/>
