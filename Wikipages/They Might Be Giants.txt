'''They Might Be Giants''' (often abbreviated as '''TMBG''') is an<!--awards and nominations don't belong here--> American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1982 by [[John Flansburgh]] and [[John Linnell]]. During TMBG's early years, Flansburgh and Linnell frequently performed as a duo, often accompanied by a [[drum machine]].  In the early 1990s, TMBG expanded to include a backing band.<ref>Santo, Jim. "Beat the Machine". ''The Music Paper''.  November 1994.</ref> The duo's current backing band consists of [[Marty Beller]], [[Dan Miller (guitarist)|Dan Miller]], and [[Danny Weinkauf]]. The group is known for their uniquely experimental and absurdist style of alternative music, typically using surreal, humorous lyrics and unconventional instruments in their songs. Over their career, they have found success on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|modern rock]] and [[Campus radio|college radio]] charts. They have also found success in [[children's music]], and in [[theme music]] for several television programs and films. The duo has been credited as vital in the creation of the prolific [[DIY music]] scene in Brooklyn in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Spiegel |first=Amy Rose |date=2015-02-19 |title=They Might Be Giants at 33: Still Here, Still Weird |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/they-might-be-giants-at-33-were-still-here-were-weird-get-used-to-us-112121/ |access-date=2021-01-11 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>

TMBG have released 23 studio albums. ''[[Flood (They Might Be Giants album)|Flood]]'' has been [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] and their children's music albums ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]'', ''[[Here Come the 123s]]'', and ''[[Here Comes Science]]'' have all been [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]]. The band has won two [[Grammy Award]]s. They were nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Tony Award for Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre]] for ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants (musical)|SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Tony Award Nominations: SpongeBob SquarePants and Mean Girls Lead the Pack|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/2018-tony-award-nominations-spongebob-squarepants-and-mean-girls-lead-the-pack|website=Playbill.com|date=May 2018|access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref> The band has sold over 4 million records.<ref name="facts">{{cite web | title=TMBG Facts | work=tmbg.com | url=http://tmbg.com/temp_site/facts.htm | access-date=May 31, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602002900/http://www.tmbg.com/temp_site/facts.htm | archive-date=June 2, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
John Linnell and Flansburgh first met as teenagers growing up in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]]. They began writing songs together while attending [[Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School]] but did not form a band at that time. The two attended separate colleges after high school and Linnell joined [[The Mundanes]], a [[New wave music|new wave]] group from [[Rhode Island]]. The two reunited in 1981 after moving to [[Brooklyn]] (to the same apartment building on the same day) to continue their career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Weiskopf, Myke|title=They Might Be Giants Early Years Handbook v3.0|url=http://www.tmbg.org/band-info/early-years/|access-date=February 26, 2006}}</ref>

===Earlier years (1982–1989)===
At their first concert, They Might Be Giants performed under the name '''El Grupo De Rock and Roll''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the Rock and Roll Band"), because the show was a [[Sandinista Revolution|Sandinista rally]] in Central Park, and a majority of the audience members spoke Spanish.<ref name="NY1">[http://statenisland.ny1.com/content/features/110059/-i-one-on-1---i---they-might-be-giants--span-the-age-group-globe Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130130205339/http://statenisland.ny1.com/content/features/110059/-i-one-on-1---i---they-might-be-giants--span-the-age-group-globe |date=January 30, 2013 }} with NY1, December 2009.</ref> Soon discarding this name, the band assumed the name of a 1971 film ''[[They Might Be Giants (film)|They Might Be Giants]]'' (starring [[George C. Scott]] and [[Joanne Woodward]]), which is in turn taken from a ''[[Don Quixote]]'' passage about how Quixote mistook [[Tilting at windmills|windmills for evil giants]]. According to Dave Wilson, in his book ''Rock Formations'', the name They Might Be Giants had been used and subsequently discarded by a friend of the band who had a [[ventriloquism]] act.<ref name="RockFormations">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOpB23GGxAIC&q=ventriloquist+%22they+might+be+giants%22+friend&pg=RA1-PA24 |title=Rock formations: categorical answers ... - Google Books|page=24 |access-date=July 17, 2011|isbn=9780974848358 |year=2004 |last1=Wilson|first1=Dave}}</ref> The name was then adopted by the band, who had been searching for a suitable name.

A common misconception is that the name of the band is a reference to themselves and an allusion to future success. In an interview, John Flansburgh said that the words "they might be giants" are just a very outward-looking forward thing which they liked. He clarified this in the documentary movie ''[[Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)]]'' by explaining that the name refers to the outside world of possibilities that they saw as a fledgling band. In an earlier radio interview, John Linnell described the phrase as "something very paranoid sounding".<ref>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Mike|year=2000|title=TMBG: FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)|work=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about They Might Be Giants|url=http://www.tmbg.org/band-info/faq/#q7|access-date=February 26, 2006}}</ref>

The duo began performing their own music in and around New York City &ndash; Flansburgh on [[guitar]], Linnell on [[accordion]] and [[saxophone]] and accompanied by a [[drum machine]] or prerecorded backing track on [[compact cassette|audio cassette]]. Their atypical instrumentation, along with their songs which featured unusual subject matter and clever wordplay, soon attracted a strong local following.  Their performances also featured absurdly comical stage props such as oversized [[fez (clothing)|fezzes]] and large cardboard cutout heads of newspaper editor [[William Allen White]].<ref>{{cite web|title=William Allen White|work=This Might Be A Wiki|url=http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/William_Allen_White|access-date=April 7, 2006}}</ref> Many of these props would later turn up in their first music videos. From 1984 to 1987, They Might Be Giants were the house-band at Darinka, a [[Lower East Side]] performance club.<ref name="gigantic" /> One weekend a month they played on the stage there and by the end of their three-year stint sold out every performance. On March 30, 1985, TMBG released their 7" [[flexi disc|flexi-disc]], dubbed "Wiggle Diskette" at Darinka. The disc included demos of the songs "Everything Right Is Wrong" and "You'll Miss Me".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==={{anchor|Dial-A-Song|Dial-a-Song}} Dial-A-Song (1985–2008)===
{{Redirect|Dial a Song|the compilation album|Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants}}
At one point, Linnell broke his wrist in a [[bicycle accident|biking accident]], and Flansburgh's apartment was [[burglary|burgled]], stopping them from performing for a time. During this hiatus, they began recording their songs onto an [[answering machine]], and then advertising the phone number in local newspapers such as ''[[The Village Voice]]'', using the [[moniker]] "Dial-A-Song".<ref>{{cite web|author=Rodgers, Robert|date=March 9, 1998|title=They Might Be Giants Anthology|work=Dial-a-song|url=http://www.lctn.com/education/hallshigh/tgrtime/dial.htm|access-date=April 7, 2006}}</ref> They also released a demo cassette, which earned them a review in ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine. The review caught the attention of [[Bar/None Records]], who signed them to a recording deal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chuss|first=Eric J.|title=TMBG New York City Where Everyone's Your Friend|work=The Unofficial TMBG site|url=http://www.tmbg.org/learning/nyc/|access-date=January 14, 2007}}</ref>

Through the 1980s until 1998, Dial-A-Song consisted of an answering machine with a tape of the band playing various songs. The machine played one track at a time, ranging from demos and uncompleted work to mock advertisements the band had created. It was often difficult to access due to the popularity of the service and the dubious quality of the machines used. In reference to this, one of Dial-A-Song's many slogans over the years was the tongue-in-cheek "Always Busy, Often Broken". The number, (718) 387-6962, was a local Brooklyn number and was charged accordingly, but the band advertised it with the line: "Free when you call from work".

At one point in 1988, the Dial-A-Song answering machine recorded a conversation between two people who had listened to Dial-A-Song, then questioned how they made money out of it. An excerpt from the conversation has been included as a [[hidden track]] on the EP for ''[[(She Was A) Hotel Detective]]''. In the late '90s, TMBG started switching to a digital unit to update the format for Dial-A-Song, but due to frequent crashes, the band returned to the original format.

In March 2000, TMBG started the website dialasong.com, which was more reliable than the original, phone-based version, as it used a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] document to stream the songs.

In 2002, Dial-A-Song's answering machine broke down, and fans responded by sending new similar models. In the following year, Dial-A-Song resumed service with a new answering machine. By 2005, a computer system from TechTV was provided to maintain the system, but technical difficulties started bringing the system to an end.

In 2006, Dial-A-Song became increasingly difficult to maintain as a result of unreliable answering machines that had to be replaced. The stress placed upon the answering machine in addition to its age caused excessive wear, and the machine broke down soon after. In August, Dial-A-Song ceased production and because fans started taking advantage of the internet, it was replaced with a page promoting the They Might Be Giants [[podcast]]s.

John Linnell stated in an interview in early 2008 that Dial-A-Song had died of a technical crash, and that the Internet had taken over where the machine left off. On November 15, 2008, the Dial-A-Song number was officially disconnected, though the number has at times been re-used in a similar style by other independent artists.

===''They Might Be Giants'' and ''Lincoln'' (1986–1989)===
The duo released their [[They Might Be Giants (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1986, which became a college radio hit. The video for "Don't Let's Start", filmed in the [[New York State Pavilion]] built for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] in [[Queens]], became a hit on [[MTV]] in 1987, earning them a broader following. In 1988, they released their second album, ''[[Lincoln (album)|Lincoln]]'', named after the duo's hometown. It featured the song "[[Ana Ng]]" which reached No.&nbsp;11 on the US Modern Rock chart. Both albums were produced on 8-track tape at [[Dubway Studios]] in New York City.

===Move to Elektra (1989–1992)===
{{Listen|filename=Birdhouse In Your Soul Clip.ogg|title="Birdhouse In Your Soul"|description=Chorus of the charting single "Birdhouse In Your Soul".}}

In 1989, They Might Be Giants signed with [[Elektra Records]], and released their third album ''[[Flood (They Might Be Giants album)|Flood]]'' the following year. ''Flood'' earned them a platinum album, largely thanks to the success of "[[Birdhouse in Your Soul]]" which reached number three on the US Modern Rock chart, as well as "[[Istanbul (Not Constantinople)]]", a cover of a song originally by [[The Four Lads]].

In 1990, ''Throttle'' magazine interviewed They Might Be Giants and clarified the meaning of the song "Ana Ng": John Flansburgh said, "Ng is a Vietnamese name. The song is about someone who's thinking about a person on the exact opposite side of the world. John looked at a globe and figured out that if Ana Ng is in [[Vietnam]] and the person is on the other side of the world, then it must be written by someone in [[Peru]]".<ref>Derek Thomas, ''Throttle'', August 1990</ref>

Further interest in the band was generated when two cartoon music videos were created by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] for ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'': "[[Istanbul (Not Constantinople)|Istanbul]]" and "[[Particle Man]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Crumpler, Forest|date=April 4, 2001|title=They Might Be Giants: The best band you've never seen|work=Central Florida Future|url=http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/media/paper174/news/2001/04/04/Entertainment/They-Might.Be.Giants.The.Best.Band.Youve.Never.Seen-62643.shtml?norewrite200603220104&sourcedomain=www.centralfloridafuture.com|access-date=April 7, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182615/http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/media/paper174/news/2001/04/04/Entertainment/They-Might.Be.Giants.The.Best.Band.Youve.Never.Seen-62643.shtml?norewrite200603220104&sourcedomain=www.centralfloridafuture.com|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The videos reflected TMBG's high "kid appeal", resulting from their often absurd songs and poppy melodies.

In 1991, Bar/None Records released the B-sides compilation ''[[Miscellaneous T]]''.  The title referred to the section of the record store where TMBG releases were often found as well as to the overall eclectic nature of the tracks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Though consisting of previously released material (save for the "Purple Toupee" [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]], which were not available publicly), it gave new fans a chance to hear the Johns' earlier non-album work without having to hunt down the individual EPs.

In early 1992, They Might Be Giants released ''[[Apollo 18 (album)|Apollo 18]]''. The heavy space theme coincided with TMBG being named Musical Ambassadors for [[International Space Year]]. Singles from the album included "[[The Statue Got Me High]]", "[[I Palindrome I]]", and "[[The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)]]". ''Apollo 18'' was also notable for being one of the first albums to take advantage of the CD player's shuffle feature. The song "Fingertips" actually comprised 21 separate tracks — short snippets that not only acted together to make the song but that when played in random order would be interspersed between the album's full-length songs. Due to mastering errors, the UK and Australian versions of ''Apollo 18'' contained "Fingertips" as one track.

===Recruiting a band (1992–1998)===
Following ''Apollo 18'', for live shows, Flansburgh and Linnell (who themselves play the guitar and accordion or sax, respectively) decided to move away from recorded backing tracks, and recruited a supporting band ([[Kurt Hoffman]] of [[The Ordinaires]] on reeds and keyboards, longtime [[Pere Ubu (group)|Pere Ubu]] bassist [[Tony Maimone]], and drummer [[Jonathan Feinberg (drummer)|Jonathan Feinberg]]).

''[[John Henry (album)|John Henry]]'' was released in 1994. Influenced by their more conventional lineup, this album marked a departure from their previous releases with more of a guitar-heavy sound.<ref>{{cite web|author=McManus, Sean|title=They Might Be Giants|work=They Might Be Giants interview|url=http://www.sean.co.uk/a/musicjournalism/tmbg.shtm|access-date=February 26, 2006}}</ref> It was released to mixed reviews amongst fans and critics alike.

Their next album, ''[[Factory Showroom]]'', was released in 1996 to little fanfare. The band had quickly moved away from the feel of ''John Henry'', and ''Factory Showroom'' returns to the more diverse sounds of their earlier albums, despite the inclusion of two guitarists, the second being [[Eric Schermerhorn]] who provided several guitar solos.

They left Elektra after the duo refused to do a publicity show, amongst other exposure-related disputes.<ref name="gigantic">{{cite video|people=Flansburgh, John and Linnell, John|title=Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns|medium=DVD|date=2003}}</ref>

In 1998, they released a mostly-live album ''[[Severe Tire Damage (album)|Severe Tire Damage]]'' from which came the single "[[Doctor Worm]]", a studio recording.

Around this same time period, [[Danny Weinkauf]] (bass) and [[Dan Miller (guitarist)|Dan Miller]] (guitar) were recruited for their recording and touring band. Both had been members of the bands [[Lincoln (band)|Lincoln]] and Candy Butchers which were previous opening acts for TMBG. Weinkauf and Miller continue to work with the band to the present day.

===Beyond Elektra and move to Restless Records (1999–2003)===
For most of their career, TMBG has made innovative use of the Internet. As early as 1992, the band was sending news updates to their fans via Usenet newsgroups. In 1999, They Might Be Giants became the first major-label recording artist to release an entire album exclusively in [[mp3]] format. The album, ''[[Long Tall Weekend]]'',<ref>{{cite web

Also, in 1999, the band contributed the song "Dr. Evil" to the motion picture ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]''. Over their career, the band has performed on numerous movie and television soundtracks, including ''[[The Oblongs]]'', the [[ABC News]] miniseries ''[[Brave New World (miniseries)|Brave New World]]'' and ''Ed and His Dead Mother''. They also performed the theme music [[Bob Mould#Pop culture|"Dog on Fire"]], composed by [[Bob Mould]], for ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title= They Might Be Giants | work=NPR's On Point radio program  | url=http://onpoint.wbur.org/2011/09/30/they-might-be-giants |date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/books/see-a-little-light-by-bob-mould-of-husker-du-review.html|title= After Metal Music's Deafening Roar, Hüsker Dü's Guitarist Pauses to Reflect|author=Dwight Garner|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>
They composed and performed the music for the [[TLC Network|TLC]] series ''Resident Life'', the theme song for the [[Disney Channel]] program ''[[Higglytown Heroes]]'', and songs about the cartoons ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' and ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=TV And Movie Themes | work=This Might Be A Wiki | url=http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/TV_And_Movie_Themes | access-date=February 26, 2006}}</ref>

During this time, the band also worked on a project for [[McSweeney's]], a publishing company and literary journal. The band wrote a McSweeney's theme song and forty-four songs for an album that was meant to be listened to with the journal, with each track corresponding to a particular story or piece of artwork. Labeled ''They Might Be Giants vs. McSweeney's'', the disk appears in issue No.&nbsp;6 of ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]''.
{{Listen|filename=BossOfMe.ogg|title="Boss of Me"|description=Sample of the band's Grammy award winning theme song to Malcolm in the Middle.|format=Ogg}}

Contributing the single "[[Boss of Me]]" as the theme song to the hit television series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', as well as to the show's [[Music from Malcolm in the Middle|compilation CD]], brought a new audience to the band. Not only did the band contribute the theme, songs from all of the Giants' previous albums were used on the show: for example, the infamous punching-the-kid-in-the-wheelchair scene from the first episode was done to the strains of "Pencil Rain" from ''Lincoln''. Another song to feature in the series was "Spiraling Shape". "Boss of Me" became the band's second top-40 hit in the UK which they performed on long-running UK television programme [[Top of the Pops]], and in [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]], won the duo a [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Boss of Me by They Might Be Giants Songfacts | work=Songfacts | url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1714 | access-date=April 3, 2006}}</ref>

On September 11, 2001, they released the album ''[[Mink Car]]'' on [[Restless Records]]. It was their first full album release of new studio material since 1996 and their first since parting ways with Elektra. The making of that album, including a record signing event at a [[Manhattan]] [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], was included in a documentary directed by [[AJ Schnack]] titled ''[[Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)]]''. The film was released on DVD in 2003.

In 2002, they released ''[[No!]]'', their first album "for the entire family". Using the [[enhanced CD]] format, it included an interactive animation for most of the songs. They followed it up in 2003 with their first book, an illustrated children's book with an included EP, ''[[Bed, Bed, Bed]]''.

===Podcasting, independent releases, and children's music (2004–2015)===
[[Image:TMBG.jpg|thumb|left|275px|They Might Be Giants performing at Bar None, in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn, NY]]]]

In 2004, the band created one of the first artist-owned online music stores, at which customers could purchase and download MP3 copies of their music, both new releases and many previously released albums. By creating their own store, the band could keep money that would otherwise go to record companies. With the redesign of the band's website in 2010, the store was reincarnated.

Also, in 2004, the band released its first new "adult" rock work since the release of ''No!'', the EP ''[[Indestructible Object]]''. This was followed by a new album, ''[[The Spine (album)|The Spine]]'', and an associated EP, ''[[The Spine Surfs Alone]]''. It was at this time that Dan Hickey was replaced by [[Marty Beller]], who had previously collaborated with TMBG. For the album's first single, "[[Experimental Film (song)|Experimental Film]]", TMBG teamed up with [[Homestar Runner]] creators [[The Brothers Chaps|Matt and Mike Chapman]] to create an animated music video.<ref name="HRWikiExperimental">{{cite web | title=Experimental Film | url=http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Experimental_Film | work=Homestar Runner Wiki | date=March 13, 2004 | access-date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The band's collaboration with the Brothers Chaps also included several Puppet Jam segments with puppet Homestar and the music for a Strong Bad email titled "Different Town". In 2006 they recorded a track for the 200th [[Strong Bad]] e-mail, where Linnell provided the voice of The Poopsmith.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jeckell, Barry A.| date=April 16, 2004| title=TMBG Complete 10th Studio Album | work=Billboard | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000490229 | access-date=February 26, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=They Might Be Giants | url=http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/They_Might_Be_Giants | work=Homestar Runner Wiki | access-date=July 16, 2009}}</ref>

TMBG also contributed a track to the 2004 ''[[Future Soundtrack For America]]'' compilation, a project compiled by John Flansburgh with the help of [[Spike Jonze]] and [[Barsuk Records]]. The band contributed "[[Tippecanoe and Tyler too|Tippecanoe and Tyler Too]]", a political campaign song from the [[U.S. presidential election, 1840|presidential election of 1840]]. The compilation was released by [[Barsuk]] and featured indie, alternative, and high-profile acts such as [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[The Flaming Lips]], and [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]].

Following the ''Spine on the Hiway Tour'' of 2004, the band announced that they would take an extended hiatus from touring to focus on other projects, such as a musical produced by Flansburgh and written by his wife, [[Robin Goldwasser|Robin "Goldie" Goldwasser]], titled ''[[People Are Wrong!]]''.

2005 saw the release of ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]'', TMBG's follow-up to the successful children's album ''No!''. The Disney Sound label released the CD and DVD separately on February 15, 2005. To promote the album, Flansburgh and Linnell along with drummer Marty Beller embarked on a short tour, performing for free at many [[Borders Group|Borders Bookstore]] locations.  In November 2005, ''[[Venue Songs]]'' was released as a two-disc CD/DVD set narrated by [[John Hodgman]]. It is a [[concept album]] based on all of the "venue songs" from their 2004 tour.

TMBG [[cover version|cover]]ed the [[Devo]] song "[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]" in the 2005 Disney film ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.

From 2005 to 2014, They Might Be Giants made [[podcast]]s on a monthly, sometimes bi-monthly, basis. Each edition included remixes of previous songs, rarities, covers, and new songs and skits recorded specifically for the podcast.

The band contributed 14 original songs for the 2006 [[Dunkin' Donuts]] ad campaign, "America Runs on Dunkin'",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20830491/rocks_new_economy_making_money_when_cds_dont_sell/2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519094601/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20830491/rocks_new_economy_making_money_when_cds_dont_sell/2 |archive-date=May 19, 2008 |title=Rock's New Economy: Making Money When CDs Don't Sell |publisher=Rolling Stone |website=rollingstone.com |date=May 29, 2008 |access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref> including "Things I Like to Do", "Pleather", and "Fritalian".

The band has produced and performed three original songs for [[Playhouse Disney]] series: one for ''[[Higglytown Heroes]]'' and two for ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse features two original songs performed by group, including the opening theme song, in which a variant of a [[Mickey Mouse Club]] chant ("Meeska Mooska Mickey Mouse!") is used to summon the Clubhouse, and "Hot Dog!", the song used at the end of the show.  The song references Mickey's first spoken words in the 1929 short ''[[The Karnival Kid]]''.

They also recorded a cover of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] song, "[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]" for the film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' and wrote and performed the theme song for ''[[The Drinky Crow Show]]''. The band was recruited to provide original songs for the [[Henry Selick]]-directed [[Coraline (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s children's book ''[[Coraline]]'' but were dropped because their music was not "creepy" enough.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2008/112008/11272008/427729/index_html?page=2 |title=They Might Be Giants' John Flansburgh Shares Plans For A Slew Of New Albums While Revisiting Old Favorites Quirky Duo Bigger Than Ever |website=Fredericksburg.com |date=November 27, 2008 |access-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713152648/http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2008/112008/11272008/427729/index_html?page=2 |archive-date=July 13, 2012  }}</ref> Only one song, titled "Other Father Song", was kept for the film with Linnell singing as the titular "Other Father".
