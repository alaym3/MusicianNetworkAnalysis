In February 2019 Blum released a new single, "Things Still Left To Say,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/02/15/694403824/watch-mal-blum-returns-with-things-still-left-to-say|title=Watch: Mal Blum Returns With 'Things Still Left To Say'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> and in March 2019 they toured with Lucy Dacus.<ref name="Shows"/> That year they released the album ''Pity Boy'',<ref name=":0" />  recorded with Joe Reinhart of Hop Along at Headroom Studios in Philadelphia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.malblum.com/about|title = About}}</ref> Pitchfork's Abby Jones categorized Pity Boy as a shift "into potent pop-punk that recalls both Hop Along and Titus Andronicus." noting the newfound focus on guitarist Audrey Zee Whitesides' electric riffs, while maintaining the lyrics as "the album's centerpiece" writes Jones,<blockquote> ''If the electric guitar had evolved into a supporting actor by Blum’s last album, 2016’s You Look a Lot Like Me, then it’s the lead on Pity Boy. The nimble, vigorous riffs [...] ricocheting like rubber balls around “I Don’t Want To” and “Not My Job” with Blum’s vocals surging in countermelody.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mal Blum, Pity Boy, 7.5|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mal-blum-pity-boy/|last=Jones|first=Abby|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref></blockquote>

Max Cohen, in her review for Bandcamp's "Album of the Day" series, writes of Pity Boy's production value:
<blockquote> ''It’s punk in spirit, but the production is rich and warm, wrapping the power chords and solos in a sunny, welcoming fuzz. At their best, as on the jangly opener “Things Still Left to Say,” they sound like The Buzzcocks, if The Buzzcocks opted for compassion instead of bile.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bandcamp's Album of the Day|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mal-blum-pity-boy-review|last=Cohen|first=Max|website=Bandcamp|date=July 25, 2019|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref></blockquote>

In August 2020, Mal Blum was tapped to write music for Season 2 of Netflix's Trinkets television show. They wrote the song "Passenger Seat" to be used in a recurring story arc for the character Elodie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/mal-blum-on-writing-music-for-trinkets-queer-representation-and-the-trans-narratives-of-bruce-springsteen/|title=Mal Blum on Writing Music for "Trinkets," Queer Representation, and the Trans Narratives of Bruce Springsteen|date=September 15, 2020}}</ref>
