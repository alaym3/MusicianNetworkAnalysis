'''Roberta Cleopatra Flack''' (born February 10, 1937)<ref name="Motown Encyclopedia"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VHK8-HLS|title=Roberta Cleopatra Flack, 10 Feb 1937|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> is an American singer. She is known for her No. 1 singles "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]", "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]", "[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Roberta Flack song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]]"; and "[[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)|Where Is the Love]]" and "[[The Closer I Get to You]]", two of her many duets with [[Donny Hathaway]]. Flack is also noted for her influence on the subgenre of contemporary R&B called [[quiet storm]], along with her interpretations of songs by various songwriters, such as [[Leonard Cohen]] and members of [[The Beatles]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=2020-02-10|title=Why Is Roberta Flack's Influence On Pop So Undervalued?|language=en|work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/804370981/roberta-flack-the-virtuoso|access-date=2021-11-01}}</ref>

Flack was the first artist to win the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] in two consecutive years: "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" won in [[15th Annual Grammy Awards|1973]] and "Killing Me Softly with His Song" won in [[16th Annual Grammy Awards|1974]]. Only [[U2]] and [[Billie Eilish]] have repeated this feat.

When Flack was nine, she started taking an interest in playing the piano,<ref name="Soulwaking.co.uk"/> and during her early teens, Flack so excelled at classical piano that [[Howard University]] awarded her a full music scholarship.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.robertaflack.com/rfbio.html |title=Roberta Flack|publisher=Roberta Flack|access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref> By age 15, she entered Howard University, making her one of the youngest students ever to enroll there. She eventually changed her major from piano to voice and became an assistant conductor of the university choir. Her direction of a production of ''[[Aida]]'' received a standing ovation from the Howard University faculty.  Flack is a member of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] [[sorority]] and was made an honorary member of [[Tau Beta Sigma]] by the Eta Delta Chapter at Howard University for her outstanding work in promoting music education.

Roberta Flack became a [[student teacher]] at a school near [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]]. She graduated from Howard University at 19 and began [[graduate studies]] in music, but the sudden death of her father forced her to take a job teaching music and English in [[Farmville, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Roberta Flack, Best-Of Edition|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5355321|publisher=NPR|date=April 21, 2006|access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Before becoming a professional singer-songwriter, Flack returned to Washington, D.C., and taught at Banneker, Browne, and Rabaut Junior High Schools. She also taught private piano lessons out of her home on Euclid St. NW. During this period, her music career began to take shape on evenings and weekends in Washington, D.C. area night spots. At the Tivoli Club, she accompanied [[opera|opera singers]] at the piano. During intermissions, she would sing [[blues music|blues]], [[folk music|folk]], and pop standards in a back room, accompanying herself on the piano. Later, she performed several nights a week at the 1520 Club, again providing her own piano accompaniment. Around this time, her voice teacher, Frederick "Wilkie" Wilkerson, told her that he saw a brighter future for her in [[popular music|pop music]] than in the classics. She modified her repertoire accordingly and her reputation spread. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Flack began singing professionally after being hired to perform regularly at Mr. Henry's Restaurant, on [[Capitol Hill]], Washington, D.C., in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrhenrysrestaurant.com/ordereze/Content/5/Summary.aspx |title=Mr. Henry's Restaurant – History Summary |publisher=Mrhenrysrestaurant.com |access-date=2014-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319065121/http://www.mrhenrysrestaurant.com/ordereze/Content/5/Summary.aspx |archive-date=March 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrhenrysrestaurant.com/ordereze/1000/Page.aspx |title=Mr. Henry's Restaurant – Home |publisher=Mrhenrysrestaurant.com |access-date=2014-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222003758/http://www.mrhenrysrestaurant.com/ordereze/1000/Page.aspx |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The atmosphere in Mr. Henry's was welcoming, and the club turned into a showcase for the young music teacher. Her voice mesmerized locals and word spread. A-list entertainers who were appearing in town would come in late at night to hear her sing (frequent visitors included Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, Ramsey Lewis and others).

As restaurant owner Henry Yaffe recalled, "She told me if I could give her work there three nights a week, she would quit teaching."  He did and she did.

To meet Roberta's exacting standards, Yaffe transformed the apartment above the bar into the Roberta Flack Room. "I got the oak paneling from the old Dodge Hotel near Union Station. I put in heavy upholstered chairs, sort of a conservative style from the 50s and an acoustical system designed especially for Roberta. She was very demanding. She was a perfectionist."

===1970s===

[[Les McCann]] discovered Flack singing and playing [[jazz]] in a Washington nightclub.<ref name = "Soulwaking.co.uk"/> He later said on the liner notes of what would be her first album ''First Take'' noted below, "Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known. I laughed, cried, and screamed for more...she alone had the voice."  Very quickly, he arranged an [[audition]] for her with [[Atlantic Records]], during which she played 42 songs in 3 hours for producer [[Joel Dorn]]. In November 1968, she recorded 39 song demos in less than 10 hours. Three months later, Atlantic reportedly recorded Flack's debut album, ''[[First Take (album)|First Take]]'', in a mere 10 hours.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Flack later spoke of those studio sessions as a "very naive and beautiful approach... I was comfortable with the music because I had worked on all these songs for all the years I had worked at Mr. Henry's."

In 1971, Flack participated in the legendary [[Soul to Soul (film)|''Soul to Soul'' concert film]] by [[Denis Sanders]], which was headlined by [[Wilson Pickett]], along with [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Les McCann]], [[Eddie Harris]], The Voices of Harlem, and others. The U.S. delegation of musical artists was invited to perform for 14th anniversary of [[African independence movements|African independence]] in [[Ghana]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/soul-to-soul|title=Soul to Soul (film review)|website=Time Out|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref> The film was digitally reissued on DVD and CD in 2004 but Flack declined permission for her image and recording to be included for unknown reasons. Her [[a cappella]] performance of the traditional spiritual "[[Oh, Freedom|Oh Freedom]]" retitled "Freedom Song" on the original [[Soul to Soul (soundtrack)|''Soul to Soul'' LP soundtrack]] is only available in the VHS version of the film.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Soul to Soul World Catalog Search Results|oclc = 840123917}}</ref>

Flack's [[cover song|cover version]] of "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]" hit number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. Her Atlantic recordings did not sell particularly well, until actor/director [[Clint Eastwood]] chose a song from ''First Take'', "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]" written by [[Ewan MacColl]], for the sound track of his directorial debut ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''; it became the biggest hit of the year for 1972, spending six consecutive weeks at #1 and earning Flack a million-selling Gold disc.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/312 312]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/312}}</ref> It finished the year as [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972|Billboard]]'s top song of 1972. The ''First Take'' album also went to #1 and eventually sold 1.9&nbsp;million copies in the United States. Eastwood, who paid $2,000 for the use of the song in the film,<ref name="McGillagan194">McGillagan (1999), p.194</ref> has remained an admirer and friend of Flack's ever since.  It was awarded the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] in 1973. In 1983, she recorded the end music to the [[Dirty Harry]] film ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' at Eastwood's request.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/>

In 1972, Flack began recording regularly with [[Donny Hathaway]], scoring hits such as the Grammy-winning "[[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)|Where Is the Love]]" (1972) and later "[[The Closer I Get to You]]" (1978), both million-selling gold singles.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Flack and Hathaway recorded several duets together, including two LPs, until Hathaway's 1979 death.

On her own, Flack scored her second #1 hit in 1973, "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]" written by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]], [[Norman Gimbel]] and [[Lori Lieberman]].<ref name=deseret12June1997>{{cite news|last=Pond|first=Steve|title=Singer's Career Was Softly Killed By Bad Luck And Insecurity |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HJkRAAAAIBAJ&pg=6439%2C710421 |access-date=2020-11-18 |newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] |date=June 12, 1997 |page=C5}}</ref> It was awarded both [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]] at the 1974 [[Grammy Awards]].  Its [[Killing Me Softly (Roberta Flack album)|parent album]] was Flack's biggest-selling disc, eventually earning [[double platinum]] certification. In 1974, Flack released "[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Roberta Flack song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]]," which became her third and final #1 hit to date on the Hot 100.  That same year, Flack sang the lead on a [[Sherman Brothers]] song called "Freedom", which featured prominently at the opening and closing of the movie ''[[Huckleberry Finn (1974 film)|Huckleberry Finn]]''. Also in that same year, she performed "When We Grow Up" with a teenage [[Michael Jackson]] on the 1974 television special, ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]''. Then, in her only film role, she served as the narrator for ''The Legend of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]''.

===1980s===
[[File:Roberta Flack.jpg|thumb|upright|Flack in 1995]]
Flack had a 1982 hit single with "[[Making Love (song)|Making Love]]", written by [[Burt Bacharach]] (the title track of the [[Making Love|1982 film of the same name]]), which reached #13. She began working with [[Peabo Bryson]] with more limited success, charting as high as #5 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] (plus #16 Pop and #4 Adult Contemporary) with "[[Tonight, I Celebrate My Love]]" in 1983. Her next two singles with Bryson, "You're Looking Like Love To Me" and "I Just Came Here To Dance," fared better on [[adult contemporary]] (AC) radio than on pop or [[R&B]] radio.

In 1986, Flack sang the theme song entitled "Together Through the Years" for the [[NBC]] television series ''Valerie'', later known as ''[[The Hogan Family]]''. The song was used throughout the show's six seasons. In 1987 Flack supplied the voice of Michael Jackson's mother in the 18-minute short film for [[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bad by Michael Jackson |url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/michael-jackson/bad |website=Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts®, LLC |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref>  ''[[Oasis (Roberta Flack album)|Oasis]]'' was released in 1988 and failed to make an impact with pop audiences, though the title track reached #1 on the [[R&B]] chart and a remix of "[[Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)]]" topped the [[Hot Dance Club Play|dance]] chart in 1989.  Flack found herself again in the US [[Top 40|Top 10]] with the hit song "Set the Night to Music", a 1991 duet with Jamaican vocalist [[Maxi Priest]] that peaked at #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts and #2 AC. Flack's smooth R&B sound lent itself easily to [[Easy Listening]] airplay during the 1970s, and she has had four #1 AC hits.

===Later career===
[[File:Roberta Flack in August 2013.jpg|thumb|240px|Flack performing in 2013]]
In 1999, a star with Flack's name was placed on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="bio"/> That same year, she gave a concert tour in South Africa; the final performance was attended by President [[Nelson Mandela]]. In 2010, she appeared on the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, singing a duet of "Where Is The Love" with Maxwell.

In February 2012, Flack released ''Let it Be Roberta'', an album of [[The Beatles|Beatles]] covers including "[[Hey Jude]]" and "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]". It was her first recording in over eight years.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roberta-flack-gearing-release-album-181300098.html | title = Roberta Flack Gearing Up for Release of New Album "LET IT BE ROBERTA: ROBERTA FLACK SINGS THE BEATLES," an Album of Beatles' Classics | publisher = Yahoo!

At age 80, Flack made her most recent recording, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcckU9t9zi4 Running]'', the closing credits song of the 2018 feature documentary ''[[3100: Run and Become]]'' with music and lyrics by [[Michael A.

== Critical reputation ==
Flack's minimalist, classically trained approach to her songs was seen by a number of critics as lacking in grit and uncharacteristic of soul music. According to music scholar Jason King, her work was regularly described with the adjectives "boring", "depressing", "lifeless", "studied", and "calculated";<ref name="Weisbard"/> [[AllMusic]]'s Steve Huey said it has been called "classy, urbane, reserved, smooth, and sophisticated".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roberta-flack-mn0000290072/biography|title=Roberta Flack|date=n.d.|last=Huey|first=Steve|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>  In 1971, ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] reported that "Flack is generally regarded as the most significant new black woman singer since [[Aretha Franklin]], and at moments she sounds kind, intelligent, and very likable. But she often exhibits the gratuitous gentility you'd expect of someone who says 'between you and I'."

Reviewing her body of work from the 1970s, he later argued that the singer "has nothing whatsoever to do with rock and roll or rhythm and blues and almost nothing to do with soul", comparing her [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] aesthetic to [[Barry Manilow]] but with better taste, which he believed does not necessarily guarantee more enduring music: "In the long run, pop lies are improved by vulgarity."<ref name="Weisbard">{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/listenagainmomen00weis/page/183 183]|editor-last=Weisbard|editor-first=Eric|year=2007|title=Listen Again: A Momentary History of Pop Music|url=https://archive.org/details/listenagainmomen00weis|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=978-0822340416}}</ref>

Writer and music critic [[Ann Powers]] argued in a 2020 piece for NPR that "Flack's presence looms over both R&B and indie "bedroom" pop as if she were one of the astral beings in Ava DuVernya's version of ''A Wrinkle In Time.''" <ref name=":0" /> Jason King argued that she occupies a complex place in popular music, as "the nature of her power as a performer — to generate rapturous, spellbinding mood music and to plumb the depths of soulful heaviness by way of classically-informed technique — is not too easy to claim or make sense with the limited tools that we have in music criticism."<ref name=":0" />

==Personal life==
Flack is a member of the Artist Empowerment Coalition, which advocates the right of artists to control their creative properties. She is also a spokeswoman for the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]; her appearance in commercials for the ASPCA featured "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face". In the Bronx section of New York City, the Hyde Leadership Charter School's after-school music program is called "The Roberta Flack School of Music" and is in partnership with Flack, who founded the school, which provides free music education to underprivileged students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertaflack.com/roberta-flack-school-of-music.php |title=Roberta Flack School of Music |publisher=Robertaflack.com |access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref>

Between 1966 and 1972, she was married to [[Steve Novosel]]. Together, they had a son, [[Bernard Wright]], who became a successful funk and jazz keyboardist and producer.<ref name = "Soulwaking.co.uk"/><ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|last1=DeCurtis|first1=Anthony|title=Two Seasoned Voices, Together Raised for a Cause|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/23/arts/two-seasoned-voices-together-raised-for-a-cause.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2015-01-14|date=March 23, 1997}}</ref> Flack is the aunt of professional ice skater [[Rory Flack]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobson |first1=Robert |title=Roberta Flack – Biography |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Roberta_Flack.aspx#1 |website=encyclopedia.com |publisher=encyclopedia.com |access-date=2015-01-14}}</ref><ref name="New York Times"/>
