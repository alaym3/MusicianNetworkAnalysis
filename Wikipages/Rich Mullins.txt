Mullins was devoted to the Christian faith and heavily influenced by [[St. Francis of Assisi]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
[[File:Black and White picture of Christian Music Singer Rich Mullins and his First Band.png|thumb|Mullins ''(third from right)'' performing in 1979, seen here with his band Zion]]

Richard Wayne Mullins was born to John Mullins, a tree farmer, and Neva Mullins, who was associated with the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].<ref>An Arrow Pointing to Heaven Smith, JB (2000) B & H Publishing Group Nashville, Tennessee {{ISBN|978-0-8054-2635-9}} p. 12, 13</ref> He had two sisters and two brothers. The family called him by his middle name, Wayne, which he went by until college, when his friends called him Richard. Mullins grew up attending Arba Friends Meeting, a church in [[Lynn, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Selleck |first = Linda |date = April 3, 1998 |title = A Ragamuffin Music Man: Rich Mullins |magazine = Quaker Magazine }}</ref> The Quaker testimonies of [[peace testimony|peace]] and [[social justice]] later inspired many of his lyrics. When Mullins was in elementary school, his family moved and started attending Whitewater Christian Church, which he attended until he graduated.<ref name="The Life of a Ragamuffin">{{cite web |url = http://www.candletothesun.com/richard-wayne-rich-mullins.html |title = The Life of a Ragamuffin |publisher = A Candle to the Sun |access-date = May 25, 2016 }}</ref> Mullins was baptized when he was in the 3rd grade.<ref name="Lufkin, Texas, July '97">{{cite web |url = http://www.kidbrothers.net/words/concert-transcripts/lufkin-texas-jul1997.html |title = Lufkin Texas, July '97 }}</ref> His great-grandmother taught him to play hymns and sing in four part harmony when he was very young,<ref>{{cite web |last = Lewis |first = Jack |url = http://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2002/09/in_memory_of_ri.php |title = Danny Carlton – alias "Jack Lewis": In memory of Rich Mullins |publisher = Jacklewis.net |date = September 19, 2002 |access-date = October 31, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130502235534/http://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2002/09/in_memory_of_ri.php |archive-date = May 2, 2013 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref> and he began to study classical piano with a Quaker teacher while in elementary school. He graduated from [[Northeastern High School (Indiana)|Northeastern High School]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.courierpress.com/features/movies/ind-art-museum-to-feature-film-on-late-musician-ep-296664338-324751881.html |title = Ind. art museum to feature film on late musician |newspaper = Evansville Courier & Press |date = December 29, 2013 |access-date = May 25, 2016 }}</ref>

Mullins was inspired when [[the Beatles]] first appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. The event helped Mullins understand the influence of music.<ref name="Newcomb">{{cite magazine |last = Newcomb |first = Brian |date = June 13, 1992 |title = Step By Step, A Conversation with Rich Mullins |magazine = CCM Magazine }}</ref> He was a fan of the Beatles music, and he was able to identify with [[John Lennon]] in particular, despite philosophical differences.<ref name="auto">{{cite video |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP0NGqymiMU |title = Rich Mullins - Michigan Interview, 1988}}</ref> In his song "Elijah", written around the time of Lennon's murder, he included the phrase "candlelight in [[Central Park]]." This was a reference to the [[candlelight vigil]]s held in the wake of the event.<ref name="Newcomb" /> The places of the vigils went on to become a permanent [[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|memorial to John Lennon]].

An important part of Mullins' early musical experience was being the pianist, songwriter and vocalist for the New Creations Choir in Richmond, Indiana, which was started by Tim and Bonnie Cummings in the early 1970s. The choir toured numerous states in its own bus and even produced an album. New Creations is a church and school for teens, and Mullins was a contributing factor in its beginning.<ref name="The Life of a Ragamuffin" />

From 1974 to 1978, Mullins attended [[Cincinnati Christian University|Cincinnati Bible College]]. He worked in a parking garage to help pay for his schooling. During this time Mullins performed with a college band, and later the band Zion, who released one album, for which he wrote all the songs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kidbrothers.net/rmml/rmml03.html |title = Rich Mullins Mailing list 103 |publisher = kidbrothers.net |date = April 17, 1995 |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref>

From 1975 to 1978, he was the youth pastor and music director at the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[Erlanger, Kentucky|Erlanger]].<ref>[http://www.erlangerumc.org/mullins.htm erlangerumc.org/mullins]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154601/http://www.erlangerumc.org/mullins.htm |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Mullins was then focusing on his duties in the church, and performed minimally in public. He considered his music a hobby. His views on his music continued this way until 1978, when he brought a group of the teens from his church to the [[Ichthus Music Festival]] in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]]. He said that during this trip he witnessed the effect of music on young people, and decided to start pursuing music full-time.<ref>{{cite video |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WOiBYv5SHA |title = Rich Mullins discusses college, youth ministry and Zion Ministries}}</ref>

=== Beginnings as a recording artist ===

Mullins' start in the [[Christian music industry]] occurred in mid-1981 when [[Amy Grant]] recorded his song "Sing Your Praise to the Lord."<ref name="cartoons">{{cite news |last = Yonke |first = David |date = November 18, 1995 |title = Rich Mullins 'cartoons' in catchy tunes |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YOE0AAAAIBAJ&pg=6075%2C5328078 |newspaper = Toledo Blade |access-date = May 5, 2016 }}</ref> The decision was made to stop touring as "Zion," and for Mullins to start his [[Solo artist|solo]] career. He moved to [[Bellsburg, Tennessee]],<ref name="auto"/> approximately 45 minutes from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], to begin his professional recording career.<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1">{{cite web |url = http://audiori.net/richmullins/timeline19551985.html |title = Rich Mullins timeline 1 – audiori.net }}</ref> Mullins got engaged sometime between the late 70s and early 80s, and wrote the song "Doubly Good to You" (recorded by Amy Grant on her album ''Straight Ahead'') for his upcoming wedding. However, his fiancée broke off the engagement in 1982.<ref name="auto"/> In response to the breakup, Mullins wrote "Damascus Road".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://kidbrothers.net/words/interviews/brothers-keeper-radio-special-oct95.html |title = Brothers Keeper radio special |publisher = Kidbrothers.net |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author = Rick Tarrant |url = http://kidbrothers.net/words/interviews/20-the-countdown-magazine-oct1197.html |title = 20: the Countdown Magazine remembers Rich Mullins |publisher = Kidbrothers.net |date = October 11, 1997 |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref>

Years later, Mullins shared thoughts about his relationships and personal life in a radio interview with Rick Tarrant:

{{quote|quote=I would always be frustrated with all those relationships even when I was engaged. I had a ten-year thing with this girl and I would often wonder why, even in those most intimate moments of our relationship, I would still feel really lonely. And it was just a few years ago that I finally realized that friendship is not a remedy for loneliness. Loneliness is a part of our experience and if we are looking for relief from loneliness in friendship, we are only going to frustrate the friendship. Friendship, camaraderie, intimacy, all those things, and loneliness live together in the same experience.<ref name="Heaven Smith 2000 p. 131, 13">An Arrow Pointing to Heaven Smith, JB (2000) B & H Publishing Group Nashville, Tennessee {{ISBN|978-0-8054-2635-9}} p. 131, 13</ref>}}

In 1987, Mullins spent time teaching conversational English in a South Korean seminary. He then served briefly as a [[Christian mission|missionary]] in Thailand, in a town approximately {{convert|2|miles}} from the Thailand-Chinese border. There he became involved with a ministry teaching trades and providing medical care to Chinese refugees.<ref name="auto"/> He wrote the song "The Other Side of the World" about his time in Asia.

=== Kansas and the move to Navajo Nation ===
[[File:DineBikeyahBe'elyaigii.svg|thumb|The location of the [[Navajo Nation]] territory in the United States]]
During the late 1980s, Mullins desired change and formulated a plan to leave Tennessee.<ref name="Newcomb" /> He took steps to become a music teacher on an [[Indian reservation]] he had visited before.<ref name="cartoons" /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-04-25/features/9604250272_1_mullins-friends-rich-mullins-awesome-god |title = Christian Rocker Finds New Life in the Desert |publisher = Chicago Tribune. |date = April 25, 1996 |access-date = June 1, 2016 }}</ref> In 1988, Mullins moved from Bellsburg to [[Wichita, Kansas]] where, in 1991, he attended [[Friends University]]. During this time he lived with his best friend, [[Beaker (musician)|David Strasser]] (aka "Beaker"). As part of his degree program, Mullins served as the choir director at West Evangelical Free Church. While in Wichita, he also regularly attended Central Christian Church. He graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] (BA) in Music Education from Friends University on May 14, 1995.<ref>{{cite news |last = Denison |first = Paul |date = October 29, 1995 |title = Stepping Out in Faith |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qEZWAAAAIBAJ&pg=5230%2C7343759 |newspaper = Eugene Register-Guard |access-date = May 26, 2016 }}</ref> His 1991 song "Calling Out Your Name" included a reference to [[The Keeper of the Plains]], a 44&nbsp;ft tall sculpture in Wichita.<ref name="Heaven Smith 2000 p. 104">An Arrow Pointing to Heaven Smith, JB (2000) B & H Publishing Group Nashville, Tennessee {{ISBN|978-0-8054-2635-9}} p. 104</ref>

}}</ref>}}

After graduation, he and [[Mitch McVicker]] moved to a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] reservation in [[Tse Bonito, New Mexico]] to teach music to children. Rich and McVicker lived in a small [[hogan]] on the reservation until Mullins' death in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-04-25/features/9604250272_1_mullins-friends-rich-mullins-awesome-god |title = Christian Rocker Finds New Life in the Desert |publisher = Chicago Tribune. |access-date = June 1, 2016 }}</ref>

In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited personal reasons for his move. He was asked if he made the move because God had called him to [[Proselytism#Christianity|proselytize]] and convert the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. To this Mullins responded, "no. I think I just got tired of a White, [[Evangelical]], middle class perspective on God, and I thought I would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos. I'm teaching music."<ref>{{cite video |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zQOX8NmC0c |title = Rich Mullins Interview – Ichthus Festival, 1996 }}</ref>

=== Philosophy and philanthropy ===

The profits from his tours and the sale of each album were entrusted to his church, which divided it up, paid Mullins the average salary for a laborer in the U.S. for that year, and gave the rest to charity.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kidbrothers.net/legacy/homeless-man-video.html |title = Homeless Man video transcript |publisher = kidbrothers.net |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref> Mullins was also a major supporter of [[Compassion International]]<ref name="Music and More Interview with Jon Rivers">{{cite web |url = http://kidbrothers.net/interviews/musicandmore.html |title = Music and More Interview with Jon Rivers }}</ref> and Compassion USA.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://kidbrothers.net/webpage/rmml/rmml143.html |title = Rich Mullins Mailing List 143 |publisher = kidbrothers.net |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref>

His philosophy can be understood by a quote he gave at a concert shortly before his death. He said,

{{quote|quote=Jesus said whatever you do to the least of these my brothers you've done it to me. And this is what I've come to think.  That if I want to identify fully with Jesus Christ, who I claim to be my Savior and Lord, the best way that I can do that is to identify with the poor. This I know will go against the teachings of all the popular [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] preachers.  But they're just wrong.  They're not bad, they're just wrong. Christianity is not about building an absolutely secure little niche in the world where you can live with your perfect little wife and your perfect little children in a beautiful little house where you have no gays or minority groups anywhere near you.  Christianity is about learning to love like Jesus loved and Jesus loved the poor and Jesus loved the broken-hearted.<ref name="Lufkin, Texas, July '97" /><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQnFU5JvuWY
''(The quoted speech begins at 7:40 of this video reference.)''</ref>}}

=== Roman Catholicism===
Mullins's interest in Saint Francis of Assisi led to an attraction to Roman Catholicism in his final years. There was no daily Protestant service on the Navajo reservation, so Mullins frequently attended daily Mass. He never converted, and there is dispute over his intentions.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=5876 |title = Catholic World News : Christian Singer Rich Mullins Dies; Planned To Become Catholic |publisher = Cwnews.com |date = September 22, 1997 |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://tmatt.gospelcom.net/column/1998/05/06/ |title = Rich Mullins, Enigmatic, restless, Catholic |work = gospelcom.net |access-date = June 1, 2016 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20020618221716/http://tmatt.gospelcom.net/column/1998/05/06/ |archive-date = June 18, 2002 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>An Arrow Pointing to Heaven, James Bryan Smith, pp53-54{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>

In 1997 Mullins declared,

{{quote|quote=A lot of the stuff which I thought was so different between Protestants and Catholics [was] not, but at the end of going through an RCIA [Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults] course, I also realized that there are some real and significant differences. I'm not sure which side of the issues I come down on. My openness to Catholicism was very scary to me because, when you grow up in a church where they don't even put up a cross, many things were foreign to me. I went to an older Protestant gentleman that I've respected for years and years, and I asked him, "When does faithfulness to Jesus call us to lay aside our biases and when does it call us to stand beside them?" His answer to me was that it is not about being Catholic or Protestant. It is about being faithful to Jesus. The issue is not about which church you go to, it is about following Jesus where He leads you.<ref>Radio interview with Artie Terry, "The Exchange," WETN, Wheaton, Ill., April 1997, quoted in An Arrow Pointing to Heaven, James Bryan Smith, p54</ref>}}

== Music career ==

Mullins had a distinctive talent both as a performer and a songwriter. His compositions showed distinction in two ways: unusual and sometimes striking [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and complex [[lyrics]] that usually employed elaborate [[metaphor]]s.

Mullins did most of his composing and performing on piano and acoustic guitar, but he also had a prodigious talent for obscure instruments. He displayed arguably virtuoso skills on the [[hammered dulcimer|hammered]] and [[lap dulcimer]]s (in "Calling out Your Name" and "Creed") and the [[Irish tin whistle]] (in "Boy Like Me/Man Like You" and "The Color Green").

Mullins formed his first band in 1976 to 77 while attending [[Cincinnati Christian University|Cincinnati Bible College]].<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1" />  In 1983 [[Debby Boone]] recorded Mullins' "O Come All Ye Faithful", for her ''Surrender'' album. In 1984, the song was also featured in a TV film, ''Sins of the Past''.<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1" />
[[File:Chrisian Music Singer Rich Mullins with his First Formal Band, Zion.png|thumb|Mullins ''(second from right)'' pictured with his band Zion {{circa|1978}}|alt=]]
His musical career formally began with Zion Ministries in the late 1970s, where he wrote music and performed with a band called Zion.<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1" />
The band released one album in 1981, ''Behold the Man''.<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1" /> While working for this ministry, Mullins wrote a song called "[[Age_to_Age#Chart_positions|Sing Your Praise to the Lord]]", which was recorded by singer [[Amy Grant]] in 1982 and became an immediate hit on [[Christian radio]].<ref name="Rich Mullins time line 1" />

In 1986, Mullins released his eponymous [[Rich Mullins (album)|debut album]], followed in 1987 by ''[[Pictures in the Sky]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://audiori.net/richmullins/timeline1987.html |title = Rich Mullins timeline 1987 – audiori.net |publisher = Audiori.net |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref> Neither album sold very well,<ref name="Music and More Interview with Jon Rivers" /> but the Christian radio hit "[[Awesome God]]" on his third album, ''[[Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth]]'', brought his music to a wider audience. The song "Awesome God" was written on the way to a youth conference in Bolivar, Missouri in July 1987.

In the early 1990s, Mullins released a pair of albums entitled ''[[The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume One]]'' and ''[[The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume Two|Volume Two]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://audiori.net/richmullins/timeline1992.html |title = Rich Mullins timeline 1992 – audiori.net |publisher = Audiori.net |access-date = October 31, 2012 }}</ref> These featured a more stripped-back, acoustic feel than his earlier work, with nods to [[Irish music]]. "Step By Step", a song written by his friend [[David Strasser|Beaker]] and included on volume one, and incorporated into "Sometimes By Step" with additional lyrics by Mullins on volume two, became an instant hit on Christian radio, and, like "Awesome God", it became a popular praise chorus. Both during and after Mullins' college years, Beaker was a substantial influence on Mullins and his music. Beaker co-wrote, performed, and toured with Mullins for several years. The first song they wrote together was "Boy Like Me, Man Like You", a 1991 hit for Mullins. Mullins wrote his hit song "Let Mercy Lead" for Beaker's son Aidan.

In 1993, Mullins assembled a group of Nashville musicians (including [[Jimmy Abegg]], Beaker, Billy Crockett, [[Phil Madeira]], [[Rick Elias]], and [[Aaron Smith (musician)|Aaron Smith]]) to form [[A Ragamuffin Band]], whose name was inspired by the Christian book ''[[The Ragamuffin Gospel]]'' by [[Brennan Manning]]. The band recorded ''[[A Liturgy, a Legacy, & a Ragamuffin Band]]'', which was later named the No. 3 best Christian album of all time by ''[[CCM Magazine]]''. ''Liturgy'' was a [[concept album]] that drew its inspiration, in part, from the [[Roman Catholic liturgy|Catholic liturgy]]. The Ragamuffins also appeared on Mullins' 1995 record ''[[Brother's Keeper (Rich Mullins album)|Brother's Keeper]]'' and his 1998 record ''The Jesus Record''. [[Mark Robertson (bassist)|Mark Robertson]] joined the Ragamuffins as the band's bass player for touring and ''The Jesus Record''.

In 1997, Mullins teamed up with Beaker and Mitch McVicker to write a musical based on the life of [[St. Francis of Assisi]]: ''The Canticle of the Plains''.<ref name="Mullins Takes Risk with Show on Saint, But Fans Keep Faith" /> Mullins had great respect for St. Francis, and even formed "The Kid Brothers of St. Frank" in the late 1980s with Beaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmullins.com/kidbrothers.html |title=richmullins.com/kidbrothers |publisher=Richmullins.com |access-date=October 31, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529035529/http://www.richmullins.com/kidbrothers.html |archive-date=May 29, 2010 }}</ref>

Shortly before his death, Mullins had been working on his next project, which was to be a concept album based on the life of [[Jesus Christ]] and was to be called ''Ten Songs About Jesus''. On September 10, 1997, nine days before his death, he made a rough [[microcassette]] recording of the album's songs in an abandoned church. This tape was released as disc 1 of ''[[The Jesus Record]]'', which featured new recordings of the songs on disc 2 by the Ragamuffin Band, with guest vocalists Amy Grant, [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Ashley Cleveland]], and [[Phil Keaggy]]. "Heaven in His Eyes" was not a new song, but had been written more than two decades earlier, and was a beloved favorite of Mullins'.

Mullins recorded the duet "I Believe" with [[Hokus Pick]] on the album ''Brothers From Different Mothers'' in 1994. In addition to vocals, Mullins performed on the lap and hammered dulcimers.<ref name=duet>{{cite book |last = Hkous Pick |title = Bothers From Different Mothers |year = 1994 |publisher = Vision Artists |location = Liner Notes }}</ref>

== Death and legacy ==

On September 19, 1997, Mullins and his friend [[Mitch McVicker]] were traveling southbound on [[Interstate 39|I-39]] north of [[Bloomington, Illinois]], to a [[benefit concert]] at Wichita State University in Kansas, when they lost control of their Jeep. They were not wearing seat belts and were both ejected from the vehicle.<ref>{{cite news |date = September 22, 1997 |title = Christian singer killed in accident |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nDofAAAAIBAJ&pg=6242%2C5959601 |newspaper = Herald-Journal |access-date = May 26, 2016 }}</ref> When a [[semi-trailer truck]] traveling in the same direction swerved to miss the overturned Jeep, Mullins, who was too injured to move out of the path of the oncoming truck, was hit by the rig and died instantly.<ref>{{cite news |date = September 22, 1997 |title = Christian singer killed in accident |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WYsfAAAAIBAJ&pg=2037%2C4386217 |newspaper = Sarasota Herald-Tribune – September 23, 1997 |access-date = May 26, 2016 }}</ref> McVicker was seriously injured but survived.

[[File:RichMullins7-19-1997.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mullins performing in 1997]]
Mullins's funeral was open to the public and had a large gathering. He is buried at the [[Harrison Township, Darke County, Ohio|Harrison Township]] cemetery in [[Hollansburg, Ohio]], alongside his brother, who died in infancy, and his father.
