'''Pale Saints''' were an English [[alternative rock]]/[[shoegazing]] band formed in 1987 in [[Leeds]] by singer-bassist [[Ian Masters (songwriter)|Ian Masters]], guitarist Graeme Naysmith and drummer Chris Cooper.<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 907-908</ref>

==History==

The group began as a jangly [[indie pop]] band influenced by [[Primal Scream]]'s early sound. By the time they recorded their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''Barging Into the Presence of God'', released in 1989, the band went into a direction that displayed a mix of Ian Masters' ethereal, choirboy-like vocals along with dark atmospheric and noisy pop tunes. Ashley Horner from [[Edsel Auctioneer]] briefly joined the band on guitar in the same year.<ref name="Strong" /> The band was signed to [[4AD Records]] after their first [[London]] [[concert|show]] by the label's chief [[Ivo Watts-Russell]].<ref name="Strong" />

The group's first album, ''[[The Comforts of Madness (album)|The Comforts of Madness]]'', was released in 1990 and reached the top 40 of the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Strong" /> The album's tracks were [[record producer|produced]] by [[John Fryer (music)|John Fryer]] and [[Gil Norton]].<ref name="Kellman">Kellman, Andy "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13895/biography|pure_url=yes}} Pale Saints Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> The album includes a [[cover version]] of "Fell From the Sun" by [[Opal (band)|Opal]].

In late 1990, Meriel Barham, the original vocalist of [[Lush (band)|Lush]], joined the band as second guitarist and vocalist.<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Kellman" /> Barham contributed backing vocals and guitars to the [[Chris Allison]] produced ''Half-Life'' EP, then joined permanently for the [[Nancy Sinatra]] [[Cover version|cover]] "Kinky Love", which gave the band a [[UK Singles Chart|minor hit single]] as part of ''Flesh Balloon'' EP.  In 1992 the band recorded their second full-length album, ''In Ribbons'', which was produced by [[Hugh Jones (producer)|Hugh Jones]].<ref name="Kellman" /> Citing his lack of enthusiasm for touring, particularly after a short-lived tour to the US/Canada in 1992 - a direction which the remaining members of the band and 4AD were keen to take - Ian Masters left the band in 1993.<ref name="Kellman" /> Former [[The Heart Throbs (band)|Heart Throbs]] bassist Colleen Browne joined afterwards.<ref name="Strong" />

Sticking with producer Hugh Jones, the group released the ''Fine Friend'' EP in mid-1994, followed by their third album, ''Slow Buildings''.<ref name="Kellman" />

The group toured Europe and the United States in late autumn 1994. Their final studio recording was a version of "[[Jersey Girl (song)|Jersey Girl]]" for the [[Tom Waits]] tribute album ''[[Step Right Up]]''.  Meriel Barham departed in September 1995, and the group eventually disbanded in 1996.<ref name="Kellman" />

In conjunction with the August 2020 [[Record Store Day]] release of the Japanese singles compilation ''Mrs. Dolphin'' on vinyl for the first time, Masters worked with director and Big Beautiful Bluebottle bandmate Terako Terao to make a video for "Sight of You."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://4ad.com/news/25/8/2020/palesaintsunveilvideoforsightofyouaheadofrecordstorydayrelease | title=Pale Saints: Pale Saints Unveil Video For 'Sight Of You' Ahead Of Record Story Day Release | publisher=[[4AD Records]] | date=25 August 2020 | accessdate=14 September 2020}}</ref>

==Post-band projects==
Masters continues to create music, often of an experimental nature. His first project after Pale Saints was [[Spoonfed Hybrid]] with former [[A.C. Temple]] member Chris Trout.<ref name="Strong" />  They released their self-titled debut album in 1993, and their second album, ''Hibernation Shock'' was released in 1996. In 1994, Masters, recording under the name Pail Saint, released the album ''Noise Bucket'' on Time Stereo, the label run by [[His Name Is Alive]] auteur [[Warren Defever]]. Masters and Defever then teamed up and  began to release music as [[ESP Summer]].<ref name="Strong" /> In autumn 1998, Masters released a 7-inch EP under the name Friendly Science Orchestra entitled ''Miniature Album'', which became an [[NME]] 'Single of the Week'. {{As of|2005}}, Masters lived in [[Japan]]. His projects, including Wingdisk with Mark Tranmer of Gnac and The Montgolfier Brothers, can be viewed on his website, ''The Institute of Spoons''.

Naysmith and Cooper formed Lorimer,<ref name="Kellman" /> and later continued working together in the Leeds band The Terminals. The band released a single in December 2006, entitled "Dictator" on Double Dragon Records. The band changed their name again to [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194646/http://damagedgoods.co.uk/band/?c=Cyanide-Pills Cyanide Pills] and by 2011 had released five singles and one album on [[Damaged Goods (record label)|Damaged Goods Records]]. Naysmith and Cooper are currently working on a new project of atmospheric instrumental music under the name The Program.

Barham has gone on to record melodic electronica under the name Kuchen.  She has released two albums on the Karaoke Kalk label: ''Kids with Sticks'' in 2001 and the collaboration ''Kuchen Meets Mapstation'' in 2003 with Stefan Schneider of [[To Rococo Rot]] (who also records as Mapstation).

Horner is a film producer based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

Browne went on to play with [[Warm Jets]], [[Rialto (band)|Rialto]],<ref name="Kellman" /> and White Hotel before briefly returning to Canada in 2001, then relocating to San Francisco in 2002. There she played with local [[rock noir]] chanteuse Rykarda Parasol, appearing on her ''Here She Comes'' EP and the ''Our Hearts First Meet'' album.
