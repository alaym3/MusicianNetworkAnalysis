'''Bad Wolves''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in 2017. Initially finding fame from their first single, a cover of [[the Cranberries]]' 1994 hit "[[Zombie (The Cranberries song)#Bad Wolves cover|Zombie]]", the band proceeded to find further success with a number of songs topping the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] songs chart, including "[[Remember When (Bad Wolves song)|Remember When]]", "[[Killing Me Slowly]]", and "[[Sober (Bad Wolves song)|Sober]]". To date, the band has released three studio albums, ''[[Disobey]]'' (2018), ''[[N.A.T.I.O.N.]]'' (2019) and ''Dear Monsters'' (2021). In January 2021, Vext left the band and was replaced by Daniel "DL" Lasckiewicz. Tensions ensued between Vext and the band, resulting in legal proceedings including [[Better Noise Music]].

===''N.A.T.I.O.N.'' and departure of Tommy Vext (2019–2021)===
[[File:Bad Wolves - Rock am Ring 2019-1109.jpg|thumb|Former lead vocalist [[Tommy Vext]] live at [[Rock am Ring]] 2019]]
On July 26, 2019, the band released a new single titled "I'll Be There", followed by another single titled "Killing Me Slowly", a third single titled "Sober", as well as a fourth single titled "Crying Game" and announced their new album, ''[[N.A.T.I.O.N.]]'', which was released on October 25, 2019. "Killing Me Slowly" was a song written in collaboration with outside songwriters; however, Vext would later state publicly that he was "the mastermind behind the song" after changing a few lyrics.<ref name="Gonzales2021"/>

Two unreleased singles were released on April 10 on [[Patreon]]. The two singles include a cover of "[[Heart-Shaped Box|Heart Shaped Box]]" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and a new song called "Shanghai".

In an interview in October 2020, vocalist Vext confirmed that the band had almost completed their third full-length album and that they may release it six months early exclusively via Patreon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-bad-wolves-14-10-2020/|title=INTERVIEW: Bad Wolves (14/10/2020)|date=October 30, 2020}}</ref>

===Hiring of Daniel "DL" Laskiewicz and ''Dear Monsters'' (2021–present)===
On May 25, 2021, Tommy Vext claimed via his official Facebook account that Daniel "DL" Laskiewicz (former guitarist of [[The Acacia Strain]]) had joined Bad Wolves as their new lead vocalist. Vext followed this up by claiming that "the band is going to have to change its name if they don't pay for the songs I wrote and my trademark ownership but either way wish this dude the best I guess." The band did not respond to Vext's claims at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-tommy-vext-claims-daniel-dl-laskiewicz-is-new-bad-wolves-vocalist/|title=News: Tommy Vext claims Daniel "DL" Laskiewicz is new Bad Wolves vocalist! |last=Redrup |first=Zach |date=May 25, 2021|website= |publisher=Dead Press |access-date=June 2, 2021|quote= }}</ref> Just over a week later on June 2, 2021, Bad Wolves announced that Laskiewicz had indeed joined the band and that they were working on their third album called ''Dear Monsters'', which they claimed would be "the best Bad Wolves album to date". The band also elaborated further on Vext's departure, saying that they "disagree with the validity of much of what he has said publicly about our parting of ways – but we would prefer to not look back on the past and instead focus on this new chapter. And most importantly, we'd like to let the music speak for itself."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://badwolvesnation.com/blogs/news/bad-wolves-has-a-new-singer|title=We are Excited to Officially Announce That Bad Wolves Has A New Singer − Daniel 'DL' Lasckiewicz|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=June 2, 2021|website= |publisher= |access-date=June 2, 2021}}</ref> Laskiewicz was involved in the songwriting of ''N.A.T.I.O.N.''<ref name="Gonzales2021"/>

In July 2021, Doc Coyle stated on an episode of his podcast ''The Ex-Man with Doc Coyle'' that Vext's continued pressure against Bad Wolves meant that "a big portion of the fanbase has essentially been radicalized against the band under false pretenses."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theprp.com/2021/07/28/news/bad-wolves-doc-coyle-comments-on-tommy-vext-drama-a-big-portion-of-the-fanbase-has-essentially-been-radicalized-against-the-band-under-false-pretenses/ |title=Bad Wolves' Doc Coyle Comments On Tommy Vext Drama: "A Big Portion Of The Fanbase Has Essentially Been Radicalized Against The Band Under False Pretenses" |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 28, 2021 |website= |publisher=The PRP |access-date=July 28, 2021 |quote=}}</ref> This came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by Vext against Bad Wolves manager Allen Kovac, who is also the CEO of Better Noise Music. In the lawsuit, Vext alleged that Kovac attempted to stop him from making political statements, attempted to buy the trademarks for Bad Wolves off him, tried to strong-arm radio and streaming services into not playing Bad Wolves when Vext refused to sell him the trademarks as a way of pushing Vext out of the music industry, and repeatedly using racial slurs to belittle him. Kovac responded with a statement of his own saying that Vext's accusations were "categorically false". Coyle and John Boecklin also made their own statement where they said that "In all our dealings with Allen Kovac, he has never used any derogatory racial slurs. Tommy is making all of this up. Period."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theprp.com/2021/07/26/news/tommy-vext-files-suit-against-bad-wolves-manager-allen-kovac-alleges-racism-campaign-to-have-him-booted-from-the-band/ |title=Tommy Vext Files Suit Against Bad Wolves Manager Allen Kovac, Alleges Racism & Campaign To Have Him Booted From The Band (Updated) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=Jul 26, 2021 |website= |publisher=The PRP |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref>
