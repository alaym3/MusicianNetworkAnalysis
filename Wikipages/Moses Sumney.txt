==Early life==
Born in California, Sumney was raised by pastor parents, and moved with his family back to Ghana at the age of 10.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/08/moses-sumney-aromanticism-album-interview|title=Moses Sumney: 'I have an obsession with loneliness, singledom, isolation'|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|first=Kate|last=Hutchinson|date=October 8, 2017}}</ref> He described his childhood as "Americanized" by this age and had difficulty adjusting to the culture of Ghana, especially the rural nature of his new environment. There he grew up on a goat farm in [[Accra]] and commuted by public bus to school.<ref name="Lough">{{cite web|url=http://issuemagazine.com/moses-sumney/#/|title=Moses Sumney|first=Taylor|last=Lough|work=Issue Magazine|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref> His family returned to Southern California when Sumney was 16, settling in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]].<ref name="Kameir">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/moses-sumney-interview/|title=Moses Sumney Is Ready to Claim His Spotlight|first= Rawiya|last=Kameir|work=Pitchfork Media|date=February 20, 2020|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

He did not learn to play any instruments until he was older, writing [[a cappella]] music for years instead. Sumney did not perform his musical compositions publicly until he was 20.<ref name="vman.com"/>

After high school, he moved to Los Angeles in 2010 to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref name="Pareles">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/arts/music/moses-sumney-aromanticism.html|title=Moses Sumney Does Not Sing Love Songs|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=September 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 15, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He majored in creative writing and studied poetry, which helped him improve his songwriting.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moses Sumney, A Choir of One |url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound-presents-studio-a/moses-sumney-a-choir-of-one |website=KCET |access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>

==Musical career==
In 2014, Sumney broke into the Los Angeles music scene and caught the eye of many record labels. He said at the time it did not feel right because labels were trying to conform him into a certain image and he was still trying to discover the artist that he wanted to be. He decided to turn down these labels and move to Asheville, North Carolina.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Moses Sumney Puts The Industry Behind Him And Explores The In-Between On 'Grae'|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/05/19/858394957/moses-sumney-puts-the-industry-behind-him-and-explores-the-in-between-on-grae|access-date=2020-11-12|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref> His resistance to labels is reflected in his later album, ''[[Græ]].''<ref name=":0" />
