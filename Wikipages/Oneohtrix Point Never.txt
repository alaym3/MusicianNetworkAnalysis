== Musical style ==
Lopatin's work has often "recontextualized sounds that seem to define an era", ranging from the "vintage synth oddities" of his early work "to the '90s [[TV commercial]]-sampling ''[[Replica (Oneohtrix Point Never album)|Replica]]'' and the [[Alternative rock|alt-rock]]-inspired ''[[Garden of Delete]]''", according to [[AllMusic]]'s Heather Phares.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/age-of-mw0003169098|title=Age Of – Oneohtrix Point Never|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Phares|first=Heather|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Lopatin has engaged with "a broad and deeply idiosyncratic array of [[music genre|genres]], [[sample (music)|samples]], sources and strategies, from [[minimal music|Minimalism]] to [[sound collage|collage]] to [[noise music|noise]]", often using "snippets of material — [[advertising jingle|ad jingles]], saccharine pop productions, throwaway dialogue — that he can't entirely dismiss as kitsch."<ref name="pareles">{{cite news |last1=Pareles |first1=Jon |title=Oneohtrix Point Never's Quest to Make Music That Freaks People Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/arts/music/oneohtrix-point-never-daniel-lopatin-age-of.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref> For ''[[Stereogum]]'', Lindsey Rhoades stated that Lopatin is "almost more of a philosopher/sound-collagist than he is a musician", noting his tendency to "elevate sounds otherwise considered cheesy" and prompt reflection "about why you have aversions to certain tones and timbres, and why others immediately bring [[childhood memory|childhood impressions]] screaming back into your brain."<ref name="rhoades">{{cite web |last1=Rhoades |first1=Lindsey |title=Oneohtrix Point Never Albums From Worst to Best |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1933687/oneohtrix-point-never-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/ |website=[[Stereogum]] |date=April 12, 2017 |access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref> Lopatin's musical influences have included [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]],<ref name="rbma">{{cite web|title=Oneohtrix Point Never {{!}} Red Bull Music Academy|url=https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/oneohtrix-point-never-replication|website=[[Red Bull Music Academy]]}}</ref> [[DJ Premier]]<ref name="rbma" /> and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].<ref name="rescued" /> He has also cited literary influences, including Romanian pessimist philosopher [[Emil Cioran]],<ref name="impose">{{cite web|title=Daniel Lopatin of Oneohtrix Point Never goes intergalactic – IMPOSE Magazine|url=https://imposemagazine.com/features/daniel-lopatin-of-oneohtrix-poi|website=Impose Magazine}}</ref> and science fiction authors [[Stanisław Lem]] and [[Philip K.
