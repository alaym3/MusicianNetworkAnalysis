'''Katatonia''' are a Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Stockholm]] in 1991 by [[Jonas Renkse]] and [[Anders Nyström]]. The band started as a studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for the band's love of [[death metal]]. Increasing popularity led them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band's founders, the lineup was a constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] of the band [[Opeth]] for a period. After two [[death/doom]] albums, ''[[Dance of December Souls]]'' (1993) and ''[[Brave Murder Day]]'' (1996), problems with Renkse's [[vocal cords]] coupled with new musical influences led the band away from the [[screamed vocals]] of death metal to a more traditional, melodic form of [[heavy metal music]].

The band released two more albums, ''[[Discouraged Ones]]'' (1998) and ''[[Tonight's Decision]]'' (1999), before settling into a stable [[quintet]] lineup for all of the 2000s. The band released four more albums with said lineup: ''[[Last Fair Deal Gone Down (album)|Last Fair Deal Gone Down]]'' (2001), ''[[Viva Emptiness]]'' (2003), ''[[The Great Cold Distance]]'' (2006), and ''[[Night Is the New Day]]'' (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their metal sound while adding more [[progressive rock]] sounds to their work over time. While lineup changes started up again into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted, and the band continued on to release their ninth and tenth studio albums, ''[[Dead End Kings]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Fall of Hearts]]'' (2016). After touring in support of the album through 2017, the band entered a hiatus at the beginning of 2018. The band returned from their hiatus in February 2019, with their eleventh studio album, ''[[City Burials]]'', released in April 2020.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1991–1997) ===
The band was first formed in 1991 by [[Jonas Renkse]] and [[Anders Nyström]] as a two piece studio-based project.<ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Katatonia {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/katatonia-mn0000855252/biography|access-date=20 June 2016|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Renkse would provide [[clean vocals|clean]] and [[screamed vocals]] and [[drum kit|drums]], while Nystrom would provide all [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[guitar]]s.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Renkse was the primary [[lyricist]], while Nystrom was the primary [[music composer]].<ref name="KRetrospective" /> The duo had been working together with music in some capacity since 1987, but became serious about making music in 1991, when they began work on their first release, the [[music demo|demo]] ''[[Jhva Elohim Meth... The Revival]]''.<ref name="AMJEM">{{cite web|last=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jhva-elohim-meth-mw0001890761 |title=Jhva Elohim Meth...The Revival – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The release, along with the next few subsequent releases by the band, were of the [[death/doom]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] sound, with the members being inspired and influenced by the rise of [[death metal]] [[Death metal#Growing popularity|becoming popular in Europe at the time]].<ref name="KRetrospective">{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-355|title=CoC : Katatonia : Interview : 8/12/2001}}</ref><ref name="AMJEM" /> The release was enough of a hit in the underground metal scene to garner the attention of a small music label, Vic Records, which re-released it as an [[extended play|EP]] in 1993, which helped gain more exposure for the duo.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> The newfound popularity found them recruiting a [[bass guitar]]ist, Guillaume Le Huche, so the trio could play [[Concert|live performances]], and returning to the studio to recreate a debut full-length album. The resulting work, ''[[Dance of December Souls]]'', was released in late 1993.<ref name="AMDODS">{{cite web|last=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dance-of-december-souls-mw0000224311 |title=Dance of December Souls – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The album's bleak melancholy and despair of their sound, continued to give them the classification of [[death-doom]].<ref name="Mblast">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalblast.net/interviews/katatonia-jonas-renkse-interview/ |title=Katatonia (Jonas Renkse) Interview |publisher=Metal Blast! |date=20 October 2012 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="AMDODS" />

After touring in support of the album, the trio recorded another EP, ''[[For Funerals to Come]]'', which was released in early 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-funerals-to-come-mw0001374619 |title=For Funerals to Come – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> However, Le Huche left the band shortly after, and issues finding a replacement found the band break up for a year, while Renkse and Nystrom worked separately on their own projects.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Of note, Renkse started up a new band, [[October Tide]], with guitarist Fredrik Norrman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/october-tide-mn0000465526/biography |title=October Tide &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> After working some with Norrman on the project, Renkse decided to revive Katatonia with Norrman as the new third member.<ref name="allmusicbio" />

After the year off, the band reformed in 1996 to record and release a second studio album, ''[[Brave Murder Day]]''.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> In addition to Fredrik Norrman contributing guitars to the album, the band also recruited Renkse's friend, [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] of the band [[Opeth]], to perform the screamed vocals, as Renkse became unable to do them himself anymore due to medical issues.<ref name="Mblast" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-cold-distance-mw0000353240 |title=The Great Cold Distance – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=4 April 2006 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The release, alongside the EP ''[[Sounds of Decay]]'' released with the same lineup the next year, were considered their last in the genre of doom/death metal, with the band starting to focus more on clean vocals in subsequent releases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jason Anderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/brave-murder-day-mw0000240046 |title=Brave Murder Day – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=23 September 1997 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sounds-of-decay-mw0001890716 |title=Sounds of Decay – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> To promote the album, the band recruited Mikael Oretoft to play bass, and they embarked on their first European tour with [[progressive metal]] band [[In the Woods...]]<ref name="allmusicbio" /><ref name="KRetrospective" />

=== Move away from death metal (1998–1999) ===
While Renkse experimented with clean, melodic vocals over metal instrumentation as early as the 1994 recording of the track "Scarlet Heavens" (later released in very limited capacity on [[Katatonia/Primordial]] in 1996), the band did not feel ready to pursue that sort of sound at the time.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> However, after the band's 1997 releases, due to a desire to create more emotive and evolving music, the band decided to move in that direction.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> The first of said releases was an EP entitled ''[[Saw You Drown]]'', released in early 1997, which also contained the first wide release of "Scarlet Heavens".<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Later in 1998, the band released their first full-album of this style, titled ''[[Discouraged Ones]]''.<ref name="AMDO">{{cite web|last=William York |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/discouraged-ones-mw0000599679 |title=Discouraged Ones – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=5 May 1998 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref>
After the release, the band signed a multi-album record deal with [[Peaceville]], which would mark the first time the band would work with a bigger label, and stay with them for the long-term.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Additionally, Renkse wanted to focus further on dedicating himself to developing his clean vocals, leading him to no longer do any further drumming for the band.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> The band kept active, recording and releasing their fourth album, ''[[Tonight's Decision]]'', in 1999.<ref name="AMTD">{{cite web|last=William York |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tonights-decision-mw0000000178 |title=Tonight's Decision – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The sessions were difficult, with the writing alone taking Renkse and Nystrom over seven months to complete.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> Once recording, they recruited [[Dan Swanö]], who had helped assist the band in the past, as a sessions drummer.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> While the album contained no screamed vocals, the band still retained Åkerfeldt still assisted with vocal production on the album, as they had with ''Discouraged Ones''.<ref name="KRetrospective" />

After the release of ''Tonight's Decision'', the band, tired of continually searching for [[session musician]]s, finally decided to put together a concrete, permanent lineup.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Fredrick Norrman recruited his brother, Mattias Norrman, as a bassist, and Daniel Liljekvist joined the band as the drummer.<ref name="KRetrospective" />

=== Stable lineup and international growth (2000–2009) ===
[[File:Katatonia 2005.jpg|thumb|240px|Anders Nystrom and Mattias Norrman]] With the band finally achieving a stable lineup with Renkse, Nystrom, the Norrman brothers, and Liljekvist, the band began work on their fifth album, the first of four albums the quintet would release over the course of the next decade. While personnel issues no longer plagued the band, recording sessions were still difficult, this time due to financial constraints, which limited how much time they could spend in the studio.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> The band worked on recording the album off and on from April to December 2000, and while the stopping and starting proved to be troublesome, it also kept them re-evaluating and reworking their material in the downtime, something they felt ultimately helped the shaping of the album.<ref name="KRetrospective" /> The resulting album, ''[[Last Fair Deal Gone Down (album)|Last Fair Deal Gone Down]]'' was released in May 2001,<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=William York |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/last-fair-deal-gone-down-mw0000588040 |title=Last Fair Deal Gone Down – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=8 May 2001 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> and marked the band further distancing itself from traditional [[heavy metal music]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Thom Jurek |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/last-fair-day-gone-night-mw0002703467 |title=Last Fair Day Gone Night – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> in favor of more of a [[hard rock]] sound.<ref name="allmusic1" /> The band decided to release the ''[[Teargas EP|Teargas]]'' EP shortly prior to the album release, essentially as a [[single (music)|single]], containing the album track "Teargas" and two [[b-sides]].<ref name="KRetrospective" /> Another EP of music from the same sessions, ''[[Tonight's Music]]'', was also released shortly after the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/all/Tonight's%20Music |title=Search for "Tonight's Music" |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The band rounded out the year with a European tour with Akerfeldt's Opeth, with Renkse and Nystrom even providing guest vocals at some of the Opeth shows when Akerfeldt was experiencing trouble with his vocal cords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeth-two-studio-albums-on-the-way/ |title=Opeth: Two Studio Albums On The Way! |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=13 January 2002 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref>

By mid-2002, the band had started to write material for their sixth album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-prepare-new-album-upcoming-compilation/ |title=Katatonia Prepare New Album, Upcoming Compilation |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=5 August 2002 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> and by October 2002, they had entered the studio to begin formal recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-enter-studio-to-record-new-album/ |title=Katatonia Enter Studio To Record New Album |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=23 October 2002 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> In April 2003, the band released the resulting album, ''[[Viva Emptiness]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thom Jurek |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/viva-emptiness-mw0000027376 |title=Viva Emptiness – Katatonia &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=29 April 2003 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The album was promoted by the release of the single "[[Ghost of the Sun]]" and the similarly named ''Ghost of the Spring'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-announce-ghost-of-the-spring-tour/ |title=Katatonia Announce 'Ghost Of The Spring Tour' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=7 February 2003 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The tour, which went through Europe with support act [[Daylight Dies]],<ref name="blabbermouth1">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-vocalist-talks-about-touring-north-america-for-first-time/ |title=Katatonia Vocalist Talks About Touring North America For First Time |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=23 October 2006 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> went as planned, though the band later had to cancel a June performance in Germany due to sickness,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-pull-out-of-germany-s-i-wood-festival/ |title=Katatonia Pull Out Of Germany's I Wood Festival |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=22 June 2003 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> and had July festival appearances cancelled due to issues beyond their control with third party organizers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-european-festival-appearances-cancelled/ |title=Katatonia: European Festival Appearances Cancelled |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=9 July 2003 |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> Still, the album was a success, being [[Katatonia discography|their first to chart on any official charts]], peaking at no. 17 on the Finnish charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finnishcharts.com/search.asp?search=katatonia&cat=a |title=Finnish charts portal |website=Finnishcharts.com |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> [[File:Katatonia in 2004.jpg|left|thumb|Katatonia in [[Montreal]], 2004]] [[File:Katatonia - Kuopio Rockcock 06.JPG|left|thumb|Katatonia in [[Kuopio]] at [[Rockcock]]-musicfestival, 2008]]

== Musical style and influences ==
The band is known for changing its sound over the course of its three-decade career. Nystrom summarized it in a 2006 interview:
<blockquote>Yeah sure, we see ourselves as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 August 2006|title=Katatonia's NystrÖm Talks About Dan SwanÖ's Departure From Bloodbath|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-s-nystr-m-talks-about-dan-swan-s-departure-from-bloodbath/|access-date=20 June 2016|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref></blockquote>

Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: <blockquote>Well, it must be hard sometimes for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters and at the same time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic [[power metal]] band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 September 2007|title=Katatonia Guitarist: 'We're Not An Energetic Power Metal Band'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/katatonia-guitarist-we-re-not-an-energetic-power-metal-band/|access-date=20 June 2016|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref></blockquote>
