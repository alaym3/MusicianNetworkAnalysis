== History ==
Gaelic Storm's origins can be traced back to 1996, when Patrick Murphy and Steve Wehmeyer joined with Steve Twigger, drummer Shep Lonsdale, and [[Uilleann pipes|Uillean]] piper Brian Walsh to perform at O'Brien's Irish Pub and Restaurant in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]], of which Murphy was the manager.
