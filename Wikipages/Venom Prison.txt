Stephen Hill of [[Metal Hammer|''Metal Hammer'']] described their second album as "2019’s most anticipated [[extreme metal]] albums".<ref name="Metal Hammer" /> Their lead vocalist [[Larissa Stupar]] was described by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' as "metal's most important - and uncompromising - voice".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morton |first1=Luke |title=Venom Prison the Remarkable Story of the Rise and Rise of Metal's Most Important - and Uncompromising - Voice |journal=[[Kerrang!]] |date=27 May 2019}}</ref> The band has released three studio albums. 

==History==
In 2015, former Wolf Down vocalist, Larissa Stupar (born in Russia), moved to Wales, where she met Ash Gray of [[Brutality Will Prevail]], whom she would begin writing music with. They coined the name "Venom Prison" as it was "the most metal name they could imagine". The pair released the demo EP ''Defy the Tyrant'' in 2015, before recruiting Ben Thomas to play lead guitar and Joe Sheehy to play drums, along with bass guitarist Mike Jeffries. This line-up released the 2015 EP ''The Primal Chaos''.<ref name="VENOM PRISON: DEATH METAL AGAINST RAPE CULTURE AND MISOGYNY" />
