==History==

===Early years (1978–1981)===
Venom's original personnel came from three different bands: Guillotine, Oberon and Dwarfstar. The original Guillotine featured [[Jeff "Mantas" Dunn|Jeffrey Dunn]] and Dave Rutherford on guitars, Dean Hewitt on bass guitar, Dave Blackman on vocals, and Chris Mercater on drums who replaced Paul Burke, the original drummer when the band was founded. Blackman and Mercater were later also replaced by drummer Anthony Bray and vocalist Clive Archer. Later, Hewitt was replaced by Alan Winston on bass. The band name then changed to Venom. In late 1979, [[Conrad Lant]] replaced Rutherford. Lant later switched to bass after the departure of Winston. The band members took on new [[stage name]]s. Archer became "Jesus Christ", Lant "Cronos", Bray "[[Abbadon]]", and Dunn "[[Mantas]]".

Prime influences of to Venom band were [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Motörhead]],<ref name=fortunecity>{{cite web |title=Interview with Mantas |publisher=fortunecity.com |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewmantas.html |access-date=10 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225104247/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewmantas.html |archive-date=25 December 2008}}</ref> the [[Sex Pistols]]<ref name="kerrang" /> and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].<ref name=fortunecity.com>{{cite web |title=Interview with Abaddon and Cronos |publisher=fortunecity.com |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewrichards.html |access-date=10 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110155313/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/sunra/315/venominterviewrichards.html |archive-date=10 January 2010}}</ref> Other musicians that have influenced Venom are [[Deep Purple]], [[the Who]], [[the Tubes]], [[Van Halen]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=fortunecity.com/><ref>Ankeny, Jason. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/venom-mn0000315403/related Venom: Related]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 20 June 2016.</ref>

Since the beginning of their career, Venom have often used "[[Satanism|Satanic]]" lyrics and imagery. However, such references were mostly for [[shock value]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moynihan |first1=Michael |last2=Søderlind |first2=Didrik |year=2003 |orig-year=1998 |title=[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]] |edition=revised and expanded |publisher=Feral House |page=13}}</ref><ref name=torreano>Bradley Torreano: [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=n-league-with-satan-mw0000222491|pure_url=yes}} "In League with Satan - Venom"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 24 January 2013.</ref>

In late 1979 Lant introduced the band to his original song ideas as he did not want to keep playing the same cover songs, and with Dunn he began writing new songs for the band. Lant had yet composed songs like "Sons of Satan", "Bloodlust" and "Welcome to Hell", while Dunn had yet composed songs like "Angel Dust", "Red Light Fever", "Buried Alive", "Raise the Dead" and "Live Like an Angel, Die Like a Devil". Dunn and Lant redefined together these songs with a mutual collaboration and then, after a few weeks, Lant recorded a rehearsal session on a basic cassette recorder which he played for the label he worked for, although as the band rehearsed in an old church hall the sound was not good. In April 1980, Lant was able to persuade the label to give him some free studio time and the band recorded a three-song demo. Soon after, six more tracks were recorded for just £50, with Lant taking vocal duties on the song "Live Like an Angel". Archer then left the band, and Venom's line-up became a trio.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rock & Metal in My Blood |website=Rock & Metal in My Blood |url=https://www.rockandmetalinmyblood.com/interviste/venom-inc-interview/189 |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref>

===Classic line-up (1981–1986)===
Venom's professional recording debut was the 1981 single ''[[In League with Satan / Live Like an Angel]]'', which was released by [[Neat Records]]. Later that year they released their full-length debut, ''[[Welcome to Hell]]''.

''Welcome to Hell'' was a big influence on future thrash bands. Venom's music was faster and harsher than most heavy metal contemporaries and while Satanism and other dark topics had been featured in metal before, the subject had rarely been more prominent. Lant was quoted as saying that this celebration of evil subjects was inspired by the perceived need to out-do musicians like [[Ozzy Osbourne]] of Black Sabbath, who would "sing about evil things and dark figures, and then spoil it all by going: '[[Black Sabbath (song)|Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!]]'"<ref name=allmusic.com>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mmv-mw0000352112|pure_url=yes}} "MMV: Review by James Christopher Monger"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 24 January 2013.</ref>

Their second album, 1982's ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'', is cited as perhaps the most important influence in the development of [[black metal]], thrash metal, [[death metal]], and other related styles that are often grouped under the [[extreme metal]] umbrella.<ref name=Kahn-Harris/> Many defining elements of these genres are first found in the lyrics and song titles created by Lant, his unique singing style and larger than life presence. Venom's first two albums inspired cult followings to this day. While many of their NWOBHM peers (like [[Iron Maiden]]) had found measures of popular success or critical acclaim, or (like [[Def Leppard]]) were moving away from heavy metal towards [[hard rock]], Venom were still regarded by critics as "a trio of buffoons".<ref>{{cite web |title=At War with Satan: Review by Eduardo Rivadavia |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=at-war-with-satan-mw0000196214|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

In 1984, Venom recorded the ''[[At War with Satan]]'' album, an epic 20-minute title track, with substantial influences of many different musical styles, which took up the first side of the LP. The title track written by Lant, was a deliberate way for him to rebuff the critics who said Venom could not play. The B-side was focused on the rapid-fire, three-minute "scorchers" Venom were known for, including "Stand Up And Be Counted". A live video, ''The 7th Date of Hell Venom Live at Hammersmith Odeon'', was also released that year. In 1985, Venom released their fourth studio album, ''[[Possessed (Venom album)|Possessed]]'', which was recorded in a stately home, and saw a band enjoying their success with different chefs being flown in every day during the album's recording, lavish parties of sex, drugs and rock n' roll. By this time Venom had released several singles ("Warhead", "Die Hard" and "Manitou" among others) and live EPs (''The Assault Series'' including ''Canadian Assault'', ''American Assault'' and ''French Assault''). Cronos and Abaddon appeared on the ''Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge'' video with Slayer and Exodus. Cronos cites the ''Possessed'' album as underestimated. "I don't think there's any songs that are kind of overlooked, I just think some songs maybe weren't recorded as well as we could have recorded them. Like say for example on the ''Possessed'' album, I still think there are great songs".<ref name="Lords of Metal (editor: Ramon van H.)">{{cite web |title=Lords of Metal interview with Cronos of Venom by Ramon van H |publisher=Lordsofmetal.nl |url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/en/interviews/view/id/4082 |access-date=11 October 2013}}</ref> During March/April of 1986, Venom the band seems ready to record the fifth album (then never released), called ''Deadline'', but internal relationships begin to deteriorate. A live album, ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'', and a second live video, ''Alive in '85'', were released in 1986. Dunn then left the band to release a solo album.

===Temporary break up and Tony Dolan era (1987–1995)===
Two guitarists, Mike Hickey and Jim Clare, were hired to replace Dunn. Their fifth album, 1987's ''[[Calm Before the Storm (Venom album)|Calm Before the Storm]]'', moved away from Satanic themes in favour of  "[[sword and sorcery]]" material.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=calm-before-the-storm-mw0000195270|pure_url=yes}} "Calm Before the Storm: Review by Steve Huey"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 24 January 2013.</ref> This was a new direction for Venom, although it did not last long, with only a short Japanese and Brazilian tour in 1986, so the band decided to split, and Lant, Clare and Hickey all left to form Lant's solo band, [[Cronos (band)|Cronos]].

Bray was left as the only group member, but he was able to convince [[Music for Nations]] for a deal to release a new Venom album on the Under One Flag label, using ''Deadline'' demo tracks which were recorded with previous line-ups but never released. In 1988, Bray offered a vocals/bass role to [[Tony Dolan]] (The Demolition Man) from [[Atomkraft]]. Bray and Dolan wrote new material prior to Dunn's rejoining the band along with rhythm guitarist Al Barnes. Together they recorded ''[[Prime Evil (Venom album)|Prime Evil]]'' (1989), ''Tear Your Soul Apart'' (1990) and ''[[Temples of Ice]]'' (1991). Barnes then left the band, and Steve White from Atomkraft was hired as his replacement. They released ''[[The Waste Lands (album)|The Waste Lands]]'' in 1992, also without success. Music for Nations refused to release any more Venom albums, so Dolan and Dunn quit, effectively disbanding Venom. Bray continued to release compilation and live albums up to 1995. Nonetheless, Dolan, Dunn and Bray continued performing as a trio.

===Reunion (1995–present)===
In 1995, Lant, Dunn and Bray reunited the "classic" line-up, beginning by headlining the Waldrock Festival on 24 June 1995. They recorded and self-released the ''Venom '96'' EP with four re-recorded old tracks and one new song, resulting in a record deal with the [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] label. Following this was a live CD/video box set, ''The Second Coming'', composed entirely of songs from their classic era such as "Welcome to Hell", "Countess Bathory", "In Nomine Satanas" and "Black Metal". An album, ''[[Cast in Stone]]'', was next released in 1997, split between two discs which was one of all new material and the other with re-recordings of popular early-'80s songs.

[[file:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|left|Venom at [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] 2008]]
By time 1999 arrived, it was time to supply SPV with the second album in their deal and internal conflicts between members of the band did not take long. Eric Cook (manager of Venom) and Abaddon met each other and decided not to work with Cronos again. Abaddon wrote a letter to Cronos, with the intent of firing him out of the band. The letter written by the drummer communicates that the role of Cronos in the band and his service is no longer necessary and that he would carry on the band with Jeff "Mantas" Dunn and other people. So Cronos called the German record company SPV/Steamhammer to communicate the situation of the band. and wish everyone good luck for whatever they decide to do. At that point the record company furiously refused point blank to have a line-up of Venom who had no Cronos in the band. After that, Cronos answered Abaddon telling him: "You can't kick the Devil out of hell, I'm firing you!".<ref>{{cite web |author=vs_baronin |date=24 October 2012 |title=Venom: Centuries of sin |url=https://vs-baronin.livejournal.com/432596.html |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref> Despite this, the band tried to invite Abaddon to play with them again but Bray did not want to perform on the album and he was replaced by a nu-metal drummer called "Anton" whom, among other things, was the younger Lant brother. This line-up released ''[[Resurrection (Venom album)|Resurrection]]'' in 2000 on SPV. However, in 2002 Dunn was next to leave the group and Lant replaced him with a US guitarist, Mike Hickey, who had already taken part in the 1987 release, "Calm Before the Storm," and Cronos solo albums. In late 2005, Venom released a career-spanning four-disc box set, ''MMV'', which includes an exclusive mini-poster of the band's seven-date tour of Europe with [[Metallica]] and a 60-page picture book, with interviews and pictures. The set includes all their best-known songs, along with rarities like live tracks, demos and outtakes. This line-up of the band released the ''[[Metal Black]]'' album in 2006.

In 2007 Mike Hickey left the band and guitarist Stuart "Rage" Dixon joined the band and this line-up released the record ''[[Hell (Venom album)|Hell]]'' the following year. In 2009 drummer Danny "Dante" Needham joined the band and Lant wrote that this will be known as "The Epic Line-Up of Venom", and they set off on a full South American tour. After headlining festivals around the world for the next couple of years gaining in popularity, they released the ''[[Fallen Angels (Venom album)|Fallen Angels]]'' album on 28 November 2011.

===Reunion of the Venom '89/'90 line-up under the name "Venom Inc."===
{{anchor|Venom Inc.}}
In April 2015, in anticipation of a date of the M-pire of Evil (Mantas and Demolition Man band) at the Keep It True Festival in Germany, the organizers of the festival, asked Mantas and Demolition Man if they could play the songs of Venom with Abaddon. Mantas had not talked to Abaddon since 1998. So after thinking a bit, the two former Venom members played along with Abaddon without having done any rehearsals for the show. At this point the three brought together the Venom line-up of 1988–1992 under the name of Venom Inc. for the sake of the fans (instead of the name "Iron & Steel", that was initially conceived by the members themselves).

On 3 February 2017, Venom Inc. signed with [[Nuclear Blast]] and released their first album, ''Avé'', on 11 August 2017. The two singles off the album were "Dein Fleisch" and "Ave Satanas". Drum parts for "Avé" delivered by Abaddon were not up to par so Mantas used a drum computer for the record. 

After playing several world wide tours, the band continued to play until the beginning of March 2018, when at the end of the Australian tour Abaddon asked for a break from the band's activity (due to the birth of his daughter, Anja) and agreed that he would be temporarily replaced by the band's front of house engineer [[Jeramie Kling]] for a period of one or two months (until April 2018) to complete the European tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=VENOM INC.

However, following some personal conflicts due to his conduct on previous tours and contract management, certain business moves made behind Demolition Man's back without any approval, as well as stylistic differences with the other band members, Abaddon was fired from Venom Inc. After which Kling also took part in the recordings for the next album, thus becoming a full member of the band.<ref>{{cite web |date=18 September 2018 |title=VENOM INC.

Cronos insists on calling it black metal, without passing judgment on the genre that later would flourish in Norway:

{{quote|...It's one of the things when I first saw when I saw the Norwegian scene beginning in the early nineties. I thought: ok, I know they said Venom are an influence, etcetera, etcetera; let's see where these guys are coming from. And then when I started to read the lyrics, read the interviews and see they were kind of saying the same thing, but about their country, they had their religion, with all the Norse gods like Wodan and Thor. And then all of the sudden the Christians came in and they tried to destroy their religion. It's great that they stayed within in their country's beliefs for their lyrics as well. So, they're not the exactly the same things as Venom, they invented something of their own, which I think is fucking great...<ref name="Lords of Metal (editor: Ramon van H.)"/>}}

==Legacy and influence==
''[[Welcome to Hell]]'' influenced several later bands.<ref name=ReferenceA/> Venom's music helped shape the development of many [[thrash metal]] bands, specifically the "Big Four of Thrash", who in turn were highly influential: [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Megadeth]]. Metallica opened for Venom on an early 1980s tour,<ref name=allmusic.com/> Venom opened for Metallica and Slayer on the ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'' tour, and Slayer played with them and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] on the ''Combat Tour'' in 1985. Both [[Kerry King]] and [[Tom Araya]] have cited Venom as an important early influence on Slayer's image and music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/04805-slayer-hell-awaits-25th-anniversary|title=The Crypts Of 35 Years: Tom Araya On The Anniversary Of Slayer's Hell Awaits|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|quote=We did covers of Venom, Maiden, Priest ...

Venom would also be of extreme importance to the [[black metal]] scene and the early [[death metal]] scene. Swiss band [[Hellhammer]] (later to become [[Celtic Frost]]) and Norwegian band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetruemayhem.com/history.htm|title=The Dark Past|date=9 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309071234/http://thetruemayhem.com/history.htm|access-date=6 October 2020|archive-date=9 March 2009}}</ref> are among the major acts influenced by Venom; [[Quorthon]], the frontman of Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], called ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' "one of the best albums ever made" in an interview, although he later downplayed Venom's influence on him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-bathory-mf24/|title=BATHORY – Out Of The Black Hole (MF24, 1987) &#124; Features / Interviews |website=Metalforcesmagazine.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] and [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130613041130/http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/REPULSION--7072.html]</ref> two bands which went on to greatly influence much of the death metal and [[grindcore]] to come, were both influenced by Venom, with [[Jeff Becerra]] of Possessed often asserting Venom and Exodus as the two main influences on his band.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/possessed.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-date=16 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083105/http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/possessed.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> German band [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], a formative band to both black metal and German thrash metal, is claimed to have been named after a Venom song.

Although they did not make it to [[MTV]]'s top 10 heavy metal bands list, they were given an "honorable mention".<ref name=MTVtopmetal>{{cite web |title=Metal's Honorable Mentions |publisher=[[MTV]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index12.jhtml |access-date=15 March 2011}}</ref>

Reflecting on Venom's 40th anniversary, Cronos said that without Venom, well known bands such as Metallica or Slayer would not exist. He explained, "We were the band that was influenced by [[Motörhead]] and the [[Sex Pistols]], but we took their sound and made something completely new out of it. We were completely new; no one had heard anything like us. And of course, unbeknown to us, in America there were these kids who were listening to our records and then shaping what we were doing into their own thing. Slayer would be an example of that. And I agree, without us those bands either wouldn't exist, or would sound very different from the way they do." He also cited the line-up consisting of himself, along with guitarist Stuart "Rage" Dixon and drummer Danny "Danté" Needham as "the best one we've ever had."<ref name=kerrang>{{cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/venoms-cronos-without-us-bands-like-slayer-wouldnt-exist/|author=Winwood, Ian|title=VENOM'S CRONOS: "WITHOUT US, BANDS LIKE SLAYER WOULDN'T EXIST"|website=[[Kerrang]]|access-date=31 May 2019}}</ref>

==Criticism==
While many fans and musicians see Venom as an important band, their music has nonetheless been the subject of debate. The biggest criticism is [[Satanism]], which is the main driving force behind the band's music and album covers. Cronos explained in 2008 that the reasoning behind it is for entertainment purposes.

{{quotation|I've always been interested in Satanism, but we're entertainers, and we used subjects like Satanism and paganism to entertain people, like horror movies do. Listening to a Venom album is the same thing as watching an [[The Evil Dead|Evil Dead]] movie. I don't go around murdering virgins in my spare time. It's frustrating when people can't make that distinction; I mean, [[David Bowie]]'s not actually from Mars, is he? But we were always being misquoted in the press. Venom admit to dancing around a campfire with virgins? Nonsense.|Cronos<ref>{{cite web |last=Chick |first=Steve |title=This is the devil's music |website=The Guardian |date=26 June 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/27/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic8 |access-date=15 August 2018}}</ref>}}

Critic Eduardo Rivadavia of [[AllMusic]] writes that even though ''Welcome to Hell'' influenced "literally thousands" of bands, Venom were "critically reviled".<ref name=ReferenceA/> Critic James Christopher Monger, however, declares that the members of Venom "grew as musicians" as their careers progressed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Darkest Hour: Review by James Christopher Monger |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=darkest-hour-mw0000360084|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=26 May 2010}}</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[Keith Kahn-Harris]] argues that Venom's limited technical skill, particularly early in their career, was a profound, though inadvertent factor in the band's influence: being unable to mimic more technically proficient metal of their predecessors or peers, Venom instead opted to focus on sheer speed, creating music that was inspired by earlier metal, yet simultaneously innovative.
