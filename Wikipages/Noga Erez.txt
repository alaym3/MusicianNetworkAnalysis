Through her childhood and while growing up she explored different instruments and studied different styles of music. Erez was a part of different groups and ensembles as a vocalist, keyboardist and percussionist.

She served as a soldier in an [[Israel Defence Forces]]'s [[Israeli military ensembles|military band]].<ref name="auto1"/>

==Career==
In 2011 Erez worked on a jazz album, which she almost finished and decided to scrap and move to writing and producing electronic music.

On stage, Erez performs as a three-piece-band with herself on vocals, Ori Rousso (sampler, synthesizer) and Ran Jacobovitz (electronic drums, percussion).<ref name="auto"/>

In 2017, Erez was included in Forbes Israel's "Under 30" list.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccalerner/2017/06/29/under-30-musician-noga-erez-is-a-rising-star-in-israels-edm-scene/#c589bbd59cfb|title=Under 30 Musician Noga Erez Is A Rising Star In Israel's EDM Scene|last=Lerner|first=Rebecca|work=Forbes|access-date=22 January 2018|language=en|archive-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322022543/https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccalerner/2017/06/29/under-30-musician-noga-erez-is-a-rising-star-in-israels-edm-scene/#c589bbd59cfb|url-status=live}}</ref>

Erez's first single, "Toy" received a rave review from ''[[The New York Times]]'': “the Israeli singer and electronic-music producer Noga Erez gives ‘Toy’ a beat that jitters and heaves, ratchets across the stereo field, speeds up fitfully and stops for a moment of dead silence halfway through the song; the melodies are brief modal phrases hinting at Middle Eastern origins... It's a sparse, thorny, unstable track — and haunting, too.”<ref>[https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Just-off-the-radar-485460 Just Off The Radar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090032/https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Just-off-the-radar-485460 |date=27 March 2019 }} The Jerusalem Post. 28 March 2017</ref>

==Influences==

Erez's musical style draws influences from alternative, electronic music, and sample-based hip hop, but is also strongly influenced by political circumstances both in her country and globally, though she has been reticent to describe her work as political.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/noga-erez-is-making-music-out-of-tel-aviv-and-she-doesnt-have-a-plan-b/|title=Noga Erez is making music with a vision out of Tel Aviv, and she doesn't have a Plan B - Loud And Quiet|work=Loud And Quiet|access-date=22 January 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702040655/http://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/noga-erez-is-making-music-out-of-tel-aviv-and-she-doesnt-have-a-plan-b/|url-status=live}}</ref>  In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Erez describes her songs as her way to “process the issues that bother me about the world”.<ref name="auto1"/> Her music also references her musical influences such as [[Flying Lotus]], [[Björk]], [[Frank Ocean]] or [[Kendrick Lamar]].<ref name="auto2"/> With a mix of drum computers, synthesizers, and vocals she describes the chaos in the environment she grew up with, through bass-heavy and danceable tunes.
