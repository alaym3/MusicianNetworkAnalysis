== Early life ==
Paradis was born in [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], near Paris, to interior designers André and Corinne Paradis. Her singing career began at the age of eight when her uncle, record producer Didier Pain, helped her appear on the local television program ''[[L'École des fans]]'', a talent show for child singers.<ref name="bio" />

== Career ==

=== 1983–1991 ===
{{Listen|filename=Vanessa Paradis - Joe Le Taxi excerpt.ogg|title=Vanessa Paradis&nbsp;– Joe Le Taxi excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Joe Le Taxi''}}

Paradis recorded her first single, "La Magie des surprises-parties", in 1983 and performed it in an Italian festival in 1985. Although not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she became internationally famous, "[[Joe le taxi]]", in 1987 when she was 14. It was number one in France for 11 weeks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Vanessa+Paradis&titel=Joe+le+taxi&cat=s |title=Vanessa Paradis&nbsp;– Joe le taxi |access-date=10 January 2008 |work=LesCharts.com}}</ref> and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom, where it reached number three. It was taken from her first album ''[[M&J]]'' (for ''Marilyn & John'') which, although it placed 13th in France, drew little attention in the UK and did not enter the British chart.

In March 1989, at age 16, she left high school to pursue her singing career.

Paradis released the album ''Variations sur le même t'aime'' in 1990, containing a remake of the [[Lou Reed]] song "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]". The album was written by French composer [[Serge Gainsbourg]], whom she met when she received the best singer award at [[Victoires de la Musique]], on 4 February 1990. In 1990, Paradis won the 1990 [[César Award for Most Promising Actress]] for her role in ''[[Noce Blanche]]''.

In 1991, Paradis promoted the fragrance Coco for [[Chanel]].<ref name="vogue">{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/celebrity-photos/2011/05/31/style-file---vanessa-paradis |title=Style File&nbsp;– Vanessa Paradis |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |date=31 May 2011 |access-date=14 July 2012 |author=Neel, Julia}}</ref> In the advertisement, she was covered in black feathers, portraying a bird swinging in a cage.

=== 1992–1996 ===
In 1992, Paradis moved to the United States to work with [[Lenny Kravitz]], whom she was dating at the time.<ref name="bio" /> Paradis started working on a new album in English, a language she was now fluent in. Written and produced by Kravitz, the album, titled ''Vanessa Paradis'', topped the French chart and briefly made the UK listings (number 45). One of the singles from it was "[[Be My Baby (Vanessa Paradis song)|Be My Baby]]", which made number 5 in France and gave her another Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number six.

In March 1993, Paradis started her first international tour, the Natural High Tour; she performed in France, England and Canada.
In February 1994, ''[[Live (Vanessa Paradis album)|Live]]'' was released in France. In April 1994, Paradis filmed ''[[Élisa (film)|Élisa]]'', under the direction of [[Jean Becker (director)|Jean Becker]]. ''Elisa'' was a big success in France, and was released internationally.

=== 1997–2006 ===
In 1997, Paradis played in ''Un amour de sorcière'' with [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Jean Reno]], before filming ''[[Une chance sur deux]]'', with [[Alain Delon]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]. In March 1999, ''[[Girl on the Bridge|La fille sur le Pont]]'', by Patrice Leconte was released. This movie was shot and released in black and white. In 2004, she promoted Chanel's new handbags called ''Ligne Cambon''.

In 2005, she modeled for Chanel again for ''The New Mademoiselle'' handbag. In 2008, she modelled for [[Miu Miu]]. Meanwhile, she was included in the French children's album and concert ''[[:fr:Le Soldat rose|Le Soldat Rose]]'' in 2006.
