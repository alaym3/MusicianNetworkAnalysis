Four of the band members grew up in [[Rockville, Maryland]] and attended [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]]. After graduating, they went on to study at [[Ohio State University]]. There they met the fifth member, saxophonist/guitarist Jerry DePizzo from [[Youngstown, Ohio]].

==History==

===Formation and early years (1996–2004)===
After earlier iterations performing together as far back as middle school, O.A.R. was formed in 1996 by lead vocalist Marc Roberge and drummer Chris Culos, inspired in part by Roberge's older brother, who plays drums for the band [[Foxtrot Zulu]]. They later recruited Richard On and Benj Gershman. In 1996 they recorded their debut album, ''[[The Wanderer (O.A.R. album)|The Wanderer]]'', at Gizmo Recording Company in Silver Spring, Maryland with engineer/producer Gantt Kushner. Many songs from the album, including "Black Rock" and "That Was A Crazy Game of Poker", became staples of their live shows and are still played at most concerts today.

The three of the four band members attended one semester at [[Alexander Muss High School in Israel]], graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School|Wootton High School]] in Rockville, Maryland, then moved to [[Columbus, Ohio]] to attend The Ohio State University. While at Ohio State, they met Jerry DePizzo, from [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. He joined the band as the saxophonist, completing the current lineup. In 1999, they returned to Gizmo Recording to record their second album, ''[[Soul's Aflame]]''.

Unlike other similar bands, O.A.R. did not use much formal advertising/marketing plans to obtain an audience, instead choosing to rely on word-of-mouth and touring alone. Their third album ''[[Risen (O.A.R. album)|Risen]]'' debuted at No.11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top internet sales chart. They received offers from various major labels, but ultimately chose to sign with [[Lava Records]] in 2002.  The following year, their fourth album ''In Between Now and Then'' debuted at No.&nbsp;156 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

===Mainstream success (2005–present)===
In 2005, O.A.R. released their fifth album, ''[[Stories of a Stranger]]'', which debuted at No.&nbsp;40 on the Billboard 200. It produced the singles "Love and Memories", "Heard the World", and "Lay Down." "Love and Memories" was the band's first single to chart and receive significant radio airplay, peaking at 98 in the [[Pop 100]], at 30 in [[Modern Rock Tracks]], and at 18 in [[Adult Top 40]]. The music videos for "Love and Memories" and "Lay Down" received airplay on [[VH1]] and [[MTV]]. The video for "Lay Down" received a "Woodie" award from MTV for streaming video. 

On January 14, 2006, O.A.R. reached a new peak of popularity by drawing roughly 18,000 fans and selling out New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]], which earned them a review in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/16/arts/music/16oar.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Scrappy Jam Band, but Hold the Jam | first=Kelefa | last=Sanneh | date=January 16, 2006 | access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> On October 5, 2006, a press release declared that O.A.R. had officially sold in excess of 1.2 million albums over their career.<ref name=marketwire>Press Release (2006).

On July 15, 2008, O.A.R. released their sixth studio album, ''[[All Sides (O.A.R. album)|All Sides]]''. The first radio single for ''All Sides'', "[[Shattered (Turn the Car Around)]]", was released on June 13, despite the band initially having hesitations about including the song on the album. It surpassed "Love And Memories", peaking at 2 in [[Adult Top 40]]. In December 2008, [[VH1]] named the music video for "Shattered" as number 18 on their Top 40 Videos of 2008.

''[[King (O.A.R. album)|King]]'' was released on Wind-up Records on August 2, 2011 and debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, the highest-charting debut for the band so far.
