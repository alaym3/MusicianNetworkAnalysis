==Early life and education==
Jon Hopkins was born in 1979 in Kingston upon Thames and grew up in nearby [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. He first became aware of [[electronic music]] after hearing early [[house music]] on the radio at the age of seven or eight, and also became a fan of [[Depeche Mode]] and the [[Pet Shop Boys]].<ref name="clubbers"/> These records inspired an early fascination with [[synths]].<ref name="moog"/>

At the age of 12 Hopkins began studying piano at the Junior Department of the [[Royal College of Music]] in London, where he continued until age 17.<ref name="hollo"/> The composers that were greatly influential to him whilst studying were [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Stravinsky]], and he eventually won a competition to perform a concert of Ravel's [[Piano Concerto in G]] with an orchestra.<ref name="ibzia"/> For a time Hopkins considered becoming a professional pianist, only to decide classical performance was too formal and unnerving to pursue full-time.<ref name="hollo"/>

As a teenager he also listened to [[acid house]], early [[hardcore techno|hardcore]], [[grunge]],<ref name="opal"/> as well as [[electronica]] artists such as [[Acen]], [[Seefeel]], and [[Plaid (band)|Plaid]].<ref name="dom"/> When Hopkins was 14 he got his first computer, an [[Amiga 500]], and started programming [[MIDI]] material.<ref name="patriarch"/> By the age of 15 he had saved up enough money from winning piano competitions to buy a low-level professional [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[synth]],<ref name="moog"/> and on this he began creating his first full-length electronic compositions.<ref name="jasn"/>

==Career==
===1997–2004: Early years===
After finishing his final exams at age 17, Hopkins accompanied his friend [[Leo Abrahams]] to an audition for [[Imogen Heap]]'s backing band. Hopkins decided to audition as well, and was hired to handle both keyboard and samples, while Abrahams was hired as guitarist.<ref name="ibzia"/><ref name="patriarch"/> He toured with the new band for the entirety of 1998.<ref name="hollo"/>

In 1999 Hopkins signed with boutique London label Just Music as a solo artist, and began recording his debut album ''Opalescent''. At the time he was also working part-time as a studio session musician.<ref name="hollo"/><ref name="jasn"/> ''Opalescent'' attracted positive press attention upon its release, and several tracks were licensed to ''[[Sex and the City]]''.<ref name="ibzia"/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' reviewed it as "a beautifully realized debut. Using synth oozes, phased and echoed guitars and pianos and chilled beats, his wonderful tunes drift from calm to eerie power like a restless sea. It will delight any lovers of beautiful music." ''[[DJ Magazine]]'' gave it 4/5 stars, and stated "Piano, guitar strings and slow beats blend like the clouds at sunset (or an opiate smoothy) filtering in and out like elegantly wasted beauty. Darker drums add a further depth."<ref name="opalreviews"/>

Hopkins released his second album, ''Contact Note'', on Just Music in 2004 while still working as a studio musician. The album slowly gained an underground following but failed to take off, and led Hopkins to become disillusioned with his solo career, and take a break from writing to learn how to become a producer.<ref name="ibzia"/>

===2004–2007: Work with Brian Eno and Coldplay===

By 2004, Abrahams had been collaborating for some time with [[ambient music|ambient]] musician and producer [[Brian Eno]]. Abrahams played some of Hopkins' second record for Eno, and Eno invited him to join them for a jam session. On the first day of their collaboration they came up with some of the music for Eno's upcoming album ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'',<ref name="hollo"/> and Hopkins became a long-term collaborator.<ref name="dom"/><ref name="jasn"/> Shortly afterwards Hopkins produced [[King Creosote]]'s album ''[[Bombshell (King Creosote album)|Bombshell]]'', which initiated his relationship with the [[Fence Collective]]. He also co-wrote tracks with DJ and composer [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] for Holmes' ''Holy Pictures'' album, and remixed for [[James Yorkston]].<ref name="dom"/>

In 2007, Hopkins was invited by Eno, who was producing [[Coldplay]]'s upcoming album ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', to join the band in the studio for a day.<ref name="coldint"/> Hopkins ended up staying and contributing to the album for the next year, co-producing<ref name="jasn"/> several tracks and playing [[Organ (music)|organs]], [[Pump organ|harmoniums]], and other keyboard instruments on others. The intro to the track "[[Violet Hill (song)|Violet Hill]]" came from an improvisation with Hopkins and [[Davide Rossi]], the album's string arranger. Throughout this period Hopkins was periodically creating his own solo tracks, and his song "Light Through the Veins" was adapted to serve as the introduction to the album's first track "[[Life in Technicolor]]". "Light Through the Veins" was also picked by the band to serve as the backing for the track "The Escapist", which is [[Hidden track|hidden]] at the end of the album.<ref name="coldint"/> ''Viva la Vida'' was released in 2008, and won [[Best Rock Album]] at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]] and became the best-selling album of 2008. Coldplay asked Hopkins to serve as the pre-show DJ and opening act for their 2008 world tour.<ref name="dom"/><ref name="tinymix"/> Hopkins toured with the band for six months through England, the United States, and Japan.<ref name="mutek"/> He performed at venues including [[Madison Square Garden]]<ref name="patriarch"/> and the London [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]],<ref name="coldint"/> with crowds as large as 20,000 people.<ref name="patriarch"/>

===2008–2013: ''Entity''; production===
[[File:Jon Hopkins (3679985832).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hopkins performing live in 2009]]
In 2008 Hopkins was commissioned by choreographer [[Wayne McGregor]] to compose music for ''Entity'', a production of McGregor's "Random Dance" group. ''Entity'' was performed live at [[Sadler's Wells]] in April 2008 to critical acclaim. A world tour followed throughout 2008 and 2009.<ref name="dom"/>

Hopkins also has co-writing or producing credits on albums by artists such as<ref name="jasn"/> [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]]<ref name="tinymix"/> and Dan Arborise.<ref name="coldint"/> He is also known for remixing a variety of artists, including [[Wild Beasts]], [[Nosaj Thing]], Imogen Heap, [[Four Tet]],<ref name="dom"/> and [[James Yorkston]].<ref name="dom"/> He was also one of the few producers chosen by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s [[Rob Da Bank]] to remix film director [[David Lynch]]'s first electronica release, "Good Day Today" / "I Know", which was released on Sunday Best Records.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===2008–2009: ''Insides''===
{{main|Insides (album)}}
Hopkins signed to [[Domino Recording Company]] in late 2008.<ref name="soundcl"/> Hopkins's third album, ''[[Insides (album)|Insides]]'', was released by Domino Records on 5 May 2009.<ref name="tinymix"/> It included the track "Light Through the Veins", which had previously been used on the [[Coldplay]] album, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''. Some of the tracks had been written by Hopkins sporadically since his last release, while others were based on the music he had composed for the ''Entity'' production.<ref name="dom"/> Hopkins developed an intense live show to support the release, resulting in club and festival performances across Europe and the United States. He secured supporting slots with [[The xx]], [[Röyksopp]], and Four Tet.<ref name="dom"/> Many of his live shows used background visuals featuring the animations of Vince Collins.<ref name="hollo"/>

''Insides'' charted at no. 15 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance/Electronic Albums chart.<ref name="billb"/><ref name="dom"/> ''[[PopMatters]]'' listed the album as one of the top ten electronic albums of 2009.<ref name="moog"/> According to reviews, the album "takes its cues from [[ambient music|ambient]] electronica, but uses strings and piano, along with some very tasty beats and [[dubstep]]-influenced bass on some tracks."<ref name="hollo"/> ''TinyMixTapes'' stated the album<blockquote>strikes me as his single most aggressive release yet. His sense of timing, the clarity of his production, and the variety of effects he employs draw you into the story that each instrumental tells. Jon Hopkins is not a button-pushing man of presets; he is a bona fide composer and a trained pianist. Craftsmanship sets him apart, and allows ''Insides'' to be as incredibly moving as it is and always will be. It will easily be one of the best electronic albums of 2009.<ref name="tinymix"/></blockquote> Paul Clarke of the BBC wrote that<blockquote>Hopkins [is] capable of producing music as epic, soaring and emotional as any power ballad in his own way. Take "Light Through The Veins" for example ... a close relative of [[Ulrich Schnauss]]' "In All The Wrong Places", it's a majestic piece of widescreen [[shoegazing]] which grows ever more expansive throughout its entire ten-minute duration ... no amount of reflected glory could ever fully illuminate ''Insides''<nowiki>'</nowiki> mysterious depths.<ref name="bbcyo"/></blockquote>

===2009–2013: Pure Scenius, film scores===
[[File:Jon Hopkins (5571448335).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hopkins performing live in 2011]]
In June 2009 Hopkins was invited by Brian Eno to play some solo shows at the Luminous Festival at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. A few weeks prior to leaving, Eno asked Hopkins to join with himself, [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s [[Karl Hyde]], Leo Abrahams, and the Sydney-based improv trio [[The Necks]] in the group "Pure Scenius", the planned finale for the Luminous Festival.<ref name="dom"/> They then improvised music based on pre-planned themes, putting on three 1½-hour shows in the Opera House with Hyde on vocals. Pure Scenius was repeated a year later in [[Brighton]], when Eno was curating the [[Brighton Festival]].<ref name="patriarch"/>

In 2009, Hopkins collaborated with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams to score the [[Peter Jackson]] film ''[[The Lovely Bones (film)|The Lovely Bones]].''<ref name="dom"/> In early 2010, Hopkins composed the score for the short film ''Rob and Valentyna in Scotland'' directed by Eric Lynne, which won an honourable mention for the short film-making award at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Also in 2010 Hopkins was commissioned to create the soundtrack for the British science fiction film ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', which was directed by [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]].<ref name="dominoromonsters"/> To create the score, Hopkins partly used string parts performed by arranger [[Davide Rossi]] and guitar by Leo Abrahams.<ref name="dominvor"/> The soundtrack album was released on 29 November 2010 on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]].<ref name="amazonmonsters"/> In 2011 the score was nominated for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Original Score.<ref name="dominvor"/>

The album was a culmination of about seven weeks of work spread over seven years of recording and collaboration,<ref name="clubbers"/> from whenever the two artists had the opportunity to get together. The album was released on 28 March 2011<ref name="soundcl"/> to acclaim,<ref name="colplay"/> which included a glowing review from [[NPR]]. On 19 July 2011 Hopkins and Anderson were announced as nominees for the 2011 [[Barclaycard Mercury Prize]], which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.<ref name="npr"/>

Also in 2011, the EP ''[[Honest Words]]'', a Hopkins collaboration with King Creosote, was released on Domino Records. In April 2012, this was followed by another collaboration with King Creosote: ''The Jubilee'', also on Domino.

|style="text-align: left;"| "[Hopkins] created the album's warm, alive feel by shunning digital perfection in favor of the analog synthesis of original sounds, both electronic and physical. The ambient prelude of the haunting, scrambled glitch-house opener 'We Disappear'—a key unlocks the door of Hopkins' London studio and his footsteps lead in—is more than idle window dressing: He is ushering us into the tactile space that suffuses the record. He drums on desks, plays salt shakers, slows down serendipitous recordings of nearby fireworks, boosts the kick-drummed rattle of a window."

''[[Immunity (Jon Hopkins album)|Immunity]]'' is Hopkins' fourth studio album, released on 4 June 2013, by Domino Records.<ref name="ohpitchfor"/><ref name="imomh"/> Among the artists that contributed vocals were long-time collaborator King Creosote, and Corin Roddick and Megan James of the band [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]].<ref name="immauneall"/> It was recorded and produced in Hopkins' London studio, with Hopkins often using homemade sound effects or the natural sound of the room.<ref name="ohpitchfor"/> Stated ''[[MixMag]]'', "''Immunity'' is an album of organic techno and exquisite mini-symphonies."<ref name="emmixmag"/>

''Immunity'' peaked at no. 13 on [[Top Electronic Albums]] by ''Billboard'' in the United States.<ref name="immunbill"/> In Britain it was nominated for the 2013 [[Mercury Prize]] for best album.<ref name="mercuryshortlist"/> The album met with a largely positive reception among critics, receiving perfect scores from ''Mixmag''<ref name="emmixmag"/> and [[MusicOMH]],<ref name="imomh"/> and 4/5 from ''The Guardian.''<ref name="spnguardian"/> [[Pitchfork Media]] described ''Immunity'' as a "remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record,"<ref name="ohpitchfor"/> and MusicOMH called it a "modern classic".<ref name="imomh"/>

The video for the single 'Open Eye Signal' directed by [[Aoife McArdle]] won best cinematography at the [[UK Music Video Awards]].

==Style and equipment==
;Style and genre
According to reviews, "Hopkins's aesthetic is perpetually intriguing. He transcends genres, melding digital coldness with subtle, bucolic textures; veering from skewed elegance to strange, unsettling depths."<ref name="opal"/> "He makes powerfully emotive, instrumental music that consistently crosses genres, ranging from solo acoustic piano to explosive, bass-heavy electro."<ref name="dom"/> Also, he "meticulously constructs lush, downtempo arrangements, blending digital beats and soothing ambience."<ref name="jasn"/>

;Equipment and software
As of September 2010 his studio setup relies on a [[Logic Studio|Logic]] system,<ref name="kirn"/> though all his previous releases were on [[Cubase|Cubase VST]], used in conjunction with an old version of [[SoundForge]].<ref name="ibzia"/> He began using Logic because his old system was not powerful enough to include the video for film soundtracks.<ref name="kirn"/> His live setup includes [[Ableton Live]] and a chain of up to five [[Kaoss Pad]]s.

==Personal life==
Hopkins practices [[autogenic training]] and [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]], of which he says, "For me, it's not about relaxing. It can get music flowing in a way that's really uninhibited, and I want to spend as much time in that place as possible."<ref name=latimes2014>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=August|title=Jon Hopkins crafts dance music to meditate on|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-dj-jon-hopkins-dance-music-20140725-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref>
