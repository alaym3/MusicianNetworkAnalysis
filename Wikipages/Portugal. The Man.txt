The Man Frontiersman John Gourley |publisher=Inflatable Ferret |access-date=2011-10-02}}</ref> Anatomy of A Ghost quickly gained popularity, but before long, the group broke up. Portugal.

==== Band name ====
The band's name is based on the idea of [[David Bowie]]'s "bigger than life" fame. They wanted the band to have a bigger-than-life feel but did not want to name it after one of their members. "A country is a group of people," guitar player and vocalist John Gourley explains. "With [[Portugal]], it just ended up being the first country that came to mind. The band's name is 'Portugal'. The period is stating that, and 'The Man' states that it's just one person" (any one of the band members). The name has a more personal meaning as well: ''Portugal. The Man'' was going to be the name of a book that Gourley had planned to write about his father and his many adventures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundbaites.blogspot.pt/2011/06/portugal-man.html|title=Portugal.

The Man album)|Woodstock]]''. The release was followed by an accompanying music video three days later. It was revealed that ''Gloomin + Doomin'' "failed to complete" and was thrown out after three years.

The album's title was inspired by an original 1969 [[Woodstock]] music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley's father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost 50 years later, music has the same mission as then – "to comment on societal and political unease." "We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered," said Gourley. "Trying to write music that would help people feel they're not alone, even if they're angry or feeling lost."<ref name="Feel It Still Billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7710337/portugal-the-man-single-video-feel-it-still |title=Portugal.
