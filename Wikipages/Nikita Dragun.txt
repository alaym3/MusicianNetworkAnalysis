Later, Dragun decided to move to Los Angeles, and got accepted to the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]], where she obtained her business degree. She said, “I was very [[Hannah Montana]] at the time. I would be in class, and we’d talk about influencers and brand deals, and my face would pop up on the screen and they’d start talking about me! They had no idea that I was sitting in the class. I never wanted anyone to know.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomward/2019/04/17/nikita-dragun-is-transforming-the-face-of-beauty/|title=Nikita Dragun Is Transforming The Face Of Beauty|last=Ward|first=Tom|date=April 17, 2019|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>

== Career ==

In response to comments by [[L Brands]] chief marketing officer [[Edward Razek|Ed Razek]] that trans women should not be included in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show because "the show is a fantasy", Dragun tweeted a video of herself modeling lingerie.
