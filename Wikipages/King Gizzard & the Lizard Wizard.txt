'''King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard''' are an Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2010 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Hann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/27/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-im-in-your-mind-fuzz-review |title=King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard: ''I'm in Your Mind Fuzz'' review &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Patrick Emery |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-album-more-than-a-procession-of-songs-20141126-11tcc5.html |title=King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard: album more than a procession of songs |website=Smh.com.au |date=27 November 2014 |access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref> The band consists of Stu Mackenzie (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, flute, sitar), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (vocals, harmonica, keyboards), [[Cook Craig]] (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Joey Walker (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Lucas Harwood (bass, keyboards), and Michael Cavanagh (drums, percussion). They are known for exploring multiple genres, staging energetic live shows and building [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard discography|a prolific discography]], having released eighteen studio albums, ten live albums, two compilations and two EPs.

Their second EP, ''[[Willoughby's Beach]]'' (2011), and debut album, ''[[12 Bar Bruise]]'' (2012), primarily blended [[surf music]] and [[garage rock]], and were released on [[Flightless (record label)|Flightless]], the band's own label. Their second album, a "psychedelic spaghetti western" titled ''[[Eyes Like the Sky]]'' (2013), features spoken-word narration by [[Broderick Smith]]. ''[[Float Along – Fill Your Lungs]]'', released later in the year, and the 2014 albums ''[[Oddments]]'' and ''[[I'm in Your Mind Fuzz]]'', saw the band expand on their psychedelic sound. In 2015, they drew on elements of [[jazz fusion]] and [[progressive rock]] with ''[[Quarters!]]'', and also released the folk-inspired ''[[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon]]'', recorded almost entirely using acoustic instruments. ''[[Nonagon Infinity]]'' (2016), arguably their most acclaimed album to date, features nine interconnected tracks that form an infinite loop, and won the [[ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/album-reviews/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-murder-of-the-universe-prog-rock-walks-the-earth-once-more-1.3120956|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard: ''Murder of the Universe'' – prog-rock walks the earth once more|last=Clayton-Lea|first=Tony|date=21 June 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/top-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-115982|title=Top 10 best King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard songs|last=Adams|first=Will|date=13 March 2017|website=[[AXS (company)|AXS]]|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year: ''[[Flying Microtonal Banana]]'', an experiment in [[microtonal music|microtonality]], in February; the three-chapter "sci-fi heavy metal epic" ''[[Murder of the Universe]]'' in June; ''[[Sketches of Brunswick East]]'', an [[jazz improvisation|improvised jazz]] collaboration with [[Mild High Club]], in August; ''[[Polygondwanaland]]'', was released into the public domain, in November; and ''[[Gumboot Soup]]'' in December. The 2019 albums ''[[Fishing for Fishies]]'' and ''[[Infest the Rats' Nest]]'' saw the band incorporate [[boogie rock]] and [[thrash metal]] into their sound, respectively.

Throughout 2020, the band released several live albums, [[Chunky Shrapnel|a concert film]], a double compilation of demos, ''[[K.G. (album)|K.G.]]'', their 16th studio album and a compilation of early singles and all the tracks on the ''Anglesea'' EP called ''Teenage Gizzard''. In August, Eric Moore (the band's second drummer and manager) left the band to focus on running his record label, [[Flightless (record label)|Flightless]]. In February 2021, the band released ''[[L.W. (album)|L.W.]]'', their third microtonal album, which was followed by the synth-based dream pop album ''[[Butterfly 3000]]'' in June. These albums were released independently rather than on [[Flightless (record label)|Flightless]].

==History==

=== Formation, early releases, and ''12 Bar Bruise'' (2010–2012) ===
The band members all grew up and went to school in the [[Deniliquin]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Geelong]] areas of Australia. Mackenzie, Moore, and Walker met studying music industry at [[RMIT University|RMIT]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Development|first=PodBean|title=Dive For Your Memory - Ep 15 - Ambrose Kenny-Smith|url=https://diveforyourmemory.podbean.com/e/dive-for-your-memory-ep-15-ambrose-kenny-smith/|access-date=2021-09-02|website=diveforyourmemory.podbean.com|language=en}}</ref> with the other members being mutual friends. The band started off as an informal jam band, with the eventual lineup becoming Mackenzie, Walker, Moore, Kenny-Smith, Cavanagh, Craig, and Harwood. The band's name was created "last minute". Mackenzie wanted to name the band "Gizzard Gizzard" while another band member wanted [[Jim Morrison]]'s nickname "Lizard King". They eventually compromised with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard/823749|title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard|date=20 October 2011|newspaper=FasterLouder|access-date=8 February 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Melbourne artist Jason Galea has created all of the band's album art, and a majority of their music videos.

The band's first releases were both singles: “Sleep”/“Summer” and “Hey There”/“Ants & Bats”, both self-released in 2010. The band's next release, 2011's ''Anglesea'', was released as a four-track EP on CD. It is named after [[Anglesea, Victoria|Anglesea]], the coastal town where Mackenzie grew up. These early releases didn't become available digitally until the inclusion of their tracks on the ''Teenage Gizzard'' compilation in 2020.

The band's second release of the year, ''[[Willoughby's Beach]]'', was released by [[Shock Records]] on 21 October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/willoughbys-beach-ep|title=Willoughby's Beach EP, by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> ''Beat Magazine'' described the 9-track garage rock EP as "filled to the teeth with consistently killer hooks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-willoughby-s-beach|title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard: Willoughby's Beach {{!}} Beat Magazine|website=Beat.com.au|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052040/http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-willoughby-s-beach|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In December 2011, the band appeared at the [[Meredith Music Festival]] for the first time.

The band's first full-length album, ''[[12 Bar Bruise]]'', was released on 7 September 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/12-bar-bruise|title=''12 Bar Bruise'', by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> The 12-track garage rock album was self-recorded, and several tracks used unconventional recording methods. For example, the vocals for the album's title track were recorded through four [[iPhone]]s placed around a room while Mackenzie sang into one of them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.purplesneakers.com.au/2012/08/album-review-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-12-bar-bruise/|title=Album Review: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard ''12 Bar Bruise'' {{!}} Purple Sneakers|date=17 August 2012|newspaper=Purple Sneakers|access-date=8 February 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== ''Eyes Like the Sky'', ''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'', ''Oddments'', and ''I'm in Your Mind Fuzz'' (2013–2014) ===
King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's second full-length album, ''[[Eyes Like the Sky]]'', was released on 22 February 2013.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/eyes-like-the-sky|title=''Eyes Like the Sky'', by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> Described as a "cult western audio book",<ref name="auto1"/> the album is narrated by [[Broderick Smith]] and tells a story of outlaws, [[Military use of children|child soldiers]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and gun fights, all set in the [[American frontier]]. The album was written collaboratively by Smith and Stu Mackenzie. When asked about the album's influences, Mackenzie said: "I love [[Western film]]s. I love bad guys and I love ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]''. Oh, and I love evil guitars".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.purplesneakers.com.au/2013/02/album-review-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-eyes-like-the-sky/|title=ALBUM REVIEW: King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard ''Eyes Like the Sky'' {{!}} Purple Sneakers|date=20 February 2013|newspaper=Purple Sneakers|access-date=8 February 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Mackenzie also stated, in a 2020 Reddit AMA, that ''Eyes Like the Sky'' was written as a response to being typecast in their previous releases- a reaction that "irks" him to this day.

The band's third full-length album, ''[[Float Along – Fill Your Lungs]]'', was released on 27 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/float-along-fill-your-lungs|title=''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'', by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> King Gizzard shifted from garage rock to a more mellow folk and psychedelic sound on this eight track album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-float-along-fill-your-lungs|title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard : ''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'' {{!}} Beat Magazine|website=Beat.com.au|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075503/http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-float-along-fill-your-lungs|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This album also saw Eric Moore start playing drums, after previously playing theremin and keyboards.<ref>{{Cite web|title=''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'' - King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|url=https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/float-along-fill-your-lungs|access-date=2021-03-10|website=kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com|language=en}}</ref>

''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'' was followed by ''[[Oddments]]'', released on 7 March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/oddments|title=''Oddments'', by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> Over the course of this 12-track album, the band takes a more melodic approach, and Mackenzie's vocals are more prominent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-oddments/836367|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – ''Oddments''|date=5 March 2014|newspaper=FasterLouder|access-date=8 February 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Oddments'' has been described as being "recorded through a woolen sock in an adjacent room".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaureview.com/albums/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-oddments-2014-lp|title=Album Review: King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard – ''Oddments'' (2014 LP) {{!}} the AU review|website=the AU review|language=en|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080430/http://www.theaureview.com/albums/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-oddments-2014-lp|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band's fifth full-length album, ''[[I'm in Your Mind Fuzz]]'', was released on 31 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/im-in-your-mind-fuzz|title=''I'm in Your Mind Fuzz'', by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|website=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> The 10-track album touches on elements of [[fantasy]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Canal Cascais|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard {{!}} Vodafone Mexefest 2014, Portugal|date=19 January 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8604AT8aAhk&t=5m47s|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> and lyrically delves into the concept of [[mind control]].

Drawing upon jazz-fusion and acid rock, the album's more laid-back sound was described as "unlike anything they've released before" and as "an album more likely to get your head bobbing and hips shaking as opposed to losing footwear in a violent mosh".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/445877/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizards-quarters-reviewed-in-quarters.htm|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's ''Quarters!''

Throughout 2018, King Gizzard continued to perform live shows, but did not release any new material. Instead, they re-released five older records, the ''Willoughby's Beach'' EP (2011), ''12 Bar Bruise'' (2012), ''Eyes Like the Sky'' (2013), ''Float Along – Fill Your Lungs'' (2013) and ''Oddments'' (2014), on CD and vinyl.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-reissue-albums/|title=King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard to Reissue Five Earliest Projects|website=Consequence of Sound|date=5 September 2018|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> They also released an official pressing of 2017's ''Polygondwanaland''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqNwu4lBl33/|title=Flightless records on instagram: ''Polygondwanaland'' was released for free on 17 November 2017...|website=instagram|date=16 November 2018|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref>

On 21 January 2019, the band announced on their Instagram page that new music was in the works, with an image in a studio of [[Gareth Liddiard]] ([[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]], [[Tropical Fuck Storm]]) flipping the bird as members of King Gizzard play in the background, which led to some speculation as to Liddiard's possible involvement in the band's new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs2XIYNFPbH/|title=@kinggizzard on Instagram: 'NeW.

In early March, details of the band's at-the-time announced fourteenth album, ''[[Fishing for Fishies]]'', were seemingly leaked onto webstores. The album title, cover and track listing were leaked, as well as 60-second previews and the entirety of the title track, and a release date of 26 April. The band then confirmed this leak on 11 March by officially announcing the album through their Facebook and Instagram accounts with the same release date on 26 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2035168/webstore-shares-previews-of-every-track-on-unannounced-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-album-fishing-for-fishies/news/|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard Announce New Album ''Fishing for Fishies''|date=9 March 2019|website=Stereogum|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> A day later, the band officially released and uploaded a music video for the title track to YouTube.<ref>{{Citation|last=Flightless Records|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – ''Fishing for Fishies'' (Official Video)|date=11 March 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beIDKFwXam0|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> Later that month, the band released another single from the album, "Boogieman Sam",<ref>{{Citation|last=Flightless Records|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – Boogieman Sam (Official Audio)|date=28 March 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kE1S9olY6A|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> and on 24 April, two days before the album release, the band released a final single, "The Bird Song".

On 9 April, the band released a music video for a new song, "Planet B", a [[thrash metal]] song regarding the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and a distinct departure from the softer sounds of ''Fishing for Fishies''. As this song did not feature on the track listing for ''Fishing for Fishies'', it led to fans speculating it was a selection from a second album to be released in 2019 prior to Mackenzie's later confirmation.<ref>{{Citation|last=Flightless Records|title=KING GIZZARD & THE LIZARD WIZARD – PLANET B|date=8 April 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtTi_uyYynA|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

During a [[Reddit]] AMA on 30 April, Mackenzie confirmed that the next King Gizzard album was being made and would include "Planet B", but the band had not decided whether or not it would be released in 2019. The album was initially believed to be titled ''Auto-Cremate'' due to the band's ambiguous response to a question regarding the use of the title as their username in the AMA, but was later confirmed to be titled ''[[Infest the Rats' Nest]]''. Mackenzie also said that the band planned to release a sequel to ''Eyes Like the Sky'' featuring a new story written by Broderick Smith and that their Gizzfest festival would be held outside of Australia for the first time in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-lizard-wizards-reddit-ama-learnt/|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's Reddit AMA: What We Learnt|last=Parker|first=Jack|date=30 April 2019|website=All Things Loud|language=en-US|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

Almost a month later on 29 May, a week after a teaser on social media, the band released the music video for a new song, "Self-Immolate", which incorporates a [[thrash metal]] style similar to "Planet B".<ref>{{Citation|last=Flightless Records|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – Self-Immolate (Official Video)|date=28 May 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmAlQvDQGoI|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref> On 18 June, the band posted a teaser on social media that confirmed their new album's title as ''Infest the Rats' Nest'', which was officially announced three days later for a release date of 16 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/melbourne-s-prolific-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-show-their-metal-20190619-p51z5r.html|title=Melbourne's prolific King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard show their metal|last=Mathieson|first=Craig|date=20 June 2019|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-release-thrash-metal-album/|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard to Release Thrash Metal Album|last=Parker|first=Jack|date=20 June 2019|website=All Things Loud|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>

On 12 November, the band announced two 3-hour live shows for 2020 whose [[set list]]s will contain elements of their entire discography, the first of which was to be performed on 18 April at the [[Greek Theatre]] in Berkeley, California. The second marathon show would have been performed on 6 May at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in Colorado. The band however was quick to announce on 22 November that another marathon show would have been performed at Red Rocks on 5 May, a decision made shortly after the Red Rocks show sold out within four days of its announcement.

===Live albums & compilations, ''Chunky Shrapnel'', ''K.G.'', the bootlegger program, and the departure of Eric Moore (2020)===

In January 2020, the band released three live albums as downloads on [[Bandcamp]], pledging to donate {{percentage|100}} of the proceeds towards relief for the [[2019–20 Australian bushfire season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8548081/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-three-live-albums-australia-bushfire-relief |title=King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard Release Three Live Albums For Australian Bushfire Relief |last=Brandle |first=Lars |date=15 January 2020 |website=Billboard.com |access-date=15 January 2020 }}</ref> ''[[Live in Adelaide '19]]'', recorded at [[Thebarton Theatre]] on 12 July 2019, and ''[[Live in Paris '19]]'', recorded at [[L'Olympia]] on 14 October 2019, were released 10 January; while ''[[Live in Brussels '19]]'', recorded at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] on 8–9 October 2019, was released 15 January. The albums' sales benefit [[Animals Australia]], [[Wildlife Victoria]], and Wires Wildlife Rescue, respectively.

In the first months of the year, the trio of Stu Mackenzie, Joey Walker, and Michael Cavanagh, who composed and recorded the material for King Gizzard's latest album ''[[Infest the Rats' Nest]]'', teamed up with previous collaborator Leah Senior and others to create a new soundtrack for the classic horror film ''[[Suspiria]]'' by [[Dario Argento]], with the previous soundtrack created by himself with the progressive rock band, [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]. Later on 18 April, in an interview, Stu Mackenzie revealed that the soundtrack would be released under the moniker, "Professor of the Occult".

In the wake of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the band postponed their [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] and [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre|Red Rocks]] marathon shows for later in the year. The band had also produced a film to be released, entitled ''[[Chunky Shrapnel]]'' from a lyric of the song "Murder of the Universe", from the [[Murder of the Universe|album of the same name]]; however, also due to the outbreak, the initial viewing was postponed for a later date and then canceled. The film was directed by John Angus Stewart, who also directed the music videos for the singles from Infest the Rat's Nest, and was recorded during the band's 2019 tour in Europe. The band decided to stream the film live for 24 hours from 17 April 6 PM to 18 April 6 PM (U.S. Eastern time zone). The film eventually screened on 8 May 2021 at the Astor Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-announce-chunky-shrapnel-screening-in-melbourne-2917137|title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard announce 'Chunky Shrapnel' screening in Melbourne|website=Nme.com|date=9 April 2021|access-date=13 June 2021}}</ref> A double-live album of the concert film would also be released with physical pre-orders starting on 10 April and available for streaming on 24 April. The band released three different limited edition copies of ''Chunky Shrapnel'' for pre-order. One of the editions, the "Copper Nitrate" wax pressing edition, sold out on the Flightless website within three minutes of being posted. The other limited edition copies sold out within an hour.

In April, the band stated that, during lockdown, they had worked on new material for upcoming albums. Mackenzie reported that one will be “pretty chill”, another “kind of jazzy”, and “some of it is microtonal” with the possibility of a sequel to ''Flying Microtonal Banana'', and the band also experimenting with electronic music and "messing around with some more polymetric stuff".<ref name=nmeint>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-working-on-a-few-projects-in-isolation-2649201|title=King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard working on a "few" projects in isolation|website=Nme.com|date=18 April 2020|access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref> In the same interview, when asked about more live recordings, Mackenzie also said that the band had recorded every show they played in 2019, and may release them in a similar fashion to [[Pearl Jam]]'s official live bootlegs.<ref name=nmeint/> June saw the release of ''RATTY'', a short documentary about the making of ''Infest the Rat's Nest''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-release-new-documentary-for-charity/|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard Release New Documentary for Charity|first=Sam|last=Sodomsky|website=Pitchfork.com|date=22 June 2020|access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref> The film was made available to rent online with all proceeds going to The [[Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation]] (ANTaR), BlaQ Aboriginal Corporation, Djirra, and Indigenous Social Justice Association Melbourne.

Also that month, in celebration of Love Record Store Day, the band released a limited print of eco-friendly versions of ten releases dating from between 2014 and 2017.

After releasing a snippet of a new song, the music video for "Honey" was released, incorporating an acoustic microtonal sound and themes centered around the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref>{{citation|last=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – Honey (Official Video)|date=14 July 2020|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADj2jDqT4uY}}</ref>

On 21 July, Aaron Grech of music.mxdwn.com released an article about the band's upcoming events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band postponed the marathon shows and North American tour for a second time, with the new dates being for October 2021.

On 12 August, the band issued a statement on Instagram with the words “Midnight Thursday”, along with a picture with fiery text with the words “SOME OF US”, hinting at a new song on the 13th. The music video for "Some of Us” debuted on YouTube the next day, continuing the themes of the COVID-19 pandemic from “Honey” but with a heavier feel than the previous acoustic tune. After the release, multiple sources mentioned a statement from the band that they have “made heaps of tunes lately”.

On 28 August, the band, through the first instance of their ''Gizzymail'' newsletter, confirmed that an album will be released in 2020, alluded to the possibility of another live album in 2020, and announced their intent to release at least three studio albums in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xznn.html?m=AVUAAAsF5QQAAAAGA7QAAAabgesAAAAAwQ4AAHfXABUqCQBfSLnsddaUOT9IRJ2vxCdVNsDfCQAU87M&b=427f889a&e=9f6504fa&x=_RHYXOZcxBMgYvjsbxSf0rMWzxwQCZ1sKcSn-WGmMVg|title=Gizzymail 1.

On 15 September, the band released their third single for the upcoming album, "Straws In The Wind". Like "Honey", the single was another acoustic microtonal song with lyrical themes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and many were quick to note that musically, the song transitions directly into the previous single "Some of Us".

On 28 September, the band announced via ''Gizzymail'' that two "MEGA DIY" releases were coming on 2 October on [[Bandcamp]]. These were suspected to be a live-album, as they had asked fans for footage of their 2019 US tour.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1305327304420196352 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2021 |archive-date=14 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914020758/https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1305327304420196352 |url-status=live }}</ref> They also announced they were building a new "studio/HQ".

On 2 October, the band released two albums via Bandcamp. The first, ''Demos Vol. 1 + Vol. 2'', includes 28 demos of songs spanning the band's entire career. This included older songs like "Footy Footy" from ''[[12 Bar Bruise]]'', along with songs like "Straws in the Wind", which had only been released less than a month prior. The second album released was a live album of the same variety as the three released in January, ''Live in Asheville '19'', recorded live at [[New Belgium Brewing Company]] on 1 September 2019.

On 20 October, the band teased the release of their sixteenth studio album ''[[K.G. (album)|K.G.]]'' and another live album, ''[[Live in San Francisco '16]]'', with both albums released on 20 November. It was announced that some limited edition versions of the records would be available. Alongside this, the band released the fourth single from ''K.G.'', "Automation". This single was released for free on their website in a similar manner to their 2017 album ''Polygondwanaland''. In addition to the raw audio files for the song as a whole, the band also included the files for separate audio channels within the song such as vocals, violin, clarinet and flute.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-21|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard - "Automation"|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2103026/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-automation/music/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=Stereogum}}</ref> They also released the video files for the song's music video, of which the band states: "If you'd like to create your own music video for Automation, we have supplied you with the raw video files to do so."<ref>{{Cite web|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|url=https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com|language=en}}</ref> All of these files require a torrent client to be installed on the user's device. Since the release of "Automation", there have been many remixes and music videos edited by fans and posted on sites like Reddit and YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web|title=r/KGATLW - AUTOMATION EDIT TRACKER - All 66 Known Video Edits and/or Remixes!|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/ji6gg5/automation_edit_tracker_all_66_known_video_edits/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=reddit|language=en-US}}</ref>

The band released a final single and music video on 19 November called “Intrasport”. ''K.G.'' and ''Live In San Francisco '16'' were released the following day.

On 10 December, the band released a new single called “If Not Now, Then When?”, continuing the microtonal and electronica styles of ''K.G.'' Some fans have pointed out that the new single continues where “The Hungry Wolf of Fate”, the last track on K.G., left off, with the band in a press release saying it was part of a bigger musical picture. Dr D Foothead, an animation director for shows on [[Adult Swim]] who had previously directed animated music videos for other rock bands like [[Osees]] and [[Melody's Echo Chamber]], said in an interview with Live For Live Music that “the song made me consider how individual action or inaction effects the world” and put those feelings to form in the music video. Also, in an interview with NME, Joey Walker said that 2021 would be a big year of output with some of their most divisive music yet, claiming “Part of me thinks this is the best we've ever done. And part of me thinks it's the worst.” He also talked about making a sequel to ''Chunky Shrapnel''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-18|title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard share 'Pleura' with music video filmed and uploaded in one day|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-share-pleura-with-music-video-filmed-and-uploaded-in-one-day-2883872|access-date=2021-03-10|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 24 December, or "Gizzmas", the band released two new "bootlegs". ''Teenage Gizzard'', a compilation of songs from the early years that included the early non-album singles, the tracks from Anglesea and a couple other rare tracks. The other, ''Live in London '19'' is another performance during the 2019 European tour, recorded on 5 October. With the release of these albums, the band launched the "bootlegger" program. This program allows anyone to create physical versions of certain albums of theirs, including all of the live albums released in 2019, the compilation album ''Teenage Gizzard,'' and their two part demos album, in addition to their previous free album, ''[[Polygondwanaland]].'' On their website's bootlegger page, the band said, "If anyone wants to release these albums, you’re free to do so. Below you’ll find links to audio master files and cover art. Feel free to get creative with it if you like - it’s yours. Only deal is you’ve gotta send us some of them to sell on GIZZVERSE.COM -  whatever you feel is a fair trade is cool with us."<ref>{{Cite web|title=BOOTLEGGER - King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard|url=https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger|access-date=2021-11-03|website=kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com}}</ref>

News about the seventeenth studio album, ''[[L.W. (album)|L.W.]]'', was discovered on the website for the music store Elusive Disc. Information included the track list, names and numbers as well as the release date of 26 February. The album is a direct sequel to the previous album ''[[K.G. (album)|K.G.]]'' and the third installment in the "Explorations into [[Microtonal tuning|Microtonal Tuning]]" series.<ref name="LW">{{Cite news |last=Richards, Will |date=January 17, 2021 |title=King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard look set to release new album ''L.W.'' next month |work=[[NME]] |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-look-set-to-release-new-album-l-w-next-month-2858205 |access-date=17 January 2021}}</ref>

On 28 January, the band released the second single for their upcoming album called "O.N.E." The track's themes continue those of "If Not Now, Then When?"; environmentalism, impending doom, and how the inaction of humans is damaging the earth. A number of articles released that day featured an official statement from Stu Mackenzie saying, “King Gizzard's new album (y'all know what it's called) is definitely not coming out in February”.

A countdown timer was discovered on the band's website, that would reach zero on 25 February at 7:00 AM (CST). On 18 February, the countdown page changed revealing the album cover and track list for ''L.W.'' This information was also revealed on their iTunes page except for a different release date of 27 February. It is presumed that the official statement from Mackenzie was only made because Elusive Disc spoiled the surprise.

The third single and music video for ''L.W.'', "Pleura", was released the same day as the album reveal. The music video featured the band performing the song live, and was recorded, mixed, and produced the day before it was released.

On 22 February, the band released a trailer for the upcoming ''L.W.'', which featured a snippet of the song K.G.L.W.. At the very end it showed another differing release date, this time being 26 February (the same as Elusive Disc).

On 25 February, the band released ''L.W.'' when the countdown timer ran out. This revealed the other two release dates as false flags. Their website changed again revealing a statement that said, “One dollar from every download of ''L.W.'' will be donated to Greenfleet, who plant native biodiverse forests in Australia and New Zealand.” With the pandemic lockdown in Australia loosening, the band played several shows in the Melbourne area to promote tracks from both ''K.G.'' and ''L.W.''

On 19 March, the band released ''Live in Melbourne '21,'' recorded from one of their first shows since the pandemic. This album because part of the band's bootleg program, with accompanying video footage. The band also released their 13th Gizzymail newsletter coinciding with ''Live in Melbourne '21'' release; in the mail there was a statement that read, “We've been having heaps of fun cooking up NEW STUFF in the studio. Can't wait to share new music with you", suggesting that the band had new music in the works.

The band's 18th full-length album, ''[[Butterfly 3000]],'' was announced on 11 May. The band stated that the album would be due 11 June, and would have no singles leading to release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/COtcRHpFarf/?igshid=t50nnvkym8v2|title=Butterfly 3000|access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref> It was also revealed that the album had 10 tracks, and was built around [[modular synthesizer]] loops.

On 24 May, the band announced that they would be postponing their 2021 tour to 2022. This was the second time these dates were moved, originally being planned for mid-2020.

On 29 May, a 15 second snippet was released by the band, and believed to be a clip from the record. However, the music in the clip did not end up appearing anywhere on the record. The same day ''Live in Sydney '21'' was released through the band's bootleg program, the 7th live recording in the program, and the 9th album overall.<ref>{{Citation|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard - Live In Sydney '21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbjZ-jZnoss|language=en|access-date=2021-06-02}}</ref> A video recording of the performance was also released. The band announced that they would be performance a series of 5 concerts at Sydney's [[Carriageworks]]. Each concert will have a different, pre-planned setlist, themed around a different style of music, including acoustic, "jams", microtonal, garage rock, and heavy metal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|url=https://carriageworks.com.au/events/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/|access-date=2021-06-20|website=Carriageworks|language=en-AU}}</ref>

''Butterfly 3000'' was released on all streaming platforms on 11 June 2021. The album received generally positive reviews,<ref>{{Citation|title=Butterfly 3000 by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/butterfly-3000/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard|language=en|access-date=2021-06-20}}</ref> with reviewers commending the album on its "sonic adventurism"<ref>{{Citation|title=Butterfly 3000 - King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/butterfly-3000-mw0003524334|language=en|access-date=2021-06-20}}</ref> and describing the songs as "pop-oriented additions [that are] are a perfect pairing to their existing sound.", while some critics said that the album's "formulaic approach lacks surprise".

On 14 June, the band released the music video for “Yours”, the first track on ''Butterfly 3000,'' directed by previous collaborator John Angus Stewart. A few days before the release, the band stated that every song on the album will have a music video. Later they released videos for "Shanghai", on 21 June and “Dreams”, on 28 June, and "Blue Morpho" on 6 July. Later in the month they released videos for "Interior People", on July 12 and "Catching Smoke", on July 26th.

In the midst of the ''Butterfly 3000'' videos being released, tour photographer and collaborator Jamie Wdziekonski announced a photo book via his [[Instagram]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Login • Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/|access-date=2021-09-01|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref> including photos from the band's 2019 European tour. The book's title, ''Chunky,'' is a reference to the concert film ''Chunky Shrapnel,'' which chronicled the same tour and was released in the spring of 2020. The book's first printing was available on the band's webstores in the United States, Europe, and Australia, and sold out within the day.

On 2 August, the band released the video for “2.02 Killer Year”, and later on 10 August, announced via Twitter that they had finished their next album, and included emojis of a diamond and a pickaxe.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1424991990278619136|url=https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1424991990278619136|access-date=2021-08-10|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> The next day, the band released the video for “Black Hot Soup”. Then, on 15 August, the band tweeted 2 more emojis; a drop of water and a faucet filling a glass,<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1426828772016197634|url=https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1426828772016197634|access-date=2021-09-01|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> leading to speculation that these emojis were related to a future album. On 24 August, the band released the video for “Ya Love”, and on 31 August, the final video, “Butterfly 3000” was released. Seven out of the ten videos for ''Butterfly 3000'' were directed by artists that the band had not previously worked with, and all of them were animated in various styles. This was unusual, as the band had previously only worked with a few select artists and directors to create their video clips.

On 31 August, the band released the "Ocular Edition" of ''Butterfly 3000,'' featuring all ten music videos on [[Blu-ray|Blu-Ray]], as well as behind the scenes content. Later on 8 September, the band announced that their Brisbane and Perth residency shows would be postpones, with dates to be announced. On 30 September, the band announced the release of a limited deluxe edition of their 7th LP, ''[[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon]]'', a double LP featuring an instrumental version of the album, as well as a new [[Lenticular printing|Lenticular]] cover. On 31 September the band released another bootleg live album, ''Live In Milwaukee '19'' via [[Bandcamp]].

On 30 October, the band played an unreleased track from an unspecified album at Melbourne's "Play On Victoria" event at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]]. The next day, the band released the lyrics to the song, "Gaia", via a screenshot posted to twitter.
