'''The Internet''' is an American band from [[Los Angeles]], California. It currently consists of vocalist [[Syd (singer)|Syd]], keyboardist [[Matt Martians]], bassist Patrick Paige II, drummer Christopher Smith, and guitarist [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]].

Their music is a blend of R&B, hip hop, jazz, funk, and electronic dance music. They have released four studio albums and three extended plays since their formation in late 2011. The band's 2015 album ''[[Ego Death (album)|Ego Death]]'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album]].

== History ==
The Internet was formed in early 2011 by [[Odd Future]] members [[Syd (singer)|Syd]] and [[Matt Martians]], along with touring members Patrick Paige, Christopher Smith, and [[Tay Walker]]. The band's name originally started out as a joke, inspired by [[Left Brain|Left Brain's]] answer to a reporter asking where he was from, to which he responded, "I hate when people ask me that, I'm going to start saying I'm from the Internet".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/10/magazine/25-songs-that-tell-us-where-music-is-going.html|title=25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going|date=2016-03-10|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The idea amused Syd, and inspired the name for her side project that eventually became The Internet.

Their debut album ''[[Purple Naked Ladies]]'' was released on December 20, 2011.<ref name="cover">{{cite web|url=http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/day/2011/11/08 |title=Ofwgkta |website=Oddfuture.tumblr.com |date=2011-11-14 |access-date=2013-03-07}}</ref><ref name="pma">{{cite web|url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/reviews/albumreviews/purplenakedladies|title=Album Review: The Internet - Purple Naked Ladies|website=Prettymuchamazing.com|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref> It was the first physical album to be released through [[Odd Future Records]]. Two songs from the album, "Cocaine" and "Fastlane", had music videos to accompany their release. The Internet has a song included on the Odd Future album ''[[The OF Tape Vol. 2]]'', called "Ya know".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oddfuturetalk.com/the-internet-give-us-a-preview-of-the-new-t-shirt-designs |title=New The Internet T-Shirt Designs |website=Oddfuturetalk.com |date=2012-01-18 |access-date=2013-03-07}}</ref>

The band released their second album ''[[Feel Good (The Internet album)|Feel Good]]'' in September 2013, and received praise from fans and critics. The first single from the album, "Give It Time", was released through [[Odd Future|Odd Future's]] official [[SoundCloud]]. On June 10,<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet: Give It Time|url=https://soundcloud.com/ofwgkta-official/give-it-time|website=Soundcloud.com|access-date=1 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> 2013, The band backed [[Mac Miller]] in [[London]] in promotion of his second album ''[[Watching Movies with the Sound Off]]''.

Their third album ''[[Ego Death (album)|Ego Death]]'' was released by [[Odd Future Records|Odd Future]] & [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] on June 30, 2015 to widespread acclaim. [[Matt Martians]] on [[NPR]] said about the album's title: "A lot of people that we know [are] just having their egos checked in many ways. Some people losing their jobs when, last year, they were at the top of the mountain; certain people's careers going in different directions that they didn't anticipate. And just kind of two words that you want people to think about these days, because we do have a lot of people who, on the Internet — whether it's Instagram, Twitter — it's a lot of egos that are really based on nothing backing it up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/08/16/432216332/a-band-called-the-internet-preaching-ego-death|title=A Band Called The Internet, Preaching 'Ego Death'|website=Npr.org|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Ego Death'', the band's members each focused on releasing individual solo projects. 2017 saw the release of [[Matt Martians]]' ''[[The Drum Chord Theory]]'', [[Syd (singer)|Syd]]'s ''[[Fin (Syd album)|Fin]]'', ''[[Steve Lacy's Demo]],'' Patrick Paige II's ''Letters of Irrelevance'' and Christopher A. Smith's ''Loud'', as a part of the duo C&T.

In December 2017, Steve Lacy told DJ Matt Wilkinson of [[Beats 1]] that the follow-up to [[Ego Death (album)|Ego Death]] was "95%" finished. He added: "I feel like this is on a higher echelon than Ego Death. I love Ego Death, that was a great record, but I know this one is a step up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/news/2017/12/steve-lacy-the-internet-album-update|title=Steve Lacy Talks New Internet Album, Singing Hooks With Syd|website=Pigeonsandplanes.com|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

In April 2018, Patrick Paige II announced his debut album ''Letters of Irrelevance''. Later that month, the band released the single "Roll (Burbank Funk)", in promotion of their fourth studio album, ''[[Hive Mind (The Internet album)|Hive Mind]]''. The track features joint lead vocals by Steve Lacy and Syd. The next month the band announced their fourth album, ''[[Hive Mind (The Internet album)|Hive Mind]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/the-internet-announce-new-album-hive-mind/9780584|title=The Internet announce new album Hive Mind – Music News|website=Abc.net.au|date=May 20, 2018|access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> which arrived on July 20, 2018. In October 2018, The Internet was the opening act at all but one show for [[Gorillaz]] on their North American leg of [[The Now Now Tour]], which concluded with the Demon Dayz Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorillaz.com/tour/|title=Gorillaz - Tour|website=www.gorillaz.com}}</ref> Their performance at the [[Scotiabank Arena]] on October 8, 2019 was their first ever performance in a stadium venue.
