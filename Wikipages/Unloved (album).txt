Joe Smith-Engelhardt of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' praised ''Unloved's'' aggression and "masterfully" executed breakdowns, writing, "If you're a fan of brutal beatdown riffs and demented experimental metal with a hardcore touch, ''Unloved'' is a necessary listen".<ref name="exclaimtop" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' Christopher R. Weingarten also lauded the album's unrelenting harshness, describing it positively as "a hailstorm where time-signature confusion meets shrill noise-rock affects".<ref name="RStop" /> [[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]] wrote that the aggression of the album was admirable, but criticized the running time for being too long and ultimately, unsustainable.<ref name="MS1" /> Daniel Cordova of ''Metal Injection'' wrote, "This album is nothing but breakdowns and chaos. It features some of the most fascinating and abrasive sounds I've heard on a record in a long, long time. The sounds on this hurt my brain almost as much as the band's name hurts my mouth to say."<ref name="MI4">{{cite web |last=Cordova |first=Daniel |title=The Weekly Injection: New Releases from Halestorm, Plini, Dee Snider, and More Out Today – 7/27 |url=http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/weekly-injection/the-weekly-injection-new-releases-from-halestorm-plini-dee-snider-and-more-out-today-7-27 |work=Metal Injection |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>
