==History==
===Formation and self-titled debut EP (2007&ndash;2008)===
[[File:WATO.jpg|thumb|left|220px|We Are the Ocean performing at Sheffield Leadmill, October 2008.]]
Dan Brown and Jack Spence were formerly in a band named ''Dead But Still Dreaming'', and when they disbanded they set about finding new members for a new band. They had formed a full line-up again by 2007 with Liam Cromby, Rickie Bloom and Tom Whittaker, and still under the original name of ''Dead But Still Dreaming''. After a while, Bloom left the band and was eventually replaced by Alfie Scully. Shortly after the creation of this solid line-up, the band decided on a new start with the name We Are the Ocean.

The band quickly shot to prominence thanks mainly to [[MySpace]] and were nominated for [[Kerrang!]] Best British Newcomer and voted K! Readers Poll 2nd best unsigned UK band.<ref name="Allmusic-bio">{{cite web|url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/we-are-the-ocean-mn0002461638 | title = We Are the Ocean - Music Biography, Credits and Discography | author = Jon O'Brien | work = [[Allmusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi]] | access-date  = 7 August 2012}}</ref> They released their debut EP entitled ''We Are the Ocean'' in 2008, selling 1000 limited edition copies in 1 day.

===''Cutting Our Teeth'' and subsequent touring (2008–2010)===
We Are the Ocean have an extensive tour history, having toured all over the UK, Europe, the US and Australia. They have played countless festivals, including the main stage at [[Reading and Leeds Festival]], [[Download Festival]], and are one of few UK bands invited to play Bamboozle festival in New Jersey, USA, one of the largest [[alternative rock|alternative]]/[[punk rock|punk]] festivals in the world.<ref name="Allmusic-bio"/>

We Are the Ocean started writing material for their debut album around December 2008. The album was produced by [[Brian McTernan]] ([[Thrice]], [[The Bled]], [[Converge (band)|Converge]]) at Salad Days Studio in Baltimore, USA. They were originally aiming for a Summer 2009 release but for unknown reasons the album release date was delayed many times. Pushing back to November,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=40280843&blogId=457431663|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}</ref> then pushed back again to 25 January 2010, and finally pushed back to 1 February 2010.<ref name="hasslerecords.sandbag.uk.com">{{cite web|url=http://hasslerecords.sandbag.uk.com/Store/DII-1081-1-we+are+the+ocean++look+alive+ep++tshirt+preorder.html|title=Hassle Records|website=Hasslerecords.sandbag.uk.com}}</ref><ref name="WE'VE SIGNED TO HASSLE RECORDS!">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=40280843&blogId=515038969|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}</ref>

The band re-released ''Cutting Our Teeth'' in October 2010 as a deluxe edition with a second disc, featuring the highly sought limited edition EP, and four unheard tracks. The re-release has received positive feedback from critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amplified.tv/2010/11/04/we-are-the-ocean-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107004842/http://amplified.tv/2010/11/04/we-are-the-ocean-interview/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2010|title=We Are The Ocean Interview|date=7 November 2010|access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref>

===Departure of Dan Brown and ''Maybe Today, Maybe Tomorrow'' (2011&ndash;2013)===
We Are the Ocean recorded their second album, titled ''[[Go Now and Live]]'', with Pete Miles ([[The King Blues]], [[Canterbury (band)|Canterbury]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amplified.tv/2011/03/07/we-are-the-ocean-to-release-new-album-april-25th/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310044710/http://amplified.tv/2011/03/07/we-are-the-ocean-to-release-new-album-april-25th/|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 March 2011|title=We Are The Ocean to release new album April 25th|date=10 March 2011|access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> The album's singles "What It Feels Like", "The Waiting Room" and "Runaway" were all playlisted on Radio 1, and received heavy rotation on many radio and television stations. The album reached number 45 in the chart in its first week.

On 1 March 2012, We Are the Ocean released that they will be entering the studio in May to record their third full-length album. On 5 June 2012, it was announced on their Facebook page that the band had parted ways with frontman Dan Brown, who would instead be pursuing a career as a band manager. Cromby will now be the primary vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/wearetheocean/posts/10151186612392977|title=It is with much regret that we announce... - We Are the Ocean |website=Facebook.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/dan-brown-leaves-we-are-the-ocean|title=The New Bury Tomorrow Video is A Tough Watch|date=9 January 2016|work=Rock Sound Magazine}}</ref>

===''Ark'' and disbandment (2014&ndash;2017)===
With new management now on board,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onefifteen.com/artists_wearetheocean.htm|title=One Fifteen - Artists - We Are the Ocean|website=Onefifteen.com}}</ref> the band recorded their fourth album, titled ''[[Ark (We Are the Ocean album)|ARK]]'', in the summer of 2014 and released an eponymous teaser single at the end of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cultnoise.com/song-review-ocean-ark/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225170634/http://www.cultnoise.com/song-review-ocean-ark/|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 February 2015|title=Song Review: We Are The Ocean – 'ARK' &#124; CultNoise|date=25 February 2015|access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> They recorded a BBC Live Lounge session, playing an acoustic version of the track and a cover of London Grammar's 'Hey Now'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02cb2yk|title=BBC Radio 1 - Live Lounge, We Are the Ocean|work=BBC}}</ref> which led to BMG/Infectious signing the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediaor.com/post/110162585789/bmg-infectious-makes-first-new-signings-music|title=BMG/Infectious makes first new signings - Music... - mediaor|website=Mediaor.com}}</ref> ''ARK'' was released on 11 May 2015.

After embarking on and finishing a tour to support their new album, updates on future endeavours became rare. In early 2016, the band was dropped by their label for undisclosed reasons. Later that year, they asked for pictures from past concerts on Facebook. On 18 January 2017, We Are the Ocean announced their disbandment and a farewell tour through Europe in February and March.
