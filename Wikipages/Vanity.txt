'''Vanity''' is the excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others. Prior to the 14th century it did not have such [[narcissism|narcissistic]] undertones, and merely meant ''futility''.<ref>''[[Oxford English dictionary]]'', on ''vanity''</ref> The related term '''vainglory'''<!-- which redirects here --> is now often seen as an archaic synonym for ''vanity'', but originally meant ''considering one's own capabilities and that God's help was not needed'', i.e. unjustified [[boasting]];<ref>''Oxford English dictionary'', on ''vainglory''</ref> although ''glory'' is now seen as having a predominantly positive meaning,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} the [[Latin]] term from which it derives, ''gloria'', roughly means ''boasting'', and was often used as a negative criticism.<ref>''Oxford English dictionary'', on ''glory''</ref>

In many religions, vanity, in its modern sense, is considered a form of self-[[idolatry]] in which one likens oneself to the greatness of God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes separated and perhaps in time divorced from the Divine grace of [[God]]. In Christian teachings, ''vanity'' is an example of [[pride]], one of the [[seven deadly sins]].  Also, in the [[Baháʼí Faith]], [[Baha'u'llah]] uses the term 'vain imaginings'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FVain+Imaginings|website=Bahai Quotes.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>

Philosophically, vanity may be a broader form of [[egotism]] and [[pride]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote that "vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality."<ref name=bartleby>[http://www.bartleby.com/66/51/41651.html Bartleby.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301050157/http://www.bartleby.com/66/51/41651.html |date=2006-03-01 }}</ref>  One of [[Mason Cooley]]'s [[aphorism]]s is "Vanity well fed is benevolent. Vanity hungry is spiteful."<ref name=bartleby/>

==Symbolism==
In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a [[peacock]], and in [[Bible|Biblical]] terms, by the [[Whore of Babylon]]. During the [[Renaissance]], vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a [[demon]] or a [[putto]]. Symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and the figure of death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Some depictions of vanity include scrolls that read ''Omnia Vanitas'' ("All is Vanity"), a quotation from the Latin translation of the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]].<ref>James Hall, ''Dictionary of Subjects & Symbols in Art'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1974), p. 318.</ref> Although the term [[vanitas]] (Latin, "emptiness") originally meant not obsession by one's appearance, but the ultimate fruitlessness of humankind's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.

"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her," writes [[Edwin Mullins]], "while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her."<ref>Edwin Mullins, ''The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women'' (New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., 1985), pp. 62–63.</ref> The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining [[Venus (god)|Venus]].

In his table of the [[Seven deadly sins]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]] depicts a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil; behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to [[Nicolas Tournier]], which hangs in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is ''An Allegory of Justice and Vanity'': a young woman holds a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]], symbolizing [[justice]]; she does not look at the mirror or the [[human skull|skull]] on the table before her. [[Johannes Vermeer]]'s painting ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, because the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.

''All is Vanity'', by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An [[optical illusion]], the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror. In the film ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', [[Satan]] ([[Al Pacino]]) claims that "vanity is his favourite sin".

Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.

In the RPG game [[Persona 5]], the second target [[Ren Amamiya]] and his friends have to change the heart of is Ichiryusai Madarame, and artist that plagiarises his students work and abuses them as well, with one of his students committing suicide over his actions. He is represented by Vanity as his Palace is an art museum filled with plagiarised work.
