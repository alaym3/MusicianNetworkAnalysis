In December 2017, Zone 2 released the ''Known Zoo'' mixtape, later dubbed a 'classic' by DJ Mag.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2021-08-12|title=Kwengface: new horizons|url=https://djmag.com/longreads/kwengface-new-horizons|access-date=2021-11-02|website=DJMag.com}}</ref>

The group is notable for its rivalry with Moscow17 (based in Elmington Estate and Brandon Estate, in [[Camberwell]] and [[Walworth]]<ref name=":2" />). These rivalries are expressed in the form of drill diss tracks, such as "Zone 2 Step" in response to Moscow17's "Moscow March",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2017/04/27/uk-drill-chicago-brixton/|title=From Chicago to Brixton: The surprising rise of UK drill|date=2017-04-27|website=FACT Magazine: Transmissions from the underground|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529054414/https://www.factmag.com/2017/04/27/uk-drill-chicago-brixton/|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> and physical violence.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.illicit-trade.com/2018/08/mars-pulls-advertising-from-youtube-after-its-products-appear-alongside-violent-uk-drill-rap-videos/|title=Mars pulls advertising from YouTube after its products appear alongside violent UK drill rap videos|last=Tóth|first=Matúš|date=2018-08-05|website=Illicit Trade News Network|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210030056/https://www.illicit-trade.com/2018/08/mars-pulls-advertising-from-youtube-after-its-products-appear-alongside-violent-uk-drill-rap-videos/|archive-date=2019-12-10|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/i-love-a-good-spanking-paloma-faith-nao-sleaford-mods-and-others-on-2018s-music-controversies|title='The British music industry needs to update': Paloma Faith, Nao, Sleaford Mods and others on 2018's music controversies|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2018-12-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210030056/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/i-love-a-good-spanking-paloma-faith-nao-sleaford-mods-and-others-on-2018s-music-controversies|archive-date=2019-12-10|url-status=live}}</ref> One member of Moscow17, Ryhiem Ainsworth Barton (also known as GB), was allegedly shot by a Zone 2 member.

The group, and drill music in general, faced increased scrutiny by authorities following an increase in violence in 2018. Artists within the group, such as Kwengface, were given 'rap injunctions', restricting the topics they could rap about. In a 2021 interview, Kwengface explained:<ref name=":4" /> <blockquote>The authorities interfered a lot, you know? Shows was getting locked off. We were doing things with [[Adidas]] and then they stopped working with us. A lot of artists didn’t wanna work with us, labels wouldn’t work with us [..] We were kind of just stuck. We were blacklisted, basically. I even took time out. I stopped releasing music for a while.</blockquote>Following the lifting of rap injunctions against the group,<ref name=":4" /> in December 2019, Zone 2 released a song titled "No Censor!". The song gained notoriety and became infamous on social media due to the uncensored nature of the song, with various claims of murders committed by the group as well as dead rivals being named outright and mocked throughout the song. Drill artists typically allude to people they are dissing as opposed to naming them outright. The song was taken off of YouTube in less than 24 hours of its release, but has since been reuploaded.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/drill-group-zone-2-no-censor-video-pulled-by-youtube-2585817|title=Drill group Zone 2's video pulled by YouTube after allegedly naming murder victims|date=2019-12-10|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211001227/https://www.nme.com/news/music/drill-group-zone-2-no-censor-video-pulled-by-youtube-2585817|archive-date=2019-12-11|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/zone-2-no-censor-video-removed-youtube-statement/|title=Zone 2's 'No Censor' video removed: YouTube issue official statement|website=Capital XTRA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034437/https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/zone-2-no-censor-video-removed-youtube-statement/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Kwengface stated the song was a reaction to previously being censored.<ref name=":4" />
