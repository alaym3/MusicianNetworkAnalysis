'''Michael James Owen Pallett''' (born September 7, 1979) is a Canadian composer, violinist, keyboardist, and vocalist, who performs solo as '''Owen Pallett''' or, before 2010, under the name '''Final Fantasy'''. As Final Fantasy, Pallett won the [[2006 Polaris Music Prize]] for the album ''[[He Poos Clouds]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2006/ | title=2006 Winners and Nominees | work=Polaris Music Prize | access-date=April 26, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424024052/http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2006/ | archive-date=April 24, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

From the age of 3, Pallett studied classical violin, and composed their first piece at age 13. A notable early composition includes some of the music for the game ''[[Traffic Department 2192]]''; Pallett moved on to scoring films, to composing two operas while in university. Apart from the indie music scene, Pallett has had commissions from the Barbican, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, National Ballet of Canada, [[Bang on a Can]], Ecstatic Music Festival, the Vancouver CBC Orchestra, and Fine Young Classicals.

On their Final Fantasy releases, Pallett has collaborated with [[Leon Taheny]], who is credited as drummer and engineer. Following the release of ''[[Heartland (Owen Pallett album)|Heartland]]'', Pallett has toured with guitarist/percussionist Thomas Gill<ref name="star">{{cite news |author-link=Ben Rayner|first=Ben|last=Rayner |title=Owen Pallett says farewell to Final Fantasy |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/cdreview/article/748614--owen-pallett-says-farewell-to-final-fantasy |work=thestar.com |date=January 10, 2010 |access-date=February 11, 2010 | location=Toronto}}</ref> and more recently with their former collaborators in Les Mouches, Rob Gordon and Matt Smith.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chromewaves.net/2011/04/beirut-finally-fulfils-fantasies-schedules-show-with-owen-pallett/ | title=A Call To Arms |work=Chromewaves.net |date=April 13, 2011 |access-date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

Pallett has been noted for their live performances, wherein Pallett plays the violin into a [[loop pedal]]. Pallett uses [[Max/MSP]] and SooperLooper to do multi-phonic looping, which sends their violin signal to amplifiers across the stage.<ref name=cycling74>{{cite web | url=http://cycling74.com/2010/12/01/an-interview-with-owen-pallett/ | title=An Interview with Owen Pallett|work=Cycling '74 website |last=Vdovin |first=Marsha |date=December 1, 2010 |access-date=January 29, 2011}}</ref>

Pallett is also known for touring and recording with [[Arcade Fire]]. In January 2014, Pallett and Arcade Fire member [[William Butler (musician)|William Butler]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[86th Academy Awards]] for [[Her (score)|their original score]] of the film [[Her (film)|''Her'']] (2013).

== Career ==

=== Solo work ===
Pallett has drawn significant inspiration from [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/03954-playing-the-field-owen-pallet-final-fantasy-heartland-interview|title=Orchestral Manoeuvres & Homoerotica: Owen Pallett Opens His Heartland|last=Turner|first=Luke|date=March 24, 2010|website=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=May 24, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Power2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerofpop.com/owen-pallett-live-in-singapore-2/|title=Owen Pallett – Live in Singapore|last=Jones|first=Mia|date=December 19, 2010|website=Power of Pop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190305/http://www.powerofpop.com/owen-pallett-live-in-singapore-2/|access-date=May 24, 2021|archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> who were Pallett's favorite band, along with [[Eurythmics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2014/09/09/interview-owen-pallett/|title=Interview: Owen Pallett|last=Stevens|first=Nathan|date=September 9, 2014|website=Spectrum Culture|access-date=May 28, 2021}}</ref> They have also identified albums by [[Tori Amos]], [[The Strokes]], [[Public Enemy]] and [[Brian Eno]] as influential.<ref name="Power2010"/> The name ''Final Fantasy'', under which Pallett recorded prior to the release of ''[[Heartland (Owen Pallett album)|Heartland]]'', was a tribute to the well-known [[Final Fantasy|video game series]], although Pallett said that it is not one of their top twenty favorite games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youaintnopicasso.com/2006/04/18/qa-with-owen-pallett-of-final-fantasy/ |title=Q&A with Owen Pallett of Final Fantasy |work=You Ain't No Picasso |date=April 18, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423231851/http://www.youaintnopicasso.com/2006/04/18/qa-with-owen-pallett-of-final-fantasy/ |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Owen Pallett.jpg|thumb|Final Fantasy performing in 2005.]]
Pallett's debut album, ''[[Has a Good Home]]'',<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-completely-biased-ranking-of-the-60-best-canadian-indie-rock-songs-of-the-00s-part-ii "A Completely Biased Ranking of the 60 Best Canadian Indie Rock Songs of the 00s Part II"]. ''Vice'', Cam Lindsay Apr 10 2017</ref> was released on February 12, 2005, by the [[Blocks Recording Club]], a [[cooperative]], Toronto-based record label of which Pallett is a founding member. "An Arrow in the Side of Final Fantasy" borrows the music from the Space Zone's final level in ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]''. "Adventure.exe" from this album was used in a series of 2006 commercials by [[Orange SA|Orange]] in the United Kingdom. Pallett did not intend to sell the song for this purpose, but its use was authorized due to an alleged miscommunication with their record label, [[Tomlab]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} All of Pallett's income from this use is donated to [[Doctors Without Borders]].

Pallett's second album, ''[[He Poos Clouds]]'', was released in June 2006, though the video, directed by [[Jesse Ewles]], was released on March 1, 2006. The album consists entirely of string quartet arrangements. Eight of the ten songs are about each of the schools of magic as described in the rules to the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]]. The album was named winner of the [[2006 Polaris Music Prize]]. Uncomfortable with receiving a prize sponsored by a mobile phone conglomerate, Pallett gave the money away to bands Pallett liked who needed financial assistance.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In July 2007, Pallett was interviewed on the [[CBC Radio One]] program ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', about their upcoming album, to be titled ''Heartland'', which was to have a theme of nothingness.<ref>"Q", ''CBC Radio'', July 9, 2007'</ref>

In 2007, the song "This Is The Dream of Win & Regine" was used in a commercial for [[Wiener Stadtwerke]] without Pallett's permission. Instead of litigation, Pallett and their booking agent Susanne Herrndorf approached the company for sponsorship for a music festival of their curation. The resultant [[Maximum Black Festival]] featured Final Fantasy, [[The Dirty Projectors]], [[Deerhoof]], [[Frog Eyes]], [[Max Tundra]], [[Six Organs of Admittance]] and others. It played Vienna, Berlin and London. In September 2007 they did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].

In October 2007 Final Fantasy released a vinyl 7" on Tomlab's Alphabet Single series (The Letter "X"). The two tracks on "X", recorded in Montreal with Zach Condon, of the band [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]]; predate the album ''[[He Poos Clouds]]''. The tracks – "Hey Dad" and "What Do You Think Will Happen Next?" are both played regularly at live shows. The song "Hey Dad" contains a melody borrowed from the Nintendo video game "[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]"; specifically it is the music from the "Coin Heaven" bonus/hidden stages. Also, the song is quite similar in melody, lyrics and tone to another of Pallett's songs – "→".

In March 2008, Owen Pallett under the alias Final Fantasy, collaborated with [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear's]] [[Ed Droste]] on a cover of [[Björk]]'s "[[Possibly Maybe]]" as part of [[Stereogum]]'s tribute to Björk's album, ''[[Post (Björk album)|Post]]''.<ref name=Sterogum>{{cite web |url=http://stereogum.com/bjork/ |title=Enjoyed: A Tribute To Bjork's Post |access-date=July 2, 2008}}</ref>

In Fall 2008, Pallett released two EPs. The first one, ''Spectrum, 14th Century'', was a collaboration with [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]]. The second EP, ''[[Plays To Please]]'', was a tribute to fellow Torontonian [[Alex Lukashevsky]] and his group [[Deep Dark United]]. On it, six Lukashevsky originals were reconfigured for a 35-piece big band, the Toronto-based St. Kitts Orchestra (which includes [[Drumheller]]'s Nick Fraser, Paul Mathew of [[the Hidden Cameras]], and a whistling [[Andrew Bird]], among others).<ref>{{cite web |title=New Final Fantasy – "The Butcher" & "Ultimatum" (Stereogum Premiere) |url=http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/new-final-fantasy-ultimatum-the-butcher_017131.html |work=Stereogum |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=October 7, 2009}}</ref>

On December, 2009, Pallett began performing and recording under their own name. The album ''Heartland'' was released on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]] on January 12, 2010. It was mixed by New York producer [[Rusty Santos]]. Also Pallett played [[Primavera Sound Festival]] 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OlasKoolKitchenOnRadio23OwenPalletLivePrimavera2010&reCache=1 |title=Ola's Kool Kitchen on Radio 23 Owen Pallett Live Primavera 2010 : DJ Ola : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |date=March 10, 2001 |access-date=2013-12-01}}</ref> In August 2010, Pallett released a four track EP entitled ''A Swedish Love Story'' on September 28 via Domino.

In June 2009 at [[Luminato]], Toronto's annual festival of arts and creativity, Pallett provided part of the live soundtrack for the outdoor screening (at [[Yonge-Dundas Square]]) of the 1919 silent German horror film ''Tales of the Uncanny'' (''[[Unheimliche Geschichten (1919 film)|Unheimliche Geschichten]]''), alongside Canadian instrumental band [[Do Make Say Think]] and [[electronica]] music artist Robert Lippok from Berlin, Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminato.com/2009/events/40|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411214228/http://www.luminato.com/2009/events/40|archive-date=April 11, 2009|access-date=June 13, 2016|title=TALES OF THE UNCANNY}}</ref>
