'''Da Vinci's Notebook''' (or simply '''DVN''') was a comedic [[a cappella]] singing group. Former Artists-in-Residence at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], they performed specials on [[Comedy Central]] and [[PBS]], and spent time as the "house band" on Washington radio's WBIG-FM. They were also regular guests on the nationally syndicated ''[[Bob and Tom|Bob and Tom Radio Show]]''.

==History==
Da Vinci's Notebook was formed in 1993, by Bernie Muller-Thym, Greg "Storm" DiCostanzo, Paul Sabourin and Richard Hsu. Muller-Thym, DiCostanzo, and Sabourin met via a classified ad. Hsu, a friend of DiConstanzo from the [[University of Maryland]], joined them in the summer of 1993. Bass singer Jay Jones sang with them from 1993 to 1994.

Da Vinci's Notebook made their debut at the 1994 Mid-Atlantic [[Harmony Sweepstakes]], where they came in third place.<ref>{{cite web|title=1994 mid-atlantic Regional Winners|url=http://www.harmony-sweepstakes.com/mid-atlantic/1994/|publisher=Harmony Sweepstakes|access-date=13 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414005007/http://www.harmony-sweepstakes.com/mid-atlantic/1994/|archive-date=14 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1996, they came back and won the 1996 Mid-Atlantic Harmony Sweepstakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History |url=http://www.davincisnotebook.com/history.asp |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208055324/http://www.davincisnotebook.com/history.asp |archivedate=8 February 2006 }}</ref>

They continued to tour, locally and nationally, for the next ten years.<ref name=be20030218>{{cite web|last=Rogovoy|first=Seth|title=Da Vinci's Notebook fills doctor's prescription|url=http://rogovoy.com/archive/378.shtml|date=18 February 2003|work=The Berkshire Eagle|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref>  Highlights included some of the most prestigious folk venues and festivals on the East Coast, such as the [[Falcon Ridge Folk Festival]].

In addition to their albums, Da Vinci's Notebook also recorded a track called "The Ballad of The Sneak" for the ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' cartoon website.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ballad of The Sneak | url=http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Ballad_of_The_Sneak | work=Homestar Runner Wiki | date=23 June 2003 | accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> This song was credited to the entire group, though it was only written and performed by [[Paul and Storm]].

In 2004, the band stopped touring and regular performances.<ref>{{cite web | title=Looking for Da Vinci's Notebook | url=http://www.paulandstorm.com/archives/looking-for-da-vincis-notebook/ | publisher=Paul and Storm | access-date=13 April 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414021705/http://www.paulandstorm.com/archives/looking-for-da-vincis-notebook/ | archive-date=14 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Two of the members, Paul and Storm, then hit the road as a musical duo dubbed [[Paul and Storm]]. Da Vinci's Notebook will still perform together on occasion for corporate shows.

In 2007, interest in the band spiked as they began to get played on the syndicated ''[[Bob and Tom Show|Bob and Tom]]'' radio show.  Their signature songs include "Ally McBeal", "Enormous Penis", "Internet Porn", "Kingdom in the Sky", and "Title of the Song".

In 2013, the group's song "Another Irish Drinking Song" was featured in the film ''[[Despicable Me 2]]'', with new lyrics in the language of the Minions.
