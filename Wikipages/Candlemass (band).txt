'''Candlemass''' is a Swedish [[epic doom metal]] band established in [[Stockholm]] in 1984 by bassist, songwriter and bandleader [[Leif Edling]] and drummer Matz Ekström. The band had a defining influence on [[doom metal]], and the genre itself is named after their debut album ''[[Epicus Doomicus Metallicus]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Along with [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]], [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]] and [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]], Candlemass has been referred to as one of the "big four of doom metal".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=80887|title=Petition For Doom 'Big Four' Tour Circulating|website=Metalunderground.com|access-date=16 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idioteq.com/the-big-4-of-doom-metal-tour-in-the-works/|title="The Big 4 of Doom Metal" tour in the works?|first=Karol|last=Kamiński|date=11 May 2012|website=Idioteq.com|access-date=16 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://chaospin.com/best-doom-metal-bands-of-all-time/|title=The 10 Best Doom Metal Bands of All-Time|website=chaospin.com|date=28 May 2021|access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/eric-wagner-lead-singer-of-doom-metal-legends-trouble-has-died-from-covid-19-11785165|title=Eric Wagner, Lead Singer Of Doom Metal Legends Trouble, Has Died From Covid-19|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|date=August 24, 2021|access-date=August 24, 2021}}</ref>

After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Candlemass disbanded in 1994, but reunited three years later. After breaking up again in 2002, Candlemass reformed in 2004 and have continued to record and perform since then.

==History==
===Formation and early career (1984–1990)===
After the breakup of his first band Nemesis, bassist [[Leif Edling]] started his own band under the name Candlemass with (session) vocalist Johan Längqvist, drummer Matz Ekström, guitarist Mats "Mappe" Bjorkman and Klas Bergwall.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=89/90}}</ref> Their first release, ''[[Epicus Doomicus Metallicus]]'' (1986),<ref name="LarkinHR"/> immediately secured their standing, positioning the band within metal circles, setting a milestone in the [[doom metal]] scene.<ref name="autogenerated1">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3827/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Candlemass > Biography )))]</ref> Following the band's debut album Längqvist was replaced by [[Messiah Marcolin]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> By the time the band entered the studio to record their second effort, ''[[Nightfall (Candlemass album)|Nightfall]]'', in 1987, Bergwall and Ekström had left the band. [[Jan Lindh]] joined the band on drums, and Lars Johansson joined the band on guitars following the completion of the album.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

Candlemass's next two albums were ''[[Ancient Dreams]]'' (1988) and ''[[Tales of Creation]]'' (1989).<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In 1990, the band released a live album ''[[Live (Candlemass album)|Live]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Shortly afterward, a dispute between the band members resulted in Messiah Marcolin's departure in 1991.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

===New singer-era, hiatus and first reunion (1991–2003)===
After Marcolin left, Candlemass recruited vocalist [[Thomas Vikström]] and recorded ''[[Chapter VI (album)|Chapter VI]]'' (1992).<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band then toured in support of that album. By 1994, Candlemass had called it quits, partly because ''Chapter VI'' was unsuccessful,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} and partially because Edling had formed another project under the name of [[Abstrakt Algebra]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> With Abstrakt Algebra not doing well, Leif suddenly recruited a new line-up under the name of Candlemass and recorded the album ''[[Dactylis Glomerata]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which was a combination of songs for a new Abstrakt Algebra CD and some new material.{{Citation needed|reason=Sept. 2008|date=September 2008}} A year later the album ''[[From the 13th Sun]]'' was released.

In 2002, the members of a past Candlemass line-up reunited. They performed some well-received live shows{{citation needed|date = January 2010}} and released another live album. Other albums released by the reformed band were [[remaster]]ed versions of ''Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Nightfall, Ancient Dreams'', and ''Tales of Creation''. A DVD called ''Documents of Doom'' was released as well. The band was working on a new album and recorded some new songs while searching for a record label when differences arose again, resulting in Candlemass disbanding a second time. In the meantime, Leif Edling started a new project, [[Krux]], with former Abstrakt Algebra singer [[Mats Levén]] and two members of [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].

===Second reunion (2004–2006)===
[[File:Candlemass - wacken.jpg|210px|thumb|right|Messiah and Leif at [[Wacken Open Air]] 2005]]
In November 2004, the band announced that they had re-united for the second time. They had recorded a new album, named simply ''Candlemass'', with the same line-up. It was released in May 2005. They won a Swedish Grammy for it in 2005.

In 2006 the band announced that a new album was in preparation, to be released sometime in 2007. In October 2006, after much uncertainty regarding Messiah Marcolin's participation, it was settled that Messiah was out for good.

===Robert Lowe era (2007–2012)===
Candlemass found a new vocalist, [[Robert Lowe (musician)|Robert Lowe]] ([[Solitude Aeturnus]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-taps-solitude-aeturnus-singer-to-replace-messiah-marcolin/ |title=Candlemass Taps Solitude Aeturnus Singer To Replace Messiah Marcolin |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=22 January 2007 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/solitude-aeturnus-guitarist-comments-on-singer-joining-candlemass/ |title=Solitude Aeturnus Guitarist Comments On Singer Joining Candlemass |website=Blabbermouth.net|date=22 January 2007 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref> who recorded with the band's ninth album ''[[King of the Grey Islands]]'', which was released on 22 June 2007.
The album is self-produced except for four songs produced by [[Andy Sneap]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-metal-doom-and-garlic/ |title=Candlemass: 'Metal, Doom and Garlic' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=18 October 2006 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref>

On 31 March 2007, Candlemass celebrated a slightly delayed twentieth anniversary. To commemorate the celebration, original singer Johan Längqvist appeared live with the band for the first time. The event was recorded and later released as a DVD.

Mats "Mappe" Bjorkman was sentenced to serve two years behind bars for grand theft in March 2008. He has been convicted of stealing over 35,000 CDs and DVDs priced at around 3 million Sek (Around $500,000).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200803/20/20080320124851_Realtid685/20080320124851_Realtid685.dbp.asp |title=Känd svensk gitarrist fick fängelse |website=Realtid.se |date=20 March 2008 |access-date=2 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006155055/http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200803/20/20080320124851_Realtid685/20080320124851_Realtid685.dbp.asp# |archive-date=6 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesliv/article2092521.ab |title=Musiker dömd till fängelse &#124; Nöjesbladet &#124; Aftonbladet |website=Aftonbladet.se |access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>

Candlemass worked on a tenth studio album in 2008. It was intended to be titled ''Hammer of Doom'', but they renamed it to ''[[Death Magic Doom]]'' because the name coincided with a German festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.candlemass.se/candlemass/2008/12/01/candlemass-new-album-finally-mixed/|title=Candlemass new album finally mixed! « Candlemass|date=23 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323040724/http://www.candlemass.se/candlemass/2008/12/01/candlemass-new-album-finally-mixed/|access-date=16 July 2021|archive-date=23 March 2009}}</ref> The album was scheduled to be released on 27 March 2009, but it was delayed until 3 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/events/news_comments.php?news_id=7975 |title=Candlemass - New Album Details - Metal Storm |website=Metalstorm.ee |access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, bassist [[Leif Edling]] told Soundshock that work on the next Candlemass album would likely begin before 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundshock.co.uk/index.php/feature-band-interviews/955-candlemass-interview-by-soundshocknet |title=soundshock.co.uk |website=Soundshock.co.uk |access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref> However, this plan fell through, and Leif had stated that the album's release date was pushed back to 2012, in order for the band concentrate on the 25th anniversary of their 1986 debut ''[[Epicus Doomicus Metallicus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrrecords.de/high_roller/sites/release_detail.php?relno=155 |title=CANDLEMASS - Don't Fear The Reaper 12 |website=Hrrecords.de |access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>

On 14 October 2011, it was announced that Candlemass were signed to the Austrian label [[Napalm Records]], who released their eleventh studio album ''[[Psalms for the Dead]]'' in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-signs-with-napalm-records-for-farewell-album/ |title=Candlemass Signs With Napalm Records For Farewell Album |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=14 October 2011 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-new-album-title-cover-artwork-revealed/ |title=Candlemass: New Album Title, Cover Artwork Revealed |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=16 March 2012 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref> Despite this, bassist [[Leif Edling]] stated that the band would not split up, but wanted to stop before they "get too old and start putting out half-lame albums."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-leader-we-re-not-splitting-up/ |title=Candlemass Leader: 'We're Not Splitting Up' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=24 February 2012 |access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Candlemass Party.San Metal Open Air 2017 13.jpg|thumb|Candlemass at Party.San 2017]]
On 2 June 2012, Candlemass announced via their website that [[Robert Lowe (musician)|Robert Lowe]] had left the band as vocalist, mainly due to the quality of the live performances and explained to be "a very difficult decision for the band", and was replaced for the band's upcoming shows by longtime friend and collaborator of Candlemass, [[Mats Levén]] (of [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[Treat (band)|Treat]] and [[At Vance]] fame, among others). Levén had earlier worked with [[Leif Edling]] in [[Abstrakt Algebra]] and [[Krux]] and sang on demos from the ''[[Candlemass (album)|Candlemass]]'' and ''[[King of the Grey Islands]]'' sessions, found on the box set ''[[Doomology]]''. In addition, keyboardist [[Per Wiberg]] (ex-[[Opeth]], [[Spiritual Beggars]]) also joined the band on stage for these live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.candlemass.se/candlemass/2012/06/02/candlemass-singer-change/|title=CANDLEMASS SINGER CHANGE!|website=Candlemass.se|date=2 June 2012|access-date=2 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925032318/http://www.candlemass.se/candlemass/2012/06/02/candlemass-singer-change/|archive-date=25 September 2012}}</ref>

===Return of Johan Langquist (2018–present)===
On 3 September 2018, Candlemass announced the return of Johan Langquist to the band after a 32-year hiatus.

Johan Langquist is back and we hope this will give us some new energy and kickstart the heart of doom again. We don't know if it will last 10 more years or even 5, but if it will give us just another year of having fun and playing the music that we love so much, it will be a blast! The circle is closed, Johan is back!" The band also announced that they were recording a new album for a 2019 release, making it not only the first Candlemass studio album since 2012's ''[[Psalms for the Dead]]'', but their first with Langquist since 1986's ''[[Epicus Doomicus Metallicus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/candlemass-parts-way-with-singer-mats-leven-announces-return-of-johan-langqvist/|title=CANDLEMASS Parts Way With Singer MATS LEVÉN, Announces Return Of JOHAN LÄNGQVIST|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=4 September 2018|date=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/here-is-video-of-candlemass-rehearsing-solitude-with-newly-returned-singer-johan-langqvist/|title=Here is Video Of CANDLEMASS Rehearsing 'Solitude' With Newly Returned Singer JOHAN LÄNGQVIST|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=4 September 2018|date=4 September 2018}}</ref>
