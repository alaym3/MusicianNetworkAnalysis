'''UNIQ''' was a [[nightclub]] in the centre of [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], near the main building of the [[Helsinki University]].

It was in the basement floor (one floor underground) of an office building housing a university research centre and an independent [[journalism]] studio.

The club's most noted feature was its "arctic [[ice]] bar", a separate room that is constantly kept at a temperature of about {{cvt|-5|C}}{{cn|date=September 2020}} and has its own bar, which, like all the other furnishings, is made of blocks of ice shipped from [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]].

The drinks at UNIQ are priced according to a "drink [[stock market]]", which updates the drink prices by increments of about 10 cents every few minutes depending on their popularity. Popular drinks become more expensive, while unpopular drinks become cheaper.
