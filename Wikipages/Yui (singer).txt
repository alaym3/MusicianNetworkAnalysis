'''Yui''' (born March 26, 1987), stylized as '''YUI''' or '''yui''', is a Japanese singer-songwriter, [[multi-instrumentalist]], and actress. In her solo career, she sold more than 5 million physical copies in Japan. She is popular in Japan and in surrounding countries, ranking number one in 2011 [[Count Down TV]] "Dearest Female Artist"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=CDTV Top 30 Most Dearest Female Artist|series=Count Down TV|author=Shinji Suzuki, Takayuki Ishibashi/Kō Serata, Shintarō Ōki (producers)|network=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System]]|airdate=August 13, 2011|language=ja}}</ref> and [[Music Station]] "Artist You Most Want to Marry"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Music Station|series=Music Station|credits=Tamori, Yoshie Takeuchi|network=[[TV Asahi]]|airdate=June 6, 2011|language=ja}}</ref> polls, as well as [[Radio Television Hong Kong]]'s "Most Popular Japanese Artist".<ref>{{cite web|title=22nd Pop International Poll|url=http://rthk.hk/special/poppoll22/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6UHO2pPJR?url=http://rthk.hk/special/poppoll22/|archive-date=November 22, 2014|publisher=[[Radio Television Hong Kong]]|language=zh|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 

Born and raised in [[Fukuoka prefecture]], she played live at various locations in her hometown before being noticed by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music Japan]] when she was 17 years old, and released her debut single months later. Her singles, however, were only met with moderate success until the breakout "[[Good-bye Days]]", which charted for 44 weeks on [[Oricon]] and marked her as one of the Japanese music industry's rising stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/358664/products/music/651433/1/|title=Good-bye Days|publisher=[[Oricon]]|access-date=July 30, 2011|language=ja}}</ref> Since Yui's debut album, ''[[From Me to You (Yui album)|From Me to You]]'', each of her soloist album releases has topped the charts, with at least one single reaching number one on the Oricon charts from 2007 until her second hiatus in 2012, including five straight from mid-2008 to late 2010.<ref name = "oricon bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/358664/products/release/|script-title=ja:ＹＵＩのリリース一覧|publisher=[[Oricon]]|language=ja}}</ref> After retiring from music as a soloist in 2012, she formed the band [[Flower Flower]] in 2013.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Yui was born in [[Fukuoka prefecture|Fukuoka, Japan]]. The ''[[Associated Press]]'' has reported that her full name is Yui Yoshioka.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=13606392#.TtiBuPIlSSr|title=Japanese Singer Yui Eyes Bigger Foreign Fan Base|agency=Associated Press|last=Lee|first=Min|date=May 15, 2011|access-date=December 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=13935743#.TtiDjPIlSSr|title=Japanese Singer Yui Stages First Foreign Show|agency=Associated Press|last=Lee|first=Min|date=June 27, 2011|access-date=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

She grew up in a single-parent family, her father leaving her mother when she was three. Growing up, Yui asserted that she had always been close to music, as she would remember the beats from music she heard on the radio, and would be able to sing it. During elementary school, Yui thought she would like to become a singer.<ref name="ld5">{{cite web|url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/1732876/?p=5|title=Interview with Yui (page 5)|publisher=Livedoor|language=ja}}</ref> Self-described as shy and horrible at talking to others as a child, she would play outside by herself in mountains, rivers, by the sea and in rice paddies.<ref name="first Oricon interview">[[Oricon|Oricon Style]], February 2, 2006 {{in lang|ja}}</ref>

During her third year in primary school, she was influenced by her mother to begin writing a journal of her feelings and tried to compose them into poems. By the time Yui attended high school, she began to write songs, thinking of that as being able to express herself little by little.<ref name="first Oricon interview"/><ref name="ld3">{{cite web|url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/1732876/?p=3|title=Interview with Yui (page 3)|publisher=Livedoor|language=ja}}</ref> While in high school, she worked part-time at a Chinese restaurant to help pay for tuition. Between music, school and work, however, she only had one or two hours of sleep, and believed she no longer had the time to realize her dreams of a music career.<ref name="ld1">''[[Rockin' on Japan]]'', May 2007 {{in lang|ja}}</ref> She subsequently became ill; however, it was at the hospital that she was overwhelmed with the desire to make music, and finally decided that school and music could not coexist.<ref name="ld1"/>

Soon after leaving the hospital, she got a chance to see her first live [[street performance]].<ref name="ld1"/> She expressed a desire to pursue a musical career to the band, Bianco Nero, at the end of the concert. The band advised Yui to join a private music school, ''[[juku]]''. Despite the social norm of finishing school in Japan and discouragement from her teachers, Yui did not hesitate to  drop out of high school and began to study guitar and songwriting at the music cram school "Voice" in her hometown of Fukuoka.<ref name="ld1"/><ref name="News Maker">News Maker, July 2007 {{in lang|ja}}</ref> Aspiring to become a professional, she took to street performing at Fukuoka's [[Tenjin Station]]. These street performances helped Yui to overcome her shyness.

===Initial career===
Yui's professional career began in March 2004 when, at the recommendation of her cram school instructors, she applied for an audition hosted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ent2.excite.co.jp/music/special/yui/int_02.html|title=Interview|publisher=Excite|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413192755/http://ent2.excite.co.jp/music/special/yui/int_02.html|archive-date=April 13, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although instructed that a participant could only perform two songs, she first sang "Why Me" (a song later included in her debut Sony Records [[Feel My Soul (song)|single]]), followed by "It's Happy Line," and then half of "[[From Me to You (Yui album)|I Know]]", performing the unfinished third song because she wanted the judges to hear a song full of hope.<ref name="ld1"/>

The judges gave her the maximum score. Although "I Know" was incomplete at the time, the judges were able to get a glimpse of what would later be dubbed {{nihongo|"Yui-go"|YUI[[Wikt:語|語]]}}, or Yui-speak, nonsensical English hummed to a tune during her songwriting process. An example of Yui-go can be found in the film ''[[Midnight Sun (2006 film)|Song of the Sun]].''

On December 24, 2004, Yui released her debut single, "It's Happy Line", under the indie label Leaflet Records, coupled with the track "I Know," although the pressing was limited to only 2,000 copies in her home area.

===''From Me to You'' (2005–2006)===
Upon leaving her hometown in Fukuoka for Tokyo, Yui wrote the song "[[Feel My Soul (song)|Feel My Soul]]" as a tribute to her hometown. Although she initially had planned its release on an indie label, Fuji Television producer Yamaguchi was so inspired by Yui's voice that he insisted on having her work on the music for his primetime drama ''[[Fukigen na Gene]],'' prior to releasing a major single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/hisashikondo/entry-10355548756.html|script-title=ja:映画「カイジ 人生逆転ゲーム」での再会|language=ja|access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> The music in ''Fukigen na Gene'' was eventually based on her songs "Feel My Soul" and "It's Happy Line."

On February 23, 2005, Yui released her first major debut single "Feel My Soul." With the publicity the drama tie-in drew in, "Feel My Soul" managed to sell over 100,000 copies and managed to chart at number 8 on [[Oricon]] Weekly Charts in its first week. Her next three singles, "[[Tomorrow's Way]]" (theme song for the movie ''[[Hinokio]]''), "[[Life (Yui song)|Life]]" (5th ending theme for the ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' anime), and "[[Tokyo (Yui song)|Tokyo]]" did not chart as high as "Feel My Soul", and were only moderately successful in comparison. Yui released her debut album on February 22, 2006, titled ''[[From Me to You (Yui album)|From Me to You]]'', a moderate success that debuted at number 4 on the [[Oricon]] charts, charting for 121 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/358664/products/638224/1/|title=FROM ME TO YOU {{!}} YUI|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja-JP}}</ref>

===''Can't Buy My Love'' (2006–2007)===
Yui made her acting debut in the full-length feature film ''[[Midnight Sun (2006 film)|Song of the Sun]]'' (Taiyou no uta, タイヨウのうた),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shochikufilms.com/film/detail.php?product_code=509|title=Midnight Sun|access-date=March 11, 2007|publisher=Shochiku|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205190614/http://www.shochikufilms.com/film/detail.php?product_code=509|archive-date=February 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> which opened on June 17, 2006.

Prior to the release of the movie, Yui released her fifth single "[[Good-bye Days]]," written specifically for the film. The single is her highest selling single, with more than 200,000 copies sold. All three tracks on the single are featured in ''Midnight Sun''. The single also re-released the track "It's Happy Line," originally released on her debut single.

Yui's next single, "[[I Remember You (Yui song)|I Remember You]]", did well in terms of sales, riding on the wave of the popularity of "Good-bye Days". Yui's seventh single "[[Rolling Star]]" was chosen as the 5th opening theme for the ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' anime. Her eighth single, "[[Cherry (Yui song)|Cherry]]" was featured in commercials promoting [[KDDI]], a Listen Mobile Service.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

She released her second album ''[[Can't Buy My Love]]'' on April 4, 2007. The album spent two weeks at number 1 on the Oricon charts, breaking her entire previous album's record sales in one week. ''Can't Buy My Love'' managed to sell over 680,000 copies. Due to the success of ''Can't Buy My Love'', Yui's previous album, ''[[From Me to You (Yui album)|From Me to You]]'' charted once again, adding another 9,000 copies to the Oricon counting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/ja/w/2007-04-16/p/3/|title=2007年04月02日～2007年04月08日 オリコン週間 CDアルバムランキング 21～30位|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja-JP}}</ref>

===''I Loved Yesterday'' (2007–2008)===
Yui released her 9th single "[[My Generation/Understand]]" on June 13, 2007. It was her first double A-side single. "My Generation" was selected as the ending theme for the TV drama ''Seito Shokun!'', and "Understand" was chosen as the theme song for the movie ''Dog in a Sidecar'' (サイドカーに犬),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/Yui-net/discography/index.html|title=Yui-net Discography|access-date=May 21, 2007|publisher=Yui-net}}</ref> (starring her [[senpai]] at Stardust Promotion, [[Yūko Takeuchi]]). The single charted at number 1 on the [[Oricon]] Weekly Charts the first week of its release.

Her tenth single, "[[Love & Truth]]" was released on September 26, 2007. The title track is the theme song to the film ''Closed Note'' (クローズド・ノート) (starring [[Erika Sawajiri]], also of Stardust). During this time, her previous two albums were re-released as Winter Sleeve Editions in alternative covers taken from her "Love & Truth" photoshoot. Her first live concert DVD ''[[Thank You My Teens]]'' was released on November 14, 2007, which contained footage of her second live concert tour.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Thank you My teens|date=November 13, 2007|type=DVD|language=ja|publisher=Sony Music Distribution|location=Japan}}</ref>

On November 19, 2007, Yui opened her first live show at [[Nippon Budokan]], which promptly sold out.<ref name="b-passbukodan">B-PASS, February, 2008 {{in lang|ja}}</ref> The Budokan concert was structured similar to a live performance, which a writer from B-Pass called it fitting considering her beginnings as a street performer on the streets of Fukuoka.<ref name="b-passbukodan" />

Yui began 2008 with her eleventh single, "[[Namidairo]]", released on February 27, 2008.<ref>[http://world-of-yui.blogspot.com/2007/12/new-yui-single.html World of Yui | Yui News, Community, Fansite, Gallery: New Yui Single!]</ref> Yui composed the song as a "mysterious and sad sounding" insert for the television drama ''4 Shimai Tantei Dan''. While writing the song, she attempted to convey a feeling of saying "I'm fine" in order to not worry one's lover, and how during such occasions, we realize little things we don't normally notice.<ref name="lt">Lawson Ticket, April 2008 {{in lang|ja}}</ref> The chorus of the song was incidentally written by Yui during her singing debut.

A week following the release of her 11th single, the promotional video of a new song "Laugh Away", was released. The song was used in [[Glico]]'s "Watering KissMint" commercial. "Laugh Away" was released as a digital single on March 10, 2008.

Her third studio album was released on April 9, 2008 titled ''[[I Loved Yesterday]]''. It quickly charted at number 1 on the Oricon Weekly Charts and sold more than 400,000 copies, behind her second album. The 10th track on the album, titled "Oh Yeah", was used as the opening theme to ''[[Mezamashi TV]]'', a morning television show. The limited edition version of the album included a DVD which contained music videos of her previous singles and live footage of her [[Nippon Budokan]] show. The album was composed mainly of semi-ballads with much of the same themes as her previous releases such as youth.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-loved-yesterday-r1389578/review| title=I Loved Yesterday-Yui|access-date=October 23, 2011| publisher=allmusic}}</ref>

On November 2, 2011, Yui released her fifth and final album as a soloist, ''[[How Crazy Your Love]]''.

Yui's upcoming single was announced through her participation in Ncon (Nコン), a national school music competition where schools compete to provide their best rendition of songs composed by select artists for a specific theme for that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/ncon/music_program/artist24.html|title=Nコン 2012|language=ja|publisher=NHK|access-date=June 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212064523/http://www.nhk.or.jp/ncon/music_program/artist24.html|archive-date=December 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Yui was selected to compose for the middle school category.

In a video uploaded to Yui's official [[Vevo]] channel on December 18, 2012, she announced that she would be taking a break from music. She explained that "...Yui is so precious and special for me, so I want to leave it as is for a while." To her fans, she said, "Actually, part of the reason I'm going into hiatus again is for the sake of my fans. The biggest reason is that I don't want them to see me with a broken-off heart, if that happens."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXOFkn-dt4 Yui on YouTube]; accessed July 22, 2015.</ref>

===Flower Flower (2013–present)===
Yui returned from hiatus shortly thereafter with a new band called [[Flower Flower]], which performed incognito throughout Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanspo.com/smp/geino/news/20130110/oth13011005180011-s.html|script-title=ja:ＹＵＩサプライズ熱唱！ライブハウス飛び入り|language=ja|publisher=Sanspo|access-date=April 7, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411055734/http://www.sanspo.com/smp/geino/news/20130110/oth13011005180011-s.html|archive-date=April 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band has since released four digital and Japan-only singles; "Tsuki (月)," "Kamisama (神様)," "Natsu/Aki (夏/秋)" and "Subarashii Sekai (素晴らしい世界)". On March 27, 2014, Yui revealed in her band blog that she had been diagnosed with a [[panic disorder]], which resulted in the cancellation of some presentations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/jpop-yui-diagnosed-panic-disorder|title=YUI DIAGNOSED WITH PANIC DISORDER|publisher=AFA Channel|access-date=April 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317234519/http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/jpop-yui-diagnosed-panic-disorder/|archive-date=March 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2014/03/yui-talks-about-her-panic-disorder-on-her-blog|title=Yui talks about her panic disorder on her blog|publisher=Tokyo Have|access-date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> The band, however, would release its first studio album [[Mi (Flower Flower album)|''Mi (実)'']] on November 26, 2014.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/635727/products/1105072/1/|title=実(初回生産限定盤) {{!}} FLOWER FLOWER|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja-JP}}</ref> The album would go on to debut at number 5 on the weekly Oricon, charting for 11 weeks.<ref name=":0" />

On April 17, 2015, the singer announced via the official blog of her band Flower Flower that she had married a man outside of the industry and that she was pregnant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com|title=Singer Yui Announces Marriage, Pregnancy|publisher=Anime News Network|access-date=April 17, 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, it was announced that Yui had given birth to healthy twin boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aramajapan.com/news/yui-has-given-birth/21052/|title=Yui Has Given Birth|publisher=ARAMA!

Flower Flower released the band's first physical single, "Takaramono (宝物)," on September 9, 2016, which debuted at number ten and charted for five weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/635727/products/1190448/1/|title=宝物(初回生産限定盤) {{!}} FLOWER FLOWER|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja-JP}}</ref> While talking about the release of the single, almost a year and a half after her previous project, Yui would state: "I did not think I could release songs again, and to be honest I am quite happy that I can."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2076101/full/|title=yui、9・7双子出産後初作品　FLOWERFLOWERが1年半ぶりリリース|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja-JP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/196726|title=FLOWER FLOWER、9月に初のシングル「宝物」リリース - 音楽ナタリー|last=Inc.|first=Natasha|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja}}</ref>

In the summer of 2017, Flower Flower appeared in various festivals, including at [[Rock in Japan Festival|Rock in Japan Festival 2017]] and [[Summer Sonic Festival|Summer Sonic 2017]], leading to speculation that the band would release a second physical single.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/239070|title=FLOWER FLOWERが2ndシングル発売、初回盤にはライブ音源も - 音楽ナタリー|last=Inc.|first=Natasha|access-date=2017-09-09|language=ja}}</ref> In a series of concerts in Osaka and Tokyo, the group announced that they would release "Mannequin (マネキン)" on August 2, 2017.<ref name=":1" /> In an interview released on the band's website, Yui would state that despite the song's initial composition as a "summer" [[pop rock]] song, reflected in the pop-like promotion material, during pre-production and recording the song eventually gravitated towards [[hard rock]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowerflower-net.jp/info/archive/?484631|title=FLOWER FLOWER {{!}} INFORMATION|website=www.flowerflower-net.jp|language=ja|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref> When comparing the single with its B-side, "Drama (ドラマ)," Yui believed that placing a strong, western-like arranged single in "Mannequin" in juxtaposition with the more graceful song "Drama" would provide a nice balance.<ref name=":2" />

On November 11, 2017, Yui confirmed reports from the media that the singer had divorced her husband at the end of August 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lineblog.me/flower_flower/archives/13160314.html|title=皆さんにご報告があります。 : FLOWER FLOWER 公式ブログ|work=FLOWER FLOWER 公式ブログ|access-date=2018-03-19|language=ja-JP}}</ref> She has custody of the twin boys they had together.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpopasia.com/feed/22263/yui-divorces-husband-of-2-years-gains-custody-of-children/|title=yui Divorces Husband Of 2 Years + Gains Custody Of Children|publisher=JpopAsia|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref>
