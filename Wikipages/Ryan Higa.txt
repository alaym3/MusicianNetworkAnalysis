== YouTube career ==
Higa and Sean Fujiyoshi began posting YouTube videos of themselves [[lip sync]]ing to songs in mid-2006 while attending [[Waiakea High School]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jul/27/il/hawaii807270330.html |title=Hilo teens become a Web video sensation. |date=July 27, 2008 |access-date=August 21, 2009 |publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser}}</ref> They quickly expanded beyond songs, with a variety of other comedic pieces.

On Christmas Eve of 2008, Higa and Fujiyoshi's two most popular videos, ''How To Be Gangster'' and ''How To Be Emo'', were removed due to copyright violations.<ref name="copyrighted">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCTAqdDfL58&feature=player_embedded | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/FCTAqdDfL58| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Copyrighted |last=Higa |first=Ryan |date=February 23, 2009 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=December 11, 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref> On January 21, 2009, the nigahiga account was temporarily suspended and was required to remove more copyrighted videos.

Since then, Higa started composing the music himself. ''How to be Gangster'' and ''How to be Emo'' were put back on nigahiga's channel in late August 2009, only to be removed a few days later, along with ''How to be Ninja'' and ''How to be Nerd''.

''Ninja Melk'', a 26-minute short film about ninjas, was released in August 2009. The plot revolves around a ninja master named Master Ching Ching sending his student Lapchung (played by Bryson Murata) to find a replacement, finding Higa and Fujiyoshi to catch the evil Bokchoy (Tim Enos) and his henchwoman, Gina (Tarynn Nago).<ref name="ninjamelk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIz3cb_igD4| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/uIz3cb_igD4| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Ninja Melk|last1=Higa|first1=Ryan|last2=Fujiyoshi, Sean|date=August 24, 2009|website=Video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 29, 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

An independent 35-minute film he created with [[Wong Fu Productions]] called ''[[Agents of Secret Stuff]]'' was uploaded on the nigahiga channel on November 24, 2010. It features some other popular YouTube users as well as actors such as [[Aki Aleong]]. The film follows a teenage A.S.S. ('''A'''gent of '''S'''ecret '''S'''tuff) (Higa) who goes undercover as a high school student to protect Taylor ([[Arden Cho]]) from the S.I.N.S. ('''S'''ociety '''I'''nvolving '''N'''ot-So-Good '''S'''tuff). It included guest appearances from Ian and Anthony of [[Smosh]], [[Dominic Sandoval|D-Trix]], [[KassemG]] and Hiimrawn.

When Higa moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to attend college, most of the nigahiga videos were solo efforts, usually featuring collaborations with other YouTube users. Since 2012, Higa has put together a production company, Ryan Higa Production Company (RHPC), which included Sean Fujiyoshi, that works together to make content for the nigahiga channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/artisans/production/youtube-star-ryan-higa-1203183732/|title=YouTube Star Ryan Higa Shows the Way to Maintain Independence With DIY Studio|last=Katz|first=S.D.|date=April 10, 2019|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref> In 2015, Higa's production company was based in a studio in [[Henderson, Nevada]].<ref name=":0" />

In 2016, Higa and other YouTubers and friends created the parody [[K-pop]] group [[Boys Generally Asian]]. In mid-2018, Fujiyoshi left the group as he was moving out of the area, specifically to [[Sacramento, California]] to live with his current girlfriend and to pursue his degree in [[Engineering education|engineering]].<ref>{{Citation |last=nigahiga |title=Goodbye Sean... |date=September 1, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkMFBDyzE8 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/jgkMFBDyzE8| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|access-date=June 7, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 2016, Ryan Higa created a [[K-pop]] band with [[David Choi]], [[Philip Wang]], [[Jun Sung Ahn]] and [[Justin Chon]]. It was called BgA, standing for Boys Generally Asian, deliberately inspired by the all-female band [[Girls Generation]].
