'''Daniel Garcia Felicione Napoleão''' (born January 18, 1995), known professionally as '''Gloria Groove''', is a Brazilian singer, rapper, songwriter, actor, voice actor, and [[drag queen]]. Napoleão's singing career began when he was 7 years old, as a member of children's musical group [[Turma do Balão Mágico]]. During his childhood, Groove starred in the [[RecordTV]] [[telenovela]] ''Savage'', and began work as a voice actor. After a period working in theatre as a teenager, Napoleão adopted the drag persona "Gloria Groove" in 2014. Two years later, he started gaining prominence by appearing in the [[Rede Globo]] reality show ''[[Amor e Sexo|Amor & Sexo]]''.

Gloria Groove's singing career launched with the release of the single "Dona" in January 2016. After its success, Groove released "Império", and was featured in Carnival hit "Catuaba" by Aretuza Lovi. Groove's first album, ''O Proceder'', was released in February 2017 and was followed by the singles "Gloriosa" and "Muleke Brasileiro". At the end of 2017, Groove released one of the most successful singles of her career, "Bumbum de Ouro". It was followed by peer recognition, which led the singer to feature in several singles such as "Joga Bunda", along with Lovi and [[Pabllo Vittar]], "Arrasta" with Léo Santana, a remix version of [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]]'s "[[Show das Poderosas]]", and [[Lexa (singer)|Lexa]]'s "Provocar".

==Artistry and public image==
Daniel defines the "Gloria Groove" persona as "half drag, half rapper", and Groove's compositions vary from soul, trap, R&B, and Brazilian funk.<ref name=est/> The singer is also known for performing and singing both as "male rapper" and a "female queer";<ref name=est/> for example, the singer does this in the music videos for "Dona", "Império",<ref name=opovo_0218/> "Bumbum de Ouro",<ref name=epoca/> and "Apaga a Luz".<ref name=est/> As a "queer, effeminate, a non-white drag queen.", Groove's career as a singer is a way to "use my own voice to point out what's wrong [in Brazil]".<ref name=billboard/> Since the first song, "Dona", Groove showed this feature with sarcastic lines such as "Oh My Lord / What animal is that? / Nice to meet you, my name is art, darling".<ref name=est/> The singer aims to represent the LGBT community: "My music hopes to signify the existence of thousands of LGBTIQ people—our music becomes a platform of love and self-acceptance."<ref name=est/>

Groove was influenced by hip hop since during the childhood; the singer appreciated male rappers, such as [[Usher (musician)|Usher]],<ref name=g1_2018/> but the main inspiration to sing comes from female rappers, including [[Lil' Kim]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Karol Conká]], and {{ill|Flora Matos|pt}}.<ref name=diariodepe/> At first, Groove did not intend to be labeled as a "drag rapper", but later thought it could be something that differentiates the singer's work.<ref name=diariodepe/> While ''O Proceder'' was considered to be mostly a rap work, it already included songs that mix rap and pop as "Muleke Brasileiro",<ref name=g1_2018/><ref name=opovo_0318/> also said to be a "[[Reggaeton]]-like song".<ref name=est/> The following song, "Bumbum de Ouro", was deemed entirely pop with a funk inspiration.<ref name=g1_2018/><ref name=diariodepe/> The singer did it consciously, hoping to achieve a wider public<ref name=diariodepe/> and it was meant to be the kickoff for the release of a pop-focused album.<ref name=g1_2018/>

Groove has been described as LGBT "idol" by Brazilian media.<ref name=vogue>{{cite web | url=https://vogue.globo.com/Video/Lifestyle/Mister-V/noticia/2018/04/gloria-groove-fala-sobre-papel-como-idolo-da-cena-lgbtq.html | title=Gloria Groove fala sobre papel como ídolo da cena LGBTQ | trans-title=Gloria Groove talks about role as an idol in the LGBTQ scene | date=April 26, 2018 | work=Vogue Brasil | accessdate=January 23, 2019 | language=Portuguese}}</ref> The singer was featured in "Rain Power", a photo essay published in the August 2017 issue of the Brazilian edition of [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]].<ref name=vogue/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://emais.estadao.com.br/noticias/moda-e-beleza,pabllo-vittar-liniker-e-artistas-lgbt-se-unem-em-ensaio-na-vogue-brasil,70001908539 | title=Pabllo Vittar, Liniker e artistas LGBT se unem em ensaio na Vogue Brasil | date=July 27, 2017 | work=O Estado de S.Paulo | accessdate=January 23, 2019 | language=Portuguese}}</ref> Despite this label, Groove's song have also been popular among the non-LGBT public.<ref name=uai/><ref name=est/>
