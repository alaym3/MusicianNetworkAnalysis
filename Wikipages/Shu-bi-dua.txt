'''Shu•bi•dua''' or '''Shu-bi-dua''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] pop group that was formed in 1973 in [[Copenhagen]], as an expansion of the group ''Passport''. Throughout their 40-year history, Shu-bi-dua changed their lineup many times, however their lead singer {{ill|Michael Bundesen|da|Michael Bundesen}} was with the band throughout, except for the gap between 1984 and 1987. They have produced many well-known hits in Denmark, like ''Vuffeli-vov'', ''Hvalen Hvalborg'', ''Står på en Alpetop'', ''Stærk Tobak'' (to the music from the [[Phil Medley]] and [[Bert Russell]] song ''[[Twist and Shout]]''), ''Familien kom til Kaffe'', ''Sexchikane'', ''We wanna be free'', and many more. 

Their musical style owed much to folk and Central European [[schlager]]. They are the Danish band with most selling albums in Denmark. The bulk of the lyrics dealt with word play and humor. In a Youtube video about the history of the band Bundesen and Hardinger were asked at the end to name a song that represents the band best. Bundesen named Den røde tråd, a comical but still autobiographical song about his development from working class poverty to find "your place in the sun." Even in the 2000s, the band was able to get the audience to sing along with the first verse.

==History==
''Passport'', which in the beginning of 1973 released the single ''Tomorrow/Everything's Wrong'', consisted of the guitarists {{ill|Michael Hardinger|da|Michael Hardinger}} and {{ill|Poul Meyendorff|da|Poul Meyendorff}}, the drummer {{ill|Bosse Hall Christensen|da|Bosse Hall Christensen}}, and bass guitarist {{ill|Niels Grønbech|da|Niels Grønbech (musiker)}}. The group was extended with the singer Michael Bundesen and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard player]] {{ill|Jens Tage Nielsen|da|Jens Tage Nielsen}}, and under the name ''Shu-bi-dua'' released the single ''Fed Rock/Tynd Blues'', before the group again as ''Passport'' released the single ''Change of the Guard/Highway of Living''. Shu-bi-dua was originally thought of as a one-off group, but when the debut single produced the hit ''Fed Rock'', they chose to keep it.

As ''Shu-bi-dua'' they quickly gained success, and the name ''Passport'' was dropped. In 1974 they released their first self-titled album ''[[Shu-bi-dua (album)|Shu-bi-dua]]''. After the first album, Poul Meyendorf left the group and was replaced by [[Claus Asmussen]], who was a sound engineer on the first.

Since then the group has had numerous changes in its lineup. Claus Asmussen replaced Poul Meyendorff in 1975, {{ill|Kim Daugaard (musician)|lt=Kim Daugaard|da|Kim Daugaard (musiker)}} replaced Niels Grønbech in 1977, {{ill|Willy Pedersen (musician)|lt=Willy Pedersen|da|Willy Pedersen}} replaced Jens Tage Nielsen, and {{ill|Kasper Winding|da|Kasper Winding}} replaced Bosse Hall Christensen in 1981. In 1984 Michael Bundesen left the group to become station chief on the Copenhagen TV station [[Kanal 2 (Danish TV station)|Kanal 2]], and simultaneously Kasper Winding left to be replaced by Paul Callaby. In 1987 {{ill|Jørgen Thorup (musician)|lt=Jørgen Thorup|da|Jørgen Thorup}} was made a permanent member in the group when Willy Pedersen left. Thorup had been singing backup vocals since ''Shu-bi-dua 11'' in 1985. In 1987 Michael Bundesen returned as lead singer, while {{ill|Søren Jacobsen|da|Søren Jacobsen (musiker)}} also joined the band. In 1988 {{ill|Peter Andersen (drummer)|lt=Peter Andersen|da|Peter Andersen (trommeslager)}} replaced Paul Callaby as drummer, and shortly thereafter Søren Jacobsen left the band again. After having made the film ''[[Den røde tråd]]'' in 1989, they went on a sabbatical until their return in 1992 with the hit single ''Sexchikane''. In the intervening years their back catalog was rereleased on CD in 1990, and in 1991 a Best Of album by the name ''Stærk Tobak'' was released. In connection to this they played live in front of 50,000 people on [[Bellevue Beach]]. In 1997 Michael Hardinger left the band after 24 years. He was replaced by {{ill|Ole Kibsgaard|da|Ole Kibsgaard}}, and in 2001 Jørgen Thorup left the band to be replaced by {{ill|Jacob Christoffersen|da|Jacob Christoffersen}}. In 2003 their 30th anniversary was celebrated with a 10-CD set called ''Shu-bi-dua 200'' (each CD had 20 songs). In 2005 Claus Asmussen left Shu-bi-dua having been the only original continuous member in the group's 30-year history. The group has, since 2011, been on an indefinite hiatus, since lead singer Michael Bundesen suffered a brain embolism. Michael Bundesen was born: May 12, 1949 and died on November 8, 2020.
