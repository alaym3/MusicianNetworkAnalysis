'''Emil Bulls''' is a German [[rock music|rock]] band that was formed in 1995 in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. The group consists of two guitarists, a bass guitar player, a drummer and a vocalist/guitarist.

== History ==
In 1995, Christoph "Christ" von Freydorf (vocals) and Stefan "Fini" Finauer (drums), pupils of a convent school, founded the band together with Christoph's church choir friend Jamie "Citnoh" Richardson (bass guitar). They were joined by Stephan Karl "Moik" and Franz Wickenhäuser (both guitar). The band was founded in Hohenschäftlarn near Munich. The name Emil Bulls is derived from a children's movie.

In 1996, they recorded their first CD ''Red Dick's Potatoe Garden'' themselves. In 1997, they attended the [[Emergenza]] festival, won the regional finals in Munich<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emergenza.net/DE/de-de/news/1659/9342/die-emil-bulls-touren-italien.aspx|title=DIE EMIL BULLS TOUREN ITALIEN!|date=1 February 2003|website=www.emergenza.net|language=German|trans-title=The Emil Bulls are touring Italy!|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 October 2019|quote=gewannen prompt das regionale Finale in München}}</ref> and finished third in the European competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.k-m.de/brand/en/emil-bulls-about-their-experiences-in-the-virtual-world-2/|title=Emil Bulls about their experiences in the virtual world|last=Scholtz|first=Sandra|date=19 March 2012|website=König & Meyer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010074551/https://www.k-m.de/brand/en/emil-bulls-about-their-experiences-in-the-virtual-world-2/|archive-date=10 October 2019|access-date=10 October 2019|quote=[…] after they were placed third at the Emergenza Contest, they have become a constant part of the music business.}}</ref> For this competition they hired DJ Paul Rzyttka (known as DJ Zamzoe) who afterwards became a permanent member of the band.

After a long tour, their album ''Monogamy'' was released by the indie record label Oh My Sweet Records. The record could only be purchased through the internet or during live shows. ''Monogamy'' was noticed by [[Island Records]], which offered the band a recording deal. Some of the songs on ''Monogamy'' and a few new songs were recorded. The result was ''[[Angel Delivery Service]]'', released in 2001. The album was already out of stock a few months later. A new edition was released including a cover version of [[A-Ha]]'s "Take on Me". The songs "Smells Like Rock 'n' Roll", "Leaving You with This" and "Take on Me" were released as singles.
