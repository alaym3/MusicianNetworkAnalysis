He admits that his [[androgynous]] vocals and appearance have led many to mistake him for a woman at first listen.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Silverstein|first1=Noah|title=Exclusive!

Before the release of his first album ''[[Dopamine (Børns album)|Dopamine]]'', Børns moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he still resides as of January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog/about_a_band_borns|title=About A Band: BORNS|website=Urban Outfitters}}</ref> Børns is vegetarian like other members of his family.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garrett Borns: West Michigan prodigy banking on belief that less is more (videos)|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/muskegon/index.ssf/2012/01/garrett_borns_grand_haven_prod.html|website=mlive.com}}</ref>

In September 2018, Børns was accused of sexual misconduct by several young women, leading to a Washington D.C. music festival named [[All Things Go Fall Classic]] dropping him from its lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/dc-music-festival-cancels-borns-performance/|website=Pitchfork.com|title=DC Music Festival Cancels Borns Performance|date=September 28, 2018}}</ref> The allegations against Børns included manipulation, grooming, and sexual aggression toward underaged fans, with the youngest accuser detailing her account of the abuse which began when she was 16 years old. Børns released a statement calling the allegations "disturbing and false", also saying that "All of the relationships I have had were legal and consensual. They ended abruptly and that obviously caused hurt feelings, but for anyone to suggest anything beyond that is irresponsible."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/26/pop-singer-borns-sexual-misconduct|website=[[The Guardian]]|title=Pop Singer Borns Accused of Sexual Misconduct|date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>
