'''The Vines''' are an Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sydney]] in 1994. Their sound has been described as a musical hybrid of 1960s [[garage rock]] and 1990s [[alternative rock]]. The band has been through several line-up changes, with vocalist/guitarist [[Craig Nicholls]] serving as the sole constant throughout the band's history.

The Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002|ARIA Award in 2002]], 'Breakthrough Artist – Single', for "[[Get Free (The Vines song)|Get Free]]" and receiving five other nominations for their debut album ''[[Highly Evolved]]'', plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in Australia,<ref name="ARIA2003Cred">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2003.htm |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 2003 Albums |date=20 January 2004 |work=ARIA Charts |access-date=6 March 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207130327/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2003.htm |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref> and since then the band has released four albums and a [[greatest hits album|best-of compilation]] from their time at [[Capitol Records]]. The Vines have released seven studio albums to date.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1994–2000) ===
The original line-up of Rishikesh formed in Sydney in 1994 when vocalist and lead guitarist Craig Nicholls and bass guitarist [[Patrick Matthews]] met whilst working at their local [[McDonald's]] in the suburb of [[South Hurstville, New South Wales|South Hurstville]], [[New South Wales]]. They were soon joined by Matthews' school friend [[David Olliffe]] on drums.<ref name="Rage 2002">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2002/vines.htm |title=The Vines – Guest Program |date=5 October 2002 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|abc.net.au]] |access-date=6 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523025245/http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2002/vines.htm |archive-date=23 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The name "Rishikesh", suggested by Olliffe, refers to [[Rishikesh|the Indian city]] where [[the Beatles]] visited an [[Rishikesh#Yoga Center|ashram]] in 1968.<ref name="Rage 2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rage/archive/s3277380.htm |title=The Vines – Guests and Specials – Rage – ABC Television |date=30 July 2011 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|abc.net.au]] |access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref> The local newspapers regularly misprinted the name as "Rishi Chasms", so Nicholls suggested a new name, "the Vines", as an homage to his father, who fronted a local band called the Vynes. The group started performing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[You Am I]] covers at backyard parties while developing their sound on Nicholls' four-track recorder.<ref name="Rage 2011"/>

Over the next few years, the Vines gigged infrequently and remained relatively unknown, even in their hometown, yet by the beginning of 2001 they had amassed a repertoire of over thirty songs.<ref name="Rage 2002"/> On the strength of their demo, [[Rex Records (2001)|Rex Records]] put out what was to be their first single, "[[Factory (The Vines)|Factory]]", as a limited seven-inch single. The release became ''[[NME]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Single of the Week in November 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2001.htm#Singles/ |title=''NME'' 2001 lists |website=Rocklist.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327025904/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2001.htm#Singles/ |archive-date=27 March 2008 |access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref>

===''Highly Evolved'', fame and critical acclaim (2001–2003)===
{{Main|Highly Evolved}}
In July 2001, the band flew to [[Los Angeles]] to start recording their debut album, ''[[Highly Evolved]]'', with [[Rob Schnapf]]. David Olliffe was replaced a few months later as a result of increasing record company interest, and the band had sessions with drummers such as [[Joey Waronker]].

Their debut single, "Factory" was released in November 2001 in the UK and gained a good response in the press, with the ''NME'' describing their garage rock sound as "of the oldest school".<ref name="nme-factory">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/the-vines/5781|title=The Vines : Factory|work=NME|date=30 October 2001|access-date=2 October 2011|author=Robinson, John}}</ref> The band then signed to [[Heavenly Records]] in the UK in December 2001 and [[EMI]] in Australia in April 2002. The single "Highly Evolved" earned them more critical acclaim as ''NME'' made it a single of the week in March 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2002.htm#Singles| title=2002 NME Single of the Week Chart|work=NME|access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325023716/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2002.htm#Singles |archive-date=25 March 2008 }}</ref> The single charted in the UK at number 32 on the singles chart and on Australia's [[ARIA Charts|ARIAnet]] top 100 singles chart.

The band appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in October 2002 (the first Australian band to do so since [[Men at Work]] in 1983) with the words "Rock is Back: Meet the Vines" boldly emblazoned underneath.<ref name="rs-cover">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/the_vines_craig_nicholls |title=The Vines |work=Craig Nicholls has all the makings of a rock star |date=6 August 2002 |access-date=13 April 2008 |author=Sheffield, Rob |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050708/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/the_vines_craig_nicholls |archive-date=29 October 2007 }}</ref> Referred to as the 'The' bands, [[the Strokes]], [[the Hives]], [[the White Stripes]], and the Vines combined "old fashioned punk and adrenaline fuelled riffs" to be ushered in at the beginning of 2002 as the "saviors of rock".<ref name="retro-rock">{{cite web|url=http://media.www.keeneequinox.com/media/storage/paper537/news/2003/02/13/AE/Retro.Rock.Rules.Airwaves-367545.shtml |title=Retro rock rules airwaves |work=Bands like The Hives and The Strokes are proclaimed rock saviors |date=13 February 2003 |access-date=13 April 2008 |author=Schlauch, Jeff |publisher=The Equinox |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103013141/http://media.www.keeneequinox.com/media/storage/paper537/news/2003/02/13/AE/Retro.Rock.Rules.Airwaves-367545.shtml |archive-date=3 January 2009 }}</ref>

The release of the album saw more critical success, with the band appearing on the cover of ''NME''. The album reached number 11 in the U.S. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Hot 100 albums chart.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the vines|chart=all}} |title=The Vines Song Chart History |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |access-date=6 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic awards">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-vines-mn0000582463/awards|title=The Vines Awards|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=6 March 2013}}</ref> The band played high-profile slots on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/04/1086203619093.html|title=Vines in a tangle|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=2 October 2011 | date=5 June 2004}}</ref> and the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. Several more singles were released from the album, including "Get Free" and "Outtathaway!". A fourth single, "Homesick", was released in Australia only.

Craig Nicholls realised while touring for the promotion of their debut album, ''Highly Evolved'' (July 2002), that they needed an additional guitarist. So Nicholls asked his longtime friend and schoolmate Ryan Griffiths to join.

In May 2003, the band went into a studio in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]] with Rob Schnapf again on production. While Craig Nicholls had talked of having a highly produced album, he told the Australian edition of ''Rolling Stone'' in March 2004 that they decided to stick to a less-is-more philosophy. "I wanted it to be – in my head – something grand, with big ideas and that vision sort of thing. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that something can't be special if it's just simple. Because I think that the songs are the main thing".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Winning Days|journal=Rolling Stone (Australian Edition)|date=March 2004 }}</ref>

{{Main|Winning Days}}

Their second album, ''[[Winning Days]]'', was released on 29 March 2004 and rose to number 23 in the US.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="Allmusic awards"/> "Ride" and "Winning Days" were released as singles in Australia (where they did not chart) and the UK.

===''Vision Valley'' and return to the stage (2006–2007)===
{{Main|Vision Valley}}
In mid-2005, the group announced they were working on their third album, with producer [[Wayne Connolly]]. [[Andy Kent]] of fellow Australian band You Am I filled in on bass playing duties. In November of that year, the band's management announced they had finished recording all the songs that would appear on the album.

"[[Don't Listen to the Radio]]" was released as the album's first single, and was made available for digital download on 7 March on [[iTunes]]. The song was used on the soundtrack for the video game ''[[FlatOut 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2006/5/31/news/33626/ |title='FlatOut 2' (PS2/Xbox/PC) Rockin' Soundtrack Revealed|work=worthplaying.com |date=31 May 2006 |access-date=24 June 2015}}</ref> "Gross Out" was made available for digital download on 18 March, and was the first song leaked from the album. ''[[Vision Valley]]'' was released on 1 April 2006 in Australia, 3 April in Europe, and 4 April in the United States.

''Vision Valley'' consisted of short, immediate songs; the album running little over 30 minutes in length. "[[Anysound]]" was the second official single from the album, and an animated music video was released exclusively through [[YouTube]]. The song was included as a track heard on the in-game radio in the 2007 [[LucasArts]] published [[Thrillville: Off The Rails]]. "Dope Train" was released as a third single, with a music video composed of live footage of the band from Big Day Out in 2007.

On 19 July 2006, the Vines played a gig at the Annandale Hotel under the name "Joe Dirt", with a new bassist, [[Brad Heald]], after  Patrick Matthews departed the group.

===''Melodia'' (2008)===
{{Main|Melodia (album)}}
In 2007, the Vines signed to [[Ivy League Records]] for an Australian album deal. The first single preceding the album ''[[Melodia (album)|Melodia]]'' was "He's a Rocker", which was released through iTunes on 3 June 2008 along with two bonus tracks. "MerryGoRound" was released as a follow-up single for radio airplay in Australia during August 2008. "MerryGoRound" only received support and backing from [[Triple J]] radio. "Get Out" was released as the third single from ''Melodia'' in September 2008 for radio airplay, and a music video was released to coincide with the release of "Get Out" as a single by Ivy League Records on [[YouTube]]. "Get Out" was featured on the in-game soundtrack of ''[[Midnight Club: Los Angeles]]'' released in late October 2008 on [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] gaming platforms.

In October 2008, the Vines commenced a national Australian tour in support of ''Melodia'', playing small venues throughout Australia. In November 2008, the Vines were announced as being part of the line-up for the 2009 Australian Big Day Out, but the band cancelled.

===''Future Primitive'' and departure of Griffiths and Rosser (2009–2012)===
{{Main|Future Primitive (The Vines album)}}
On 14 November 2009, the Vines played at the Annandale Hotel, under the alias of the Crimes. They had a support slot with You Am I, playing their back catalogue and a new song from an album due in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/21381/The-Vines-stage-a-comeback.htm |title=The Vines stage a comeback |date=16 November 2009 |work=fasterlouder.net.au |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404055132/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/21381/The-Vines-stage-a-comeback.htm |archive-date=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Vines recorded in early 2010. They also played gigs that year, including a set at the Annandale Hotel on 23 June where they debuted new songs "Future Primitive", "Gimme Love", and "Black Dragon". They also played Splendour in the Grass on 1 August and Singfest, a Singapore music festival on 5 August. At the start of September, they supported [[Powderfinger]] at the first four shows of their farewell tour.

A music video for "Gimme Love" wrapped filming on 1 March 2011, with the completed video surfacing online through YouTube on 27 March. The music video pays homage to the 2010 film ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''.{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right |quote=It's cool that we're still together and that we got through it all, all the hard times and all the ups and downs.

Over a year after its completion, ''Future Primitive'' received an official release date through ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' on 3 June 2011. Because the Vines did not have a label at the time of recording, the band members funded the album's recording themselves. Upon the album's completion, the band approached various record labels to see if any were interested in signing the band for its release, explaining the year-long delay between recording and release.

In May 2011, the Vines played on-stage with [[the Dandy Warhols]] at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney for the song "It's a Fast-Driving Rave-Up with The Dandy Warhols".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18JBXO22-8 |title=The Dandy Warhols + The Vines – It's a Fast Driving Rave-Up |date=30 May 2011 |work=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> The two bands had previously had dinner at the Warhols' studio The Odditorium in 2004, along with the bands [[Jet (band)|Jet]] and [[the Strokes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dandywarhols.com/news/dig-sf/ |title=DIG!

In an interview with [[Music Feeds]] at [[Splendour in the Grass]] 2011, Nicholls talked about a late 2011 or early 2012 release date for their still unnamed sixth album.<ref name="musicfeeds">{{cite web |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/the-vines-new-album-late-this-year-or-early-next-year-release/ |title=The Vines New Album – Late This Year or Early Next Year Release? |author=Brayden Darke |date=3 August 2011 |work=musicfeeds.com.au |access-date=2 October 2011}}</ref>
On 26 November 2011, rumours on the band's [[Facebook]] page suggested that the band had "pushed out" two of its members. At the 2011 [[Homebake]] music festival, the Vines emerged on the main-stage as a three piece, consisting of Nicholls, Heald and drummer Murray Sheridan. The departure of both Griffiths and Rosser was confirmed by [[Channel V Australia|Channel V]] presenter [[Jane Gazzo]], who wrote that the two had been "sacked" in a [[Twitter]] post.

Craig's sister, Jess Nicholls, also confirmed their departure via the band's official forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thevines.forumotion.com/t86p15-new-members |title=New members? – Page 2 |publisher=Thevines.forumotion.com |access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> "If any of you were at Homebake yesterday, I'm sure you can agree the set was amazing and sounded better than ever," she wrote. "The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started. I know you will probably have a lot of questions but just wanted to say don't fear, this is in no way the end of the Vines!!" Nicholls, Heald and Sheridan performed again at Southbound music festival in Perth on 8 January 2012.

On 16 March 2012, Rosser announced that he had joined Australian rock band [[Wolfmother]], as their new drummer, on the ''Faster Louder'' website. He also claimed that the band had "broken up," although "Craig [Nicholls] will always write great music in the future and he may choose to carry on under the Vines’ name."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/31901/Vines-drummer-joins-Wolfmother-claims-The-Vines-have-broken-up |title=Vines drummer joins Wolfmother; claims The Vines have "broken up" |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=16 March 2012 |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073107/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/31901/Vines-drummer-joins-Wolfmother-claims-The-Vines-have-broken-up |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Paul McKercher]] produced the first half of the record and [[Lachlan Mitchell (record producer)|Lachlan Mitchell]], who also produced the latest Something With Numbers record, worked on the second half based upon West's recommendation to Nicholls.

The album featured over 70 different guest musicians.<ref name="Rolling Stone Article On White Shadows">{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Annabel|title=The Birth of White Shadows|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/the-birth-of-white-shadows/1613|website=rollingstoneaus.com|publisher=Rolling Stones|access-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518005951/http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/the-birth-of-white-shadows/1613|archive-date=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Craig Nicholls project, White Shadows, enlists all-star guests for debut album|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4196514.htm|website=abc.net.au|publisher=ABC|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

===''In Miracle Land'' and classic line-up reunion (2016–2018)===
{{Main|In Miracle Land}}
On 25 March 2016, the band changed their profile picture on [[Facebook]] to the band's logo.  Along with this came a new post featuring a picture of [[Craig Nicholls]] in the studio playing guitar with the caption "Album #7 coming soon..." On 1 April 2016, the first single "In Miracle Land" was released.

In October 2016, the band played three shows in Australia for the 'In Miracle Land' Tour in support of the upcoming album of the same name. During the tour, the band debuted new songs "Hate the Sound", "I Wanna Go Down", "Broken Heart", "Sky Gazer" and "Gone Wander". The title track has yet to be performed live.

In June 2017, it was announced that ''Highly Evolved'' was to be reissued on vinyl to coincide with its 15th anniversary.

In May 2018, The Vines' official Facebook page announced that The Vines would be joining [[Jet (band)|Jet]] as the opener for the two Sydney dates of their ''[[Get Born]]'' anniversary tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Original The Vines Line-up Reunite To Join Jet's Australian Tour|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2018/05/14/original-the-vines-line-up-reunite-to-join-jets-australian-tour/|website=theMusic.com.au|publisher=The Music|access-date=13 May 2018}}</ref> With the announcement came the news that the shows would be with the line-up of Nicholls, Matthews, Griffiths and Rosser. The shows marked Matthews' first with The Vines in 14 years, and the first in seven years for Griffiths and Rosser.

On 31 May 2018, it was announced via Facebook that the album ''[[In Miracle Land]]'' would be released 29 June 2018. It featured the same line-up as ''Wicked Nature''. The Vines have not performed live or given any updates on the band since late 2018.

In June 2021, [[Double J (radio station)|Double J]]'s Al Newstead wrote an [[op-ed]] in support of the band. "Their legacy isn’t clean cut," he wrote, "but it’s still remarkable to see what The Vines achieved, and chiefly what Nicholls survived."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newstead |first1=Al |title=Why The Vines deserve a serious reappraisal they’ll never get |url=https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/the-vines-j-files-craig-nicholls-deserved-better-highly-evolved/13409268 |website=Double J |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=19 November 2021}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
{{quote|Unlike many other pop post-modernists, the Vines never sound weighed down by all the influences they include in their music—it's as if they're so excited by everything they hear, they can't help but recombine it in unique ways.<ref name="allmusic-phares">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r588072 |title=Highly Evolved – The Vines : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Phares |first=Heather |work=Allmusic |access-date=16 July 2012}}</ref>|Heather Phares|[[AllMusic]]}}

Ex-bassist Matthews believed that ''Winning Days'' was a step in a different direction for the band. "The themes are more introspective and less wild rock'n'roll".<ref name="whither"/> Their music also was described by [[Chart Attack]] as having "neo-psychedelic arrangements".<ref name="Keene">{{cite web |url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/PrintThis.cfm?ID=2002052113 |title=LIVE: The Vines |last=Keene |first=Darrin |work=chartattack.com |date=21 May 2002 |access-date=16 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030429204713/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/PrintThis.cfm?ID=2002052113 |archive-date=29 April 2003}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Upon the release of their debut album, the Vines were hailed as "the second coming of Nirvana" by the British press; their grungy sound was considered reminiscent of the Seattle scene circa 1991 and Nicholls' erratic on-stage behaviour and raw vocals drew comparisons between him and Kurt Cobain.<ref name="nme-mar26-02">{{cite web|url = https://www.nme.com/reviews/the-vines/6208|title = Vines: Highly Evolved|date = 26 March 2002|access-date = 14 May 2014|author = James Oldham|work = NME}}</ref><ref name="straight-interview">{{cite web |url = https://www.straight.com/article/vines-show-growth |title = Vines Show Growth |author = Mike Usinger |date = 15 April 2004 |work = straight.com |access-date = 2 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="smh-vines1">{{cite news |date = 30 July 2002 |title = Fruit of The Vines |newspaper = [[The Sun-Herald]] }}</ref> ''Highly Evolved'' became a huge success and their accompanying live shows in the early years were praised as "electrifying" and "sensational".<ref name="nme-vineslive02">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/the-vines/6172 |title=NME Reviews - Vines : Brighton Freebutt |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2005-09-12 |access-date=2015-11-02}}</ref>

Critical reactions to 2004's ''Winning Days'' were mixed. [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'s Chris Ott described it as being "nothing more than boring and harmlessly vapid" and showing "only mild promise".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/8472-winning-days/ |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130201014826/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/8472-winning-days/ |url-status = dead |archive-date = 1 February 2013 |title = The Vines: Winning Days |last = Ott |first = Chris |date = 14 April 2004 |work = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |access-date = 16 July 2012 }}</ref> Conversely, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[David Fricke]] said it was "a leap forward in style and frenzy".<ref name="rs-wdreview">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thevines/albums/album/5198094/review/6067618/winning_days ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212223424/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thevines/albums/album/5198094/review/6067618/winning_days |date=12 February 2009 }}</ref>

==Activism==
In 2006, the Vines created a decorated heart card to benefit [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nme.com/news/the-vines/22177 |title = Get Valentine's Day cards from The Vines and Franz! |date = 9 February 2006 |work = nme.com |access-date = 16 July 2012}}</ref> In 2007, the group joined the organisation in calling for an end to Canada's seal hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/15/jet_and_the_vines_join_peta_against_seal |title = Jet and the Vines Join PETA Against Seal Slaughter - Starpulse.com |date = 15 May 2007 |work = starpulse.com |access-date = 16 July 2012}}</ref>
