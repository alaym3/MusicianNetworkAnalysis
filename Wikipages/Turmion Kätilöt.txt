'''Turmion Kätilöt''' (literally "Midwives of Ruin", "Midwives of Bane" or "Midwives of Perdition") is a Finnish [[industrial metal]] band founded in 2003 by [[MC Raaka Pee]] and DJ Vastapallo, who until the latter's departure, were the only studio lineup. The live line-up adds Master Bates, [[Janne Tolsa|RunQ]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], [[Eternal Tears of Sorrow]]) and DQ.

==Biography==
The band had a recording contract with [[Spinefarm Records]] (specifically Ranka Recordings), and their second album, ''Pirun nyrkki'', was released on 29 March 2006. Shortly after a dispute over income developed between the band and Spinefarm, with the band filing a lawsuit against the label. During the ongoing case, a new album, ''[[U.S.C.H.!]]'', was released for free download on 11 June 2008. A single, "Minä määrään" ("I Rule"), was also released for free before the album, on 21 May.

On 9 March the group posted a statement on their website, clarifying the arguments between the band and their former record company [[Spinefarm Records]] had been settled, but stated that the terms of the agreement meant they could not discuss the matter further. ''U.S.C.H.!'' was released physically on 20 May 2009 including two bonus tracks.

On 7 December 2012, lead vocalist Turunen suffered a stroke. The band was on small hiatus but returned on 22 January 2013 and revealed that a new album is coming out next autumn. On 4 April 2013, the band released a new single titled "Jalopiina" in two different forms; as a purchasable single or as a free download on their website. During the first day after the release, the Finnish record shop Levykauppa X held a campaign where the single was legally stealable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fi-fi.facebook.com/turmionkatilot/posts/10151677887387985|title=Jos haluat nähdä sisällön, kirjaudu sisään tai rekisteröidy|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>

In May 2015, the band debuted two new singles, "Vastanaineet" and "Taisteluhuuto", and in July announced that their upcoming album ''Diskovibrator'' would be available on 25 September that year.

In January 2017, Turmion Kätilöt announced on their [[Facebook]] page that long-time member Spellgoth had departed from the band. A devout [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanist]], he later commented on his decision to leave the band as "having his heart more on the side of black metal". He currently fronts a Finnish black metal band [[Horna]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fi-fi.facebook.com/turmionkatilot/posts/10155212890667985|title=Jos haluat nähdä sisällön, kirjaudu sisään tai rekisteröidy|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>

In August 2017, the band announced that after his trial period, Shag-U will become the full-time member of the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fi-fi.facebook.com/turmionkatilot/posts/10155912006077985|title=Jos haluat nähdä sisällön, kirjaudu sisään tai rekisteröidy|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>
