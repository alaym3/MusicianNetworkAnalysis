'''A-ha''' (usually stylised as '''''a''-h''a'''''; {{IPA-no|ɑˈhɑː}}) is a Norwegian [[synth-pop]] band formed in [[Oslo]] in 1982. Founded by [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]] (guitars), [[Magne Furuholmen]] (keyboards and guitars), and [[Morten Harket]] (vocals), the band rose to fame during the mid-1980s.

A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album ''[[Hunting High and Low]]'' in 1985. The album peaked at number one in their native country Norway, number 2 in the UK, and number 15 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart; yielded two international number-one singles: "[[Take On Me]]" and "[[The Sun Always Shines on T.V.]]"; and earned the band a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best New Artist. In the UK, ''Hunting High and Low'' continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/frontrow/1986.shtml| title=Best-selling albums of 1986|publisher=BBC| access-date=13 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="US album-positions for A-ha">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-ha-p3491/charts-awards| title=Allmusic: A-ha (Albums)|website=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref> The band released studio albums in 1986, 1988, and 1990, with single hits including "[[Hunting High and Low (A-ha song)|Hunting High and Low]]", "[[The Living Daylights (song)|The Living Daylights]]", "[[Stay on These Roads (song)|Stay on These Roads]]", and "[[Crying in the Rain#a-ha version|Crying in the Rain]]". In 1994, after their fifth studio album, ''[[Memorial Beach]]'' (1993), failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on hiatus.<ref name="A-ha to break up after 25 years">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8308829.stm|title=A-ha to break up after 25 years|publisher=BBC|date=15 October 2009|access-date=15 October 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017150924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8308829.stm| archive-date= 17 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Following a performance at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in 1998, A-ha recorded their sixth album, 2000's ''[[Minor Earth Major Sky]]'', which was another number-one album in Norway and Germany.

==Biography==
===Formation===
The trio, composed of lead vocalist [[Morten Harket]]; guitarist [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]] (then known as Pål Waaktaar) and keyboardist [[Magne Furuholmen]], formed in 1982 and left Norway for London in order to make a career in music. "We were trying to think of what to call themselves, focusing on Norwegian words people could say in English." They jettisoned that idea when Morten spotted a song called "A-ha" in Waaktaar's songbook. "It was a terrible song but a great name," said Morten.<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]''; circa 1986. "The Icemen Cometh" by David Fricke, page 18.</ref>

They chose the studio of musician, producer, and soon-to-be-manager John Ratcliff because it had a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' machine. John Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, <span class="plainlinks">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150910055519/http://a-ha.com/the-band/the-story-so-far/chapter-11/ Terry Slater]</span>, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group's international business manager and as liaison to Warner Brothers' head office in Los Angeles.

===''Hunting High and Low'' (1984–1986)===
An early version of "[[Take On Me]]" was the first song that Morten Harket had heard Magne Furuholmen and Pål Waaktaar play in [[Asker]]. At that time, the song was called "Miss Eerie" and the two men were still known as [[Bridges (band)|Bridges]]. Morten said it sounded more like a "[[Juicy Fruit]] song" for a gum advertisement. A-ha's first recorded version, called "Lesson One", was released in 1984 and promoted with a video of the band performing the song in front of a blue background. After it failed to chart, the song was re-recorded with production by Alan Tarney, and again failed to chart. Finally, the song was re-recorded and re-released in 1985 with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="US Singles-positions for A-ha">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-ha-p3491/charts-awards/billboard-singles| title=Allmusic: A-ha (Singles)|website=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="UK" />

A-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number one hit in the U.S. The popularity of "Take on Me" earned the band a spot on the American television series ''[[Soul Train]]'' in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show. (Earlier ''Soul Train'' appearances by white artists included [[Gino Vannelli|Gino Vanelli]], Elton John, David Bowie, Hall & Oates, Sheena Easton, and Teena Marie.)

The video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called [[Rotoscope|rotoscoping]], in which individual frames of film are drawn over or coloured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.muchmusic.com/archives/2008/02/video_spotlight_4.php |title=Much Music Retro Video Spotlight |work=Much Music |access-date=13 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420081935/http://blog.muchmusic.com/archives/2008/02/video_spotlight_4.php |archive-date=20 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It became one of the most instantly recognisable and most enduringly popular music videos in the US, where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual [[MTV Video Awards]] in 1986, winning six, including Best New Artist in a Video, Best Concept Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, and Viewer's Choice and Best Video of the Year. Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined.

The band's second single worldwide was "[[The Sun Always Shines on T.V.]]", even though "Love Is Reason" was the second single in Norway. In the US, the song peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and reached number 17 on ''[[Radio & Records]]'' airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number 5 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.<ref name="US Singles-positions for A-ha"/> The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated in three categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha's total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, [[Peter Gabriel]] would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached—and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel.

A-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category, which was eventually won by [[Sade (band)|Sade]]. "The Sun Always Shines on TV" turned out to be A-ha's last Hot 100 [[top 40]] single, and to this day in the United States, A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of "Take On Me".<ref name="US Singles-positions for A-ha"/> As such, the band is frequently considered a [[one-hit wonder]] there, despite their two top 40 hits. In the UK, however, the story was very different: "The Sun Always Shines on TV" became their only number one there.<ref name="UK" /> In the UK, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album—"Train of Thought" and "Hunting High and Low" (with another innovative video) —and the band remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The band's first album, 1985's ''[[Hunting High and Low]]'', became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top 200 album chart. The album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for A-ha. ''Hunting High and Low'' earned triple platinum status in the UK and reached platinum status in the US and Germany, while earning gold in Brazil and the Netherlands.<ref name="UK's certification-database"/><ref name="RIAA">{{cite web

===Golden age (1986–1994)===

A-ha's second album, ''[[Scoundrel Days]]'', was released in the midst of the 1986 world tour, and represented a move towards [[alternative rock]], as [[synthpop]] began to fall out of style. Although the album received favourable reviews and had three singles become international hits, the album's sales (6.4 million copies) did not match those of its predecessor (except for Switzerland, where it is A-ha's best-selling album).<ref name="SWI C">{{cite web| url=http://hitparade.ch/search_certifications.asp?search=A-ha| title=Swiss Certifications| publisher=Swiss Hitparade| access-date=7 March 2008}}</ref> "[[Cry Wolf (A-ha song)|Cry Wolf]]" would be the last A-ha single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After the release of the album, A-ha toured in the US, its last appearance there for 20 years.

Ned Raggett of AllMusic Guide would later write of the album, "The opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around: the tense edge of the title track, featuring one of Morten Harket's soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp, pristine punch in the music, and 'The Swing of Things,' a moody, elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement (plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro Michael Sturgis) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over...The '80s may be long gone, but ''Scoundrel Days'' makes clear that not everything was bad back then."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-ha.com/discography/albums/scoundrel-days/|title=Scoundrel days|website=A-ha.com|access-date=30 December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231011115/http://a-ha.com/discography/albums/scoundrel-days/|archive-date=31 December 2014}}</ref>

In May 1988, A-ha released their third studio album, titled ''[[Stay on These Roads]]'', which matched the number-two chart peak of its two predecessors on the British album charts. ''Stay on These Roads'' has been certified Platinum in Brazil and France, and Gold in Switzerland, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands.<ref name="UK's certification-database"/><ref name="GER C"/><ref name="Brazil's Certifications for A-ha"/><ref name="SWI C" /><ref name="French Platinum Album certifications for 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.disqueenfrance.com/fr/page-259165.xml?year=2001&type=12 |title=Certifications Albums Platine – année 2001 |publisher=Disque en France |access-date=25 March 2011 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003538/http://www.disqueenfrance.com/fr/page-259165.xml?year=2001&type=12 |archive-date=6 March 2012 }}</ref>

The album includes the title-track theme song to the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. The version that appears on their album is a re-recording of the film version and single. The band has said that they are particularly proud of the title track, and all three members contributed to its writing. "Stay on These Roads" and "The Living Daylights" would remain part of their live set throughout the rest of the band's history. After the release of the album, the band went on a 74-city world tour. The album has sold more than 4.2 million copies worldwide.<ref name="Pandora" />
[[File:A-ha Pål.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy|Pål Waaktaar-Savoy]] live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]
''[[East of the Sun, West of the Moon]]'' featured a cover version of [[The Everly Brothers]]' 1963 single, "[[Crying in the Rain]]". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, A-ha were very popular in South America, especially in Brazil, where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world. At the [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio II]] festival in January 1991, A-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at [[Maracanã stadium]] for their top-billed evening concert—a [[Guinness World Record]] for biggest rock concert attendance.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqY3qCF-8pQC|title=Guinness World Records 2001|first=Tim|last=Footman|date=1 September 2000|publisher=Mint Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=9781892051011}}</ref> In contrast, the other performers ([[George Michael]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Guns N' Roses]]) each drew less than a third of that audience, 60,000 each. In a 2009 interview from Cody Eide in ''Musicweek'', celebrating A-ha's up and coming 25-year anniversary, the band members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band. The 1991 Rock in Rio festival, which should have been the band's crowning achievement, was instead a moment of crushing disappointment. "MTV interviewed everybody except us", remembers Waaktaar-Savoy. "They were all calling their bosses and saying, 'We must cover A-ha; it's the only night that has sold out.' But they weren't allowed to." "I felt very alienated," says Furuholmen. "It made us feel hopeless. We played to the biggest crowd in the world, and they ignored it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/2640/ahanewsweek4.jpg| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216061549/http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/2640/ahanewsweek4.jpg |archive-date=16 February 2010|title=Kiso Siefert Dropmann newspaper advertisement |publisher=Musicweek |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref>

''East of the Sun, West of the Moon'' was certified Gold in Switzerland, Brazil, and Germany and Silver in the UK.<ref name="UK's certification-database"/><ref name="GER C" /><ref name="Brazil's Certifications for A-ha"/><ref name="SWI C" /> Steven McDonald of AllMusic said of their fourth album, "This is a nicely crafted collection of songs, performed and sung beautifully, with lots of echoes and suggestions tucked into the music. While not an album one can discuss at length, it's an album that's a pleasure to listen to." The album sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.<ref name="Pandora" />

Their last album before their hiatus was ''[[Memorial Beach]]'', in 1993. Relative to previous releases, the album was a commercial disappointment. The only single from the album to chart officially outside of Norway was "Dark Is the Night", which peaked at number 19 in the United Kingdom. ''Memorial Beach'' is notably the last official American release by A-ha to date, although their material has continued to have limited availability there as imports. Despite the commercial reception, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlists.html#1993 |title=Rocklist.net...Q magazine Recordings of the Year |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> The following February, A-ha performed two concerts during the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], Norway, followed by tours of South Africa and Norway. A-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the Winter [[Paralympic Games]] in Lillehammer, which they entitled "Shapes That Go Together".

In 1994, the band unofficially entered a hiatus, and band members then focused on solo projects.<ref name="A-ha to break up after 25 years"/>

===First comeback (1998–2007)===
[[File:A-ha all1.jpg|thumb|right|A-ha live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]
The band was invited to perform at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in 1998. Paul wrote "[[Summer Moved On]]" especially for this performance.<ref>interview on "A-ha live at valhall homecoming" DVD, 2001</ref> They also performed "The Sun Always Shines on TV". This performance was A-ha's comeback into the world of music, yet the band's set was controversially omitted from a programme of highlights of that concert that was televised in the UK, and even more controversially in the US by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]. Nevertheless, the band returned to the studio. Those recording sessions resulted in 2000's ''[[Minor Earth Major Sky]]'', an international tour, and a webcast performance of the band opening the new [[Coca Cola Vallhall Arena|Vallhall Arena]] in Oslo on 24 and 25 March 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://a-ha.com/news/articles/a-ha-concert-in-oslo-will-be-live-on-the-internet |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008140307/http://a-ha.com/news/articles/a-ha-concert-in-oslo-will-be-live-on-the-internet/ |archive-date=8 October 2016}} News item announcing the webcast.</ref> A-ha's video for "I Wish I Cared" was one of the first fully web-based animated flash music videos to be made available. (The first was Duran Duran's flash video for the 2000 song "Someone Else Not Me".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}) The album reached platinum status, with sales of 1.5 million copies, and spawned four singles: "Summer Moved On", "Minor Earth Major Sky", "Velvet" and "The Sun Never Shone That Day". "Summer Moved On" went to No.&nbsp;1 in 17 countries.

A-ha made a return appearance at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in 2001, performing a new song, Differences, and [[Hunting High and Low (A-ha song)|Hunting High and Low]]. The subsequent album, ''[[Lifelines (A-ha album)|Lifelines]]'', was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top 5 hits there, "[[Forever Not Yours]]" and "[[Lifelines (song)|Lifelines]]". Jesper Hiro directed the video for "Lifelines", based on the short film ''[[A Year Along the Abandoned Road]]'', which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year passing by in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed.

A live album from their 2002 tour, titled ''[[How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head]]'', was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit "The Sun Always Shines on TV." In 2004, a book entitled "The Swing of Things" was published, which also featured a CD of early demo material. That year A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, ''[[The Definitive Singles Collection 1984–2004]]''. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number 13 and earned a [[Music recording certification|Gold album]].

On 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of [[Live 8]], in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with "Hunting High and Low", followed by "Take On Me", during which [[Morten Harket]] had difficulties hearing himself when his [[in-ear monitor]] failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, "Summer Moved On," became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band's time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:A-ha Morten2.jpg|thumb|left|Lead vocalist [[Morten Harket]] live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]
On 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at [[Irving Plaza]] in New York City, the band's first concert in North America since 1986 despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in [[Frogner Park]] in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.

On 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, ''[[Analogue (album)|Analogue]]''. The UK release of the single "[[Analogue (All I Want)|Analogue]]" gave A-ha their first top 10 hit in the UK since 1988.<ref name="UK" /> The album includes a guest appearance by [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby Stills & Nash]] performing backup vocals on the songs "Over the Treetops" and "Cosy Prisons". The song "[[Celice (song)|Celice]]" became the band's ninth to go No.&nbsp;1 on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The following tour included a gig at London's Shepherd's Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa. In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[No.&nbsp;9 Dream]]" for [[Amnesty International]]. It was released in June 2007 on the album "[[Make Some Noise (campaign)|Make Some Noise]]". On 30 October 2006 in London, A-ha received the prestigious [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' Magazine]] Inspiration Award for their long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} On 15 September 2007, A-ha played a free outdoor concert in Kiel, Germany. The band played on a floating stage in the harbour. This concert was streamed live on the internet via [[MSN]].

On 24 January 2009, 25 years after its first release, A-ha won the Norwegian Spellemann award for Hit of All Time for "[[Take On Me]]" on the 50th anniversary of the official hit list in Norway.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===New direction and farewell (2008–2010)===
On 20–22 May 2008, [[Morten Harket]], [[Magne Furuholmen]] and [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy|Pål Waaktaar-Savoy]] performed concerts in [[Oslo]], Norway, to promote their respective solo material before coming together as A-ha to play "[[Train of Thought (A-ha song)|Train of Thought]]", "[[Take On Me]]", and two new songs, "Riding the Crest" and "Shadowside", which previewed the new A-ha album, ''[[Foot of the Mountain]]''. These events led up to their performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 24 May.

On 24 April 2009, A-ha surprised their fan base by releasing their new single, "Foot of the Mountain", premiering that day on Norwegian radio. The single had been completed only the night before. The song is based upon the track "The Longest Night" by Magne Furuholmen, which was released on his album ''[[A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss]]''. The single was released on 22 May in Germany. The band promoted the song by playing it during the final of ''Germany's Next Topmodel'' on 21 May in the Lanxess Arena, Cologne.

''[[Foot of the Mountain]]'', A-ha's ninth studio album, was released in Europe on 19 June 2009. The album's material marked a return to synth pop, similar to the band's earliest work, although the first single (and title track) was not wholly indicative of this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=43118_0_2_0_C|title=A-ha returns to synthpop with new album 'Foot of the Mountain' |website=Side-line.com |access-date=4 October 2010}}</ref> The band collaborated with successful producer [[Steve Osborne]], who has produced albums for such artists as [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Starsailor (band)|Starsailor]], [[Doves (band)|Doves]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], and [[U2 (band)|U2]].

"I feel more connected to [[Depeche Mode]] (compared with other acts of the '80s)," claimed Magne Furuholmen.

In 2014, Furuholmen agreed to compose the songs and supervise the recordings for the Norwegian film ''Beatles''.

===Second comeback (2015–2016)===
In late 2014, rumours about new A-ha activities in 2015 embarked, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of "[[Take On Me]]". During an A-ha fan convention in Oslo in October 2014, manager Harald Wilk announced plans to re-release A-ha's first five albums on vinyl and albums 3 to 5 as deluxe editions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/aha_com/status/526027755390271489|title=a-ha.com on Twitter|work=Twitter}}</ref> In December 2014, four years to the day of their final concert, the band announced that they had been invited to reunite to perform in [[Rock in Rio 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/A-ha-to-reunite-in-Rio-7813211.html|title=A-ha to reunite in Rio|work=Aftenposten}}</ref>

In March 2016, they played a live concert which was broadcast on the BBC's Red Button service and on BBC Radio 2 as part of their "In Concert" strand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075t9qs |title=BBC Radio 2 - Radio 2 in Concert, a-ha |access-date=24 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930224924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075t9qs |archive-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>

In [[Oslo Spektrum]] on 3 May 2016, A-ha cleared away their normal stage-production to give room for a very different concert performance in collaboration with Void, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[computation]]al design studio working in the intersection between [[design]], [[architecture]], [[art]] and [[technology]]. The collaboration resulted in a unique one-of-a-kind concert with advanced [[scenography]] using 360 virtual reality technology.

On 3 May 2016, A-ha gave a multimedia performance in collaboration with Void, a Norwegian computational design studio. The stereoscopic VR experience was made available for Android users directly through a YouTube app and also made available for iPhone users and other platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDh-4ySTC7I| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211031/vDh-4ySTC7I| archive-date=2021-10-31 | url-status=live|title=The technology behind A-ha Afterglow - HYDRO|last=Norsk Hydro|date=3 May 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=20 October 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-ha.com/news/articles/preparing-for-afterglow/|title=Preparing for Afterglow.

===MTV Unplugged tour and ''Hunting High and Low'' Tour (2017−present) ===

In December 2016, A-ha announced that they would go on a European acoustic tour in early 2018. They also stated that they were going to be producing an album and film from a series of acoustic performances, slated for June 2017, with the release scheduled for November 2017.

In mid-June 2017, they recorded an MTV Unplugged special in the remote Norwegian island of [[Giske]] under close secrecy, with no phones or recording equipment being allowed into the studio. The CD, DVD, and Blu-ray recordings were released in October 2017. The European acoustic tour was also renamed from "An acoustic evening with A-ha" to the "MTV Unplugged tour 2018".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/musikk/a-ha/a-ha-med-ny-plate-film-og-turne/a/23873160/|title=a-ha med ny plate, film og turné|website=Vg.no|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, the band confirmed the acoustic album would be titled ''Summer Solstice'', and would feature two new A-ha songs, titled "This Is Our Home" and "A Break in the Clouds". The video for "This Is Our Home" was released in September 2017, followed by the Unplugged versions of "The Sun Always Shines on TV", "The Living Daylights" and "Take On Me", the latter of which received widespread acclaim for re-imagining the pop classic.

The acoustic version of "Take On Me" was included in the movie ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', released in May 2018, and in episode 13, season 4 of the American TV series [[The Magicians (American TV series)|''The Magicians'']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crowley |first1=James |title=A-Ha's "Take On Me" Becomes the Second '80s Video to Break 1 Billion YouTube Views |url=https://www.newsweek.com/aha-take-me-youtube-video-80s-billion-views-1488117 |publisher=Newsweek |access-date=26 April 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref>

On 29 October 2019, A-ha started their "Hunting High and Low" tour in Dublin. They play, among other songs, their debut album in full length.

On 13 June 2021, the documentary ''[[a-ha: The Movie]]'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York. The movie tells the story of the band and deals both the success and the problems – among them personal rifts inside the group. The director was [[Thomas Robsahm]], who followed the band for four years.<ref>https://www.screendaily.com/features/director-thomas-robsahm-talks-a-ha-the-movie-ahead-of-tribeca-premiere/5160453.article</ref> It is scheduled for world wide release.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10851414/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1</ref><ref>https://www.salon.com/2021/06/12/a-ha-the-movie-morten-harket</ref>

==Legacy==
To date the band is the most successful global pop music act to have emerged from Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicnorway.no/artist/a-ha-2/|title=a-ha|website=Music Norway EN|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref> In its heyday in the mid-1980s the band achieved chart topping success in Britain and the United States, and it was subsequently commercially successful in non-English-speaking areas of the world such as Germany, France and in South American countries. In 1986, A-ha received eight [[MTV Video Music Awards]] during one award show.

Their music video for the song "[[Take On Me]]" is considered to be one of the most distinctive music videos from the 1980s. On 17 February 2020 the music video reached 1 billion views on YouTube. At the time only four songs from the entire 20th century had reached that elusive mark—"[[November Rain]]" and "[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]], "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]"—making "Take on Me" the fifth video from that time period to ever do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/a-ha-take-on-me-billion-streams-youtube/|title=A-ha's 'Take on Me' Moves Past One Billion Streams on YouTube |publisher=PEOPLE.com|date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220165402/https://people.com/music/a-ha-take-on-me-billion-streams-youtube/ |archive-date=20 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Lauren M. |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/19/us/take-on-me-1b-trnd/index.html |title=Iconic music video for "Take On Me" hits one billion views on YouTube - CNN |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=20 February 2020 |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>

Songs by A-ha, either in original form or in the form of cover versions have also been included as background music and performances in episodes of popular television series, such as ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Cougar Town]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'' and ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/musikk/a-ha/hbo-serien-the-leftovers-hylles-for-bruk-av-a-has-take-on-me/a/23997292/|title=HBO-serien "The Leftovers" hylles for bruk av a-has "Take On Me"|website=Vg.no|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref>

Ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, a poll made it clear that the [[Norway|Norwegian]] band A-ha's appearance in 1991 and their record audience number that year was what people remembered best and the highlight of its 30-year history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/musica/rock-in-rio/2015/noticia/2015/09/-ha-em-1991-e-eleito-momento-mais-marcante-de-30-anos-do-rock-rio.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 September 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403075644/http://g1.globo.com/musica/rock-in-rio/2015/noticia/2015/09/-ha-em-1991-e-eleito-momento-mais-marcante-de-30-anos-do-rock-rio.html |archive-date=3 April 2016}}</ref> As a result of this, A-ha were invited to reunite for a performance at the festival, celebrating 30 years since their debut album's release.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
