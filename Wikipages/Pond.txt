Ponds may be [[Fresh water|freshwater]] or [[Brackish water|brackish]] in nature. 'Ponds' with [[Saline water|saltwater]], with a direct connection to the sea that maintains full salinity, would normally be regarded as part of the marine environment because they would not support fresh or brackish water organisms, so not really within the realm of freshwater science. 

Ponds are usually by definition quite shallow waterbodies with varying abundances of [[aquatic plant]]s and animals. Depth, seasonal water level variations, nutrients fluxes, amount of light reaching the ponds, the shape, the presence of visiting large mammals, the composition of any fish communities and salinity can all affect the types of plant and animal communities present.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801405617|title=Wetland ecology : principles and conservation|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-22365-2|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|oclc=801405617}}</ref> [[Food web|Food webs]] are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.<ref name=":2" /> Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.<ref name=":2" />

Ponds are frequently manmade or expanded beyond their original depths and bounds by [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]] causes. Apart from their role as highly biodiverse, fundamentally natural, freshwater ecosystems ponds have had, and still have, many uses, including providing [[Irrigation|water for agriculture]], livestock and communities, aiding in habitat restoration, serving as breeding grounds for local and migrating species, decorative components of [[landscape architecture]], [[flood control]] basins, general urbanization, interception basins for pollutants and sources and sinks of greenhouse gases.

== Classification ==
The technical distinction between a pond and a lake has not been universally standardized. [[Limnology|Limnologists]] and [[Hydrobiology|freshwater biologists]] have proposed formal definitions for ''pond'', in part to include 'bodies of water where light penetrates to the bottom of the waterbody,' 'bodies of water shallow enough for rooted water plants to grow throughout,' and 'bodies of water which lack wave action on the shoreline.' Each of these definitions are difficult to measure or verify in practice and are of limited practical use, and are mostly not now used. Accordingly, some organizations and researchers have settled on technical definitions of ''pond'' and ''lake'' that rely on size alone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Biggs|first1=Jeremy|last2=Williams|first2=Penny|last3=Whitfield|first3=Mericia|last4=Nicolet|first4=Pascale|last5=Weatherby|first5=Anita|date=2005|title=15 years of pond assessment in Britain: results and lessons learned from the work of Pond Conservation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.745|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|volume=15|issue=6|pages=693–714|doi=10.1002/aqc.745|issn=1052-7613}}</ref>

Some regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than 10 acres (4.0 ha). [[Minnesota]], known as the "land of 10,000 lakes", is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=Travis|last2=Tyson|first2=Jeff|last3=Page|first3=Kevin|last4=Stott|first4=Wendylee|date=2019|title=Evaluation of potential sources of sauger Sander canadensis for reintroduction into Lake Erie|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2019.09.027|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1299–1309|doi=10.1016/j.jglr.2019.09.027|s2cid=209565712|issn=0380-1330|via=}}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Adamson|first1=David|last2=Newell|first2=Charles|date=2014-02-01|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Monitored Natural Attenuation in Groundwater|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21236/ada627131|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|doi=10.21236/ada627131}}</ref> Even among organizations and researchers who distinguish lakes from ponds by size alone, there is no universally recognized standard for the maximum size of a pond.

In North America, even larger bodies of water have been called ponds; for example, [[Crystal Lake (Newton)|Crystal Lake]] at 33 acres (130,000 m<sup>2</sup>; 13 ha), [[Walden Pond]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] at 61 acres (250,000 m<sup>2</sup>; 25 ha), and nearby [[Middlesex Fells Reservation|Spot Pond]] at 340 acres (140 ha). There are numerous examples in other states, where bodies of water less than 10 acres (40,000 m<sup>2</sup>; 4.0 ha) are being called lakes. As the case of Crystal Lake shows, [[marketing]] purposes can sometimes be the driving factor behind the categorization.<ref>{{Citation|title=Newton of Braintree, Baron, (Antony Harold Newton) (1937–25 March 2012)|date=2007-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u29423|work=Who Was Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u29423|access-date=2020-11-16}}</ref>

In practice, a body of water is called a pond or a lake on an individual basis, as conventions change from place to place and over time. In origin, a pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.22489|title=Pond, Edward (d 1629)|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.22489}}</ref> In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian, as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. However, some parts of New England contain "ponds" that are actually the size of a small lake when compared to other countries. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds. Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as "stock pond", used for watering livestock. The term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).

There are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In the South Western parts of North American, lakes or ponds that are temporary and often dried up for most parts of the year are called [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Craig A.|last2=Smith|first2=Loren M.|last3=Conway|first3=Warren C.|date=2005|title=Lipid Reserves of Migrant Shorebirds During Spring in Playas of the Southern Great Plains|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7584|journal=The Condor|volume=107|issue=2|pages=457|doi=10.1650/7584|s2cid=85609044|issn=0010-5422}}</ref>  These playas are simply shallow depressions in dry areas that may only fill with water on certain occasion like excess local drainage, groundwater seeping, or rain.

Any [[Depression (geology)|depression]] in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of water can be considered a pond, and such, can be formed by a variety of [[Geology|geological]], [[Ecology|ecological]], and human terraforming events.

Natural ponds are those caused by environmental occurrences. These can vary from glacial, volcanic, fluvial, or even tectonic events. Since the Pleistocene epoch, glacial processes have created most of the Northern hemispheric ponds; an example is the [[Prairie pothole|Prairie Pothole Region]] of North America.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brönmark|first1=Christer|last2=Hansson|first2=Lars-Anders|date=2017-12-21|title=The Biology of Lakes and Ponds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198713593.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|series=Biology of Habitats Series|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198713593.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-871359-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17842267|title=Northern prairie wetlands|date=1989|publisher=Iowa State University|others=Valk, Arnoud van der., National Wetlands Technical Council (U.S.)|isbn=0-8138-0037-4|edition=1st|location=Ames|oclc=17842267}}</ref> When glaciers retreat, they may leave behind uneven ground due to bedrock [[Elastic-rebound theory|elastic rebound]] and sediment outwash plains.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kettles (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/kettles.htm|access-date=2020-11-16|website=www.nps.gov|language=en}}</ref> These areas may develop depressions that can fill up with excess precipitation or seeping ground water, forming a small pond.

Natural [[floodplain]]s along rivers, as well as landscapes that contain many depressions, may experience spring/rainy season [[flooding]] and snow melt.

In agriculture practices, [[treatment pond]]s can be created to reduce nutrient runoff from reaching local streams or groundwater storages. Pollutants that enter ponds can often be mitigated by natural sedimentation and other biological and chemical activities within the water. As such, waste stabilization ponds are becoming popular low-cost methods for general wastewater treatment. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s for struggling farms during times of drought.

As urbanization continues to spread, [[Retention basin|retention ponds]] are becoming more common in new housing developments. These ponds reduce the risk of flooding and erosion damage from excess storm water runoff in local communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Birx-Raybuck|first1=Devynn A.|last2=Price|first2=Steven J.|last3=Dorcas|first3=Michael E.|date=2009-11-21|title=Pond age and riparian zone proximity influence anuran occupancy of urban retention ponds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-009-0116-9|journal=Urban Ecosystems|volume=13|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi=10.1007/s11252-009-0116-9|s2cid=3118057|issn=1083-8155}}</ref>

== Pond Biodiversity ==
[[File:Still_Pond_2,_Isabella_Plantation,_Richmond_Park,_London,_UK_-_Diliff.jpg|thumb|Azalea flowers around a still pond in London's Richmond Park]]A defining feature of a pond is the presence of [[standing water]] which provides [[habitat]] for a biological community commonly referred to as [[pond life]].

[[File:Young_pumpkinseed_sunfish.jpg|thumb|Common freshwater fish species include the Large Mouth and Small Mouth Bass, Catfish, Bluegill, and Sunfish such as the Pumpkinseed Sunfish shown above]]
Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by [[wetland]], and these wetlands support the aquatic [[food web]], provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. This margin is also known as the littoral zone and contains much of the photosynthetic algae and plants of this ecosystem called macrophytes. Other photosynthetic organisms such as phytoplankton (suspended algae) and periphytons (organisms including cyanobacteria, detritus, and other microbes) thrive here and stand as the primary producers of pond food webs.<ref name=":0" /> Some grazing animals like [[Goose|geese]] and [[muskrat]]s consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food. In many other cases, pond plants will decay in the water. Many invertebrates and herbivorous zooplankton then feed on the decaying plants, and these lower trophic level organisms provide food for wetland species including fish, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and herons both in the littoral zone and the limnetic zone.<ref name=":0" /> The open water limnetic zone may allow [[algae]] to grow as sunlight still penetrates here. These algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and other small fish species. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae and their specific upper trophic level consumers and predators.<ref name=":0" /> Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources though biotic interaction. They, therefore, provide an important source of [[biological diversity]] in landscapes.

Opposite to long standing ponds are [[vernal pond]]s. These ponds dry up for part of the year and are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of "vernal" comes form the Latin word for [[Spring (season)|spring]]). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish, a major higher tropic level consumer, as these ponds frequently dry up. The absence of fish is a very important characteristic of these ponds since it prevents long chained biotic interactions from establishing. Ponds without these competitive predation pressures provides breeding locations and safe havens for endangered or migrating species. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name="Keddy 390–426"/>

Often groups of ponds in a given landscape - so called 'pondscapes' - offer especially high biodiversity benefits compared to single ponds. A group of ponds provides a higher degree of habitat complexity and habitat connectivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=John|date=1999|title=Framing a Strategy for Pond Landscape Conservation: aims, objectives and issues|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01426399908706551|journal=Landscape Research|volume=24:1|pages=67-83|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hill |first=Matthew J. |display-authors=etal |date=2018|title=New policy directions for global pond conservation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12447|journal=Conservation Letters|volume=11|via=Wiley}}</ref>

== Stratification ==
[[File:Lake_Stratification_(11).svg|thumb|Lakes are stratified into three separate sections: I. The ''[[Epilimnion]]'' II. The ''[[Metalimnion]]'' III. The ''[[Hypolimnion]]''.
The scales are used to associate each section of the stratification to their corresponding depths and temperatures. The arrow is used to show the movement of wind over the surface of the water which initiates the turnover in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion.]]

Many ponds undergo a regular yearly process in the same matter as larger lakes if they are deep enough and/or protected from the wind. Abiotic factors such as UV radiation, general temperature, wind speed, water density, and even size, all have important roles to play when it comes to the seasonal effects on lakes and ponds.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/351296306|title=Encyclopedia of inland waters|others=Likens, Gene E., 1935-|date=19 March 2009|isbn=978-0-12-370626-3|location=[Amsterdam]|oclc=351296306}}</ref> Spring overturn, summer stratification, autumn turnover, and an inverse winter stratification, ponds adjust their stratification or their vertical zonation of temperature due to these influences. These environmental factors affect pond circulation and temperature gradients within the water itself producing distant layers; the [[epilimnion]], [[Thermocline|metalimnion]], and [[hypolimnion]].<ref name=":0"/>

Each zone has varied traits that sustain or harm specific organisms and biotic interactions below the surface depending on the season. Winter surface ice begins to melt in the Spring. This allows the water column to begin mixing thanks to solar convection and wind velocity. As the pond mixes, an overall constant temperature is reached. As temperatures increase through the summer, thermal stratification takes place. Summer stratification allows for the epilimnion to be mixed by winds, keeping a consistent warm temperature throughout this zone. Here, [[photosynthesis]] and [[primary production]] flourishes. However, those species that need cooler water with higher dissolved oxygen concentrations will favor the lower metalimnion or hypolimnion. Air temperature drops as fall approaches and a deep mixing layer occurs. Autumn turnover results in [[Isothermal process|isothermal]] lakes with high levels of dissolved oxygen as the water reaches an average colder temperature. Finally, winter stratification occurs inversely to summer stratification as surface ice begins to form yet again. This ice cover remains until solar radiation and convection return in the spring.

Due to this constant change in vertical zonation, seasonal stratification causes habitats to grow and shrink accordingly. Certain species are bound to these distinct layers of the water column where they can thrive and survive with the best efficiency possible.

For more information regarding seasonal thermal stratification of ponds and lakes, please look at "[[Lake stratification|Lake Stratification]]".

[[File:Pond_in_winter_2.jpg|thumb|A pond in winter experiencing inverse stratification]]Ponds provide not only environmental values, but practical benefits to society. One increasingly crucial benefit that ponds provide is their ability to act as greenhouse gas sinks. Most natural lakes and ponds are greenhouse gas sources and aid in the [[flux]] of these dissolved compounds. However, manmade farm ponds are becoming significant sinks for gas [[mitigation]] and the fight against [[climate change]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Ridgwell|first1=A.|title=Geological carbon sinks.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/9781845931896.0074|work=Greenhouse gas sinks|pages=74–97|place=Wallingford|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-189-6|access-date=2020-11-16|last2=Edwards|first2=U.|year=2007|doi=10.1079/9781845931896.0074|citeseerx=10.1.1.371.7116}}</ref> These agriculture runoff ponds receive high [[pH]] level water from surrounding soils. Highly acidic drainage ponds act as catalysis for excess [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] (Carbon Dioxide) to be converted into forms of carbon that can easily be stored in sediments.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Reay|first1=D.

As a result, breakdown and release of Nitrogen gasses from these organic materials such as [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]] does not occur and thus, not added to our atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Ty|date=2019-05-21|title=Farm Ponds Sequester Greenhouse Gases|url=https://eos.org/articles/farm-ponds-sequester-greenhouse-gases|journal=Eos|volume=100|doi=10.1029/2019EO124083|issn=2324-9250|doi-access=free}}</ref> This process is also used with regular [[denitrification]] in [[Anoxic zones|anoxic]] layer of ponds. However, not all ponds have the ability to become [[Carbon sink|sinks]] for [[greenhouse gas]]ses. Most ponds experience [[eutrophication]] where faced with excessive nutrient input from fertilizers and runoff. This over-nitrifies the pond water and results in mass [[Algal bloom|algae blooms]] and local [[fish kill]]s.

Some farm ponds are not used for runoff control but rather for livestock like [[cattle]] or buffalo as watering and bathing holes. As mentioned in the use section, ponds are important hotspots for biodiversity. Sometimes this becomes an issue with invasive or introduced species that disrupt pond ecosystem dynamics such as [[Food web|food-web]] structure, [[Niche construction|niche]] partitioning, and guild assignments.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Radosevich, Steven R.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181348071|title=Ecology of weeds and invasive plants : relationship to agriculture and natural resource management|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|others=Holt, Jodie S., Ghersa, Claudio., Radosevich, Steven R.|isbn=978-0-470-16894-3|edition=3rd|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=181348071}}</ref> This varies from introduced fish species such as the [[Common carp|Common Carp]] that eat native water plants or Northern [[Snakehead (fish)|Snakeheads]] that attack breeding amphibians, aquatic snails that carry infectious parasites that kill other species, and even rapid spreading aquatic plants like [[Hydrilla]] and [[Lemnoideae|Duckweed]] that can restrict water flow and cause overbank flooding.<ref name=":1" />

Ponds, depending on their orientation and size, can spread their wetland habitats into the local riparian zones or watershed boundaries. Gentle slopes of land into ponds provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows to expand beyond the limitation of the pond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Genet|first1=John A.|last2=Olsen|first2=Anthony R.|date=2008|title=Assessing depressional wetland quantity and quality using a probabilistic sampling design in the Redwood River watershed, Minnesota, USA|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/06-150.1|journal=Wetlands|volume=28|issue=2|pages=324–335|doi=10.1672/06-150.1|s2cid=29365811|issn=0277-5212|via=}}</ref> However, the construction of retaining walls, lawns, and other urbanized developments can severely degrade the range of pond habitats and the longevity of the pond itself.

In landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing and conservation opportunities, to treat wastewater, for sequestration and pollution containment, or for simply aesthetic purposes. For natural pond conservation and development, one way to stimulate this is with general stream and river restoration. Many small rivers and streams feed into or from local ponds within the same watershed. When these rivers and streams flood and begin to meander, large numbers of natural ponds, including [[vernal pool]]s and [[wetland]]s, develop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Geist|first1=Juergen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Stephen J.|date=2016-08-31|title=Habitat recovery and restoration in aquatic ecosystems: current progress and future challenges|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2702|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|volume=26|issue=5|pages=942–962|doi=10.1002/aqc.2702|issn=1052-7613}}</ref>
