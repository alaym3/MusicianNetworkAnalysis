==History==

===Inception and ''All's Well That Ends Well'' (2001&ndash;2005)===
The original members of Chiodos assembled (under the name The Chiodos Brothers) while attending high school in their hometown of [[Davison, Michigan]] during 2001. Initially, they got their start playing shows at the [[Flint Local 432]], an all-ages, substance free music venue located in Downtown Flint. The Flint Local 432 also helped develop other nationally recognized alternative acts such as [[The Swellers]], and Empty Orchestra. The group changed their name the following years to Chiodos after releasing three EPs, one for each year until the coming of 2004 when the writing and preparation of their debut album, ''[[All's Well That Ends Well (Chiodos album)|All's Well That Ends Well]]'' began. The debut record was released on July 26, 2005 through Equal Vision Records. It reached #3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Heatseekers chart and #164 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart upon its release.<ref>{{cite web| publisher= AllMusic| url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p707967|pure_url=yes}} | title= Billboard| access-date= November 18, 2006}}</ref>

===''Bone Palace Ballet'' and departure of Craig Owens (2006&ndash;2009)===
Chiodos headlined some shows on their own before joining [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'s 2006 "Invisible Sideshow" tour, headlined by [[Armor for Sleep]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher= NowOnTour| url= http://www.nowontour.com/reviews/show/00085.php| title= Chiodos| access-date= November 18, 2006| archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/6GgpWyys7?url=http://www.nowontour.com/reviews/show/00085.php| archive-date= May 17, 2013| url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.www.thedailyaztec.com/media/storage/paper741/news/2006/02/14/Tempo/In.Focus.Two.Bands.Trying.To.Break.The.Mold-1611614.shtml|title=IN FOCUS: two bands trying to break the mold - Tempo|last=Burkard|first=Jessica|date=February 14, 2006|website=The Daily Aztec|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222054911/http://media.www.thedailyaztec.com/media/storage/paper741/news/2006/02/14/Tempo/In.Focus.Two.Bands.Trying.To.Break.The.Mold-1611614.shtml|archive-date=December 22, 2007 }}</ref> Following that tour, they supported [[Matchbook Romance]] on the [[Sub City Records|Sub City]] "Take Action" tour in Spring 2006.

They played [[Warped Tour 2009]] on the main stage alongside bands [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Saosin]] and [[Underoath]].

On September 24, 2009 the band announced on their [[MySpace]] page that they had "let go" of lead singer, Craig Owens.

{{cquote|To all of our friends, family, and fans: We would like to let you know that we have let Craig Owens go as the singer of Chiodos. This decision was a necessary one. Out of respect for all of the hard work that we have put in together for all of these years we will not be discussing the specific reasons that this needed to happen. We wish Craig well. We will absolutely be continuing on as a band and we will keep you informed as this next chapter unfolds. Chiodos fans are the best fans in the world and all we can ask of you, after everything you have already given us, is to share in our
excitement for this next album. We promise you will not be disappointed............Brad, Jason, Pat, and Matt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/craigowensoutofchiodos|title=Craig Owens kicked out of Chiodos|work=Alternative Press}}</ref>}}
 
People close to the band were apparently aware of the tension and acrimony between Owens and the other members but, in the days following this announcement, expressed both surprise at the firing, and curiosity about how Chiodos would proceed without Owens as the "face of the band."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/09/davison_punk_band_boots_singer.html |title=Davison punk band Chiodos boots singer Craig Owens |publisher=MLive.com |access-date=2010-06-26}}</ref> 

===Line-up change and ''Illuminaudio'' (2010&ndash;2012)===
[[Image:ChiodosSoundwave.JPG|thumb|left|188px|Chiodos performing at Australian music festival, [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]], in Melbourne, 2009.]]
On February 1, 2010, the band announced that they were set to record their third album with acclaimed producer, Machine, that month. "Entering the studio with Bell will be members Jason Hale (guitar), Pat McManaman (guitar), Matt Goddard (bass), and a recently added drummer, [[Tanner Wayne]] (ex-[[Underminded]], ex-[[Scary Kids Scaring Kids]]).

The band planned to keep the identity of their new vocalist a secret until their performance at Bamboozle left, but on February 2, 2010 ''Alternative Press'' reported that former [[Yesterdays Rising]] singer [[Brandon Bolmer]] was the new vocalist. Bolmer later revealed to AP that he was the new Chiodos vocalist and he would no longer be a part of Yesterdays Rising.

In the May issue of ''Alternative Press'' the band stated they and Derrick Frost parted ways at the time due to his and Craig Owens inability to get along. The band let Frost go over Owens, and only months later let Owens go. They also stated they had considered bringing Frost back.

On June 9, 2010 a demo featuring Owens on vocals was leaked onto the internet, named "Thermacare". The demo was recorded in September, just before Owens parted ways from the band. The band released a version of this song on their new CD "Illuminaudio" renaming it "Stratovolcano Mouth", which features only the music portion of "Thermacare". Owens' band, [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows|D.R.U.G.S.]] released their version on their self-titled debut album. It features Owens's lyrics with new music, and is renamed "The Only Thing You Talk About"

On August 3, 2010, ''Alternative Press'' posted on their website that Chiodos' new album would be titled ''[[Illuminaudio]]'', and would be released on October 5. This was confirmed on August 9, 2010, in a press release from their label, [[Equal Vision Records|Equal Vision]].<ref name="Chiodos To Release New Album October 5th">[http://equalvision.com/news/show/572 Chiodos To Release New Album October 5th] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921231817/http://equalvision.com/news/show/572 |date=September 21, 2010 }}</ref> On January 21, 2011, the Australian version of "Illuminaudio" CD was released with a bonus track, "New Thought Movement".<ref>[http://www.shock.com.au/release/564253/chiodos-illuminaudio/ Shock Entertainment | View Release<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218075638/http://www.shock.com.au/release/564253/chiodos-illuminaudio/ |date=2011-02-18 }}</ref> In 2011 Chiodos toured with [[Skindred]] to promote the Welsh ragga metallers' new album, ''[[Union Black (album)|Union Black]]''. This was followed by four American dates with [[The Color Morale]], [[Close to Home (band)|Close to Home]] and The Air I Breathe and the "[[Scream It Like You Mean It]]" tour 2011, a 39 date American tour which saw the band play directly underneath [[Breathe Carolina]], with [[I See Stars]], The Color Morale, MOD SUN and The Air I Breathe also on the bill.

===Second line-up change (2012–2013)===

On September 11, 2013, the band entered Dreamland Studio in Woodstock, NY with producer [[David Bottrill]], vocalist Craig Owens commented on the production of the new album, "We're excited to be working with Dave Bottrill on this new Chiodos record. So for the next two months, we'll be hiding out in the woods of upstate NY, in a hollowed out Church turned studio".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/21104/Chiodos-begins-recording-new-album|title=Chiodos begins recording new album|date=September 11, 2013|website=lambgoat.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>

On September 25, 2013, [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] released in an interview with Bradley Bell on what to expect on the new album. In the interview Bradley has stated that the album would be "...touching back toward the Bone Palace roots, but Thomas kind of brings us an All’s Well That Ends Well vibe with his playing. And then, there’s a new frontier that we’re exploring, as well." Bradley also mentioned how the band had been working outside of their comfort zone, with vocalist Craig Owens "...challenging himself on this record to sing in different ways. He’s been working on using his actual falsetto a lot instead of screaming his high notes just to bring it to a new dimension. He’s even singing lower on a lot of stuff than he has in the past."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/its_more_about_helping_other_people_out_than_yourself._brad_bell_on_the_nex/P1|title=“It’s more about helping other people out than yourself.” Brad Bell on the next phase of Chiodos|work=Alternative Press|access-date=2013-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144111/http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/its_more_about_helping_other_people_out_than_yourself._brad_bell_on_the_nex/P1|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On November 1, 2016 in an interview with Billboard, vocalist Craig Owens stated in regards to Chiodos that, "It's done, it just couldn't stay afloat. There were just kind of, not necessarily bad vibes, but we came to the realization that we can't do it full-time. I think it just stopped becoming a passion for most of us so we said, 'Alright, let's stop.'" This brought an end to Chiodos' fifteen-year career. Owens is now performing under the stage moniker badXchannels and is touring in support of his new solo album "WHYDFML" (what have you done for me lately).<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7564584/craig-owens-bxc-one-car-funeral-premiere Craig Owens Leaves Chiodos Behind, Previews New Sound With BXC's 'One Car Funeral': Exclusive Premiere]</ref>
