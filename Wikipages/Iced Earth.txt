'''Iced Earth''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] and currently based in [[Columbus, Indiana]]. They were formed in 1984 under the name the Rose, then Purgatory,<ref name="Bio">{{Cite web |title=Iced Earth's Bio &#124; The Official Iced Earth Website |url=http://www.icedearth.com/band-0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904114226/http://www.icedearth.com/band-0 |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |access-date=November 18, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> by guitarist and main songwriter [[Jon Schaffer]] and original drummer Greg Seymour. Iced Earth released their [[Iced Earth (album)|debut album]] in 1990 and have since released twelve [[studio album]]s, four [[Extended play|EP]]s, three [[Compilation album|compilation]]s, three [[box set]]s, three [[live albums]] and eleven [[music videos]].
	
After releasing the demo EP ''Enter the Realm'' (1989) and signing to [[Century Media Records]], the band released two full-length studio albums – ''[[Iced Earth (album)|Iced Earth]]'' (1990) and ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'' (1991) – before taking a two-year hiatus from 1992 to 1994,<ref name="Burnt">{{Cite web |title=''Burnt Offerings'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/burnt-offerings |access-date=November 18, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> after which the band returned with new lead vocalist [[Matt Barlow]]. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with him in over half a decade: ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1995), ''[[The Dark Saga]]'' (1996), ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Iced Earth album)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' (1998) and ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]'' (2001).

After ''Horror Show'', Barlow quit the band and joined the [[Police officer|police force]],<ref name="Barlow bio">{{Cite web |title=Matt Barlow's bio. |url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/membre_groupe/membre_groupe-nom-Matt_Barlow-id-12911-l-en.html |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=Spirit of Metal}}</ref> while Iced Earth continued on with [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]], formerly of [[Judas Priest]], on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums (2004's ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'' and 2007's ''[[Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1|Framing Armageddon]]''). In late 2007, Barlow rejoined the band,<ref name="Barlow rejoins">{{Cite web |title=Matt Barlow rejoins Iced Earth. |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234913/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |access-date=November 26, 2011 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> and they recorded one more album with him: ''[[The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2|The Crucible of Man]]'' (2008).

Before arriving at their current lineup, Iced Earth has had numerous line-up changes, with founder Jon Schaffer as the only founding member remaining. As of 2021, there have been over thirty musicians in and out of Iced Earth since its formation in 1984.

The band is composed solely of Schaffer and drummer Brent Smedley, with all other band members having departed following Schaffer's January 2021 arrest by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for his involvement in the [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|Capitol riots]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |date=February 15, 2021 |title=ICED EARTH Singer STU BLOCK And Bassist LUKE APPLETON Have Officially Quit The Band |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iced-earth-singer-stu-block-and-bassist-luke-appleton-have-officially-quit-band/ |access-date=February 15, 2021 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web |date=15 February 2021 |title=ICED EARTH Guitarist JAKE DREYER Distances Himself From Band, Says He Is Focusing Solely On WITHERFALL |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iced-earth-guitarist-jake-dreyer-distances-himself-from-band-says-he-is-focusing-solely-on-witherfall/ |access-date=16 February 2021 |website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> Schaffer is in FBI custody on felony charges, which has generated new publicity for Iced Earth and has resulted in the band being dropped from their longtime label Century Media.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=January 19, 2021 |title=Iced Earth's Stu Block Issues New Statement on Jon Schaffer's Capitol Riot Involvement |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/9513008/iced-earth-jon-schaffer-arrested-capitol-riot |access-date=January 20, 2021 |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Huang |first=Binghui| last2=Martin |first2=Ryan |last3=Evans |first3=Tim |date=January 19, 2021 |title=Iced Earth guitarist Jon Schaffer arrested by FBI for involvement in Capitol riot |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/iced-earth-guitarist-jon-schaffer-225701958.html |access-date=January 20, 2021 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}</ref><ref name="IE century media">{{Cite web |last=Hartmann |first=Graham |date=January 19, 2021 |title=Iced Earth's Stu Block Issues New Statement on Jon Schaffer's Capitol Riot Involvement |url=https://loudwire.com/iced-earth-demons-wizards-removed-century-media-online-roster/ |access-date=January 20, 2021 |publisher=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years (1984–1989)===

The central figure of Iced Earth is, and has been, guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]], who formed the band on January 20, 1985,<ref name="Iranian">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer answers questions from Iranian fans. |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3yL0xFxtsg&list=FLOb0w15YR6aG-n_TxKIZg9Q&index=2&feature=plpp_video |access-date=February 9, 2011 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Schaffer's original vision for the band started under the moniker "The Rose" in 1984.<ref name="Bio" />

[[File:JonSchaffer2010.2.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]], who founded the band in 1984, is the only remaining original member of Iced Earth.]]

The group was very short-lived, after which Schaffer formed a band called Purgatory, which would eventually change its name to Iced Earth.<ref name="Bio" /> Line-up changes were common within the band, with Schaffer staying as the only constant member. The group recorded a demo in 1985, titled ''Psychotic Dreams''.<ref name="Bio" /> In 1988, Purgatory changed its name to Iced Earth.<ref name="Bio" /> According to Schaffer, a friend of his, who died in a motorcycle accident prior to Schaffer moving to Florida<ref name="Bio" /> was responsible for the name.<ref name="FaceCulture">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer Interviewed by FaceCulture. |url=http://www.faceculture.tv/index.php?cnti_key=11749157 |access-date=November 18, 2011 |publisher=Faceculture.com}}</ref> In 1989, Iced Earth recorded another demo called ''Enter the Realm'', with the line-up of [[Gene Adam]] on vocals, Randall Shawver on lead guitar, [[Dave Abell]] on bass, Greg Seymour on drums and Schaffer on rhythm guitar and vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |title=''Enter the Realm'' |url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=3181346 |access-date=October 14, 2013 |publisher=[[Discogs]]}}</ref> All of the songs on ''Enter the Realm'' would later appear on the band's debut album, with the exception of "Nightmares" and the title track.

=== Self-titled debut album and ''Night of the Stormrider'' (1990–1993) ===

After getting signed to [[Century Media Records]], the band, now with Mike McGill on drums, started work on their debut album. Recorded at [[Morrisound Recording]], with Tom Morris and Schaffer as producers,<ref name="Iced">{{Cite web |title=''Iced Earth'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/iced-earth |access-date=November 18, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> ''[[Iced Earth (album)|Iced Earth]]'' was released in November 1990 in Europe and on February 25, 1991 in the US. Following the album's release, Iced Earth toured across Europe with [[Blind Guardian]].<ref name="Interview ">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer and Matt Barlow Interviewed in 1996. |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NkwHEXeLc |access-date=June 15, 2012 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref name="MetalReviews">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer interviewed by MetalReviews. |url=http://www.metalreviews.com/interviews/icedearth/interview.htm |access-date=September 2, 2012 |publisher=MetalReviews}}</ref>

Following their self-titled debut, Iced Earth quickly began work on their second album. Prior to the recording process, singer Gene Adam was let go from the band after he refused to take singing lessons. Adam was subsequently replaced by John Greely, as was drummer McGill by Richey Secchiari.<ref name="Night">{{Cite web |title=''Night of the Stormrider'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/night-of-the-stormrider |access-date=November 18, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> The album, entitled ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'', was again recorded at Morrisound Recording, with Schaffer and Morris as producers. The album was released on November 11, 1991, in Europe, but in the US, the album's release was delayed until April 1992, so it wouldn't compete with the group's debut album. Following ''Night of the Stormrider's'' release, Iced Earth again toured Europe with Blind Guardian.<ref name="Interview " /><ref name="MetalReviews" />

===''Burnt Offerings'' and ''The Dark Saga'' (1994–1997)===

Following the supporting tour for ''Night of the Stormrider'', Iced Earth entered a two-year hiatus from 1992 to 1994.<ref name="Burnt" /> During this downtime, the band was faced with issues that almost resulted in them breaking up,<ref name="Burnt" /><ref name="Interview 1996">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer interview from 1996. |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFKqARuxmSA |access-date=November 19, 2011 |publisher=[[YouTube|Youtube.com]]}}</ref> but eventually Iced Earth resurfaced with ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]''.<ref name="Burnt" /> Heralded as Iced Earth's heaviest album,<ref name="Burnt" /> ''Burnt Offerings'' was released on April 14, 1995,<ref name="Amazon">{{Cite web |title=''Burnt Offerings'' at Amazon.com |url=http://www.icedearth.com/home/iced-earth-re-records-epic-%E2%80%9Cdante%E2%80%99s-inferno%E2%80%9D-gives-it-away-free |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523110336/http://www.icedearth.com/home/iced-earth-re-records-epic-%E2%80%9Cdante%E2%80%99s-inferno%E2%80%9D-gives-it-away-free |archive-date=May 23, 2012 |access-date=June 13, 2012 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}</ref> and was the band's first album to feature drummer Rodney Beasley and vocalist [[Matt Barlow|Matthew Barlow]].
[[File:MattBarlow2010.jpg|thumb|[[Matt Barlow]] joined the band for 1995's ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]''. He would record three more albums with Iced Earth before his first departure from the band in 2003.]]

In January 1996, Iced Earth began recording their fourth studio album, this time with Tom Morris' brother Jim Morris acting as co-producer, along with Schaffer.<ref name="Dark">{{Cite web |title=''The Dark Saga'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-dark-saga |access-date=November 19, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> The album was also the first to feature drummer Mark Prator, and the last to feature longtime bassist Dave Abell, who left the group after finishing recording. Although Abell was credited for playing on the album, bassist Keith Menser appears on the back cover, because Century Media demanded the touring line-up to appear on the cover. Menser was fired after he didn't learn any of the band's songs for the tour, so he was soon replaced by [[James MacDonough]]. Mark Prator was also let go from the band, and was subsequently replaced by [[Brent Smedley]]. Released on May 23, 1996, ''[[The Dark Saga]]'' was a concept album based on the comic book character [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]].<ref name="Dark" /> Musically the album was much more melodic and simplified compared to previous Iced Earth albums.<ref name="Dark" /> For the supporting tour, Iced Earth was joined by [[Nevermore]].<ref name="Interview " />

On April 21, 1997, Iced Earth released their first compilation album: ''[[Days of Purgatory]]''. The album featured songs from their first two albums, as well as the ''Enter the Realm'' demo, resung by Matt Barlow, with new drums and bass on some tracks as well. The album also featured a few songs from ''Burnt Offerings'', remixed and remastered.

===''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' and ''Alive in Athens'' (1998–1999)===

In March 1998, work began on the band's fifth studio album, with Jim Morris returning as the producer.<ref name="Something">{{Cite web |title=''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/something-wicked-this-way-comes |access-date=November 20, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> Prior to the recording process, long-time guitarist Randall Shawver left the group. Guitarist [[Larry Tarnowski]] handled lead guitar duties on the album, but wasn't credited as a full-time member of the band, but as a [[session musician]]. Brent Smedley was also unable to play on the album, due to personal reasons,<ref name="Metal Rules">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer interviewed by Metal Rules. |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Jon_Schaffer.htm |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=[[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> and was temporarily replaced by Mark Prator, whom Smedley had originally replaced in 1996. Released on June 17, 1998, ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Iced Earth album)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' was notable for featuring the debut of  Schaffer's Something Wicked Saga,<ref name="Something" /> which he would expand upon on future albums. While on the supporting tour for ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' (with Brent Smedley back on drums), the band recorded their first [[live album]] in [[Athens]], Greece on January 23 and 24, 1999.<ref name="Alive">{{Cite web |title=''Alive in Athens'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/alive-in-athens |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> Entitled ''[[Alive in Athens]]'', the three CD set was recorded in front of a sold-out audience (both nights) at the Rodon Club.<ref name="Alive" /> The album was released on July 19, 1999.

Also in 1999, the band released ''The Melancholy E.P.''. Originally conceived as a radio-only single, the EP contained three previously released songs ("Melancholy (Holy Martyr)", "Watching Over Me" and "I Died for You"), as well as two new ones ([[cover version]]s of [[Bad Company]]'s "[[Shooting Star (Bad Company song)|Shooting Star]]" and [[Black Sabbath]]'s "Electric Funeral").<ref name="Melancholy">{{Cite web |title=''The Melancholy EP'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-melancholy-ep |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> However, Century Media Records did not end-up releasing the EP, so it was made available for fans as a limited 1500-copy special release.<ref name="Melancholy" />

===''Horror Show''  and ''The Glorious Burden'' (2000–2004)===
In 2000, work began on Iced Earth's sixth studio album. Entitled ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]'', the album contained songs based on [[horror film]]s and [[Horror literature|literature]], such as ''[[Dracula]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and the ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]]''.<ref name="Horror">{{Cite web |title=''Horror Show'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/horror-show |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> Released on June 26, 2001, the album was the band's first to feature drummer [[Richard Christy]], and the third with guitarist Larry Tarnowski (now a full-time member). Originally [[Steve Di Giorgio|Steve di Giorgio]] played bass on the album, but left the group after the recording process.<ref name="MetalWorks">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer interviewed by MetalWorks. |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfxw0UknukI |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=[[YouTube|Youtube.com]]}}</ref> According to Schaffer, Di Giorgio was required and agreed to go on tour, but left due to "prior commitments".<ref name="Metal Temple">{{Cite web |title=Jon Schaffer interviewed by Metal Temole. |url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/jon_schaffer_iced_2.htm |access-date=November 26, 2011 |publisher=Metal Temple}}</ref> He was replaced by James MacDonough. ''Horror Show'' was also the first Iced Earth album to be partially recorded at Schaffer's home studio "Schaffer Sound".<ref name="Horror" />

On November 26, 2001 (March 5, 2002 in America) the band released the [[boxset]] ''[[Dark Genesis]]'', which featured the band's first three albums plus the ''Enter the Realm'' -demo, remastered and remixed with new cover art.<ref name="Genesis">{{Cite web |title=''Dark Genesis'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/dark-genesis |access-date=November 21, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> The set also featured a new album, entitled ''[[Tribute to the Gods]]''. It was Iced Earth's seventh studio album, featuring songs from such bands as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Blue Öyster Cult]].

After the events of [[9/11]], Matt Barlow came to the conclusion that he wanted to start contributing to the "real world".<ref name="Barlow bio" /> Barlow approached Schaffer with this in late 2002, but Schaffer convinced Barlow to stay with the band. When Iced Earth began recording their next studio album, Schaffer realized that Barlow's vocals were not what he desired; he felt that they lacked passion and quality, so he decided to let Barlow go after all.<ref name="Barlow bio" /> Barlow became a police officer in the Georgetown Police Dept. in [[Georgetown, Delaware]].<ref name="Barlow bio" />

After Barlow's departure, Iced Earth continued work on their next album, and eventually Schaffer got [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]], from Judas Priest, to sing on the record as a favor.<ref name="Ripper interview">{{Cite web |title=Tim "Ripper" Owens interviewed by Metal Rules. |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/IcedEarth-Ripper-Jan2004.htm |access-date=November 22, 2011 |publisher=[[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> Owens, who was still in Judas Priest at the time, was originally supposed to be credited as a guest musician, but after singer [[Rob Halford]] rejoined Judas Priest, Owens joined Iced Earth full-time.<ref name="Ripper interview" /> Prior to the recording process, Tarnowski was let go from the band, so the lead guitar parts on the album were played by producer Jim Morris and session guitarist [[Ralph Santolla]].

Prior to the album's release, Iced Earth released ''[[The Reckoning (Iced Earth song)|The Reckoning]]''.<ref name="Reckoning">{{Cite web |title=''The Reckoning'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-reckoning |access-date=November 22, 2011 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> The single contained four songs off the new album, that the band felt were most likely to get radio airplay.<ref name="Reckoning" /> ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'' was released on January 12, 2004, in Europe and on January 13, in the United States. Much like how ''Horror Show'' was based on horror films and literature, ''The Glorious Burden'' was inspired by historical events.<ref name="Glorious">{{Cite web |title=''The Glorious Burden'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-glorious-burden |access-date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> It was also the band's first album with their new record company [[SPV GmbH|SPV]].

After ''The Glorious Burden'', work began on the group's next album, which would be an expanded [[concept album]] on the "Something Wicked" storyline from ''Something Wicked This Way Comes''.

===Planned thirteenth studio album, Schaffer's arrest, and lineup changes (2020–present)===
In a Facebook Live chat that took place on April 14, 2020, Schaffer confirmed that, after "a little bit of time off", Iced Earth would start working on their thirteenth studio album for a spring 2021 release. He stated: "Everything is a little bit up in the air right now. Even working on a new Iced Earth album is gonna be challenging until we see how all this plays out, because it's an international band. [[Stu Block|Stu]]'s in Canada and Luke is in the U.K., so that makes it even more difficult for travel…the biggest issue now is logistics of actually getting together to do it, because we're an international band. If we lived in the same town or even in the same country, it would make things a lot easier. But we will [get around to making a new album], and there will be a time for that, no doubt. To say when that's gonna be, my plan was to focus on it in the back half of this year and have a release in spring of 2021.

On the group's 1990 [[Iced Earth (album)|self-titled debut album]], the band's sound was characterized by time changes, acoustic passages and [[Iron Maiden]]-type galloping rhythms.<ref name="Iced" /> Many of these elements carried over to the follow-up album ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'', which added [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[piano]], as well as some [[Choir|choral]] arrangements.<ref name="Night" /> 1995's ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]'' has been heralded as Iced Earth's heaviest album, and included the band's longest song to date, "[[Dante's Inferno (song)|Dante's Inferno]]".<ref name="Burnt" /> As a counter measure to ''Burnt Offerings'', 1996's ''[[The Dark Saga]]'' featured a much more subdued sound compared to previous releases.<ref name="Dark" /> The focus was less on technical musicianship, but on emotion and melody.<ref name="Dark" /> ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Iced Earth album)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' combined elements found on previous albums with brand new ideas.<ref name="Something" /> The "Something Wicked Trilogy", which closes the album, took many cues from the ''Night of the Stormrider'' album.<ref name="Something" /> Iced Earth continued to expand their sound throughout the 2000s, like adding a full-piece orchestra to the song "Gettysburg" from 2004's ''[[The Glorious Burden]]''.<ref name="Glorious" />

Common lyrical themes in Iced Earth's music have been religion,<ref name="Burnt" /><ref name="Night" /> history, fantasy,<ref name="Glorious" /> literature,<ref name="Burnt" /><ref name="Dark" /><ref name="Horror" /><ref name="IE Dystopia" /> and films.<ref name="Horror" /><ref name="IE Dystopia" /> The band has also released several [[concept album]]s, the first being 1991's ''Night of the Stormrider''.<ref name="Night" /> The second, 1996's ''The Dark Saga'', was based on the [[Todd McFarlane]] comic book character [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]].<ref name="Dark" /> 1998's ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' introduced the Something Wicked Saga,<ref name="Something" /> which was later expanded upon on 2007's ''[[Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1]]'',<ref name="IE Framing">{{Cite web |title=''Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/framing-armageddon |access-date=March 23, 2013 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> and 2008's ''[[The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2]]''.<ref name="IE Crucible">{{Cite web |title=''The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-crucible-of-man-%E2%80%93-something-wicked-part-ii |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012504/http://www.icedearth.com/discography/the-crucible-of-man-%E2%80%93-something-wicked-part-ii |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2013 |publisher=Icedearth.com}}</ref> Iced Earth have also released several albums written around a theme. 2001's ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]'' was largely based on horror literature and films,<ref name="Horror" /> 2004's ''The Glorious Burden'' was inspired by history and war,<ref name="Glorious" /> while 2011's ''[[Dystopia (Iced Earth album)|Dystopia]]'' centered around dystopian themes in literature and film.<ref name="IE Dystopia">{{Cite web |title=''Dystopia'' |url=http://www.icedearth.com/discography/dystopia-0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302111758/http://www.icedearth.com/discography/dystopia-0 |archive-date=March 2, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2013 |website=Iced Earth}}</ref>
