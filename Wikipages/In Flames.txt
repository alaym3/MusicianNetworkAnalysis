'''In Flames''' is a Swedish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, formed by guitarist [[Jesper Strömblad]] in [[Gothenburg]] in 1990. Alongside [[At the Gates]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]], In Flames pioneered the genres known as [[Swedish death metal]] and [[melodic death metal]].

During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many [[Session musician|session musicians]]. By the release of ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]'' (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to [[alternative metal]]. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/14997.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141741/http://www.livedaily.com/news/14997.html|archive-date=16 December 2008|title=In Flames finds 'A Sense of Purpose' in North America|last=Kilgore|first=Kym|date=6 October 2008|publisher=[[LiveDaily]]|access-date=26 April 2009}}</ref>

Since the band's inception, In Flames have released thirteen [[studio album]]s, three [[Extended play|EPs]], and two live DVDs, their latest release being their thirteenth studio album ''[[I, the Mask]]'' in 2019. In Flames has been nominated for three [[Grammis Awards]]. They won two of these nominations; one for ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'' (2004) in the "Hard Rock/Metal of the Year" category, and one nomination for their following album ''[[Come Clarity]]'' (2006) in the same category.

===Founding and ''Lunar Strain''===
In Flames was founded in 1990 by [[Jesper Strömblad]] as a [[side project]] from his then-current [[death metal]] band, [[Ceremonial Oath]].<ref name="IFB">{{cite web|url=http://www.inflames.com/biography/default.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207092033/http://www.inflames.com/biography/default.asp|archive-date=7 February 2008|title=In Flames Biography|access-date=1 June 2016|date=30 March 2004|publisher=In Flames}}</ref><ref name="MR"/> His purpose was to write songs with a more melodic musical direction, something which he was not allowed to do in Ceremonial Oath.<ref name="MR"/><ref name="Enslain"/> In 1993, Strömblad decided to quit Ceremonial Oath due to these musical differences and began focusing more on In Flames.<ref name="MR"/><ref name="Enslain"/> That same year, Strömblad recruited [[Glenn Ljungström]] on guitar and [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] on [[bass guitar]] to form the first official In Flames line-up.<ref name="Enslain"/>

The trio recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] in August 1993 and sent it to [[Wrong Again Records]]. In order to increase their chances of getting signed to the label, the group lied and said they had thirteen songs already recorded, when in fact they only had three.<ref name="LM" /> The owner of the label enjoyed the music, and immediately signed them to the label.<ref name="IFB" />

After being signed, work on the band's debut album began. The album, titled ''[[Lunar Strain]]'', was recorded in [[Studio Fredman]] and released in August 1994.<ref name="sharpe-young">{{cite book|last1=Sharpe-Young|first1=Gary|title=Metal: The Definitive Guide|date=2007|publisher=Jawborne Press|location=London, England|isbn=9781906002015|pages=378–379}}</ref> Since the band did not have a vocalist yet, Strömblad asked [[Mikael Stanne]] of [[Dark Tranquillity]] to provide [[session musician|session vocals]].<ref name="sharpe-young" /> Many other session musicians participated in the recording as well, including guitarists Anders Iwers, Carl Näslund, and [[Oscar Dronjak]] (the latter of which provided backing vocals), vocalist Jennica Johansson, and violinist Ylva Wåhlstedt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists :: In Flames|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/gothenburg/in+flames|website=MusicMight|access-date=2 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193840/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/gothenburg/in+flames|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>

===''Subterranean''===
[[File:In Flames - 2017153171030 2017-06-02 Rock am Ring - Sven - 1D X II - 1004 - AK8I6946.jpg|thumb|Guitarist [[Björn Gelotte]] at Rock am Ring 2017]]
During 1994, In Flames recorded and self-produced their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Subterranean (EP)|Subterranean]]'', in Studio Fredman. In Flames still did not have a vocalist yet, so session vocals were provided this time by [[Henke Forss]]. In 1994, the band covered the song "[[Eye of the Beholder (song)|Eye of the Beholder]]" for the [[Metallica]] tribute album ''Metal Militia: A Tribute to Metallica''. In 1995, ''Subterranean'' was released. ''Subterranean'' garnered much attention and led the band to acquire a record deal with [[Nuclear Blast]].<ref name="IFB"/>

===''The Jester Race''===
In 1995, In Flames became tired of using session musicians to record an album or to do live shows, so the trio asked [[Björn Gelotte]] to join the band as the full-time drummer, and 6 months later asked [[Anders Fridén]] to join the band as the full-time vocalist.<ref name="IFB"/><ref name="MR"/><ref name="LM">{{cite web|url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_inflames.html|title=A Moment of 'Clarity' with In Flames|access-date=8 June 2007|date=26 July 2006|publisher=Live-Metal.Net}}</ref> That same year, the new line up recorded the band's second studio album, ''[[The Jester Race]]'' (Released in 1996). This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman, but unlike previous albums, it was co-produced by the studio's owner, [[Fredrik Nordström]]. Gelotte also provided some lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Afterwards, In Flames toured with [[Samael (band)|Samael]], [[Grip Inc.]], and [[Kreator]].<ref name="IFB"/>

===''Whoracle''===
[[File:In Flames - 2017153171418 2017-06-02 Rock am Ring - Sven - 1D X II - 0419 - B70I6338.jpg|thumb|Guitarist [[Niclas Engelin]] at Rock am Ring 2017]]
In 1997, In Flames recorded and released their third studio album, ''[[Whoracle]]''. This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman and co-produced by Nordström. Once again Gelotte provided lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Ljungström and Larsson unexpectedly announced that they were leaving In Flames after the album was recorded.<ref name="IFB"/> [[Niklas Engelin]] and [[Peter Iwers]] were recruited to fill in the vacant spots on guitar and bass respectively, during a tour with [[Dimmu Borgir]].<ref name="IFB"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,4354.sm?id=92 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224210557/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist%2C4354.sm?id=92 |archive-date=24 December 2007 |title=Come Clarity |access-date=8 June 2007 |author=Morgan, Anthony |date=28 June 2006 |publisher=rockdetector.com |url-status=dead}}</ref> After the tour both Engelin and Iwers were asked to join the band as permanent members, to which they agreed. With the new line-up, In Flames then proceeded with a European tour and played their first two shows in Japan.<ref name="IFB"/> However, by the end of that tour in 1998, Engelin quit In Flames, so the band decided to switch Gelotte from his position as drummer to guitarist, and they recruited [[Daniel Svensson]] to take over as drummer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themetalweb.com/inflamesinterview.html|title=Dawn with Daniel Svensson|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Dawn|date=22 September 2002|publisher=The Metal Web|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714032717/http://www.themetalweb.com/inflamesinterview.html|archive-date=14 July 2007}}</ref><ref name="NBN"/>

===''Colony''===
In 1999, the new line-up recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]''. This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman and co-produced by Nordström. The second solo on "Coerced Coexistence" was recorded by [[Kee Marcello]].<ref name=IFOfficial>{{cite web|url=http://www.inflames.com|title=In Flames website|publisher=Inflames.com |access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> Afterwards, In Flames toured Europe, Japan, and played their first show in the United States during the Milwaukee Metal Fest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gryphonmetal.ch/InterviewInFlames.html|title=In Flames: Interview with Björn Gelotte|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Haumschild, Matthew|date=22 September 2002|publisher=Gryphon Metal}}</ref>

===''Clayman'' and ''The Tokyo Showdown''===
In 2000, In Flames recorded and released their fifth studio album, ''[[Clayman]]''. It was recorded in the same studio as their previous releases and again co-produced by Nordström. Afterwards, In Flames toured with [[Dream Theater]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref name="IFB"/> In August 2001, In Flames released ''[[The Tokyo Showdown]]'', a live album recorded during the Japanese tour in November 2000.

===''Reroute to Remain''===
In 2002, In Flames recorded and released their sixth studio album, ''[[Reroute to Remain]]''. Unlike all of In Flames' previous albums, ''Reroute to Remain'' was not recorded in [[Studio Fredman]] or produced by Nordström. The album was produced by [[Daniel Bergstrand]] and recorded in a house the band rented in Denmark, except for the drums which were recorded at Dug-Out studio. ''Reroute to Remain'' represented a major stylistic shift for In Flames music, in the addition of clean vocals, catchier choruses and less growling. It was also their first album to have official singles released from it. That year the band toured with [[Slayer]], [[Soulfly]], and [[Mudvayne]].<ref name="IFB"/>

===''Soundtrack to Your Escape''===
In 2003, In Flames recorded their seventh studio album, ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'', and released it in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middletownjournal.com/features/content/shared/oh/go/music/hjn0805goINFLAMES.html|title=In Flames rocks Bogart's|access-date=3 March 2009|last=Jones|first=Richard O.|date=5 August 2005|publisher=Middletown Journal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090935/http://www.middletownjournal.com/features/content/shared/oh/go/music/hjn0805goINFLAMES.html|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> Like with ''Reroute to Remain'', the majority of the album was recorded in a house that the band rented in Denmark, with the drums recorded in Dug-Out Studio. This album was also produced by Bergstrand. ''Soundtrack to Your Escape'' increased the band's popularity considerably, selling 100,000 copies in the United States and yielding a No.&nbsp;2 single on the Swedish charts with ''The Quiet Place''.<ref name="Swedish Singles Charts: In Flames">{{cite web | url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/search.asp?search=In+Flames&cat=s | work=swedishcharts.com | title=Swedish Singles Charts: In Flames | access-date=24 July 2008}}</ref> Four music videos were filmed: "The Quiet Place", "My Sweet Shadow", "F(r)iend" and "A Touch of Red", all of which were directed by [[Patric Ullaeus]]. The ensuing world tour saw the band make their first trip to Australia, where they played to mostly sold-out crowds. Afterward, In Flames toured with [[Judas Priest]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[Motörhead]].<ref name="NBN"/> In Flames was also featured on the main stage at [[Ozzfest|Ozzfest 2005]].

===''Come Clarity''===
In 2005, In Flames recorded and self-produced their eighth studio album, ''[[Come Clarity]]'', in Dug-Out studio. That same year, In Flames released ''[[Used and Abused: In Live We Trust]]'', a [[box set]] consisting of material filmed and recorded throughout various live performances during 2004. The DVD was filmed, edited and directed by Ullaeus. Also in 2005, In Flames decided to sign with an additional record label, [[Ferret Music]], so future releases could have better distribution in [[North America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-888_in_flames.aspx|title=Moments of Clarity|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Smit, Jackie|date=9 January 2006|publisher=Chronicles of Chaos}}</ref> In 2006, ''Come Clarity'' was released in North America through Ferret Music and elsewhere through Nuclear Blast. It became the band's first No.&nbsp;1 album on the Swedish charts. A bonus DVD of In Flames playing all the songs in a rehearsal studio was also released. Ullaeus directed their music video for "Take This Life". That same year, In Flames toured with [[Sepultura]], co-headlined a U.S. tour with [[Lacuna Coil]], joined [[The Unholy Alliance (tour)|The Unholy Alliance Tour]], was one of the headliners on the [[Sounds of the Underground]] tour, and played on the main stage at [[Download Festival]].<ref name="NBN"/> In 2007, the band played in [[Dubai]] for the annual [[Dubai Desert Rock Festival]].

In early 2016, In Flames began recording a new album in Los Angeles, and finished the recording in April.<ref>{{cite web|title=IN FLAMES Drummer DANIEL SVENSSON Quits Band To Focus On Family Life|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/in-flames-drummer-daniel-svensson-quits-band-to-focus-on-family-life/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=7 November 2015|access-date=14 November 2015}}</ref>

On 25 August 2016, In Flames posted a [[YouTube]] link to a new song entitled "The End" along with a new profile picture with the In Flames logo accompanied by the word "Battles". It was later revealed the same day that ''[[Battles (album)|Battles]]'' will be the title of their twelfth studio album, and was released worldwide on 11 November 2016 through [[Nuclear Blast]].

On 17 September 2016 the band announced on their Facebook page that [[Joe Rickard]], formerly of American rock band [[Red (band)|RED]], who performed session drums on [[Battles (album)|Battles]] is now the new permanent drummer, replacing [[Daniel Svensson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IN FLAMES Announces New Drummer|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/in-flames-announces-new-drummer/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=17 September 2016|access-date=17 September 2016}}</ref>

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
In Flames, along with [[Dark Tranquillity]] and [[At the Gates]], pioneered what is now known as [[melodic death metal]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Swedish Death Metal |last=Ekeroth |first=Daniel |page=268 |publisher=Bazillion Point Books |year=2008 |isbn=9780979616310 }}</ref><ref name=TeamRock /><ref name=Biography>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/in-flames-mn0000096977/biography |title=In Flames {{!}} Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |last=DaRonco |first=Mike |access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> The founding members of all three bands all lived in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden and they were all friends who shared the same musical interests.<ref name="MR"/> Eventually, the group of friends branched off into three bands with the same musical direction: In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and At the Gates.

[[Jesper Strömblad]] formed In Flames to write music that combined the melodic guitar style of [[Iron Maiden]] with the brutality of [[death metal]], something which he stated he had never heard any band do.<ref name="Enslain">{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/enslain/interviews/inflames.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021226105039/http://members.aol.com/enslain/interviews/inflames.html|archive-date=26 December 2002|title=Interview with Jesper Strömblad|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Lady Enslain|year=1999|publisher=Enslain}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewflames.html|title=Interview with Jesper Strömblad|access-date=8 June 2007|author=German, Eric|author2=Schumacher, Rick|date=19 November 1999|publisher=Metal Update}}</ref> In writing songs, Strömblad also decided to make use of [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], something which was (at the time) uncommon in death metal. Ever since In Flames' debut studio album, ''[[Lunar Strain]]'', the band has made use of keyboards. However, despite their sometimes heavy use of keyboards in their music, they still refuse to recruit a full-time keyboardist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=14902|title=Interview with In Flames|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Dusedau, Zack|date=8 August 2005|publisher=metalunderground.com}}</ref><ref name="MI"/>

In Flames' musical style is characterized by the constant use of [[harmonization|harmonized]] [[lead guitar]] melodies and screaming-style singing along with [[death growl]]. In early albums such as ''[[The Jester Race]]'', In Flames would often employ two harmonized lead guitars playing over a [[rhythm guitar]]. However, since the band only has two guitar players, they found it hard to reproduce those songs during live performances and ever since ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' they have focused on writing songs with the intention of playing them live. On the album ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'', the band focused on less guitar melodies, giving place for more synths. However, this has not been continued on the later albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/inflames3.html|title=In Flames Interview|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Kasparek, Alexa|date=18 February 2004|publisher=Tartarean Desire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623090948/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/inflames3.html|archive-date=23 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=158|title=Interview – In Flames|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Powell, Brett|year=2006|publisher=Skratch Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610011101/http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=158|archive-date=10 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcovenant.com/pages/interviews/interview_in_flames.htm|title=Daniel Svensson - In Flames|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Lundqvist, Niklas|date=21 November 2006|publisher=Metal Covenant}}</ref>

In Flames' vocal style is characterized by the use of [[death growl|growled vocals]] or [[scream (music)|screamed vocals]] complemented at times by [[clean vocals]]. On more recent albums such as ''[[Come Clarity]]'', the band makes more prominent use of clean vocals, especially during [[refrain|choruses]]. In Flames' lyrics have also varied during their career. In early albums such as ''The Jester Race'' and ''[[Whoracle]]'', In Flames' lyrics focused on [[astrology]], [[human|mankind]], and other global themes.<ref name="MR"/><ref name="MP"/> On later albums such as ''Soundtrack to Your Escape'' and ''Come Clarity'', In Flames' lyrics focus more on personal issues, thoughts, and other introspective themes.<ref name="MR">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalreview.com/viewinterview.aspx?ID=30094|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210164908/http://www.metalreview.com/viewinterview.aspx?ID=30094|archive-date=10 December 2005|title=Anders Fridén of In Flames|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Rennick, Patrick|date=2 August 2005|publisher=Metal Review}}</ref><ref name="MI">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-invader.com/interviews_69.html|title=In Flames - Dialogue with the Stars|access-date=8 June 2007|author=Sultatos, Alexander|date=24 February 2004|publisher=Metal Invader|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230316/http://www.metal-invader.com/interviews_69.html|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="MP">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalpigeon.com/interview.php?id=27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021181538/http://www.metalpigeon.com/interview.php?id=27|archive-date=21 October 2006|title=In Flames Interview|access-date=8 June 2007|date=17 July 2006|publisher=Metal Pigeon}}</ref>

Since ''Reroute to Remain'' was released in 2002, In Flames' fan-base has been split because of the gradual change in style towards a more [[alternative metal]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=14902|title=Interview with In Flames|publisher=Metalunderground.com|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> The stylistic changes include screamed and clean vocals, as opposed to the death growl on the early records, more prominent rhythm section and less guitar melodies and solos, more obvious use of synthesizers and electronics, and a clear influence from modern American metal, especially in the uplifting chorus melodies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthias Sheaks |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reroute-to-remain-mw0000221920 |title=Reroute to Remain - In Flames &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=3 September 2002 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> This later style has been mostly described as alternative metal.<ref name=TeamRock>{{cite web |url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-11-05/in-flames-anders-fridens-guide-to-life |title=In Flames: Anders Fridén's Guide To Life |work=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=5 November 2016 |access-date=2 October 2017 |last=Patterson |first=Dayal}}</ref><ref name="hindu1">{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/01/01/stories/2009010150650200.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623174140/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/01/01/stories/2009010150650200.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=23 June 2011 | location=Chennai, India | work=[[The Hindu]] | title=It is time to rock on | date=1 January 2009}}</ref> Since ''Siren Charms'' and more recently their latest studio album ''Battles'', they have more extensively used clean vocals as opposed to screams and growls and have played a softer overall sound, putting more emphasis on a melodic alternative metal direction.

However, some very mild elements of this style can still sometimes be heard in their music.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Fridén's clean singing style has altered drastically as it is now more prominent and he has taken on a higher-pitched vocal range. In Flames has also been described as [[metalcore]], with [[AllMusic]] calling the band one of the pioneers of metalcore along with calling In Flames one of the pioneers of melodic death metal.<ref name="Biography" />

===Jester Head mascot===
When In Flames were recording their second studio album, ''[[The Jester Race]]'', [[Anders Fridén]] and [[Niklas Sundin]] came up with an idea to create a [[symbol]]/[[mascot]] for In Flames.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundrymusic.com/bands/displayinterview.cfm/id/136/page/show_interview_number_136.html|title=Interview with In Flames singer Anders Fridén|access-date=8 June 2007|date=11 September 2005|publisher=foundrymusic.com}}</ref> The result was the Jester Head.
