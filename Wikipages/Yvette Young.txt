She began taking piano lessons at the age of four, and violin lessons at the age of seven. She graduated from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]<ref name="xpress">{{cite web|last1=Salvatin|first1=Lorisa|title=The Sound of Odd Numbers: Yvette Young|url=http://xpress.sfsu.edu/xpressmagazine/2015/01/30/the-sound-of-odd-numbers-yvette-young/|publisher=XPRESS Magazine|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> and began her career by posting videos of herself playing music in 2009.<ref name="metroactive">{{cite web|last1=Carnes|first1=Aaron|title=Guitarist, Yvette Young, Leads Math Rock Band, Covet, With Piano-Like Finger-Tapping|url=http://activate.metroactive.com/2014/12/guitarist-yvette-young-leads-math-rock-band-covet-with-piano-inspired-finger-tapping-technique/|publisher=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> In 2014, Young released an EP titled ''Acoustics EP''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicbrainz.org/release-group/e25e0af7-3116-4e6d-b068-24b8dc0fb6b9|title=Release group "Acoustics EP" by Yvette Young - MusicBrainz|website=musicbrainz.org|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref><ref name="theaureview">{{cite web|last1=Glob|first1=Cletus|title=ALBUM REVIEW: YVETTE YOUNG - ACOUSTICS (2014 EP)|url=http://www.theaureview.com/albums/yvette-young-acoustics-2014-ep|publisher=The AU Review|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> and further expanded her discography with the release of a split EP with Natalie Evans in 2015.<ref name="circuitsweet">{{cite web|last1=Frosh|first1=Joel|title=LITTLE L RECORDS INTRODUCES NATALIE EVANS|date=2 November 2015|url=http://circuitsweet.co.uk/2015/11/little-l-records-introduces-natalie-evans/|publisher=Circuit Sweet|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> In June 2017, Young released a second EP entitled ''Acoustics EP 2''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yvetteyoung.bandcamp.com/album/acoustics-ep-2|title=Acoustics EP 2, by yvette young|website=yvette young}}</ref>

Young used her background in piano to use polyphony on a guitar. She taught herself guitar, playing by ear she notes, "I write with my ear, so I’m not really in a box in terms of chord shapes. And I don’t use [traditional] shapes at all, which freaks a lot of people out! I have a million different tunings I work in too so I didn’t really put in the time to learn every shape in every tuning, that would be ridiculous."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=November 2019|first=Rob Laing 18|title=Yvette Young: "I jokingly call myself a hack because I figure everything out by ear and I don't really have a formula I follow"|url=https://www.musicradar.com/features/yvette-young-i-jokingly-call-myself-a-hack-because-i-figure-everything-out-by-ear-and-i-dont-really-have-a-formula-i-follow|access-date=2021-04-07|website=MusicRadar|date=18 November 2019|language=en}}</ref> She uses a technique of singing the part out loud and then replicating it on guitar to decipher the parts of the songs she writes. <ref name=":0" />

Young also creates unique illustration and art pieces, including work on some of her own guitars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yvetteyoung.wordpress.com/|title=Artwork of Yvette Young|website=Artwork of Yvette Young|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2016}}</ref> One of her paintings serves as the cover for her band's album ''Technicolor'', released in June 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/yveyoung/photos/a.696045563782266/2924258924294241/?type=3&theater|title=Yvette Young Official Facebook Page|website=Facebook|language=en-US|access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Young has begun to teach a master course on guitar and finds that her style resonates with many of her students. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Yvette Young {{!}} Guitar Lessons & Master Course|url=https://jamplay.com/guitar-lessons/yvette-young|access-date=2021-04-07|website=JamPlay.com|language=en}}</ref> <ref name=":0" /> Before this she was mainly an art teacher, but by teaching while on tour she has become a music teacher.  <ref name=":0" />

Young was featured in a Super Bowl LV Commercial in February 2021 for Logitech.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpCIEY9xgTY</ref> She is also featured on their website as a partner with tutorials and tips on how to use their equipment. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/promo/streaming-content-creation-tips.html|title = Logitech for Creators}}</ref>
