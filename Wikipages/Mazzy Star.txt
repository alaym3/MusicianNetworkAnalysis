'''Mazzy Star''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Santa Monica, California]] from remnants of the group [[Opal (band)|Opal]], in 1988. Founding member [[David Roback]]'s friend [[Hope Sandoval]] became the group's vocalist when [[Kendra Smith]] left Opal.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |date=2003 |title=The Great Indie Discography |publisher=Canongate |isbn=1841953350 |pages=861–862}}</ref>

Mazzy Star is best known for the song "[[Fade into You]]," which brought the band some success in the mid-1990s and was the group's biggest mainstream hit, earning extensive exposure on [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and radio airplay. Roback and Sandoval were the creative center of the band, with Sandoval as lyricist and Roback as composer of the majority of the band's material until his death in Los Angeles on February 24, 2020 from metastatic cancer.

The band's most recent studio album, ''[[Seasons of Your Day]]'', was released in 2013, followed by the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Still (Mazzy Star EP)|Still]]'' in 2018.

==History==

===Opal and Paisley Underground (1981–1987)===
Mazzy Star has deep roots within the Californian [[Paisley Underground]] movement of the early 1980s. David Roback, along with his brother Steven, was one of the main architects of leading Los Angeles [[psychedelic music|psychedelic revival]] band the [[Rain Parade]].<ref name="Strong"/><ref name="Guard130508">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/may/13/rememberingtherainparade |title=Remembering the Rain Parade |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=May 13, 2008 |first=Alan|last=McGee |access-date=November 30, 2011}}</ref> Leaving that band after their [[Emergency Third Rail Power Trip|first LP]], he founded [[Opal (band)|Clay Allison]] in 1983 with then-girlfriend, ex-[[Dream Syndicate]] bassist [[Kendra Smith]].<ref name="Strong"/><ref name="AltMusic">{{Cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/mazzystar.htm|title=Mazzy Star&nbsp;– Artist Profile |publisher=[[About.com]] |first=Anthony|last=Carew|access-date = November 30, 2011}}</ref> Soon after the publication of their sole release, the 1983 [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]]d single "Fell From the Sun"/"All Souls", Clay Allison renamed themselves [[Opal (band)|Opal]] and released the LP ''[[Happy Nightmare Baby]]'' on [[SST Records|SST]] on December 14, 1987.<ref name="AltMusic" /> With Roback as its musical catalyst, Opal were a direct precursor to Mazzy Star musically—often featuring the same psychedelic guitar drones and similar hints of [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] that would later appear on Mazzy Star recordings. Meanwhile, Sandoval—who was in high school at the time—formed the folk music duo Going Home in the early 1980s with fellow student Sylvia Gomez,<ref name="AltMusic" /> and played gigs with [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]].<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite web |first=Nisha |last=Gopalan |url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2013/09/20/mazzy-star-reunites-after-17-years-with-new-album-seasons-of-your-day.html |title=The Reawakening of Mazzy Star |work=[[Newsweek]] |publisher=[[IBT Media]] |date=October 6, 2013 |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Both were devoted followers of the Rain Parade, and after a 1983 concert by the band in the Los Angeles area, Gomez entered the backstage area of the venue and gave Roback a copy of Going Home's demo tape, featuring Sandoval on vocals and Gomez on guitar.<ref name="AltMusic" /><ref name="Newsweek" /> Upon hearing the tape, Roback offered to produce a still-unreleased album by the pair.<ref name="Strong"/><ref name="AltMusic" />

When Smith left Opal under cloudy circumstances in the middle of a tour supporting [[the Jesus & Mary Chain]], Sandoval was tapped as her replacement.<ref name="Strong"/>

===Formation and Rough Trade (1988–1990)===
{{main|She Hangs Brightly}}
Despite Smith's departure, Rough Trade retained Roback's original record deal, contractually obligating him to supply a follow-up to Opal's debut LP. As a result, Roback and Sandoval continued to tour under the Opal alias for the next two years, during which time they completed production on Opal's planned second album, titled ''Ghost Highway''. Composed mainly of songs written by Roback and Smith, Sandoval stated that she was unhappy with the material, and expressed an interest in wanting to "start something completely new". The pair quickly composed and recorded seven new tracks in [[Hyde Street Studios]] in San Francisco, and renamed the band Mazzy Star.<ref name="Uncut">{{cite magazine |last=Bonner |first=Michael |year=2013 |title=Hope Springs Eternal – Feature |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] | volume=October 2013 |issue=201310 |pages=24–28 |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/the-view-from-here/a-mazzy-star-interview-theres-happiness-but-theres-also-torture-67963 |access-date=June 11, 2015}}</ref> Written over a year before Mazzy Star's inception, the track "Ghost Highway" is the duo's only original song to not feature a writing credit from Sandoval,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyid=467007&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716152958/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyid=467007&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2012|title=Ghost Highway (Legal Title) |website=BMI Repertoire |publisher=BMI.com |access-date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> while another song, "Give You My Lovin{{'"}}, was written by Going Home guitarist Sylvia Gomez<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyid=476509&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716173523/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyid=476509&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2012|title=Give You My Lovin (Legal Title) |website=BMI Repertoire |publisher=BMI.com |access-date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> and first recorded by Sandoval and Gomez in the mid-1980s.

''[[She Hangs Brightly]]'' was released in May 1990 on Rough Trade and, although it was not an immediate commercial success, the album established the duo as a recurrent fixture on [[alternative rock]] radio, with lead single "Blue Flower" – a cover of the [[Slapp Happy]] track – peaking at No.&nbsp;29 on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name=AllmusicSHB>{{Citation | title = Mazzy Star > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles > She Hangs Brightly Singles | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/she-hangs-brightly-r12619/charts-awards | access-date =October 24, 2011}}</ref> The album would go on to sell over 70,000 copies in the UK.<ref name="Uncut" />

===Capitol (1990–1997)===
{{main|So Tonight That I Might See}}
The American branch of Rough Trade folded in late 1990, briefly leaving Mazzy Star without a record label. Within weeks, the duo's contract was picked up by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], who re-released ''She Hangs Brightly'' on November 4, 1990,<ref>{{Cite web |title=She Hangs Brightly |website=Mazzy Star Boulevard | url = http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/she-hangs-brightly.html | access-date = October 24, 2011 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111104225656/http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/she-hangs-brightly.html | archive-date = November 4, 2011 | df = mdy-all}}</ref> and released their follow-up, ''[[So Tonight That I Might See]]'' on September 27, 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |title=So Tonight That I Might See |website=Mazzy Star Boulevard | url = http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/so-tonight-that-i-might-see.html | access-date = October 24, 2011 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111104140107/http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/so-tonight-that-i-might-see.html | archive-date = November 4, 2011 | df = mdy-all}}</ref> A year after its release, the album yielded an [[Sleeper hit|unexpected hit]] single.

We could do our own thing and go at our own pace. But that changed when major labels started wanting bands that would sell 7 million records. They had a formula. And suddenly all these people wanted to come to the studio to keep track of what we were doing and make sure we were following that formula. So we got out."<ref name="AltMusic" />

===Hiatus, reunion, and subsequent work (1997–2009)===
In the immediate aftermath of Mazzy Star's dissolution, Sandoval, who had appeared on The Jesus and Mary Chain's 1994 release ''[[Stoned & Dethroned]]'', made another guest appearance on their album ''[[Munki]]'', and also collaborated with [[the Chemical Brothers]], while Roback produced and mixed two songs found on [[Beth Orton]]'s 1999 album ''[[Central Reservation (album)|Central Reservation]]''.

In June 2000, the band reunited for a mini-tour of Europe. Performing up to seven new songs at each of these concerts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/bootlegs.html|title=Mazzy Star Bootlegs list|access-date=October 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930075039/http://www.mazzystar.nu/web/bootlegs.html|archive-date=September 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sandoval revealed in interviews around this time that these new songs were written and recorded for Mazzy Star's fourth studio album, which was to be released independently sometime in the future. This did not materialize, however, as later that year, Sandoval joined with [[Colm Ó Cíosóig]] (formerly of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]) to form [[Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions]]. In October 2000, Sandoval issued her first EP with The Warm Inventions, ''[[At the Doorway Again]]'', and followed it up with her debut full-length album, ''[[Bavarian Fruit Bread]]'', a year later. Around this time, Sandoval also contributed vocals to several songs by other artists, notably [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Death in Vegas]].

Sandoval performed as part of [[Bert Jansch]]'s 60th birthday celebration at [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on November&nbsp;3, 2003. As well as Ó Cíosóig, Jansch and his son Adam, she was also joined on stage by David Roback for renditions of "Suzanne" and "All This Remains", a song Sandoval had contributed lead vocals and wrote lyrics to for Jansch's 2002 album ''[[Edge of a Dream]]''. This would remain Sandoval and Roback's final appearance together on-stage until 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopesandoval.com/tour/tour2003.shtml|title=London, England – Queen Elizabeth Hall (South Bank)|date=November 8, 2003 |website=HopeSandoval.com |access-date=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

David Roback made his debut appearance as an actor in the 2004 film ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]''. He also wrote and produced three songs that were performed in the film by actress [[Maggie Cheung]].

In 2009, ''So Tonight That I Might See'' album track "[[Into Dust]]" debuted at No.&nbsp;71 and stayed one week on the U.K. singles chart<ref name=UKChartsMazzyStarSingles /> when it featured on a commercial for [[Virgin Media]].<ref name=MoneyHighSt>{{Citation | title = Virgin Media Launching TV Campaign on Mobile Internet | work = Money High Street | publisher = Media Netrix | date = June 23, 2009 | url = http://www.moneyhighstreet.com/finance-news/virgin-media-launching-tv-campaign-on-mobile-internet/ | access-date = May 23, 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102133324/http://www.moneyhighstreet.com/finance-news/virgin-media-launching-tv-campaign-on-mobile-internet/ | archive-date = January 2, 2011 | df = mdy-all}}</ref> Two years later, the song appeared on the "Dust to Dust" trailer for [[Gears of War 3]] and spent a further four weeks on the chart, reaching a new peak of No.&nbsp;47;<ref name=UKChartsMazzyStarSingles /> while it also became the band's first song to ever place on the [[Irish Singles Chart]], where it peaked at No.&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://acharts.co/ireland_singles_top_100/2011/38 |title=Ireland Singles Top 50 |website=aCharts.co |publisher=Chart-Track (IRMA) |date=September 22, 2011 |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

Sandoval's second album with The Warm Inventions, ''[[Through the Devil Softly]]'', was released via [[Nettwerk]] on September 29, 2009 and was followed on August 10, 2010 by a non-album single, a cover of [[Syd Barrett]]'s "Golden Hair". Also released in 2010 was her vocal contribution to [[Massive Attack]]'s ''[[Heligoland (album)|Heligoland]]'', "[[Four Walls / Paradise Circus|Paradise Circus]]". The song spent one week on the U.K. singles chart at No.&nbsp;117.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_M.HTM |title=Chart Log UK 1994{{ndash}}2010: M{{spndash}} My Vitriol |last=Zywietz |first=Tobias |website=Zobbel.de |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>

===Reformation and ''Seasons of Your Day'' (2010–2014)===
{{main|Seasons of Your Day}}
The first substantive confirmation that the duo would reconvene to complete work on their fourth studio album came from Sandoval herself in a July 2009 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, where she was quoted as saying, "It's true we're still together. We're almost finished [with the record]. But I have no idea what that means."<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mazzy-star-crooner-readies-return-with-hope-sandoval-and-the-warm-inventions-20090706| title=Mazzy Star Crooner Readies Return With Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions| first=Kevin |last=O'Donnell |date=July 6, 2009 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> Later, in a September 2009 interview with Vancouver-based music website ''Straight.com'', interviewer John Lucas wrote of the 8-year gap between ''Bavarian Fruit Bread'' and ''Through the Devil Softly'', "That seems like a long time until you consider that Mazzy Star, Sandoval's partnership with guitarist David Roback, hasn't put an album out since 1996. Sandoval promises that will change; she and Roback have their very own ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' in the works, but it won't see the light of day until The Warm Inventions have wrapped up their tour."<ref name="Straight">{{cite news| url=https://www.straight.com/article-257527/hope-sandoval-has-never-been-one-rush-things| title=Hope Sandoval Has Never Been One To Rush Things|first=John|last=Lucas|date=September 17, 2009 |newspaper=Vancouver Free Press |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

===David Roback===
{{main|David Roback}}
In Mazzy Star, Roback played guitar, keyboard, and piano. He wrote almost all music for Mazzy Star and produced all their recordings.

Roback grew up in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], graduating from [[Palisades Charter High School|Palisades High School]] in 1975. He started a band called [[Rain Parade]] with his brother Steven. They first hit the scene in 1982 as part of a loose aggregate of psychedelic 1960s-influenced guitar bands in Los Angeles, and they were in the forefront of that movement which lasted a couple of years.

After Rain Parade's first album and tours, Roback left the band. He then became involved with ex-[[Dream Syndicate]] bassist Kendra Smith and formed a new band called [[Opal (band)|Clay Allison]] in 1983. The recordings from the summer this year remained unreleased until the 1989 release of Opal's ''Early Recordings''.

After Clay Allison's 1984 tour, the band decided to go with a name change, and went from Clay Allison to Opal, whose sound was defined by Roback's spare, distorted guitar work and Smith's vocals. They released the ''Northern Line'' EP in 1985. [[SST Records]] signed Opal and released their album ''[[Happy Nightmare Baby]]'' on December 14, 1987. During the Opal tour in December 1987, Smith left the band. She was replaced by Sandoval, and they toured Europe through early 1988. Roback and Sandoval had an intimate relationship at this time and after Opal was disbanded, they took the remaining members of Opal and changed their name to Mazzy Star.

Roback spent most of the past decade living in [[Norway]] before his death on February 24, 2020.<ref name=NYT200226/><ref name=Residence>{{cite web |url=http://www.stereogum.com/1469741/qa-mazzy-star-talk-a-little-about-seasons-of-your-day-their-first-new-album-in-17-years/interview/ |title=Q&A: Mazzy Star Talk (A Little) About Seasons of Your Day, Their First New Album in 17 Years |work=[[Stereogum]] |first=T.
