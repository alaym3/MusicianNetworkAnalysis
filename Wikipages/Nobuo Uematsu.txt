The two later worked together on many titles at the company, most notably in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company, which included the [[Dog Ear Records]] music label. He has since composed music as a [[freelancer]] for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development studio, [[Mistwalker]].

Many soundtracks and [[arrangement|arranged]] albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various [[Final Fantasy concerts|''Final Fantasy'' concerts]],<ref name="1UP" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/594/594622p1.html |title=Dear Friends: Final Fantasy in San Francisco |author=Jeremy Dunham |date=March 9, 2005 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215214944/http://music.ign.com/articles/594/594622p1.html |archive-date=December 15, 2010  }}</ref> where he has worked with [[Grammy Award]]–winning conductor [[Arnie Roth]] on several of these performances. In the 2000s, he was the keyboardist in the hard rock band [[The Black Mages]], along with [[Square Enix]] colleagues [[Kenichiro Fukui]] and [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]]. The band played various arranged rock versions of Uematsu's ''Final Fantasy'' compositions. He has since performed with [[Earthbound Papas]], which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011. He is sometimes referred to as the [[Beethoven]] of video game music and has made several appearances in the annual [[Classic FM Hall of Fame]].<ref name="classicfm"/>

===Early life===
Uematsu was born in [[Kōchi, Kōchi|Kōchi]], [[Kōchi Prefecture]], Japan.<ref name="SEU">{{cite web |url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/uematsu/profile/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055159/http://www.square-enix-usa.com/uematsu/profile/index.html |archive-date=May 17, 2008 |title=N's profile |publisher=Square Enix USA |access-date=June 1, 2008}}</ref> A self-taught musician, he began to play the piano when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old,<ref name="Biography"/> and he did not take any formal piano lessons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHyIdyrxd5U |title=Nobuo Uematsu and Arnie Roth – Live Interview (Part I of II) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |author=squaresoundcom |date=October 15, 2008 |access-date=July 8, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093551/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHyIdyrxd5U |archive-date=July 18, 2011  }}</ref> He has an older sister who also played the piano.<ref name="1UP"/> After graduating from [[Kanagawa University]] with a degree in English, Uematsu played the keyboard in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials.<ref name="Biography" /> When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in [[Tokyo]], a [[Square (video game company)|Square]] employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.<ref name="1UP">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3166165 |title=A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu |website=[[1UP.com]] |first=James |last=Mielke |date=February 15, 2008 |access-date=May 30, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207080524/http://www.1up.com/features/final-fantasy-composer |archive-date=February 7, 2013  }}</ref>

===Square (1985–2004)===
Uematsu joined Square in 1985, and composed his soundtrack with ''Cruise Chaser Blassty'' in 1986. Shortly after, he met [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], who asked him if he wanted to create music for some of his games, to which Uematsu agreed.<ref name="1UP"/> For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, such as ''[[King's Knight]]'', ''[[3-D WorldRunner]]'', and ''[[Rad Racer]]''.<ref name="Biography" /> In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="developmentFF">{{cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=December 13, 2007 |work=Develop |publisher=Intent Media |access-date=October 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809114048/http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |archive-date=August 9, 2011  }}</ref> ''Final Fantasy''{{'s}} popularity sparked Uematsu's career in video game music, and he would go on to compose music for over 30 titles, most prominently the subsequent games in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. He scored the first installment in the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series, ''[[The Final Fantasy Legend]]'', in 1989. For the second game in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy Legend II]]'' he was assisted by [[Kenji Ito]].<ref name="Biography"/> In late 1994, Uematsu was asked to finish the soundtrack for ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' after [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] contracted [[peptic ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite book |year=2005 |title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life |publisher=[[BradyGames]] |isbn=0-7440-0424-1 |author= Kohler, Chris}}</ref> In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to ''[[Front Mission: Gun Hazard]]'', and created the entire score for ''DynamiTracer''. He also created music for three of the games in the ''[[Hanjuku Hero]]'' series.<ref name="Biography"/>

Outside of video games, he has composed the main theme for the 2000 animated film ''[[Ah! My Goddess: The Movie]]'' and co-composed the [[anime]] ''[[Final Fantasy: Unlimited]]'' (2001) with ''Final Fantasy'' orchestrator [[Shirō Hamaguchi]]. He also inspired the ''Ten Plants'' concept albums, and released a solo album in 1994, titled ''Phantasmagoria''. Feeling gradually more dissatisfied and uninspired, Uematsu requested the assistance of composers [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]] for the score to ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' in 2001. This marked the first time that Uematsu did not compose an entire main-series ''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack. For ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' from 2002, he was joined by [[Naoshi Mizuta]], who composed the majority of the soundtrack, and [[Kumi Tanioka]]; Uematsu was responsible for only eleven tracks.<ref name="Biography"/> In 2002, fellow Square colleagues [[Kenichiro Fukui]] and [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]] asked Uematsu to join them in forming a rock band that focused on reinterpreting and expanding on Uematsu's compositions. He declined their offer at first because he was too busy with work; however, after agreeing to perform with Fukui and Sekito in a live performance as a keyboardist, he decided to join them in making a band.<ref name="1UP"/><ref name=man>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200905/N09.0527.1612.59659.htm?Page=3 |title=Nobuo Uematsu: The Man Behind The Music |work=[[Game Informer]] |first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo |date=May 27, 2009 |access-date=June 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601154539/http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200905/N09.0527.1612.59659.htm?Page=3 |archive-date=June 1, 2009}}</ref> Another employee at Square, Mr. Matsushita, chose the name [[The Black Mages]] for their band.<ref name="1UP"/> In 2003, [[Keiji Kawamori]], Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band.<ref name="Biography" /> The Black Mages released three studio albums and performed at several concerts.

In February 2010, it was announced that Uematsu would appear at [[Anime Boston]], one of the largest anime conventions on the East Coast.

On August 18, 2013, while headlining the Fantasy Rock Festival in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], Japan with the [[Earthbound Papas]], he revealed to the audience that he had originally intended to name their second album "Dancing Mad" after the ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' track which also appears on the album. However, referring to [[Square Enix]] indirectly, he told the audience that "a certain company 'S'" had phoned and informed him that he "could not use the name". Consequently, instead of backing down he decided to name the album "Dancing Dad", as a nod to the band's name. He also told the audience that he wanted to make an album of wholly original songs, but lamented that "it's just that if there are no game songs on it, it probably wouldn't sell!"

==Musical style and influences==
The style of Uematsu's compositions is diverse, ranging from stately [[classical music|classical]] symphonic pieces and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] to [[New-age music|new-age]] and hyper-percussive [[techno]]-[[electronica]].
