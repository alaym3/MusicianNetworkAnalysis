Tinchy"], dailyrecord.co.uk; accessed 26 December 2013.</ref> and she was the host of [[Got What It Takes?]]. He attended [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School (Hove)|Cardinal Newman Catholic School]] in [[Hove]]. On 19 May 2006, he signed up to the online video-sharing website [[YouTube]] and in December 2008 uploaded his very first video of him singing "Breathe", by fellow British musician Lee Carr.<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/skillzaisherebooya|title=YouTube User: skillzaisherebooya|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2012-04-05}}</ref>

In 2006, Maynard starred as a young [[Casper Rose]] in the [[Sky 1]] television series ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]''.<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877066/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|title=Dream Team: War of Roses |publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref>

Since 2009, Maynard has uploaded cover versions of songs with rapper and close friend, Anthony "Anth" Melo, who resides in Virginia. Together they have covered a variety of songs, including: [[Taio Cruz]] ("[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]") and [[Rihanna]] ("[[Only Girl (In the World)]]"). Maynard came to label attention when [[United States|American]] singer/songwriter [[Ne-Yo]] watched a cover version of his track "[[Beautiful Monster]]" – who contacted the musician soon afterwards, and [[Ne-Yo]] became Maynard's mentor.<ref name="The Student Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudentmagazine.co.uk/dailynews/conormaynardinterview.php|title=The Student Magazine Interview Conor Maynard|publisher=The Student Magazine|access-date=3 May 2012}}</ref> He signed to EMI/Parlophone and Turn First management.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_SStennett2.html|title=Interview with Sarah Stennett (part 2)|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=4 March 2013|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

Turn First were responsible for developing the artist.<ref name="hitquarters"/> CEO Sarah Stennett told [[HitQuarters]] that rather than telling him what songs to sing, they guided him through the songwriting process, finding what music he was listening to and what was inspiring him, and then matched him up with producers [[The Invisible Men]] and songwriter Sophie Stern.<ref name="hitquarters"/> These sessions eventually resulted in first single "[[Can't Say No]]". Stennett described the song as "a tastemaker track. It sounded like something he was listening to, which was urban radio."<ref name="hitquarters"/>

In November 2011, Maynard received a nomination for [[MTV]]'s ''Brand New for 2012'' award, competing alongside [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]], [[Michael Kiwanuka]], [[Lana Del Rey]], and [[Lianne La Havas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a354099/lana-del-rey-delilah-charli-xcx-make-mtv-brand-new-artist-2012-list.html|title=Lana Del Rey and Delilah makes MTV's Brand New for 2012 list|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=2 December 2011}}</ref> It was announced on 31 January 2012 that Maynard had been crowned winner of the award, having received approximately 48% of the public vote.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/brand-new-for-2012/344686-conor-maynard-voted-brand-new-for-2012-winner|title=Conor Maynard voted 'Brand New' for 2012|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=31 January 2012}}</ref>
