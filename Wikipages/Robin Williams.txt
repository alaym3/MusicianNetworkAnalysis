Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers; according to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams and his ability to instantly perform in many different accents. Their primary acting teacher was [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo".<ref name="reeve" /> Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his well-received performance as an old man in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[The Night of the Iguana|Night of the Iguana]]''. Reeve wrote, "He simply ''was'' the old man. I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."<ref name="reeve"/> The two remained close friends until Reeve's death in 2004. Their friendship was like "brothers from another mother", according to Williams's son Zak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/11/23/robin-williams-son-remembers-his-dad-and-christopher-reeve-friendship/|title=Robin Williams' son remembers his dad and Christopher Reeve's friendship|website=[[Fox News]]|date=November 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123153048/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/11/23/robin-williams-son-remembers-his-dad-and-christopher-reeve-friendship/ |archive-date=November 23, 2014 }}</ref>

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===

[[File:Robin Williams in Camp Phoenix.jpg|thumb|Williams at a [[United Service Organization|USO]] show on December 20, 2007]]

Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|last2=August 12|first2=Leah Garchik {{!}} on|last3=2014|date=August 12, 2014|title=Robin Williams' heart never strayed far from San Francisco|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Robin-Williams-heart-never-strayed-far-from-San-5682602.php|access-date=June 27, 2020|website=www.sfgate.com|language=en|archive-date=June 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628161700/https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Robin-Williams-heart-never-strayed-far-from-San-5682602.php|url-status=live}}</ref> He gave his first performance at the [[Holy City Zoo]], a comedy club in [[San Francisco]], where he worked his way up from tending bar.<ref name=Zehme/> In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a [[rock music]] renaissance, [[hippie]]s, [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], and a [[sexual revolution]], and in the late 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes critic [[Gerald Nachman]].<ref name=Nachman>{{cite book|first=Gerald|last=Nachman|title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|publisher=Back Stage Books|location=Brno, Czech Republic|date=2004|isbn=978-0823047864}}</ref>{{rp|6}} Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud".<ref name=Maslon/>

Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including [[The Comedy Store]]. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer [[George Schlatter]], who asked him to appear on a revival of his show [[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|''Laugh-In'']]. The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance.<ref name=Maslon/> That year, Williams also performed a show at the [[The Improv|L.A.

With his success on ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials: ''Off The Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1983), and ''[[A Night at the Met]]'' (1986).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benedictus|first1=Leo|date=December 6, 2012|title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams' A Night at the Met|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, England|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|access-date=December 3, 2014|archive-date=June 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626201217/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|url-status=live}}</ref> Williams won a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for the recording of his 1979 live show at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in [[New York City|New York]], ''Reality{{nbsp}}...

[[David Letterman]], who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane", said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=August 19, 2014|title=Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|access-date=October 23, 2014|website=Slate|archive-date=October 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023180951/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Robin Williams Aviano.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams at [[Aviano Air Base]] (Italy) on December 22, 2007]]

Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using [[drug]]s and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] early in his career. He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally performed when [[Hangover|hung over]] from the previous day. During the period he was using [[cocaine]], he said it made him [[Paranoia|paranoid]] when performing on stage.<ref name="Grobel">{{cite magazine|first=Lawrence|last=Grobel|title=Playboy Interview: Robin Williams|magazine=[[Playboy]]|publisher=[[Playboy Enterprises]]|location=Beverly Hills, California|date=January 1992}}</ref>

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{quote|It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic [[Vincent Canby]], were concerned that his monologues were so intense it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown".<ref name="When the Laughter Stops">{{cite book | title=Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014 | first=Emily | last=Herbert | publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd. | location=London, England | date=November 15, 2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ | isbn=9781784183004 | oclc=889523094 | access-date=August 26, 2016 | archive-date=December 26, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226050044/https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ | url-status=live }}</ref> His biographer, Emily Herbert, described his "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis{{nbsp}}...

Williams felt secure that he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.<ref name=Grobel/> He also explained that he often used [[Free association (psychology)#Characteristics|free association]] of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.<ref>{{YouTube|id=4LaJDOD5cJI|time=14m20s|title=Robin Williams – Parkinson interview [2002]}}.

During a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something.{{nbsp}}... If I stop trying, I get afraid." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist [[Jerzy Kosiński]] to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.<ref name=Grobel/>

Williams's stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). In 2004, he was voted 13th on [[Comedy Central]]'s list "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time".<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/|access-date=December 26, 2007|publisher=Internet Movie Database|archive-date=March 11, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311144616/http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/|url-status=live}}</ref> After a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, ''Weapons of Self-Destruction''.

====''Mork & Mindy''====

After the ''[[Laugh-In]]'' revival and appearing in the cast of ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' on [[NBC]], Williams was cast by [[Garry Marshall]] as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series ''[[Happy Days]]'', "[[My Favorite Orkan]]".<ref name=Maslon/><ref name="actors">{{cite episode | title = Robin Williams | series = Inside the Actors Studio | season = 7 | number = 710 | airdate = June 10, 2001 | network = Bravo | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | credits = James Lipton (host) | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093734/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | archive-date = February 4, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |publisher=Biography Channel |access-date=September 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |archive-date=July 16, 2012 }}</ref> As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice, and he made the most of the script. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives were deeply impressed with his performance. As such, the executives moved quickly to get the performer on contract just four days later before competitors could make their own offers.<ref>{{cite magazine |title='Happy Days' Cast Reveals How Robin Williams Got Cast as a "Martian" in Show's "Worst Script" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/happy-days-cast-reveals-how-750779 |access-date=August 10, 2018 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 20, 2014 |archive-date=August 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042224/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/happy-days-cast-reveals-how-750779 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom ''Mork & Mindy'', which co-starred [[Pam Dawber]], and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialogue and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in ''Happy Days'', the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in [[Milwaukee]]. ''Mork & Mindy'' at its peak had a weekly audience of sixty million and was credited with turning Williams into a "superstar".<ref name="Maslon" /> According to critic [[James Poniewozik]], the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention".<ref name="Corliss">{{cite magazine |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |title=Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy |magazine=Time |date=August 25, 2014 |access-date=August 20, 2014 |archive-date=August 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819223702/http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials, ''Off the Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1983), and ''[[A Night at the Met]]'' (1986).

===Film===
{{see also|Robin Williams filmography}}

The first film role credited to Robin Williams is a small part in the 1977 low-budget comedy ''[[Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?]]''. His first starring performance, however, is as [[Popeye the Sailor|the title character]] in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980), in which Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work; accordingly, the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed on his performance.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://articles.philly.com/2014-08-13/news/52732960_1_golden-globe-aladdin-role | title = Robin Williams, 63, comic genius | first = Steven | last = Rea | date = August 13, 2014 | access-date = August 18, 2014 | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043346/http://articles.philly.com/2014-08-13/news/52732960_1_golden-globe-aladdin-role | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="VF-20140812">{{cite web |last=Spitznagel |first=Eric |title=Popeye Is the Best Movie Robin Williams Ever Made |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/robin-williams-popeye |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=August 13, 2014 |archive-date=August 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813212404/http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/robin-williams-popeye |url-status=live }}</ref> He went on to star as the leading character in ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' (1982), which Williams considered "may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core".<ref name=Zehme/> He continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]'' (1983) and ''[[Club Paradise]]'' (1986), though he said these roles did not help advance his film career.<ref name=Zehme/>

His first major break came from his starring role in director [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].<ref name="actors"/> The film is set in 1965 during the [[Vietnam War]], with Williams playing the role of [[Adrian Cronauer]], a radio [[shock jock]] who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines.

His roles in comedy and dramatic films garnered Williams several accolades, including an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''Good Will Hunting'';<ref name="actors" /> as well as two previous Academy Award nominations, for ''Dead Poets Society'', and as a troubled homeless man in ''The Fisher King'', respectively.<ref name="actors" />

Among the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited Robert De Niro, from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialogue when acting. From [[Dustin Hoffman]], with whom he co-starred in ''Hook'', he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. [[Mike Medavoy]], producer of ''Hook'', told its director, [[Steven Spielberg]], that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg.<ref>{{cite book|title = You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot|last = Medavoy|first = Mike|publisher = Simon & Schuster (Altria)|year = 2002|isbn = 9780743400541|location = New York|page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743400541/page/n281 228]|others = Young, Josh (contributor)|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743400541|url-access = registration}}</ref> Williams benefited from working with [[Woody Allen]], who directed him and Billy Crystal in ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997), as Allen had knowledge of the fact that Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.<ref>{{cite book|title = Conversations with Woody Allen: His Films, the Movies, and Moviemaking|last = Lax|first = Eric|publisher = [[Knopf Doubleday]]|location=New York City|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0375415333|page = [https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00laxe/page/52 52]|url = https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00laxe/page/52}}</ref>

====Voice roles====

[[File:Robin Williams 1996.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Williams in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1996]]

Williams voiced characters in several animated films. His voice role as the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] in the animated musical ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) was written for him. The film's directors said they had taken a risk by writing the role.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOo9XqAyxE&t=2m24s|via=[[YouTube]]|title=Turning Robin Williams into 'Aladdin's' Genie|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 15, 2014}}</ref> At first, Williams refused the role since it was a Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie.

Due to Disney breaking an agreement with Williams regarding the use of the Genie in the advertising for ''Aladdin'', Williams refused to sign on for the direct-to-video sequel ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), where the Genie was instead voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].

==Influences==

Williams credited comedians including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Nichols and May]], and [[Lenny Bruce]] as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|43}} He also liked [[Jay Leno]] for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines, and [[Sid Caesar]], whose acts he felt were "precious".<ref name="Grobel" />

Jonathan Winters was his "idol" early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|259}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|title=Jonathan Winters Dead: 'Mork and Mindy' Star Dies At Age 87|date=April 12, 2013|work=Huffington Post|access-date=October 23, 2014|archive-date=November 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110235521/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Williams was inspired by Winters' ingenuity, realizing, he said, "that anything is possible, that anything is funny{{nbsp}}...

During an interview in [[London]] in 2002, Williams told [[Michael Parkinson]] that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', stating, "It doesn't get better than that." British comedy actors [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]] were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.<ref>video: {{cite interview|last=Williams|first=Robin|interviewer=[[Michael Parkinson]]|title=Robin Williams, Parkinson interview 2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI|access-date=September 18, 2014|archive-date=September 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917135858/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI|url-status=live}}</ref>

Williams was also influenced by [[Richard Pryor]]'s fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|121}}

Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.<ref name=Grobel/><ref>[https://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: 'Robin Williams Was a World Treasure'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045202/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure |date=May 25, 2017 }}, ''Showbiz411'', August 13, 2014</ref>

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.<ref name=CSM>[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816042537/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video |date=August 16, 2014 }},(+video), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 12, 2014</ref> According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person."<ref name=CSM/>

Williams created a signature free-form comedy persona so widely and uniquely identified that new comedians like [[Jim Carrey]] impersonated him,<ref>{{YouTube|9zorOqE0j1c|"Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}</ref> paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: "one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space".<ref>Rappoport, Leon. ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', Greenwood Publishing (2005) p. 136</ref> According to [[Judd Apatow]], the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but his talent was so extremely unusual no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.<ref name="Browne">{{cite magazine | last=Browne | first=David | title=Robin Williams, 1951–2014 | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=September 11, 2014 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/robin-williams-final-days-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140827 | pages=38–47 | access-date=August 26, 2016 | archive-date=August 29, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829003957/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/robin-williams-final-days-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140827 | url-status=live }}</ref>

His film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed Williams in ''Mrs. Doubtfire'', says watching him work "was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|title = Valley native Chris Columbus speaks about life with Robin Williams|date = August 13, 2014|access-date = October 24, 2014|website = vindy.com|archive-date = August 19, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084802/http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|url-status = live}}</ref> Looking over most of his filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that "Williams helped us grow up."<ref name="WP"/>
