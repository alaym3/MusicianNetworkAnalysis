'''Henrietta "Etta" Bond''' is a British singer-songwriter. She was the first signing to [[Odd Child Recordings|OddChild Music]], partially owing to Bond becoming friends with [[Labrinth]] thanks to a fluke [[Myspace]] encounter.

==Career==
Writing material for her debut release, Bond worked with producer DaVinChe – having already uploaded the demo singles "Ask Me to Stay" and "Come Over". Credited as Henrietta, she appeared on DaVinChe's song "No Significance", which was also featured on the ''[[4.3.2.1.]]'' film soundtrack. Bond also made an appearance on [[United Kingdom|British]] rapper [[Wretch 32]]'s second studio album, ''[[Black and White (Wretch 32 album)|Black and White]]'', on the track [[Forgiveness (Wretch 32 song)|"Forgiveness"]] – which was released on 11 December 2011 as a single.

Bond and fellow OddChild signing [[Raf Riley]] (who's also had releases with [[Mad Decent]]) released a free collaboration EP on 20 July 2012 under the name ''Emergency Room'', featuring the previously unreleased demo "Ask Me To Stay" alongside 7 other tracks, including the single "Boring Bitches", featuring [[Lady Leshurr]]. The video was produced by [[Rogue Films|Reuben Dangoor]] alongside the EP artwork, and received mixed opinions due to the controversial content shown in the video.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkABiq8RfiM Boring Bitches]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2012-09-12.</ref>

The EP received support from many notable artists, including [[Labrinth]], [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]], [[Professor Green]] and [[Mike Skinner (musician)|Mike Skinner]]<ref>[https://soundcloud.com/mike-skinner/mike-skinner-dj-set-nest Mike Skinner DJ Set @ Nest London 04.01.13 by Mike Skinner Ltd | Free Listening on SoundCloud]. Soundcloud.com. Retrieved on 2016-03-14.</ref> among others. "Resolve" was released in the form of a promotional video in December 2012. Both the video and artwork again made by Dangoor.

On 26 July 2013, [[ExR]] released the music video for "Big Girl's Vogue", the first promotional single from their second EP ''Meds''. The eight-track EP was released for free download on 8 August 2013. The duo appeared on DJ Target's [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] show on 13 August 2013 to promote the EP. They also appeared on CJ Beatz' "Soundcheck Special" to perform "Loophole" on 1Xtra on 9 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz-_z7RdF7A|title=Etta Bond and Raf Riley - 'Loophole' CJ's Soundcheck Special|publisher=YouTube|date=2013-09-09}}</ref> On 30 September 2013, they appeared on [[Rinse FM]] to perform "Break Free".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWimlVwAyXM|title=Rinse Sessions -- Etta Bond & Raf Riley - Break Free|publisher=YouTube|date=2013-09-30}}</ref>

On 13 October 2014, Bond released her third extended play, entitled ''#CoolUrbanNewTalent''. The release was her first solo EP, and features collaborations with [[Raf Riley]] and [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]]. As a follow up to ''#CoolUrbanNewTalent'' Etta released her first single '18' featuring Etta's old lady alter ego who is 'growing old disgracefully' produced by [[MNEK]]. The video of '18' was released on 10 July 2015. Etta is currently working on new music with [[Raf Riley]], [[Wilkinson (musician)|Wilkinson]], Mojam, [[Fred Ball (producer)]] and [[Naughty Boy]].

Etta cites [[Labrinth]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[J Dilla]] and [[D'Angelo]] as major influences.<ref name="id">{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-etta-bond|title=10 things you need to know about etta bond|work=[[i-D]]|author=Collins, Hattie|date=16 November 2015}}</ref>
