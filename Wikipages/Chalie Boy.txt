===2000–2004: The Freestyle Kingz / Chalie Boy and Tite===
In 2000, Charles made his rapping debut, being featured on a mixtape for Texas underground group known as the Freestyle Kingz, performing under DJ Bull's independent record label Dirty 3rd Records. From this point on, Charles Williams performed under the name Chalie Boy.

The members of the Freestyle Kingz included Tite, Das Ryno, Big Redd, Big Ake, Lil' Sho, Sir Coop and Bubba Luv.

This album sold over 40,000 copies independently, and featured the single ''Candy'' (featuring [[Slim Thug]]). Other popular songs from the album included ''20's'', ''Uh Oh'' and ''A King''.

Chalie Boy & Tite became a popular duo. They always remained and were recognized as members of the Freestyle Kingz, but they also released 4 projects together under the same label. Promotion was seen on flyers, posters and CD artwork about an upcoming album featuring the duo titled ''Long Time Comin'', but the title was never released.

Members of the group began to leave for different reasons. The only members that remain with the label today are Da Ryno and Chalie Boy. The group name is occasionally referenced in the recordings of the two members, but officially, the Freestyle Kingz is no longer a group.

Rapid Ric featured the group in different variations throughout his mixtape releases.

In 2006, DJ Rapid Ric and Chalie Boy collaborated to release ''The Versatyle Child'', which included his first regional hit, ''Bumpa Grill''. This mixtape exposed Chalie Boy to an even wider audience because of Rapid Ric's popularity and success as a club and mixtape DJ. The two continued to work together, including a follow-up release titled ''The Return of The Versatyle Child''.

During the years of 2007 and 2008, Chalie Boy began to release even more underground releases, while recording material for his debut solo studio album titled ''Makin' My Way 2''.
