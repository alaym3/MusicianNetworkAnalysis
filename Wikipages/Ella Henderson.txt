'''Gabriella Michelle "Ella" Henderson''' (born 12 January 1996) is an English singer and songwriter. She competed in the [[The X Factor (British series 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor UK]]'' in 2012, and finished in sixth place despite being a strong favourite to win. She signed with [[Syco Music]] shortly after, and released her debut studio album, ''[[Chapter One (Ella Henderson album)|Chapter One]]'' (2014), which reached number one in the UK. The album spawned the chart-topping single "[[Ghost (Ella Henderson song)|Ghost]]", as well as the top 20 singles "[[Glow (Ella Henderson song)|Glow]]" and "[[Yours (Ella Henderson song)|Yours]]".

Following the successful collaborations, "[[Glitterball (song)|Glitterball]]" with [[Sigma (DJs)|Sigma]] and "[[Here for You (Kygo song)|Here for You]]" with [[Kygo]] in 2015, Henderson went on a four-year hiatus. She returned to music in 2019 with the EP ''[[Glorious (Ella Henderson EP)|Glorious]]'', and the singles "[[This Is Real]]" with [[Jax Jones]], "[[We Got Love (Sigala song)|We Got Love]]" with [[Sigala]] (both in 2019), and "[[Let's Go Home Together]]" with [[Tom Grennan]] (2021), two of which reached the top 10 in the UK.

===2012: ''The X Factor''===
{{Main|The X Factor (British series 9)}}

In 2012, Henderson auditioned for [[The X Factor (British series 9)|series nine]] of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' with the original song called "Missed", which was later included on her debut studio album. She reached the live shows and was mentored by [[Tulisa]]. Henderson and [[James Arthur]] were controversially in the bottom two in week seven and sang for survival. Tulisa and [[Louis Walsh]] voted to send Henderson through to the quarter-final and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[Gary Barlow]] voted to send Arthur through to the quarter-final. The result went to deadlock and Arthur advanced to the quarter-final receiving 13.7% of the vote and Henderson received 12.1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/X-Factor-Ella-Henderson-voting-table-shining/story-17566305-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131212155003/http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/X-Factor-Ella-Henderson-voting-table-shining/story-17566305-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 December 2013 |title=XFactor: Ella Henderson was never top of the voting table – but she is still shining on |publisher=Grimsby Telegraph }}</ref> She consequently finished in sixth place, despite being a strong favourite to win.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seale|first=Jack|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-02/the-x-factor-2012-ella-henderson|title=The X Factor 2012: Ella Henderson|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2 October 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044332/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-02/the-x-factor-2012-ella-henderson|archive-date=29 November 2014}}</ref> Presenter [[Dermot O'Leary]] described Henderson's exit as "one of the biggest shocks we've ever had on the results show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-11-18/x-factor-favourite-ella-henderson-makes-a-surprise-exit/|title=X Factor favourite Ella Henderson makes a surprise exit|publisher=[[itv.com]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175748/http://www.itv.com/news/2012-11-18/x-factor-favourite-ella-henderson-makes-a-surprise-exit/|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>

===2016–2019: Asylum Records and ''Glorious''===

In November 2016, Henderson announced that she had finished recording her second studio album, having worked with [[Danny O'Donoghue]] from [[The Script]] and producer [[Max Martin]]. In April 2017, it was announced that she would be supporting James Arthur on his [[Back from the Edge Tour]]. In June, she featured along with other artists, including fellow ''X Factor'' artists [[Leona Lewis]], [[Louis Tomlinson]], [[Liam Payne]], James Arthur, [[Louisa Johnson]] and [[Matt Terry]] on a cover version of [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s song "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]", which was recorded to raise money for those affected by the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] in London earlier that month. The single reached number one in the UK after only two days sales. Later that year, it was announced that Arthur had recorded a duet with Henderson, reportedly set to be included on her second studio album. While supporting him on his tour, she performed new songs that were set to be included on the record: "Ugly", "Cry Like a Woman", "Bones", "Solid Gold" and "Let's Go Home Together", her duet with Arthur.

In February 2018, it was announced that Henderson and Syco Music had parted ways. In a statement, a Syco representative stated: "Syco and Ella Henderson are parting company. We wish Ella all the best for the future and thank her for her hugely successful contribution over the years."<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Sarah|title=''X Factor'' star Ella Henderson has parted ways with Syco|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/the-x-factor/news/a850834/syco-ella-henderson-parted-ways-x-factor/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225235133/http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/the-x-factor/news/a850834/syco-ella-henderson-parted-ways-x-factor/|archive-date=25 February 2018|location=United Kingdom|language=en|date=25 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2018, Henderson confirmed that she had completed work on her second studio album.

She also supported Rudimental on their European tour that year.<ref name="major toms">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/rudimental-sign-ella-henderson-to-major-toms-asylum/074282|title=Rudimental sign Ella Henderson to Major Toms/Asylum|publisher=Music Week|date=30 October 2018|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Malt, Andy|url=http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/rudimental-sign-ella-henderson-to-major-toms-label/|title=Rudimental sign Ella Henderson to Major Toms label|work=[[Complete Music Update]]|publisher=UnLimited Media|date=1 November 2018|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> Regarding the scrapped material, Henderson later told ''[[i (newspaper)|i]]'': "I did write an album – well, I say an album, I wrote a body of work.
