==History==

=== Formation and ''These Are Lights'' (2009) ===
Most of the members of The Armed previously played in another band, Slicer Dicer, which, according to Tony Wolski, became The Armed.<ref name=":42">{{Cite news|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/08/27/make-%E2%80%98enemies%E2%80%99-with-the-armed/|title=MAKE 'ENEMIES' WITH THE ARMED {{!}} MetalSucks|date=27 August 2010|work=MetalSucks|access-date=15 November 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116064039/http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/08/27/make-%E2%80%98enemies%E2%80%99-with-the-armed/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Armed released their debut album ''These Are Lights'', mixed by [[Kurt Ballou]],<ref name=":42" /> for free in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/the-armed-these-are-lights/|title=The Armed – These Are Lights|work=[[Invisible Oranges]] - The Metal Blog|access-date=15 November 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116043334/http://www.invisibleoranges.com/the-armed-these-are-lights/|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolski explained the album's free release in an interview with ''Thrash Hits'': "Wanting people to actually ''hear'' the music made us give it away for free. We’ve all played in other bands for a while now, and whether it is good or not, it is undeniable that for the most part young people do not place the same sense of monetary value on recordings as they once did. People can argue about the ethics, but that is the fact. So you might as well try to adapt to that and control the situation on your own terms. Why let someone posting a horribly compressed torrent of your material dictate what ''most'' people are going to hear? Releasing it on our own allowed us to exercise some level of quality control. Also, we’re able to reach a lot further this way…for example, I doubt you guys would’ve heard our album if we were just shelling out half a dozen CDs at shows back in the States. And people actually hearing this stuff is by far the most important goal."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2009/12/the-armed-we-want-the-airwaves-back/|title=The Armed: "We want the airwaves back"|work=Thrash Hits|access-date=15 November 2018|language=en|archive-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116002116/http://www.thrashhits.com/2009/12/the-armed-we-want-the-airwaves-back/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''Only Love'' (2018–2020) ===
On 27 April 2018 The Armed released ''[[Only Love (album)|Only Love]],'' with [[Ben Koller]] providing drums.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/july-2018-ben-koller-on-the-armeds-only-love/|title=Ben Koller on the Armed's Only Love|work=Modern Drummer Magazine|access-date=15 November 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116001206/https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/july-2018-ben-koller-on-the-armeds-only-love/|url-status=live}}</ref> Koller explained in an interview with ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' that he was only sort of familiar with the band and knew they were "mysterious and total weirdos." Koller was informed by Ballou that the band was recording a new album and would love for Koller to track drums for it. Koller has said the request was short notice, and that the recording would take place right in the middle of tracking drums for a new Converge album, which seemed "[like it would be] pretty stressful." However, Koller heard that [[Robert Trujillo|Rob Trujillo]] would be playing bass on the album, which was "the selling point" to him. In fact, Trujillo was never involved in any capacity with the album. Koller was also told by fellow Converge bandmate and ''Only Love''<nowiki/>'s producer Kurt Ballou that the demos he was sent for this album were Converge songs, spurring him to learn them. Koller went on to say "...essentially, I was conned into playing on this album. I was so taken aback by these weird tactics that I just went with it."<ref name=":12" />

The Armed contributed the song "Night City Aliens" to ''[[Cyberpunk 2077]]'' under the pseudonym "Homeschool Dropouts".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metalinjection.net/av/new-music/converge-tomb-mold-the-armed-stream-new-song-from-cyberpunk-2077 |website=Metal Injection |title=CONVERGE, TOMB MOLD & THE ARMED Stream New Songs From Cyberpunk 2077 |date=11 December 2020 |access-date=18 January 2021 |archive-date=18 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118171052/https://metalinjection.net/av/new-music/converge-tomb-mold-the-armed-stream-new-song-from-cyberpunk-2077 |url-status=live }}</ref>
