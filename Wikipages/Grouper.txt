'''Groupers''' are [[fish]] of any of a number of [[genus|genera]] in the subfamily '''Epinephelinae''' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Serranidae]], in the order [[Perciformes]].

Not all serranids are called "groupers"; the family also includes the [[Bass (fish)|sea basses]]. The common name "grouper" is usually given to fish in one of two large [[genus|genera]]: ''[[Epinephelus]]'' and ''[[Mycteroperca]]''. In addition, the species classified in the small genera ''Anyperidon'', ''Cromileptes'', ''Dermatolepis'', ''Graciela'', ''Saloptia'', and ''Triso'' are also called "groupers". Fish in the genus ''[[Plectropomus]]'' are referred to as 'coral groupers. These genera are all classified in the subfamily Epiphelinae. However, some of the hamlets (genus ''Alphestes''), the hinds (genus ''Cephalopholis''), the [[yellow-edged lyretail|lyretails]] (genus ''Variola'') and some other small genera (''Gonioplectrus'', ''Niphon'', ''Paranthias'') are also in this subfamily, and occasional species in other serranid genera have common names involving the word "grouper". Nonetheless, the word "grouper" on its own is usually taken as meaning the subfamily Epinephelinae.

== Description ==
[[File: Only today I got to know this Fish better! What about you? (3852325083).jpg|thumb|left|Anatomy of a grouper]]

Groupers are [[Teleost]]s, typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They are not built for long-distance, fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and the largest is the [[Atlantic goliath grouper]] (''Epinephelus itajara'') which has been weighed at {{convert|399|kg|lb|abbr=off}} and a length of {{convert|2.43|m|ftin|frac=2|abbr=on}},<ref name = DF>{{cite web | url = https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/epinephelus-itajara/ | title = Epinephelus itajara | work = Discover Fish | author = Robert H. Robins | access-date = 8 June 2020 | publisher = Florida Museum}}</ref> though in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the [[pharynx]]. They habitually eat [[fish]], [[octopus]]es, and [[crustacean]]s. Some species prefer to [[Ambush predator|ambush their prey]], while other species are active predators. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, such as the [[giant grouper]] (''Epinephelus lanceolatus'') are unconfirmed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lieske |first1=E. |last2=Myers |first2=R. |year=1999 |title=Coral Reef Fishes |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691004815 |url-access=registration |edition=2 |isbn=0-691-02659-9}}</ref>

Their mouths and [[gill]]s form a powerful vacuum which pulls their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills.{{Cn|date=July 2021}}

Research indicates [[roving coralgrouper]]s (''Plectropomus pessuliferus'') sometimes cooperate with [[giant moray]]s in hunting.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Interspecific Communicative and Coordinated Hunting between Groupers and Giant Moray Eels in the Red Sea |year=2006 |publisher=Biology.plosjournals.org |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431 |last1=Bshary |first1=Redouan |last2=Hohner |first2=Andrea |last3=Ait-El-Djoudi |first3=Karim |last4=Fricke |first4=Hans |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=e431 |pmid=17147471 |pmc=1750927 |s2cid=14006488 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Groupers are also one of the only animals that eat invasive [[red lionfish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2011-07-reveals-grouper-lionfish-invasion.html |title=Study reveals grouper can help control lionfish invasion |year=2011 |publisher=Biology.plosjournals.org}}</ref>

==Systematics==

=== Etymology ===
The word "grouper" is from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name, ''garoupa'', which has been speculated to come from an indigenous South American language.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/81859 |title=s.v. (?)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grouper |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2010-09-11}}</ref>

In Australia, "groper" is used instead of "grouper" for several species, such as the [[Queensland grouper]] (''Epinephelus lanceolatus''). In New Zealand, "groper" refers to a type of wreckfish, ''Polyprion oxygeneios'', which goes by the [[Māori language|Māori]] name ''[[hāpuku]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/coastal-fish/6/2 |title=Coastal fish - Hāpuku - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2 March 2009 |access-date=2010-09-11}}</ref> In the [[Philippines]], groupers are generally known as ''lapu-lapu'' in [[Luzon]], while in the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] they are known as ''pugapo''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kohno |first1=Hiroshi |title=State of grouper (lapu-lapu) culture in the Philippines |journal=SEAFDEC Asian Aquaculture |date=1988 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=4–9 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77981077.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Eslao-Alix">{{cite news |last1=Eslao-Alix |first1=Louella |title=From Pugapo to Lapu-lapu |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/255075/from-pugapo-to-lapu-lapu |access-date=11 February 2021 |work=Cebu Daily News |date=1 September 2019}}</ref> In the [[Middle East]], the fish is known as '[[hamour|hammour]]', and is widely eaten, especially in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/travel/localdishes.asp |title=Food and Drink – Local Dishes |publisher=UAE Interact |url-status=dead |access-date=2011-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705003439/http://uaeinteract.com/travel/localdishes.asp |archive-date=5 July 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Carrington |first=Daisy |url=http://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/restaurants/features/5632-handling-hammour |title=Handling hammour |publisher=Time Out Abu Dhabi |date=19 January 2009 |access-date=2011-08-12}}</ref> In Latin America, the fish is known as '[[:es:Epinephelinae|mero]]'.

The species in the tribes Grammistini and Diploprionini secrete a mucus-like toxin in their skin called [[grammistin]] and when they are confined in a restricted space and subjected to stress the mucus produces a foam which is toxic to nearby fish, these fishes are often called soapfishes. They have been classified either as their own families or within subfamilies,<ref name = Randall1971>{{cite journal | author1 = John E.

== Reproduction ==
Groupers are mostly monandric [[protogynous hermaphrodite]]s, i.e. they mature only as females and have the ability to change sex after sexual maturity.<ref name="Erisman2009">Erisman, B. E., M. T. Craig, and P. A. Hastings. 2009. A phylogenetic test of the size-advantage model: Evolutionary changes in mating behavior influence the loss of sex change in a fish lineage.

Fishery Bulletin 109:123-134.</ref> Some species of groupers grow about a kilogram per year and are generally adolescent until they reach three kilograms when they become female.

However, some groupers are [[gonochoristic]].<ref name="Erisman2009" /> Gonochorism, or a reproductive strategy with two distinct sexes, has evolved independently in groupers at least five times.<ref name="Erisman2009" /> The evolution of gonochorism is linked to group spawning high amounts of habitat cover.<ref name="Erisman2009" /><ref name="Munoz" /><ref name="Erisman2008">Erisman, B.
