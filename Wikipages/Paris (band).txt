==History==
The group released two albums for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Paris (Paris album)|Paris]]'' and ''[[Big Towne, 2061]]'', both in 1976.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1903}}</ref> Paris toured in support of these albums, playing at arenas and auditoriums with [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]], [[Leslie West]], [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Head East]], [[Be-Bop Deluxe]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]], [[Nektar]] and [[Wishbone Ash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tourdatesearch.com/tourdates/artist/65/paris |title=TourDateSearch.com: Paris tour dates |access-date=9 April 2021 |website=Tourdatesearch.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/tourdates.php |title=Rush Concert Tour Dates Listing |access-date=9 April 2021 |website=Cygnus-x1.net }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/paris-featuring-bob-welch-glenn-cornick |title=Paris featuring Bob Welch & Glenn Cornick's Concert History |access-date=9 April 2021 |website=Concertarchives.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stonecityattractions.com/tidbits/concert-history/1970s |title=Stone City Attractions > Where the Music Comes First |access-date=9 April 2021 |website=Stonecityattractions.com }}</ref> After the first album, Mooney was replaced by [[Hunt Sales]], who had also played with Rundgren.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Initially the band's sound was rock-oriented, but later developed towards [[funk]], and represented a departure from Welch's work with Fleetwood Mac.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Cornick then departed the band and was replaced by Sales' brother [[Tony Fox Sales]]. A third album was planned, but Hunt Sales fell ill and after they did not achieve commercial success, the group split in 1977.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Songs from the aborted third Paris album were used for Welch's first solo album, ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', and the deal with Capitol was converted into a solo album deal for Welch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmlegacy.com/Bios/biobobwelch.html |title=Bob Welch bio at fmlegacy |access-date=4 September 2011 |website=Fmlegacy.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623132439/http://fmlegacy.com/Bios/biobobwelch.html |archivedate=23 June 2011 }}</ref>

After Paris split up, Welch launched a successful solo career, and Sales worked with [[Iggy Pop]] and later [[Tin Machine]] with [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bowiezone.com/#/hunt-sales/4550872429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050129000816/http://bowiezone.com/#/hunt-sales/4550872429 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 January 2005 |title=Hunt Sales at BowieZone |access-date=4 September 2011 |website=Bowiezone.com }}</ref> British-born Cornick moved to the US where, after a decade out of the music business, he reformed his band Wild Turkey in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.j-tull.com/musicians/pastmembers/glenncornick.html |title=Glenn Cornick at the official Jethro Tull website |access-date=4 September 2011 |website=J-tull.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815135747/http://www.j-tull.com/musicians/pastmembers/glenncornick.html |archivedate=15 August 2007 }}</ref>
