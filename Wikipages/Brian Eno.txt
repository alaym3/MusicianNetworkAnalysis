'''Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|RDI}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|n|oʊ}}; born '''Brian Peter George Eno''', 15 May 1948) is a British musician, composer, [[record producer]] and [[visual artist]] best known for his pioneering work in [[ambient music]] and contributions to [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[electronica]].<ref name="ankeny" /> A self-described "non-musician", Eno has helped introduce unique conceptual approaches and recording techniques to contemporary music.<ref name="ankeny" /><ref name="rs">{{cite web|title=Brian Eno Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/brian-eno/biography|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=28 April 2016}}</ref> He has been described as one of [[popular music]]'s most influential and innovative figures.<ref name="ankeny">{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-eno-mn0000617196/biography|title=Brian Eno {{!}} Biography & History|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=22 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Steadman |first=Ian |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/28/brian-eno-peter-chilvers-scape |title=Brian Eno on music that thinks for itself (Wired UK) |magazine=Wired UK |date= 28 September 2012|access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref>

Born in [[Suffolk]], Eno studied painting and [[experimental music]] at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at [[Winchester School of Art]]. He joined [[glam rock]] group [[Roxy Music]] as its [[synthesiser]] player in 1971, recording two albums with the group then departing in 1973 amidst tensions with the group's frontman [[Bryan Ferry]]. Eno recorded a number of solo albums beginning with ''[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]'' (1974). In the mid-1970s, he began exploring a [[minimal music|minimalist]] direction on releases such as ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975) and ''[[Ambient 1: Music for Airports]]'' (1978), coining the term "ambient music" with the latter.

Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including [[Robert Fripp]], [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Harold Budd]], [[David Bowie]], and [[David Byrne]]. He also established himself as a sought-after [[music producer|producer]], working on albums by [[John Cale]], [[Jon Hassell]], [[Laraaji]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Ultravox]], and [[Devo]], as well as the [[no wave]] compilation ''[[No New York]]'' (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently [[U2]] and [[Coldplay]], alongside work with artists such as [[Daniel Lanois]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Slowdive]], [[Karl Hyde]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Kevin Shields]], and [[Damon Albarn]].

Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including [[sound installations]], film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed [[Oblique Strategies]], a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur [[creativity|creative thinking]]. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] in 2009<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC news|date=19 March 2009|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-19/brian-eno-to-lead-new-sydney-festival/1623812|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref> and the [[Lovell Telescope]] at [[Jodrell Bank]] in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the [[Long Now Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://longnow.org/projects/|title=Projects - The Long Now|website=Longnow.org|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Eno was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Roxy Music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roxy Music|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roxy-music|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=30 March 2019|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Brian Peter George Eno was born on 15 May 1948 in the village of [[Melton, Suffolk]], the son of William Arnold Eno (1916–1988), a postal worker and clock and watch repairer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/united-kingdom-records-in-birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records/and_deaths-and-burials?firstname=william%20a&lastname=eno&yearofbirth=1916&yearofbirth_offset=2|title=findmypast.co.uk|website=Search.findmypast.co.uk|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> and Maria Alphonsine Eno (''née'' Buslot; 1922–2005),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/united-kingdom-records-in-birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records?firstname=maria%20alphonsine&lastname=eno&yearofbirth=1922&yearofbirth_offset=2&yearofdeath=2005&yearofdeath_offset=2|title=findmypast.co.uk|website=Search.findmypast.co.uk|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> a Belgian national.{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|pp=14–15}} Eno is the eldest of their three children; he has a brother, [[Roger Eno|Roger]], and sister Arlette.

In 1959, Eno attended [[St Joseph's College, Ipswich|St Joseph's College]] in Ipswich, a Catholic [[grammar school]] of the [[De La Salle Brothers]] order. His confirmation name is derived from the school, taking the name Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno.{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=27}} In 1964, after earning four O-levels, including one in art and maths, Eno had developed an interest in art and music and had no interest in a "conventional job".<ref name=NME77P1/> He enrolled at the [[Ipswich School of Art]], taking on the newly established Groundcourse foundation art degree established by [[New media art|new media]] artist [[Roy Ascott]].{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|pp=30–31}} Here, one of Eno's teachers was artist [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], who became a lifelong friend and encouraged his musical ability. Phillips recalled the pair doing "piano tennis" in which, after collecting pianos, the two stripped and aligned them in a hall and struck them with tennis balls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-brian-eno-and-tom-phillips-1198029.html|title=HOW WE MET: BRIAN ENO AND TOM PHILLIPS|date=1998-09-13|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> In 1966, Eno studied for a diploma in Fine Arts at the [[Winchester School of Art]], from which he graduated in 1969.{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=43}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.responsivelandscapes.com/readings/CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf |title=Cybernetics and Art : Cultural Convergence in the 1960s |author=Edward A.

Whilst at school, Eno used a [[tape recorder]] as a musical instrument{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=42}} and in 1964 he joined his first group, the Black Aces, a four-piece with Eno on drums that he formed with three friends he met at the youth club he visited in Melton.{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=29}} In late 1967, Eno pursued music once more, forming the Merchant Taylor's Simultaneous Cabinet, an [[avant-garde music]], art, and performance trio with two Winchester undergraduates.{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=50}} This was followed by short stints in multiple avant-garde and college groups, including The Maxwell Demon and Dandelion and The War Damage which featured Eno as frontman who adapted a theatrical persona on stage and later played the guitar.<ref name=NME77P1/>{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|pp=53–54}}

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2018}}

===1970s===
In 1969, after separating from his wife, Eno moved to London where his professional music career began. He became involved with the [[Scratch Orchestra]] and the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]; Eno's first appearance on a commercially released recording is the [[Deutsche Grammophon]] edition of ''The Great Learning'' (1971) by [[Cornelius Cardew]] and the Scratch Orchestra which features Eno as one of the voices on the track "Paragraph 7".{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=224}} Another early recording was the soundtrack to ''Berlin Horse'' (1970), a nine-minute avant-garde art film by [[Malcolm Le Grice]].{{sfn|Sheppard|2008|p=84}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://desistfilm.com/main-article |title=Malcolm Le Grice's 'Berlin Horse' |last=Beed |first=Catherine Jessica |date=20 April 2012 |website=Desistfilm |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> At one point, Eno had to earn money as paste-up assistant for the advertisement section of a local paper for three months. He quit and became an electronics dealer by buying old speakers and making new cabinets for them before selling them to friends.<ref name=NME77P1/>

In 1971, Eno co-formed the [[glam rock|glam]] and [[art rock]] band [[Roxy Music]]. He had a chance meeting with saxophonist [[Andy Mackay]] at a train station, which led to him joining the band. Eno later said: "If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, I probably would have been an art teacher now".<ref name="Prendergast">{{Cite book |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance: The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |last=Prendergast |first=Mark |year=2001 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/118 118] |isbn=978-1-58234-134-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/118 }}</ref> Eno played on their first two albums, ''[[Roxy Music (album)|Roxy Music]]'' (1972) and ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' (1973), and is credited as "Eno" with playing the [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3 synthesiser]], tape effects, backing vocals, and co-producer. Initially Eno did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the group's [[mixing console|mixing desk]] at the centre of the concert venue where he had a microphone to sing backup vocals. After the group secured a record deal, Eno joined them on stage performing the synthesiser<ref name=NME77P1>{{cite web|url=http://www.moredarkthanshark.org/eno_int_nme-nov77.html|title=Before and After Science - Part 1: Accidents Will Happen|first=Ian|last=MacDonald|date=26 November 1977|work=New Musical Express|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> and became known for his flamboyant costumes and makeup. After touring ''For Your Pleasure'' ended in mid-1973, Eno quit the band. He cited disagreements with lead singer [[Bryan Ferry]] and the frontman's insistence on being in command of the group, which affected Eno's ability to incorporate his own ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moredarkthanshark.org/eno_int_recor-aug73.html|title=Eno's sparkling with new ideas|first=Rick|last=Sanders|date=4 August 1973|work=Record Mirror|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Brian Eno - TopPop 1974 12.png|thumb|230px|Eno appearing on Dutch television in 1974]]
Almost immediately after his exit from Roxy Music, Eno embarked on his solo career. He released four albums of electronically inflected [[art pop]]:<ref>{{cite news|last=Tannenbaum|first=Rob|date=27 August 2002|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-08-27/music/steadfast-in-style/|title=Steadfast in Style|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|access-date=17 July 2013|quote=After two LPs, Eno left for a solo career, releasing briny albums of art-pop and inventing ambient music.}}</ref> ''[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]'' (1973), ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)]]'' (1974), ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975), and ''[[Before and After Science]]'' (1977). ''Tiger Mountain'' contains the "Third Uncle" which became one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later cover by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[801 (band)|801]]. Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is "a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref> During this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in [[801 (band)|801]], a supergroup that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers by [[The Beatles]]  and [[The Kinks]].

In 1973, [[King Crimson]] founder and guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] collaborated with Eno and his tape delay system to make experimental, ambient, and [[drone music]]. The result was ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973), released as their duo name of [[Fripp & Eno]].<ref name="BBCEquatorialStars">{{cite web|title = BBC – Experimental Review – Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|access-date = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Fripp subsequently referred to the tape delay recording method as [[Frippertronics]]. The pair followed their debut with a second album ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'' (1975), and completed a European tour. Eno produced the albums ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (1974) and ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'' (1974) by the Portsmouth Sinfonia, both of which feature Eno playing the clarinet. He also deployed the orchestra's dissonant string section on ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. Eno went on to work with several performers in the orchestra on his Obscure label, including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. Later in 1974, Eno and [[Kevin Ayers]] contributed music for the experimental/[[spoken word]] album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'' (1974) by poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].

==== Ambient music ====
{{Main|Ambient music}}
Eno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term "ambient music",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying ''[[Ambient 1: Music for Airports]]'', Eno wrote: "Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>

Eno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. "This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music – as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Eno's first work of ambient music was ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: ''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with American composer [[Laraaji]] playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').

===1980s===

Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele – Exzess und Bestrafung]]'' (1980), also known as ''Egon Schiele – Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.

Before Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' "[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' "Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the 'spacious' quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>

In 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.

In 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind (film)|For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|access-date=10 August 2019|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|access-date=10 August 2019|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|access-date=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

===1990s===
In September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}

During the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace – The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room (Brian Eno project)|The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>

In 1993, Eno worked with the Manchester rock band [[James (band)|James]] to produce two albums, [[Laid (album)|''Laid'']] and [[Wah Wah (album)|''Wah Wah'']]. ''Laid'' was met with notable critical and commercial success both in the UK and the United States after its release in 1993. ''Wah Wah'', in comparison, received a more lukewarm response after its release in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=James {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-mn0000112185/biography|access-date=19 June 2020|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref>

One of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, "[[Miss Sarajevo]]", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.

In 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996– )|access-date=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.

Eno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.

In early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web

An unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, "A Secret Life" and "Help Me Somebody". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.

[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]
In late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77&nbsp;million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of "77 Million Paintings" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.

Also in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled "Grafton Street" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name="qmag">Aizlewood, John.

In January 2016, a new Eno ambient soundscape was premiered as part of [[Michael Benson (filmmaker)|Michael Benson]]'s planetary photography exhibition "Otherworlds" in the Jerwood Gallery of London's Natural History Museum. In a statement Eno commented on the unnamed half-hour piece: {{quote|We can't experience space directly; those few who've been out there have done so inside precarious cocoons. They float in silence, for space has no air, nothing to vibrate – and therefore no sound. Nonetheless we can't resist imagining space as a sonic experience, translating our feelings about it into music. In the past we saw the universe as a perfect, divine creation – logical, finite, deterministic – and our art reflected that. The discoveries of the Space age have revealed instead a chaotic, unstable and vibrant reality, constantly changing. This music tries to reflect that new understanding.}}

===Record producer===
{{Listen

 |title = "Dune Prophecy Theme"
 |description =}}

From the beginning of his solo career in 1973, Eno was in demand as a record producer. The first album with Eno credited as producer was ''[[Lucky Leif and the Longships]]'' by [[Robert Calvert]]. Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for [[Talking Heads]], [[U2]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]] and [[James (band)|James]]. He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].

Eno describes himself as a "non-musician", using the term "treatments" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill in using the studio as a compositional tool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&nbsp;– The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref> led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being "Eno".

Eno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the "Prophecy Theme" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.

He worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977–79 '[[Berlin Trilogy]]' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on ''Low'' were largely created by Eno, who played a portable [[EMS Synthi A]] synthesiser. Producer [[Tony Visconti]] used an [[Eventide, Inc|Eventide Harmonizer]] to alter the sound of the drums, claiming that the audio processor "f–s with the fabric of time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-bowie-berlin-trilogy/ |title=The History of David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy: 'Low,' 'Heroes' and 'Lodger' |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=27 June 2013 |access-date=11 January 2016}}</ref> After [[Death of David Bowie|Bowie died]] in early 2016, Eno said that he and Bowie had been talking about taking ''Outside'', the last album they'd worked on together, "somewhere new", and expressed regret that they wouldn't be able to pursue the project.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Kev|last1=Geoghegan |first2=Emma |last2=Saunders |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/entertainment-arts-35278886 |title=Reaction to David Bowie's death |work=[[BBC Online]] |date=11 January 2016|access-date=11 January 2016}}</ref>

Eno co-produced ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' (1984), ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987), ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' (1991), and ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) for U2 with his frequent collaborator [[Daniel Lanois]], and produced 1993's ''[[Zooropa]]'' with [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included "[[Your Blue Room]]" and "[[Miss Sarajevo]]".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah (album)|Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for "frequent interference and occasional co-production" on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.

Eno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. He remixed two tracks for [[Depeche Mode]], "[[I Feel You]]" and "[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]", both single releases from the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of "[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]" by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single.

In 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]], ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for "production consultation" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.

In 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed "enoxification" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.

===The Microsoft Sound===
In 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|access-date=18 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104221227/http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|archive-date=4 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], "The Microsoft Sound". In an interview with [[Joel Selvin]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' he said:

{{quote|The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, "Here's a specific problem – solve it."

The thing from the agency said, "We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional," this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said "and it must be {{frac|3|1|4}} seconds long."<ref group="†" name="MSSound">The eventual length of The Microsoft Sound as supplied and used was roughly 6 seconds, not {{frac|3|1|4}}.</ref>

I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel.

In fact, I made eighty-four pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.<ref>{{Cite news|author=[[Joel Selvin]], Chronicle Pop Music Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Q-and-A-With-Brian-Eno-2979740.php |title=Q and A With Brian Eno |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2 June 1996 |access-date=19 June 2012}}</ref>}}

Eno shed further light on the composition of the sound on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]'', admitting that he created it using a [[Macintosh]] computer, stating "I wrote it on a Mac. I've never used a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] in my life; I don't like them."<ref>{{Cite news |author=Adam Bunker, Technology Journalist |url=http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2011/11/23/brian-eno-spills-windows-start-up-sound-secrets/ |title=Brian Eno spills Windows start-up sound secrets |work=Electricpig |date=23 November 2011 |access-date=23 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524194038/http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2011/11/23/brian-eno-spills-windows-start-up-sound-secrets/ |archive-date=24 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Video work===
Eno has spoken of an early and ongoing interest in exploring light in a similar way to his work with sound. He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:

"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic."<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' "My Light Years". pp. 2.</ref>

The [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). "My Light Years". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:

"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting&nbsp;... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |access-date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

These works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). "My Light Years". pp. 5.</ref>

Eno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). "My Light Years". pp. 6–8.</ref>

===Generative music===
Eno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: "I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders."
<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|access-date=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

Initially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.

In 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.

====''Generative Music 1''====
In 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''—only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)—both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).

====Released excerpts====
Eno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':

{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable – they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music – Brian Eno – In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}

Several of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations. Most notably ''The Shutov Assembly'' (view [[The Shutov Assembly#Overview|breakdown of Album's sources]]), ''Contra 1.2'' thru to ''Compact Forest Proposal'', ''Lux'', ''CAM'', and ''The Ship''.

====Installations====
{{summarize section|date=May 2019}}
Eno has created installations combining artworks and sound that have shown across the world since 1979, beginning with 2 Fifth Avenue and White Fence, in the Kitchen Centre, [[New York, NY]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lumenlondon.com/thepast|title=Brian Eno - Home|website=Brian Eno - Home|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> Typically Eno's installations feature light as a medium explored in multi-screen configurations, and music that is created to blur the boundaries between itself and its surroundings:

"There is a sharp distinction between "music" and "noise", just as there is a distinction between the musician and the audience. I like blurring those distinctions – I like to work with all the complex sounds on the way out to the horizon, to pure noise, like the hum of London."<ref>Anthony Korner, Aurora Musicals, interview with Brian Eno Artforum 24 Summer 1986.

David A. Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: "In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented "Muzak" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>

Early installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. "2 Fifth Avenue", ("a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports") resulted from Eno shooting "the view from his apartment window: without&nbsp;... intervention," recording "what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time&nbsp;... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas.&nbsp;... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116–117 {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref>

From the outset, Eno's video works, were "more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema".<ref name="auto1">My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref> The author and artist [[John Coulthart]] called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980–81), which incorporated music from [[Ambient 4: On Land]], "The first ambient film." He explains: "Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980–81. The low-grade equipment&nbsp;... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality. Lack of a tripod meant filming with the camera lying on its side so the tape had to be re-viewed with a television monitor also turned on its side."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2013/07/05/mistaken-memories-of-mediaeval-manhattan/|title=Mistaken Memories Of Mediaeval Manhattan|date=5 July 2013|website=Johncoulthart.com|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> And turning the TV on its side, says David A. Ross, "recontextualize[d] the television set, and&nbsp;... subliminally shift[ed] the way the video image represents recognizable realities&nbsp;... Natural phenomena like rain look quite different in this orientation; less familiar but curiously more real."<ref name="berkeley.edu">{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

Thursday Afternoon was a return to using figurative form, for Eno had by now begun "to think that I could use my TVs as light sources rather than as image sources.&nbsp;... TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented – because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesiser, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range."<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>

Turning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. "The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence."<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>

Calling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>

By positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.

Envisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, "sculptural objects [that]&nbsp;... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html]</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).

Since ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135–137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>

In the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: "Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses."<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.

The Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as "tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>

The continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. "One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less "dramatic" and more sensual."<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. "Compact Forest Proposal" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: "During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>

In Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77&nbsp;Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.

====77 Million Paintings====
Developments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable [[generative art]] and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. "One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined…" <ref name="auto2">Painting by Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>

Most (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier ''Natural Selections'' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale di Milano|Triennale in Milan]]. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>

For the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Markgraph,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.markgraph.de/projekte|title=Projects|website=Markgraph.de|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref> used new technology by Dataton<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dataton.com/us/|title=WATCHOUT and media servers for multi displays|website=Dataton.com|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref> that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>"My Light Years" by Brian Eno. ''77&nbsp;Million Paintings'' accompanying booklet, HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for ''77&nbsp;Million'', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.

With the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: "Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. …The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows."<ref name="auto2"/>

Although designed for the domestic environment, ''77&nbsp;Million Paintings'' has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (the Arcos di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/18/surgeon-prescribes-brian-eno-to-patients |title=Surgeon prescribes Brian Eno to patients |last=Brown |first=Mark |date=18 April 2013| website=The Guardian |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then ''77&nbsp;Million'' and Eno's latest "Light Boxes" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2013/04/brian-eno-uk-doctor-patients-relaxation |title=Brian Eno's Music Prescribed to Patients Who Need to Chill Out |last=McGovern |first=Kyle |date=18 April 2013| website=Spin |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref>

====Montefiore Hospital Installations====
In 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|access-date=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area "77 Million Paintings for Montefiore" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named "Quiet Room for Montefiore" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.

====''Spore''====
Eno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.

====iOS apps====
Inspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:

* [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']] (2008)
* ''Trope'' (2009)
* ''Scape'' (2012)
* ''Reflection'' (2016)

In 2009, Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well)—based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |magazine=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>

====Reflection====
The generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause – later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:

{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.

In other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.

As a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time. To access it, simply update REFLECTION in the App Store and follow the instructions when you open the app on your device. The download will be available until 28th February [2017].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1580788841935301|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref> and the App's Apples iTunes page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brian-eno-reflection/id1180524479?mt=8|title=Brian Eno : Reflection on the App Store|website=App Store|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}

Previous to the updates for the App, the iTunes page used the following from Eno. 
{{Quote|text=Reflection is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far.

My original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time – 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings – whether vinyl, cassette or CD – are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form – on vinyl or CD – is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.

The creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode – a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time – many days and weeks in fact – seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}

The version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:

{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?

[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.

[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?

[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music – Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}

===Artworks: Light Boxes===
Eno's "light boxes" utilise advances in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in ''[[Kite Stories]]'' (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist [[Michael Bracewell (writer)|Michael Bracewell]] writes that the viewer "is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself". He likens Eno's art to "Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding."<ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell. Paul Stolper. {{ISBN|978-0-9552154-9-0}}</ref>

First shown commercially at the [[Paul Stolper Gallery]] in London (forming the ''Light Music'' exhibition in 2016 that included lenticular paintings by Eno),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulstolper.com/exhibitions/works/85-brian-eno|title=Brian Eno Exhibition Works - Paul Stolper - Contemporary Art Gallery - London|website=Paulstolper.com|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> light boxes have been shown across the world. They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's light paintings have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.

===Obscure Records===
Eno started the [[Obscure Records]] label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''[[The Sinking of the Titanic (Bryars)|The Sinking of the Titanic]]'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of German [[Baroque music|baroque]] componist [[Johann Pachelbel]]'s ''[[Canon in D|Canon]]'', the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Robert Fripp, most notably on ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].
