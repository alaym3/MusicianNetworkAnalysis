'''Martha Ivelisse Pesante Rodríguez''' (born March 4, 1972), known professionally as '''Ivy Queen''', is a Puerto Rican singer, rapper, songwriter, and actress. She is considered one of the pioneers of the reggaeton genre, commonly referred to as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Reggaeton]]. 

Queen began her career as a member of the all-male collective [[The Noise (band)|The Noise]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.largeup.com/2012/01/05/throwback-thursdays-wayne-marshall-on-the-noise-6-feat-ivy-queen-friends/|title=Throwback Thursdays: Wayne Marshall on 'The Noise 6' feat. Ivy Queen + Friends|website=LargeUp|date=January 5, 2012|access-date=March 7, 2016}}</ref> There, she performed her first song "Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes" ''(We are Rappers, Not Delinquents)''. Queen went solo in 1996, and released her debut studio album ''[[En Mi Imperio]] (In My Empire)'' which was quickly picked up by [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Discos]] for distribution in 1997. 

She later released ''[[The Original Rude Girl]]'', her second studio album for Sony label, which spawned the hit single "[[In the Zone (song)|In the Zone]]". However, Ivy Queen did not rise to fame until she moved to an independent record label to release her third studio album, ''[[Diva (Ivy Queen album)|Diva]]'' in 2003. Queen's albums ''Diva'', ''[[Flashback (Ivy Queen album)|Flashback]]'', and ''[[Sentimiento (album)|Sentimiento]]'' have all been awarded Gold and Platinum record status by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Her seventh studio album ''[[Drama Queen (Ivy Queen album)|Drama Queen]]'' was released in 2010, and spawned a top ten single "[[La Vida es Así]]". It was followed by the Grammy Award-nominated ''[[Musa (album)|Musa]]'' in 2012. Queen's recordings often include themes of female empowerment, socio-political issues, infidelity, and relationships.

Ivy Queen is one of the wealthiest reggaeton artists and had a net worth of $10 million in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latintimes.com/richest-reggaeton-artists-15-urban-music-singers-fat-bank-accounts-and-fit-bodies-420781|title=Richest Reggaeton Artists: 15 Urban Music Singers with Fat Bank Accounts and Fit Bodies|work=[[Latin Times]]|author=Gomez, Shirley|date=July 18, 2017|access-date=September 24, 2018|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]}}</ref>

==Musical career==

===1995–99: The Noise, ''En Mi Imperio'' and ''The Original Rude Girl''===
When she was 18, Ivy Queen moved to San Juan, where she met rapper and producer DJ Negro. In 1995, Queen joined an all-male Puerto Rican group called the Noise, at the invitation of DJ Negro. The group became part of the emerging reggaeton scene. DJ Negro began producing a series of CDs centered around the Noise. Ivy Queen made her first appearance on the fifth installment of the CD series on a track called "Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes". She became tired of the violent and sexual themes often used in reggaeton, and wished to write about a wider variety of subjects.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/ivy-queen-p224845|title=Ivy Queen - Biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

DJ Negro convinced Queen to go solo, and in 1997 she recorded her first solo album, ''[[En Mi Imperio]]''{{mdash}}which featured the hit single "[[Como Mujer]]"{{mdash}}for [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Discos]].

The album included collaborations with artists including [[Fat Joe]], [[La India]], [[Héctor Delgado]], and [[Getto & Gastam]]. American hip-hop producer [[Swizz Beatz]] produced the track "Soldados".<ref name="Caracol"/> The album was released on November 16, 2004, and spawneed the Top 10 single "[[Dile (Ivy Queen song)|Dile]]" which was nominated for "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female".<ref name="AwardsBillboard"/>

"I’m single. For the first time in my life, I’m really experiencing what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album."

}} Queen said that to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, she would have to deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, "God blessed me with a powerful voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice."<ref name="Si Una Vez"/> Queen also stated that her achievements are all due to the fact that she is an artist who, “always [has] something to say, something to contribute. [She] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [Men saw that] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say”.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRMEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=March 31, 2007|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> She created music people's bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment with lyric like in "Quiero Baliar" where she states "Yo quiero bailar/Tu quieres sudar/Y pegarte a mi/El cuerpo rozar/Yo te digo sí, tu me puedes provocar/Eso no quiere decir que pa' la cama voy". In these lyric she explicitly states she wants to dance, and her partner wants to sweat, and as long as she gives her partner the go ahead they can excite her, but this rapport should not be taken to imply sexual access or consent. According to Ivy, men commonly misinterpret consent to dance with sexual interest within reggaeton dance culture. Since beginning her career, Queen has wanted to create and compose songs "that have some kind of subject matter" so that people understand the concept and message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2012/08/28/ivy-queen-thrives-in-male-dominated-reggaeton/|title=Ivy Queen thrives in make-dominated reggaeton|work=Fox News Latino|publisher=Fox News Network, L.L.C.|date=August 21, 2012|access-date=January 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514012437/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2012/08/28/ivy-queen-thrives-in-male-dominated-reggaeton/|archive-date=May 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak.
