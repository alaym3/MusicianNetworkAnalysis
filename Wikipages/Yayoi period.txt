The {{nihongo|'''Yayoi period'''|{{linktext|弥生|時代}}|Yayoi jidai}} started at the beginning of the [[Neolithic]] in Japan, continued through the [[Bronze Age]], and towards its end crossed into the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="Silberman2012"/><ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"/><ref name="Shinya"/>

Since the 1980s, scholars have argued that a period previously classified as a transition from the [[Jōmon period]] should be reclassified as Early Yayoi.<ref>{{cite book |surname=Habu |given=Junko |title=Ancient Jomon of Japan |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-77670-7 |page=258}}</ref> The date of the beginning of this transition is controversial, with estimates ranging from the 10th to the 6th centuries BC.<ref name="Shinya">{{cite journal |url=http://www.seaa-web.org/bul-essay-01.htm |title=A Comment on the Yayoi Period Dating Controversy |journal=Bulletin of the Society for East Asian Archaeology |surname=Shōda |given=Shinya |year=2007 |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Archaeology of Japan: From the Earliest Rice Farming Villages to the Rise of the State |given=Koji |surname=Mizoguchi |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-88490-7 |pages=35–36 }}</ref>

The period is named after the [[Yayoi, Tokyo|neighborhood]] of [[Tokyo]] where [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] first uncovered artifacts and features from that era. Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new [[Yayoi pottery]] styles and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in [[paddy field]]s. A hierarchical social class structure dates from this period and has its origin in China. Techniques in [[metallurgy]] based on the use of [[bronze]] and [[iron]] were also introduced from China via Korea to Japan in this period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The Yayoi followed the Jōmon period (14,000 BC – 1,000 BC) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern [[Kyūshū]] to northern [[Honshū]]. Archaeological evidence supports the idea that during this time, an influx of farmers (Yayoi People) from the Korean Peninsula to Japan overwhelmed, and mixed with the native [[hunter-gatherer]] population (Jomon People).

== History ==

===Origin of the Yayoi people===
{{Main|Yayoi people}}
{{See also|Genetic history of East Asians}}

[[File:Korea Strait.png|thumb|left|Northern Kyushu is the part of Japan closest to the Asian mainland.]]

The origin of Yayoi culture and the [[Yayoi people]] has long been debated. The earliest archaeological sites are Itazuke or Nabata in the northern part of Kyūshū. Contacts between fishing communities on this coast and the southern coast of Korea date from the Jōmon period, as witnessed by the exchange of trade items such as fishhooks and obsidian.<ref>Mizoguchi (2013), p. 54.</ref> During the Yayoi period, [[Korean influence on Japanese culture|cultural features from Korea]] and China arrived in this area at various times over several centuries, and later spread to the south and east.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = The earliest societies in Japan | given = J. Edward Jr. | surname = Kidder | pages = 48–107 | title = Cambridge History of Japan, vol. 1: Ancient Japan | editor-given = Delmer | editor-surname = Brown | editor-link = Delmer Brown | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-521-22352-2}} p. 81.</ref> This was a period of mixture between immigrants and the indigenous population, and between new cultural influences and existing practices.<ref>Mizoguchi (2013), p. 53.</ref>

Chinese influence was obvious in the bronze and copper weapons, [[Bronze mirror|dōkyō]], [[dōtaku]], as well as irrigated paddy rice cultivation. Three major symbols of Yayoi culture are the bronze mirror, the bronze sword, and the royal seal stone.

Between 1996 and 1999, a team led by Satoshi Yamaguchi, a researcher at Japan's [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], compared Yayoi remains found in Japan's [[Yamaguchi Prefecture|Yamaguchi]] and [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]] prefectures with those from China's coastal [[Jiangsu]] province and found many similarities between the Yayoi and the Jiangsu remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html|title=Long Journey to Prehistorical Japan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421054014/http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html|archive-date=21 April 2015|publisher=National Science Museum of Japan|language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel.com/prehist/news111.htm |title=Yayoi linked to Yangtze area: DNA tests reveal similarities to early wet-rice farmers|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=March 19, 1999}}</ref>

Many scholars claimed that Korean influence existed. [[Mark J. Hudson]] has cited archaeological evidence that included "bounded paddy fields, new types of polished stone tools, wooden farming implements, iron tools, weaving technology, ceramic storage jars, exterior bonding of clay coils in pottery fabrication, ditched settlements, domesticated pigs, and jawbone rituals".<ref>{{cite book | author=Mark J. Hudson | title=Ruins of Identity Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands | publisher =University Hawai'i Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8248-2156-4}}</ref> The migrant transfusion from the Korean peninsula gains strength because Yayoi culture began on the north coast of Kyūshū, where Japan is closest to Korea.

Some scholars argue that the rapid increase of roughly four million people in Japan between the Jōmon and Yayoi periods cannot be explained by migration alone. They attribute the increase primarily to a shift from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural diet on the islands, with the introduction of rice. It is quite likely that rice cultivation and its subsequent deification allowed for a slow and gradual population increase.<ref>Mizoguchi (2013), p. 119.</ref> Regardless, there is archaeological evidence that supports the idea that there was an influx of farmers from the continent to Japan that absorbed or overwhelmed the native hunter-gatherer population.<ref name="Diamond"/>

Some pieces of Yayoi pottery clearly show the influence of Jōmon ceramics. In addition, the Yayoi lived in the same type of pit or circular dwelling as that of the Jōmon. Other examples of commonality are chipped stone tools for hunting, bone tools for fishing, shells in bracelet construction, and lacquer decoration for vessels and accessories.

According to several linguists, Japonic was present on large parts of the southern Korean peninsula. These "Peninsular Japonic languages" were replaced by [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic-speakers]] (possibly belonging to the [[Han languages|Han-branch]]) likely causing the Yayoi migration.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Janhunen |first=Juha |date=2010 |title=Reconstructing the Language Map of Prehistorical Northeast Asia |journal=Studia Orientalia |number=108|quote=... there are strong indications that the neighbouring Baekje state (in the southwest) was predominantly Japonic-speaking until it was linguistically Koreanized.}}</ref><ref name=":1">Vovin, Alexander (2013). "From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean". ''Korean Linguistics''. '''15''' (2): 222–240.</ref> Similarly Whitman (2012) suggests that the Yayoi are not related to the proto-Koreans but that they were present on the Korean peninsula during the [[Mumun pottery period]]. According to him, Japonic arrived in the Korean peninsula around 1500 BC and was brought to the Japanese archipelago by the Yayoi at around 950 BC. The language family associated with both Mumun and Yayoi culture is Japonic. Koreanic arrived later from Manchuria to the Korean peninsula at around 300 BC and coexist with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later [[founder effect]] diminished the internal variety of both language families.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitman|first=John|date=2011-12-01|title=Northeast Asian Linguistic Ecology and the Advent of Rice Agriculture in Korea and Japan|journal=Rice|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=149–158|doi=10.1007/s12284-011-9080-0|issn=1939-8433|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Classification of the Japonic languages}}
Most linguists and archaeologists agree that the [[Japonic languages|Japonic language family]] was introduced to and spread through the archipelago during the Yayoi period.

===Emergence of ''Wo'' in Chinese history texts ===
[[File:King of Na gold seal faces.jpg|thumb|The golden seal said to have been granted to the "King of [[Wo (Japan)|Wo]]" by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] in 57 AD. It is inscribed ''King of Na of Wo in Han Dynasty'' (漢委奴國王)]]
The earliest written records about people in Japan are from [[China|Chinese]] sources from this period. [[Wo (Japan)|Wo]], the pronunciation of an early Chinese name for Japan, was mentioned in 57 AD; the [[Nakoku|Na state]] of Wo received a golden seal from the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] of the Later [[Han dynasty]]. This event was recorded in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' compiled by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] in the 5th century. The seal itself was discovered in northern Kyūshū in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.city.fukuoka.jp/en/exhibition.html|title=Gold Seal (Kin-in)|publisher=Fukuoka City Museum|access-date=2007-11-10}}</ref> Wo was also mentioned in 257 in the ''Wei zhi'', a section of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' compiled by the 3rd-century scholar [[Chen Shou]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.jp/mb1527/wajinden.htm 魏志倭人伝] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016074410/http://www.geocities.jp/mb1527/wajinden.htm |date=2010-10-16 }}, Chinese texts and its Japanese translation</ref>

Early Chinese historians described Wo as a land of hundreds of scattered tribal communities rather than the unified land with a 700-year tradition as laid out in the 8th-century work ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', a partly mythical, partly historical account of Japan which dates the foundation of the country at 660 BC. Archaeological evidence also suggests that frequent conflicts between settlements or statelets broke out in the period. Many excavated settlements were moated or built at the tops of hills. Headless human skeletons<ref>{{Cite book|last=Huffman|first=James L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNzQCwAAQBAJ&q=yoshinogari+headless+skeletons&pg=PA10|title=Japan in World History|date=2010-02-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970974-8|language=en}}</ref> discovered in [[Yoshinogari site]] are regarded as typical examples of finds from the period. In the coastal area of the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]], stone arrowheads are often found among funerary objects.

Third-century Chinese sources reported that the [[Wajin (ancient people)|Wa people]] lived on raw fish, vegetables, and rice served on bamboo and wooden trays, clapped their hands in worship (something still done in [[Shinto shrine]]s today), and built earthen-grave mounds. They also maintained vassal-master relations, collected taxes, had provincial granaries and markets, and observed mourning. Society was characterized by violent struggles.

===Yamataikoku===
[[File:Hashihaka-kofun-1.jpg|thumb|right|Hashihaka kofun, [[Sakurai, Nara]]]]
The ''Wei Zhi'' ({{zh|魏志}}), which is part of the Records of the three Kingdoms, first mentions [[Yamataikoku]] and Queen [[Himiko]] in the 3rd century. According to the record, Himiko assumed the throne of Wa, as a spiritual leader, after a [[Civil war of Wa|major civil war]]. Her younger brother was in charge of the affairs of state, including diplomatic relations with the Chinese court of the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]].<ref>[http://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/%E9%AD%8F%E5%BF%97%E5%80%AD%E4%BA%BA%E4%BC%9D 魏志倭人伝], Chinese texts of the ''Wei Zhi'', [[Wikisource]]</ref> When asked about their origins by the Wei embassy, the people of Wa claimed to be descendants of the [[Taibo]] of [[Wu (region)|Wu]], a historic figure of the [[Wu (state)|Wu Kingdom]] around the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze Delta]] of China.

For many years, the location of Yamataikoku and the identity of Queen Himiko have been subject of research. Two possible sites, [[Yoshinogari, Saga|Yoshinogari]] in [[Saga Prefecture]] and [[Makimuku]] in [[Nara Prefecture]] have been suggested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/1446|title=ヤマト王権はいかにして始まったか|last=Karako-kagi Archaeological Museum|date=2007|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> Recent archaeological research in Makimuku suggests that Yamataikoku was located in the area.<ref>[http://www.nikkei.co.jp/news/shakai/20080306AT5C0501C05032008.html 古墳２タイプ、同時に出現か・奈良の古墳群で判明]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Nikkei Net, March 6, 2008</ref><ref>[http://sankei.jp.msn.com/culture/academic/080306/acd0803060039001-n1.htm 最古級の奈良・桜井“３兄弟古墳”、形状ほぼ判明　卑弥呼の時代に相次いで築造] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308193428/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/culture/academic/080306/acd0803060039001-n1.htm |date=2008-03-08 }}, Sankei Shimbun, March 6, 2008</ref> Some scholars assume that the Hashihaka kofun in Makimuku was the tomb of Himiko. Its relation to the origin of the Yamato polity in the following [[Kofun period]] is also under debate.
