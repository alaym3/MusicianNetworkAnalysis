'''Flight of the Conchords''' is a New Zealand comedy duo composed of musicians [[Bret McKenzie]] and [[Jemaine Clement]]. Beginning as a popular New Zealand live comedy act in the early 2000s, the duo's comedy and music became the basis of the self-titled [[Flight of the Conchords (radio series)|BBC radio series]] (2004) and then the [[HBO]] [[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|American television series]] (2007–2009). 

The duo's live performances have gained them a worldwide [[cult following]],<ref>{{cite web|date=16 August 2007|title=Conchords Take Flight on Prime|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0708/S00197.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116161036/https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0708/S00197.htm|archive-date=16 November 2020|access-date=18 August 2007|publisher=[[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime TV]]}}</ref> and they continue to tour periodically. They were named Best Alternative Comedy Act at the 2005 [[US Comedy Arts Festival]] and Best Newcomer at the [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]], and received a nomination for the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] at the [[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] for their show at Edinburgh venue The Caves. More recently in 2018, they released the live HBO comedy special ''[[Live in London (Flight of the Conchords album)|Live in London]]''. The special was concurrently released by [[Sub Pop]] as their fifth album.

Previously, they referred to themselves as "New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo"; as of 2014, however, they refer to themselves as "the almost award-winning fourth-most-popular folk duo in New Zealand".<ref>{{cite web |title=What the Folk! |url=http://www.whatthefolk.net/ |access-date=20 April 2014}}</ref>

==Career history==

=== 1998–2006: Early years ===
McKenzie and Clement were flatmates at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where they were studying film and theatre before forming Flight of the Conchords in 1998. They first performed as part of a five-man group called [[So You're a Man]], which included [[Taika Waititi]] and debuted at Wellington's [[BATS Theatre]], garnering a small but loyal following in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=nytimes>Itzkoff, Dave.

During this period, they had television development deals with [[Channel 4]] in the UK, [[NBC]] in the United States, and [[TVNZ]] in New Zealand but, ultimately, shows were not produced.<ref name="bbc2" /> In 2006, they performed at the [[South by Southwest]] Music Festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. While in Texas, they recorded a documentary titled ''Flight of the Conchords: A Texan Odyssey'', which aired on New Zealand's [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] in late 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.co.nz/production/entry/flight_of_the_conchords_a_texan_odyssey/|access-date=25 August 2007|title=Flight of the Conchords: A Texan Odyssey|work=What the Folk!|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071936/http://www.gibson.co.nz/production/entry/flight_of_the_conchords_a_texan_odyssey/|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref>[[File:Flight of the Conchords.jpg|right|thumb|241x241px|Flight of the Conchords performing at [[Cirkus (Stockholm)|Cirkus]] in Stockholm, Sweden in May 2010.]]

On 23 August 2013, Flight of the Conchords co-headlined the Oddball & Curiosity Festival with [[Dave Chappelle]], kicking off the tour in Austin, Texas. In 2016, the duo performed new songs alongside old favourites on a North American tour; they also appeared at the 2016 [[Newport Folk Festival]] in Newport, Rhode Island. 

In 2018, Flight of the Conchords reunited for ''[[Live in London (Flight of the Conchords album)|Flight of the Conchords: Live in London]]'', a one-hour TV special on HBO.<ref name="2018 TV Series">{{cite web|date=7 October 2018|title=Flight of the Conchords live in London remind us they're not just funny, they're seriously good|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/107367299/flight-of-the-conchords-live-in-london-remind-us-theyre-not-just-funny-theyre-seriously-good|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116161031/https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/107367299/flight-of-the-conchords-live-in-london-remind-us-theyre-not-just-funny-theyre-seriously-good|archive-date=16 November 2020|access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="nytimes hbo london">{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=5 October 2018|title=Laughter, and Time, Heal All Wounds|page=C11|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/television/flight-of-the-conchords-hbo.html|url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=3 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116161048/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/television/flight-of-the-conchords-hbo.html|archive-date=16 November 2020}}</ref>

==Related projects==
Both McKenzie and Clement appeared alongside Rhys Darby in a horror comedy titled ''[[Diagnosis: Death]]'', though not as Flight of the Conchords. The film was released on 3 August 2009. They have also each appeared in several films separately: Clement in ''[[Men in Black 3]]'', ''[[Eagle vs Shark]]'', ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]'', ''[[Gentlemen Broncos]]'',  ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (which featured songs by McKenzie), and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'', and McKenzie in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', ''[[Austenland (film)|Austenland]]'' and ''[[Two Little Boys (film)|Two Little Boys]]''. 

The song "I'm Not Crying" appears in the film ''[[The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!]]''. In 2014, both Clement and Rhys Darby starred in the horror comedy mockumentary titled ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'', directed by Clement and [[Taika Waititi]].

== Style ==

=== Instrumentation ===
Most commonly, the duo both play [[acoustic guitar]] in live performances, with McKenzie almost always playing a standard grand concert-style acoustic guitar and Clement playing a [[parlor guitar]] and sometime a [[classical guitar]]. For some songs, Clement plays [[acoustic bass guitar]].

They commonly employ 1980s-era novelty instruments like the Casio DG-20 [[guitar synthesizer]] and [[Omnichord]], in addition to glockenspiel, bongos, and [[autoharp]], among others. In the past decade, they have expanded their instrumentation; more recent performances, like those during their 2018 tour of United Kingdom and Ireland, saw both playing [[Bass guitar|electric bass guitar]] (with Clement playing a [[Höfner 500/1]]) and using [[Effects unit|effect pedals]]. Since 2008, they have collaborated with musician [[Nigel Collins (musician)|Nigel Collins]], who plays cello, keyboards, and percussion, for both studio and live performances.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 8, 2009|title=On the road with Flight of the Conchords|url=https://sonicscoop.com/2009/09/08/on-the-road-with-flight-of-the-conchords/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-23|website=sonicscoop.com}}</ref>
