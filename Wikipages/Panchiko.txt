The EP was first published in 2000 with roughly 30 self-produced copies on [[CD-R]]. These were shared among friends with a few copies being sent out to reviewers and labels. Despite receiving some interest from [[Fierce Panda]], the band remained unsigned and disbanded shortly after.<ref name=bandcamp/> ''D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L'' has been compared to [[emo music]], [[industrial music]], [[dream pop]], and [[psychedelic music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tapedeckpodcast.com/spectreview-panchiko-deathmetal/ |title=Spectreview: Panchiko – D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L |last=Moura |first=Rob |date=25 February 2020 |website=The Tape Deck |access-date=13 July 2021}}</ref>
