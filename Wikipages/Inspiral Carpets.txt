'''Inspiral Carpets''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, part of the late-1980s/early-1990s [[Madchester]] movement. Formed in [[Oldham]] in 1983, the band's most successful lineup featured frontman [[Tom Hingley]], drummer Craig Gill, guitarist Graham Lambert, bassist Martyn Walsh and keyboardist [[Clint Boon]].

Formed by Lambert and singer Stephen Holt, who departed the band before they signed with [[Mute Records]],<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2000) ''Alternative Rock'', Miller Freeman, {{ISBN|0-87930-607-6}}, p.425-427</ref> Inspiral Carpets was known for using [[Organ (music)|organs]] and distorted [[guitars]] with influences from [[psychedelic rock]].  In 2011, Hingley departed the band, though members disagree about the circumstances. The band continued on, reuniting with Holt. The group have been inactive since Gill's suicide in 2016.

==History==
===1983–1995===
Graham Lambert and Stephen Holt, friends from their school days, formed Inspiral Carpets in 1983, originally as a [[garage rock]]- and [[punk music|punk]]-inspired band, with keyboardist Glenn Chesworth and bassist Tony Feeley.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band recruited 14-year-old drummer Craig Gill in 1986.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-38066578 Inspiral Carpets drummer Craig Gill dies at 44]. BBC News (2016-11-22).</ref> In 1987, following the departures of Chesworth and Feeley, the lineup included first Mark Hughes, then Dave Swift, on bass and organist [[Clint Boon]] (at whose [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] studio the band had been rehearsing).<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin: ''The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music'', 2002, Guinness Publishing, pp. 144/5, {{ISBN|0-85112-579-4}}</ref> The band released two albums of demos in the 1980s, ''Waiting for Ours'' and ''Songs of Shallow Intensity'', including songs that would later be re-recorded.<ref name="Thompson" />

Inspiral Carpets came to prominence along with bands such as [[the Stone Roses]] and [[Happy Mondays]] in the [[Madchester]] scene of the late 1980s. The band first appeared on a [[flexi-disc]] with "Garage Full of Flowers" that was given free with [[Manchester]]'s ''Debris'' magazine in 1987. Their first proper release, the ''Cow'' cassette, soon followed. The 1988 ''Planecrash'' [[Extended play|EP]] on the Playtime label received much airplay from [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]], who asked the band to record a session for his show.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band reworked their single "Find Out Why" as the theme song for the show ''[[8:15 from Manchester]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube video showing how the band recorded the theme tune to 8:15 from Manchester|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS9C_mO0LPs|website=YouTube|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref>

As the band's popularity grew, Playtime's distributor [[Red Rhino Records]] went bankrupt, leading Inspiral Carpets to form their own label, Cow Records, in March 1989. The label's first release was the ''Trainsurfing'' EP.<ref name="Thompson" /> With half of the first album, ''[[Life (Inspiral Carpets album)|Life]]'', written, Holt and Swift departed and formed [[the Rainkings]], so the band recruited [[Too Much Texas]] singer [[Tom Hingley]] and Martyn "Bungle" Walsh of The Next Step to replace them.<ref name="Thompson" /> Martyn Walsh became the band's 13th bass player.<ref>Graham Lambert interview on ''Cool As'' box set</ref> After a handful of singles on their own label, with "Move" nearly reaching the UK top 40, the band signed a deal with [[Mute Records]] and soon experienced their first top-40 chart success in the UK with "[[This Is How It Feels (single)|This Is How It Feels]]." The single reached No.&nbsp;14 on the [[UK Singles Chart|singles chart]], and the debut album ''Life'' reached No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK Albums Chart|albums chart]] in 1990.<ref name="Thompson" />

The following year's ''[[The Beast Inside]]'' was not as well-received by critics,<ref name="Larkin" /> but still achieved a top-5 album chart ranking.  The "Caravan" and "Please be Cruel" singles only reached No.&nbsp;30 and No.&nbsp;50 respectively, and an attempt to crack the American market largely failed.<ref name="Thompson" /> However, the band gained a strong following in Portugal, Germany and Argentina, where the 1992 album ''[[Revenge of the Goldfish]]'' became their most successful.<ref name="Thompson" /> The album peaked at number 17 in the UK and spawned four UK hit singles. The next album, ''Devil Hopping'' (1994), reached number 10 in the album chart, with "Saturn 5" and "I Want You" (featuring [[Mark E. Smith]]) as top-20 hits.<ref name="Thompson" /> The next single, "Uniform", stalled at No.&nbsp;51 and in 1995, after the release of a ''Singles'' collection, the band were dropped by Mute and split up soon after.<ref name="Thompson" />

===Post-split activities (1995–2003)===
Hingley formed a new band, [[Tom Hingley and the Lovers|the Lovers]], along with Jerry Kelly of [[The Lotus Eaters (band)|the Lotus Eaters]] (which later featured [[Steve Hanley (musician)|Steve]] and [[Paul Hanley (musician)|Paul Hanley]] of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]), while Boon formed [[the Clint Boon Experience]], releasing a string of singles on the Artful label.<ref name="Thompson" /> Gill also formed a new band, Hustler, who eventually changed their name to Proud Mary after a [[Proud Mary|song]] by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Proud Mary signed to [[Noel Gallagher]]'s Big Brother label some years later, while Walsh moved into production, largely working on techno and dance music.<ref name="Thompson" /> Two of the band's roadies enjoyed musical success themselves: van driver [[Mark Collins (musician)|Mark Collins]] joined [[The Charlatans (English band)|the Charlatans]] in 1991 and drum technician [[Noel Gallagher]] joined [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name="Thompson" />

In 1999, [[Strange Fruit Records]] released a compilation of tracks recorded for [[BBC Radio 1]] sessions.<ref>Larkin, Colin (2006) ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', OUP USA, {{ISBN|978-0195313734}}, p. 482</ref>

===Reformation (2003–2011)===
Inspiral Carpets reunited in 2003, playing to sellout crowds on tour and releasing the single "Come Back Tomorrow" (recorded in 1995) and a number of new compilation records, most notably the ''Cool As'' box set. The band have toured sporadically since, reuniting again in 2007 to tour in support of an [[iTunes]]-exclusive compilation of their B-sides and rarities. They played a tour in 2008 under the banner "Return of the Cow", announcing that their own Cow Records label was to be revived.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Hingley departs, Holt returns and Gill's death (2011–2016)===
In February 2011, it was revealed that Tom Hingley was no longer part of the band, with the circumstances of his departure unclear. Band members indicated that Hingley had left of his own accord, with Clint Boon contradicting Hingley's suggestion that the band had split up<ref>{{cite web|title=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/therealboon/status/33568163060785152|access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> whilst Hingley later claimed that he had been fired by the band at a meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/inspiral-carpets-pulled-the-rug-from-under-693963|title=Inspiral Carpets pulled the rug from under me claims ex-frontman Tom Hingley in new autobiography|first=Sarah|last=Walters|date=28 August 2012|website=Manchestereveningnews.co.uk|access-date=24 November 2017}}</ref>

In August 2011, the band announced a reunion with original singer Stephen Holt. Their website indicated that "Inspirals will be recording their first material in 15 years coupled with concerts in South America & Greece."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inspiral Carpets garage band|url=http://www.inspiralcarpets.com/|access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> The band recorded "You're So Good For Me"/"Head for the Sun" for [[Record Store Day]], a [[Single (music)|7" single]] that was released, sold and deleted on 21 April 2012. The accompanying video for the main track was shot at a concert in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 2011. In support of the single, the band toured the UK in March 2012 for the first time with Holt in 24 years. In May, the band were special guests on a Happy Mondays tour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In the summer of 2012, the band played at several festivals, culminating with a live performance at the [[Old Trafford]] cricket ground on 10 September during [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|England's T20I match with South Africa]]. For Record Store Day in April 2014, Inspiral Carpets released ''[[Dung 4]]'', a previously cassette-only collection of demos from 1987, on vinyl and CD, with the earlier tape ''Cow Demo'' added as a free 7" with the vinyl version. ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' said of the album: "... the whole package is a fine summation of the Inspirals enduring appeal".

In October 2014, the band released ''[[Inspiral Carpets (album)|Inspiral Carpets]]'' on [[Cherry Red Records]]. Their first album in 20 years, ''Inspiral Carpets'' contained two past singles, "You're So Good For Me" and "Spitfire", plus 10 new tracks. The album also included "Let You Down", co-written by and featuring punk poet [[John Cooper Clarke]]. Interviewed in ''[[Record Collector]],'' Boon described the album as "Diverse. A couple (of the songs) have an [[R.E.M.]] flavour, one nod to the 50s, two to [[Joy Division]], several [[the Doors]], one Northern soul, two [[the Beach Boys]]." After several dates in Europe over the summer, the band played 12 UK dates in December 2014 in support of the album's release.

On 20 November 2016, drummer Craig Gill died by suicide at the age of 44.<ref name=x>"[http://www.radiox.co.uk/news/inspiral-carpets-drummer-craig-gill-dies-aged-44/#2H7TQZrlW2PGLWmp.97 Inspiral Carpets Drummer Craig Gill Dies, Aged 44]", ''[[Radio X (United Kingdom)|RadioX]]'', 22 November 2016</ref><ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-38066578|title=Inspiral Carpets drummer Craig Gill dies at 44|date=20 November 2016|access-date=22 November 2016|work=BBC News}}</ref> His suicide was said to be the result of [[tinnitus]] that had caused 20 years of insomnia and anxiety.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/05/inspiral-carpets-drummer-craig-gill-inquest-tinnitus|title=Inspiral Carpets drummer killed himself after 20 years of 'unbearable' tinnitus|date=5 May 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=24 November 2017}}</ref> Memorial services were attended by music-industry friends including Inspiral Carpets members, Oasis singer [[Liam Gallagher]], [[Stone Roses]] bassist [[Mani (musician)|Mani]] and [[Happy Mondays]] singer [[Rowetta]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/101080/music-world-mourns-craig%7COldham_Evening_Chronicle|title=Music world mourns Craig  - Chronicle Online|website=www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-06|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220074742/http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/101080/music-world-mourns-craig%7COldham_Evening_Chronicle|archive-date=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Soon after his death, Gill's friends began a social-media campaign to make the band's 1994 hit "Saturn 5" the  [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number-one song]] for 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/christmas-number-1-2016-the-contenders-revealed__17110/|title=Christmas Number 1 2016: The contenders revealed|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref>
