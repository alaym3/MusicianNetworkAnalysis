'''Ariel Marcus Rosenberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|i|ɛ|l}} {{respell|AR|ee|el}};<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/ariel-pink-in-studio/ |title=Ariel Pink: Absurdist, Dreamy Pop Songs {{!}} Soundcheck {{!}} WNYC |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120437/https://www.wnyc.org/story/ariel-pink-in-studio/ |url-status=live }}</ref> born June 24, 1978), professionally known as '''Ariel Pink''', is an American musician, singer, and songwriter whose work draws heavily from the popular music of the 1960s–1980s. His [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and [[home recording|home-recorded]] albums proved influential to many indie musicians starting in the late 2000s. He is frequently cited as "godfather" of the [[hypnagogic pop]] and [[chillwave]] movements,<ref name="RBMApink"/> and he is credited with galvanizing a larger trend involving the evocation of the media, sounds, and outmoded technologies of prior decades,<ref name="Spin2012" /> as well as an equal appreciation for [[high art|high]] and [[low art|low]] aesthetic values in [[indie music]].<ref name="Goldner"/>

A native of [[Los Angeles]], Pink began experimenting with recording songs on an [[Stem mixing and mastering|eight-track]] [[Portastudio]] as a teenager. His early influences were artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[the Cure (band)|the Cure]], and [[R. Stevie Moore]]. The majority of [[Ariel Pink discography|his recorded output]] stems from a prolific eight-year period (1996–2003) in which he accumulated over 200 cassette tapes of material.  Virtually all of his music released in the 2000s was written and recorded before 2004, the same year he debuted on [[Animal Collective]]'s [[Paw Tracks]] label with ''[[The Doldrums (album)|The Doldrums]]'' (2000), followed with ''[[House Arrest (album)|House Arrest]]'' (2002) and ''[[Worn Copy]]'' (2003). The albums immediately attracted a [[cult following]].<ref name="ReynoldsLeave"/>

In the 2000s, Pink's unusual sound prompted a renewed critical discussion of [[Hauntology (music)|hauntological]] phenomena, for which he was a central figure.<ref name="Fisher10"/> Until 2014, his records were usually credited to "Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti", a solo project sometimes conflated with his touring band.<ref name="i52"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Alexandra|title=Ariel Pink Hasn't Lost His Marbles Yet|url=http://bullettmedia.com/article/ariel-pink-hasnt-lost-marbles-yet/|website=Bullett Media|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> His fame and recognition escalated following the success of his 2010 album ''[[Before Today (album)|Before Today]]'', his first recorded in a professional studio. Since then, he has recorded three more albums: ''[[Mature Themes]]'' (2012), ''[[Pom Pom (album)|Pom Pom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Dedicated to Bobby Jameson]]'' (2017). He has also collaborated with a variety of other artists.

Ariel's parents encouraged him to pursue a career in visual arts rather than music.

When he was young, Rosenberg was an avid record collector and reader of music magazines, he said, and "had a gross hunger for bootlegs and unofficial rare recordings by artists I worshiped; ate them all up and adopted certain criteria for what I longed for in music."<ref name="Simonini"/> He was first drawn to music through watching [[MTV]].<ref name="Fisher10"/> When his interest intensified, he was particularly fond of [[Michael Jackson]], and after entering junior high school, expanded his tastes to [[heavy metal music|metal]].<ref name="Griffey"/> Favorites included bands like [[Def Leppard]], [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and after that, "[[death rock]]" groups such as [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[the Cure (band)|the Cure]], the latter being his favorite band of all time.<ref name="Griffey">{{cite web |url=http://junkmedia.org/index.php?i=1433 |title=An Interview with Ariel Pink |last=Griffey |first=Mark |date=March 14, 2005 |website=Junkmedia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082400/http://junkmedia.org/index.php?i=1433 |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |access-date=December 15, 2014}}</ref> Another artist he was particularly fond of was [[Lou Reed]].<ref name="Beta" /> He enjoyed the writings of rock critic [[Nick Kent]]<ref name="plug14" /> and read [[Richie Unterberger]]'s ''Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll: Psychedelic Unknowns, Mad Geniuses, Punk Pioneers, Lo-Fi Mavericks & More'' (1998); later he recorded a cover version of one of the tracks included in a CD that came with the book ("Bright Lit Blue Skies").<ref name="HarperShades"/>

Rosenberg was initially raised in [[Louisiana]].<ref name="Beta" /> He chose to live there with his mother following child custody proceedings. They lived in [[Pico-Robertson]], and later, [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]]. Due to the bullying he received in junior high school, his parents sent him to live with his cousins in Mexico City for a year. There, he lost his virginity at age 13, to a prostitute named Sara, and discovered the Cure, a band he thought espoused "something unholy ... something alive and dead at the same time."<ref name="Spin2012" /> He then returned to live with his father in the [[Beverlywood]] area of Los Angeles,<ref name="Beta" /><ref name="Spin2012">{{cite web|last1=Bevan|first1=David|title=Ariel Pink: In Praise of Guilty Genius|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/ariel-pink-in-praise-of-guilty-genius/|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=August 21, 2012|access-date=February 7, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120415/https://www.spin.com/2012/08/ariel-pink-in-praise-of-guilty-genius/|url-status=live}}</ref> where he attended [[Beverly Hills High School]], branded himself as a [[Goth subculture|goth]], sold off his collection of metal records, and stopped following new music.<ref name="Beta"/> He cited [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as the last group he enjoyed before this point.<ref name="Reynolds2011Field" /> In his view, [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] bands marked the end of the forward progress of popular music.<ref name="Spin2012" /> "After that, my listening was totally retro.

While in high school, Rosenberg began experimenting with songwriting and composing avant-garde pieces using a portable cassette recorder in his father's garage. His tools were limited to one bass guitar, an [[amplifier|amp]], and kitchen utensils.<ref name="RBMApink"/> In 1996, he started what he later described as an eight-year-long "recording session" in which he "was very completely single-minded. I had tunnel vision. I was just completely [recording music] like if my life depended on it."<ref name="RBMApink"/> By then, he "was very into" [[krautrock]],<ref name="RBMApink"/> and in his songs, he endeavored to obfuscate his personality while using photos that bore minimal resemblance to him as album covers.<ref name="Guardian14" /> He credited his tapes to a variety of names (or "logos") including "Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti" and "Ariel Rosenberg's Thrash and Burn".<ref name="RBMApink" /> He did not intend to release any of this music.<ref name="search">{{cite web |last1=Rothbarth |first1=Adam |title=Ariel Pink's Search for the Right Label |url=https://artists.spotify.com/blog/ariel-pinks-search-for-the-right-label |website=[[Spotify]] |date=December 2, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120426/https://artists.spotify.com/blog/ariel-pinks-search-for-the-right-label |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1997, Rosenberg entered the [[California Institute of the Arts]] studying [[fine art]]. He was dissatisfied that the school focused on "the art market" rather than "[[color theory]] or anything like that".<ref name="RBMApink"/> He met [[John Maus]] at CalArts, and they subsequently became best friends<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Christopher|title=I Ate It All Up In Fast Forward: Ariel Pink's Favourite LPs|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/23056-ariel-pink-interview-favourite-albums?page=14|website=[[The Quietus]]|date=August 23, 2017|access-date=February 7, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120355/https://thequietus.com/articles/23056-ariel-pink-interview-favourite-albums?page=14|url-status=live}}</ref> and roommates.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pemberton|first1=Nathan|title=John Maus Is Making Outsider Pop for the End of the World|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/john-maus-is-making-outsider-pop-for-the-end-of-the-world.html|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=October 25, 2017|access-date=February 7, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120431/https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/john-maus-is-making-outsider-pop-for-the-end-of-the-world.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On one project, Rosenberg collaborated with fellow student and roommate Jeremy Albert Ringermacher, submitting a three-foot tall illustration, titled "The Last Art Piece", that realistically depicted the school's faculty, staff members, and students engaging in an orgy. The piece was allowed to be displayed, and in response, an administrative member unsuccessfully sued the university for [[sexual harassment]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Justin|title=The Changing Face of Sexual {{sic|nolink=y|Harra|ssment}}|url=https://www.alternet.org/story/26151/the_changing_face_of_sexual_harrassment|website=[[Alternet]]|date=September 29, 2005}}</ref>

His album ''[[The Doldrums (album)|The Doldrums]]'' (2000) was recorded during his final semester at the university. According to ''[[LA Weekly]]'', he was then "in the throes of a drug binge".<ref name="Hoinski2014" /> "I'm sure those were my words," he later said. "I don’t know. It was fine. I had a typical art school experience, I suppose, if you consider getting drunk at openings, partying with your 'teachers,' and shrugging off scholastic duties as often as possible as something typical of college experience."<ref name="Simonini"/>  He described the album as "the saddest record I could [have made]; it was negative not only emotionally but aesthetically." The guitar parts were played with only three strings.<ref name="Gilbey06"/> For [[final examination]]s, he submitted a kiosk where he sold CDs of ''The Doldrums'' as a criticism against the school's marketing-oriented curriculum.<ref name="RBMApink"/>

After dropping out of CalArts, Rosenberg lived in a Hindu [[ashram]] in [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles]], where he "brought in heroin, smoked so much pot, blasted music, lived in filth, brought all these fucking weirdos in, played and recorded music all night, and never had a problem with those people."<ref name="Beta" /> He also attended a music school and worked as a clerk at a record store.<ref name="Weiss2012">{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Jeff|title=Ariel Pink Is the King of Whatever|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/ariel-pink-is-the-king-of-whatever-2176044|date=August 16, 2012|work=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=February 7, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120433/http://www.laweekly.com/ariel-pink-is-the-king-of-whatever/|url-status=live}}</ref> During this period, he recorded ''[[Scared Famous]]'' (2001), ''[[Scared Famous|Fast Forward]]'' (2001), ''[[House Arrest (album)|House Arrest]]'' (2002), ''[[Lover Boy (album)|Lover Boy]]'' (2002), and portions of ''[[Worn Copy]]'' (2003).<ref name="Beta" /> He envisioned working at a record store "for the rest of my life" before [[the Strokes]] "came out and all the sudden guitars came back [on the charts].

Virtually all of Pink's music released in the 2000s was written and recorded before 2004.

In 2006, Pink embarked on a few supporting tours and assembled a group backed with Jimi Hey, [[John Maus]], [[Gary War]], and girlfriend Geneva Jacuzzi. Musician and collaborator [[Cole M.

In later years, Rosenberg said the name "Ariel Pink" was not meant as a persona or pseudonym. The "common misconception," he said, started when promoters billed his early 2000s live shows as "Ariel Pink" fronting a band called the "Haunted Graffiti". He said: "There's no Ariel Pink ... My name's Ariel Rosenberg and I have a solo project that I called Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti.  ... automatically people assumed that [the band] must be the 'Haunted Graffiti'."<ref name="i52">{{cite web|author=52 Insights|title=Ariel Pink 'Nixon is the best president we ever had.'|url=https://www.52-insights.com/ariel-pink-singer-songwriter-nixon-is-the-best-president-we-ever-had-politics-music-interview/|website=52 Insights|date=September 7, 2017|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120429/https://www.52-insights.com/ariel-pink-singer-songwriter-nixon-is-the-best-president-we-ever-had-politics-music-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> The original liner notes to these early albums, while credited to "Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti", also distinctly credit "Ariel Pink" with performing, recording, or writing the music.<ref>See:

Pink's music encompasses a diverse selection of styles, sometimes within the same song, and espouses a [[postmodern]] take on pop music.<ref name="Guardian14"/> His initial recordings blended lo-fi [[psychedelic pop]] with elements drawn from 1980s [[soft rock]] and "classic pop" from California.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hopper |first1=Jessica |title=Ariel Pink strikes a chord with new pop direction |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-xpm-2010-11-19-ct-ott-1119-ariel-pink-20101119-story.html |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 19, 2010 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120423/https://www.chicagotribune.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He likened his early records to a compendium of what he believed to be "everything good about music".<ref name="Fader09">{{cite web |last1=Bevan |first1=David |title=Soft Truth: Ariel Pink's Virtual Reality |url=https://www.thefader.com/2009/06/09/ariel-pink-cover-story |website=[[The Fader]] |access-date=December 14, 2019 |date=June 9, 2009 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120444/https://www.thefader.com/2009/06/09/ariel-pink-cover-story |url-status=live }}</ref> Writing for [[Louder Than War (website)]], Maren McGlashan said that Pink typically draws from "the fuzzy glow of 1970s radio, the unapologetic weirdness of [[Frank Zappa|Zappa]], the cool enthusiasm of [[new wave music|New Wave]] and Western popular culture.

His early recordings were amateurishly recorded on an eight-track cassette [[Portastudio]].<ref name="Griffey" /> Since he was not a proficient instrumentalist, he usually tracked music parts one at a time in short increments.<ref name="Gilbey06" /> The use of cassettes lent a conspicuously lo-fi sound, which later became a deliberate aesthetic choice; he experimented with recording in professional studios and with [[digital audio workstations]], but was dissatisfied with the results.<ref name="Griffey" /> Lyrically, he said that he is "not a poet" and that he approaches his work as "musical pieces" rather than songs, with the words usually written as an afterthought.<ref name="fullofshit">{{cite web|last=Juto|first=Tommy|title=Interview: Ariel Pink – "It's like no one should listen to what I say, because it's full of shit"|url=https://songsforwhoever.com/2014/11/30/interview-ariel-pink/|website=Songs for Whoever|date=November 30, 2014|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120430/https://songsforwhoever.com/2014/11/30/interview-ariel-pink/|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the time of his Paw Tracks reissues, Pink was perceived as both an outsider and as a novelty act, as there were virtually no other contemporary indie acts with a similar retro lo-fi sound.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/genres/a/lo-fi.htm|first=Anthony|last=Carew|date=March 8, 2017|publisher=About.com Guide|title=Genre Profile - Lo-Fi|access-date=March 11, 2018|archive-date=April 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404135736/http://altmusic.about.com/od/genres/a/lo-fi.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that before Pink, lo-fi acts were generally "vehemently opposed to the slick, big-budget [[yacht rock|AOR]] and '80s rock 'n' soul that he's so inspired by."<ref name="Reynolds2010" /> In 2014, Pink described his artistic philosophy as remaining in an era "somewhere in the forgotten ‘90s and ‘80s ... the stuff that nobody listens to ... and see what happens when you try to pause time and not affect it."<ref name="plug14"/> In 2017, he reiterated that the sum of his work was "a weird art experiment" aimed at investigating "what would happen if I decided to plant myself in Cure-land" and create "the same thing over and over again forever, forever?"<ref name="rhoades17" /> Fans of Pink's music came to include John Maus, [[Kurt Vile]], [[Bradford Cox]] of [[Deerhunter]], [[Christopher Owens]] of [[Girls (band)|Girls]], Alan Palomo of [[Neon Indian]], and [[Beck]].<ref name="Spin2012" />

R.

During the late 2000s, Pink was referenced in early discussions of [[hauntology (music)|hauntology in music]].<ref name="Gabriele">{{cite web|last1=Gabriele|first1=Timothy|title=Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti Before Today|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/126592-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti-before-today/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=June 8, 2010|access-date=March 25, 2017|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120442/https://www.popmatters.com/126592-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti-before-today-2496184314.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The renewed discussion of [[hauntology]], in itself, was prompted by his emergence.<ref name="Fisher10">{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Fisher (theorist)|url=http://www.factmag.com/2010/04/26/ariel-pink-russian-roulette/|title=Ariel Pink: Russian roulette|magazine=Fact|date=26 April 2010|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120431/https://www.factmag.com/2010/04/26/ariel-pink-russian-roulette/|url-status=live}}</ref> In an August 2009 piece for ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', journalist [[David Keenan]] coined "[[hypnagogic pop]]" to describe a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-[[noise music]] in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural [[nostalgia]], childhood memory, and outmoded recording technology.

Reynolds compared Pink's influence to [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]'s impact on the [[shoegaze]] genre. He wrote, "the sound Pink invented—’70s radio-rock and ’80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog—was so striking it could only become a chronic influence."<ref name="ReynoldsLeave">{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|author-link1=Simon Reynolds|title=Leave Chillwave Alone|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/leave-chillwave-alone-6429943|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=January 19, 2011|access-date=December 18, 2019|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120457/https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/01/19/leave-chillwave-alone/|url-status=live}}</ref> Such a sound was most prominently attributed to Pink following the success of 2010's ''Before Today'' and the convergence of chillwave, lo-fi, and the assistance of the Web in nostalgia-driven pop culture marketing.<ref name="Spin2012" /> That year, ''Pitchfork'' writer Mark Richardson said of Pink's influence:

{{blockquote|His records didn't reach a lot of people, but many of those who heard them were inspired to start home recording projects of their own. So as different kinds of lo-fi music bubbled up from the indie underground in the last couple of years{{em dash}} from more placid [[chillwave]] to roughed-up garage rock to abstract instrumental music{{em dash}} and many of these bands were talking about his influence, all of a sudden Ariel Pink started looking way ahead of the game.<ref name="RichardBT"/>}}

''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''{{'}}s Sam Richard profiled Pink as "a lo-fi legend" whose "ghostly pop sound" proved influential to chillwave acts such as [[Ducktails (music)|Ducktails]] and [[Toro y Moi]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Sam|title=Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti – Before Today|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti-before-today|website=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=June 7, 2010}}</ref> Jeff Weiss of ''Pitchfork'' said ''The Doldrums'' "inspired chillwave and a lo-fi revival, as well as alter[ed] the perception of L.A. as an [[indie-rock]] backwater."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Jeff|title=Pom Pom|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19936-ariel-pink-pom-pom/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=November 18, 2014|access-date=February 7, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120437/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19936-ariel-pink-pom-pom/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Spin'' writer David Bevan credited Pink's "fascination with, and commitment to, recasting outdated, obsolescent media" with galvanizing what is "widely seen in the VHS-boosted, Polaroid-clad aesthetic embraced by a hundred blogs and apps."<ref name="Spin2012" /> Sam Goldner of ''Vice'' posited that a direct link can be drawn between Pink's "recycling of cheesy older sounds" and [[vaporwave]], adding that, in the early 2010s, Pink and fellow musician [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]] "together represented a massive shift in music that was about to happen" – namely "a new mindset within independent music, one that viewed 'high' and 'low' art as equal, complementary forces in a vast cultural expanse."<ref name="Goldner">{{cite web |last1=Goldner |first1=Sam |title=The 2010s Were the Decade That Genre Collapsed |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xw3g4/2010s-were-the-decade-that-genre-collapsed |website=Vice |date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>

Pink said that he never claimed to be the "godfather" of "lo-fi", "hypnagogic pop", or "chillwave". He thought that "people are just having fun with ideas they get in their head. They find a way to frame artists in a certain way that makes them interesting."<ref name="RBMApink">{{cite web|last1=Raffeiner|first1=Arno|title=Interview: Ariel Pink|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/09/ariel-pink-interview|website=Red Bull Music Academy|date=September 14, 2017|access-date=February 2, 2018|archive-date=January 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120426/https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/09/ariel-pink-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2012 interview, he commented that although it was not his intention to evoke nostalgia, he was aware "that I was doing something that sounded like the trace of a memory you can't place ... now, people take it for granted.

I can hear it in their music."<ref name="Reynolds2011Field" />

Music writer Adam Harper contested that "the pop-art pastiche of hypnagogic pop" or the "mirror-shades-cool synth groove of chillwave" could be attributed to Pink's "largely rock-based" music. He argued that instead of "the progenitor or the AZ Generation, Pink can easily be understood as the youngest member of this mid-80s [[Cassette Culture]] Generation."<ref name="HarperShades"/> Among predecessors, Harper lists R. Stevie Moore and [[the Cleaners from Venus]]' [[Martin Newell (musician)|Martin Newell]] as the most notable.<ref name="HarperShades"/> He referenced a 1990s observation by music critic [[Richie Unterberger]] that compared Moore to Newell's "lo-fi, murkily recorded affairs that couldn't hide the power of the melodies, or a wit that could be both tender and savage".

Many of Pink's remarks in interviews have incited controversy, particularly among [[leftist|left]]-leaning indie music communities.<ref name="Guardian14"/> Some of his provocations included "It’s not illegal to be racist", "This gay marriage stuff pisses me off", and his expressed "love" for necrophiliacs, pedophiles, and the [[Westboro Baptist Church]].<ref name="Guardian14"/> His negative press reached a peak around the release of ''Pom Pom'', when detractors variously labelled him a "troll", a "[[Beta male (slang)|beta male]]", and a "misogynist".<ref name="w">{{cite web |last1=Pemberton |first1=Nathan |title=Ariel Pink Opens His Big Mouth Again: The Musician Returns to Explain His Controversial Past, and Predict His Own Future |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/ariel-pink-new-album-dedicated-to-bobby-jameson-interview |website=W |date=August 1, 2017 |access-date=February 7, 2018 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120426/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/ariel-pink-new-album-dedicated-to-bobby-jameson-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Fans argued that he is simply a [[glib]] speaker.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McArdie |first1=Allanna |title=Op-Ed: Ariel Pink's "Joke" Isn't Funny Anymore |url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/566-op-ed-ariel-pinks-joke-isnt-funny-anymore/ |website=Pitchfork |date=November 25, 2014 |access-date=October 17, 2019 |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108120448/https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/566-op-ed-ariel-pinks-joke-isnt-funny-anymore/ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Rhik Sammadar of ''The Guardian'' noted that "Pink has a particular tendency to pull radically insightful arguments from nowhere – about sensationalist media, the amorality of capitalism, liberal delusion – and cloak them in clangingly reactionary or inflammatory conclusions."<ref name="Guardian14"/>}}

In October 2014, Pink told the online journal ''Faster Louder'' that [[Interscope Records]] had contacted him about working with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

Pink admitted that one of his tactics with interviewers is to talk so much that the other person has no opportunity to ask a question. He resents interviews and fame, explaining "I'd like to get by without making a fool of myself, running my mouth all the time.

During an October 2017 performance in San Francisco, attendees were offended by Pink's on-stage physicality with then-bandmate and girlfriend Charlotte Ercoli Coe.
