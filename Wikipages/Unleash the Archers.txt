==History==
===2007-2015: Formation and indie years===
Unleash the Archers was formed in late 2007 by vocalist Brittney Hayes (a.k.a. Brittney Slayes) and drummer Scott Buchanan with former member Brayden Dyczkowski on guitar, whom Scott had played with previously in an independent death metal project.<ref name="MetalMaster">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalmasterkingdom.com/unleash-the-archers.html|title=UNLEASH THE ARCHERS Interview with Brittney Hayes of Unleash The Archers|date=September 9, 2013|work=metalmasterkingdom.com}}</ref> Former member Mike Selman was brought on after his departure from Canadian death metal band Meatlocker Seven. The position of bass player was unfilled for the first few months of Unleash The Archers' career, until Zahk Hedstrom joined in October 2007 to complete the lineup. In late 2008 the band recorded a self-titled four song demo, which featured two songs they would end up re-recording for their first studio album.

Their debut studio album Behold The Devastation was recorded with Jason Hywell Martin at Omega Mediacore Studios in Richmond, BC and was released independently in August 2009. This was the only album to feature the band's original lineup in its entirety.<ref name="Vampster">{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://vampster.com/artikel.php%3Fid%3D33302&prev=search|title=Vampster Album Review 2009|work=vampster.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/Unleash_Archers_-_Behold_Devastation|title=Unleash the Archers Behold the Devastation|work=exclaim.ca|last=Dawes|first=Laina|date=May 11, 2010}}</ref>

The band's second album Demons Of The AstroWaste was recorded with Nick Engwer and Stu McKillop at the Hive Soundlab in Burnaby, BC and was released independently in May 2011. This album included the first appearance of guitarist Grant Truesdell, who provided solos for their songs Battle in the Shadow (of the Mountain) and The Outlander. He would step in as the new guitar player later that same year after the departure of Mike Selman prior to the recording. The album was a [[concept album]] based on the exploits of a mercenary in space<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/unleash_archers-demons_of_astrowaste|title=Unleash the Archers: Demons of the Astrowaste|work=exclaim.ca|last=Walschots|first=Natalie Zina|date= May 18, 2011}}</ref> and was set far into the future.<ref name="MondayMag">{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaymag.com/lifestyles/135772083.html|title=BC Death metal band launches concept album (interview)|work=mondaymag.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/05/unleash-the-archers-demons-of-the-astrowaste/ "Unleash The Archers – Demons of the AstroWaste"], ''Hellbound.ca''</ref>

In 2012 the band released Defy The Skies. This album was a three-song [[Extended play|EP]] released solely on 7-inch [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]. A bonus fourth track titled ‘Arise’ was given to those that pre-ordered, but was later released on the band's [[Bandcamp]] page in digital format only.  This record also marked the departure of original bassist Zahk Hedstrom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soniccathedral.com/webzine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=761&Itemid=35|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115043335/http://www.soniccathedral.com/webzine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=761&Itemid=35|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 15, 2012|title=Sonic Cathedral WebZine - Unleash the Archers - Defy the Skies|work=soniccathedral.com}}</ref>

===2015-present: Signing with Napalm Records===
In February 2015 the band announced their signing with [[Napalm Records]],<ref name="Bravewords">{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/canadas-unleash-the-archers-sign-with-napalm-records|title=Canada's UNLEASH THE ARCHERS Sign With Napalm Records|work=bravewords.com}}</ref> and soon after the title, track listing and release date for their upcoming studio album ''Time Stands Still'' were revealed.  The album was released in Europe on June 26 and in North America on July 10.  The album was originally slated for a late-Summer/early-Fall 2014 release, but the release was pushed back after the band was signed by Napalm Records.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Sonic Cathedral WebZine - Face-Off Challenge: Cradle of Filth & Unleash The Archers|url = http://www.soniccathedral.com/webzine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1233|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103817/http://www.soniccathedral.com/webzine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1233|url-status = dead|archive-date = September 24, 2015|website = www.soniccathedral.com|access-date = July 16, 2015}}</ref> This album was the first without Brayden Dyczkowski, who had been one of the main songwriters up until his parting with the band in late 2013; this lineup change has affected the band's sound and driven it towards a more traditional heavy metal direction with the addition of Andrew Kingsley, who is also trained in jazz, on guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beatroute.ca/2014/11/24/vancouver-power-metallers-unleash-the-archers-woman-the-ramparts/|title=Unleash The Archers (Wo)man the Ramparts (Interview)|work=beatroute.ca}}</ref>

On May 26, 2015, the band released the "Tonight We Ride" video, inspired by ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''.<ref name="antiMusic Tonight We Ride">{{cite web|title=Singled Out: Unleash The Archers' Tonight We Ride|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/15/July/09Singled_Out-_Unleash_The_Archers_Tonight_We_Ride.shtml|website=antiMusic|access-date=July 20, 2015|date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> The video was filmed in the Nevada desert, using props from the Death Guild Thunderdome camp at [[Burning Man]].<ref name=":0" />

The first single, "Cleanse the Bloodlines" was released on April 8, 2017. ''[[Apex (album)|Apex]]''' was released on June 2, 2017 through Napalm Records.  The album debuted at No. 3 on iTunes metal charts, and became their first to make Billboard charts.  The album debuted at No. 9 Heatseeker, No. 29 Top Hard Music Albums, No. 29 Record Label Independent Current Albums, No. 34 Top Current Rock Albums, No. 116 Overall Digital Albums, No. 119 Top Current Albums, and No. 197 Top Albums by Strata.  It also debuted at No. 12 on Canadian Top Hard Music chart.  The band announced they would be touring Europe, accompanying Orden Ogan, to promote the album in the fall of 2017, with a US tour to be announced. In end of January it was announced that bassist Nikko Witworth had decided to leave the band.<ref>[http://www.truemetal.it/news/unleash-the-archers-nikko-whitworth-lascia-la-band-96110 Unleash the Archers: Nikko Whitworth lascia la band].</ref>

Brittney Hayes gave interviews and tweeted saying that they are currently working on an EP of covers with a "bit of a UTA spin" on them. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metaltotheboneccmr.wordpress.com/2019/03/21/we-are-writing-and-recording-a-new-full-length-album-this-year-and-will-hopefully-be-releasing-it-early-2020-brittney-slayes-metal-to-the-bone/|title="We are writing and recording a new full-length album this year, and will hopefully be releasing it early 2020": Brittney Slayes|last=chuchocrdoba|date=March 21, 2019|website=Metal to the Bone|language=es-ES|access-date=May 31, 2019}}</ref>
