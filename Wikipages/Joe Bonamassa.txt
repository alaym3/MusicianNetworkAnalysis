=== Collaborations with Beth Hart ===

Bonamassa was first exposed to [[Beth Hart]]'s music after seeing her play several television performances. The two would often cross paths when playing shows separately in Europe, and Bonamassa became very impressed with Hart when he caught her show at the Blue Balls festival in Lucerne, Switzerland. While recording his album ''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' and listening to the expanded edition of the [[Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]]'' that features tracks by [[Ike & Tina Turner]], Bonamassa became inspired to try pairing up with a woman, and Beth Hart came to mind. The two musicians met up in a hotel bar in Dublin and soon Bonamassa floated the idea, which Hart accepted immediately, although she was at first under the impression that he was asking her to sing backup vocals on his next album. When she realized that his intention was for her to sing lead vocals, she said "I was floored".<ref name=":1">Bosso, Joe. {{cite web|title=Interview: Joe Bonamassa and Beth Hart on their new album, Don't Explain| url=http://www.musicradar.com/us/news/guitars/interview-joe-bonamassa-and-beth-hart-on-their-new-album-dont-explain-511797| publisher=MusicRadar.com| date=November 7, 2011| access-date=December 5, 2014}}</ref>

Bonamassa, Hart, and producer [[Kevin Shirley]] wrote down lists of soul songs they liked to come up with material for the album, which was named ''[[Don't Explain (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Don't Explain]]''. The group settled on twelve songs, although only ten ended up being recorded.

== Influences ==

[[File:JoeBonamassaStaffordTX.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bonamassa performing at [[Stafford, Texas]] in 2007]]

Unlike many blues rock guitarists that came before him, Bonamassa's influences are British and Irish blues acts rather than American artists. In an interview in ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine he cited three albums that had the biggest influence on his playing: [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]] with Eric Clapton (the [[Beano album]]), Rory Gallagher's ''[[Irish Tour '74]]'' and ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'' by [[Cream (band)|Cream]].<ref>''Guitar Magazine'', Issue 265</ref> He also noted that [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s ''[[Texas Flood]]'' had a big influence when Bonamassa was young. Among other bands, he listed the early blues playing of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] as an influence, and named both [[Martin Barre]] and [[Mick Abrahams]] as important musicians to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesinbritain.org/joe-bonamassa-interview/ |title=Joe Bonamassa Interview |publisher=Blues in Britain |date=June 2, 2010 |access-date=August 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/12/28/joe-bonamassa-talks-influences-touring-and-gear/ |title=Joe Bonamassa Interview: Guitar Interviews |publisher=Guitarinternational.com |access-date=August 6, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911103121/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/12/28/joe-bonamassa-talks-influences-touring-and-gear/ |archive-date=September 11, 2014 }}</ref>

He elaborated on his influences:
{{quote|You know, my heroes were the English guys – [[Paul Kossoff]], [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], Eric Clapton. There's so many – there's [[Gary Moore]], [[Rory Gallagher]] – another Irish musician who played the same things, but don't tell him that. But those guys were my guys – [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimmy Page]]. There's a certain sophistication to their approach to the blues that I really like, more so than the American blues that I was listening to. B.B. King's a big influence – he's probably my biggest traditional influence. I love Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and [[T-Bone Walker]] and stuff like that, but I couldn't sit down. I was always forcing myself to listen to whole records by them, where I'd rather listen to [[Humble Pie]] do "I'm Ready" than Muddy Waters, you know? I think, the English interpretation of the blues just hit me a lot better, you know?<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chopik|first1=Chopik|title=Joe Bonamassa Interview|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/interviews/joe-bonamassa-interview/|website=Guitar Messenger|publisher=Guitar Messenger|access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref>}}

In an October 2008 interview with ''[[Express & Star]]'', he said:

{{quote|When I heard [[Paul Kossoff|Kossoff]] playing "Mr. Big" and when I heard Clapton playing "[[Cross Road Blues|Crossroads]]" and when I heard Rory Gallagher playing "Cradle Rock", I was like, "This is way cooler.... British blues are my thing." When I heard [[Rod Stewart]] and [[The Jeff Beck Group]] singing "Let Me Love You", it changed my life. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Those are my influences.}}

In a December 2012 interview with [[MusicRadar]]:

{{quote|My friends would ask me, "Have you heard the new [[Van Halen]] record?" And I'd be like, "Nope." I was listening to [[Frank Marino]] and [[Mahogany Rush]].<ref>Joe Bosso, [http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/joe-bonamassa-my-top-5-not-so-guilty-pleasures-of-all-time-568209 "Joe Bonamassa: my top 5 not-so-guilty pleasures of all time"], ''Music Radar'', December 7, 2012</ref>}}
