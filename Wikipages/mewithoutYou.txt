'''MewithoutYou''', usually styled as '''mewithoutYou''', is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The band consists of Aaron Weiss (vocals),  Michael Weiss and Brandon Beaver (guitars), Greg Jehanian (bass guitar) and Rickie Mazzotta (drums). The band's music is generally dominated by spoken-word vocals and free-ranging drums, bass and guitar.

== History ==
The band was originally conceived as a side project. The Weiss brothers and former guitarist Christopher Kleinberg were playing together in another band called The Operation with former bassist Greg Jehanian (who released one album and one EP, 2001's ''There Is Hope for a Tree Cut Down'' & 1999's ''Invisible Man EP'', on Takehold Records), but Aaron wanted to start another band to experiment with new sounds. With the help of Ricky Mazzotta, Ray Taddeo, and his brother Mike, Aaron formed what is now formally known as mewithoutYou. At first the band was a four piece, with Aaron Weiss on both bass and vocals. However, in only a few months Chris Kleinberg joined to play third guitar. The band released their first EP, ''I Never Said That I Was Brave'', in 2001 and shortly thereafter signed to [[Tooth & Nail Records]] after a show at [[Cornerstone Festival]] the same year. Around this time Taddeo had moved on, and Daniel Pishock was recruited to be the first official and permanent bass player of the band. The Operation disbanded soon afterward, and mewithoutYou's debut full-length album, ''[[A→B Life|[A→B] Life]]'', was released in 2002. The band garnered more attention for their second release, 2004's'' [[Catch for Us the Foxes]]'', which was produced by [[Brad Wood]] ([[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]]). In December 2004 Pishock had made the decision to retire as the bassist to pursue a career in teaching and explore other musical ventures, and former Operation frontman, Greg Jehanian, was selected to replace him. In 2005, mewithoutYou won [[mtvU]]'s "Left Field" award for most original artist for their song "January 1979." Their third album, ''[[Brother, Sister]]'', again produced by Wood, was released on September 26, 2006. In late 2007, guitarist Christopher Kleinberg left the band, to pursue a degree in medicine.  Pete Syoum filled in for guitar in the fall of 2007, but later Kleinberg returned to play with the band on their 2008 Summer tour since school was not in session. Kleinberg also played some shows on their ''[[It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright]]'' tour in June 2009.

Aaron Weiss narrates the [[Forgive Durden]] album entitled, ''Razia's Shadow: A Musical'' which was released October 28, 2008. He also sings for [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]]'s "Memphis Will Be Laid to Waste" and the indie/hip hop project Bella Futuro's "70 X 7".

In September 2008, the band finished recording the follow-up to ''[[Brother, Sister]]'' titled, ''[[It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright]]''. The title of the album is taken from parable 518 in the book ''The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh'' by [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]]. In this he writes, "It's all false, It's all a dream, It's all crazy, It's all over, It's all right, Let's see what's next."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4gbhnNuEPbcC |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4gbhnNuEPbcC/page/n249 221] |quote=It's all false, It's all a dream, It's all crazy, It's all over, It's all right, Let's see what's next. |title=The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh |publisher=The Fellowship Press |access-date=February 6, 2012|isbn=9780914390732 |last1=Bawa Muhaiyaddeen |first1=M. R. |year=2006 }}</ref> The album is a departure from Weiss' trademark shouting and the band's rough grooves. The fast rants, thick with lyrical angst, are traded for simpler melodies with lyrics about anthropomorphic food and animals. Similarly, the band has scaled back its edgier post-hardcore sound, at times trading riffs for chords and guitars for pianos and harp; a classical composer was called into their Fishtown, Philadelphia, studio for various arrangements on several tracks.<ref>{{cite web|author=US |url=http://www.myspace.com/mewithoutyou/blog/529731416 |title=Please support our composer, Joshua Stamper |website=Myspace|date=February 23, 2010 |access-date=January 22, 2011}}</ref> The album was produced by Dan Smith ([[Danielson]], [[Sufjan Stevens]]) and Brian McTear and was mixed by Brad Wood.

They toured in a 42-foot 1976 MC8 Charter bus that runs on vegetable oil. Before July 2009, the side of the bus read "[[Altus, OK|Altus Bulldogs]]". The bus has since been painted in a light beige and marked with paintings of flowers and vines by the artist Salihah Moore.<ref>[http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-4961/2006-12-07-jeremy_enigk_and_aaron_weiss Synthesis Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218113247/http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-4961/2006-12-07-jeremy_enigk_and_aaron_weiss |date=February 18, 2008 }} Jeremy Enigk and Aaron Weiss Catch Up as the World Waits, December 7, 2006</ref> The bus broke down on June 3, 2016, while on tour in Canada.<ref>mewithoutYou, [https://twitter.com/mewithoutYou/status/738864885124079616 "Been a lot of good years, adios nameless metal entity that made our band feasible with family and friends #sad"], ''Twitter''</ref>

In 2011 they added Brandon Beaver of Buried Beds to play second guitar, as stated on their blog by Rickie Mazzotta. In August 2011, Mazzotta stated in an interview that the band has parted ways with Tooth & Nail Records due to perceived restrictions placed on them by the label. They hinted at starting their own label as they prepared to release their fifth album.<ref>[http://propertyofzack.com/post/9635412288/propertyofzack-interview-mewithoutyou] mewithoutYou leaves Tooth & Nail</ref> Other band members, however, expressed satisfaction with and gratitude and affection toward their old label, citing different reasons for ceasing to work with them: namely, having completed their contract, the declining relevance of record labels in the current music world, and simply the excitement to try something new.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Lyrical themes ==
The Weiss brothers are of Jewish descent and their songs use Jewish, Muslim and Christian imagery to explore spiritual themes. The Weiss brothers were raised in a [[Sufism|Sufi]] Muslim household: their mother had converted from the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal church]], and their father from Judaism.<ref name="Busted">{{cite web

| quote = "So my dad was raised Jewish and became Sufi, but he still identifies himself as a Jew. My mom was raised Episcopalian and she converted thoroughly to Sufi Islam." "Its not like I'm offended if someone says we're a Christian band. I just don't think it's true. I don't think we live up to that calling, so I'd be reluctant to go saying that| access-date =September 4, 2008
}}</ref> Due to the Christian imagery in some of Aaron Weiss' lyrics, they have been categorized as a Christian band, although an interview, A. Weiss has stated he does not think they are a Christian band.<ref name="Busted" /> Their lyrics reflect a personal relationship with God, and are not [[evangelism|evangelistic]]. Other lyrical themes explored include suffering and self-doubt.

Many lyrics are taken from the Sufi poet [[Rumi]] including the song "The Cure for Pain" from ''[[A to B: Life|[A→B] Life]]'' and a line in the song "Seven Sisters" from ''[[Catch for Us the Foxes]]''.<ref>[[Wikiquote:Rumi]]</ref>

In the song "Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt" from their album ''[[A to B: Life|[A→B] Life]]'', Aaron Weiss' lyrics are based on a poem from the [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical poet]] [[John Donne]] called "[[A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning]]". John Donne wrote the poem to his wife to explain that there is no need for dreading their physical separation or distance because their spiritual love will always keep them together. The lines of the song "thy firmness makes my circle just, and makes me end where I begun" are directly from John Donne's poem where the conceit is revealed as a compass (Stanza 9, ll. 35–36). The title of the song itself is a Kurt Vonnegut quote.

The title of their second album ''[[Catch for Us the Foxes]]'' is taken directly from [[Song of Songs]] 2:15: "Catch for us the foxes, / the little foxes / that ruin the vineyards, / our vineyards that are in bloom" (''[[New International Version]]'').<ref name="SoS 2:15">{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Songs%202:15;&version=31; |title=Song of Songs 2:15, NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVSwBAUlBs |title=(question asked by audience member at 4:31) |publisher=Youtube |access-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref> singer Aaron Weiss states that the title of their third album, ''[[Brother, Sister]]'', comes from a verse in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].<ref>Bhagavad Gita 11:19, "You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos."</ref>

Their fourth album, ''[[It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright]]'' explores many of the teachings of [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]]. The Sufi teacher's story of "The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie" from ''My Love You My Children: 101 Stories for Children''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmfstore.com/Scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=33 |title=Children's Stories : Sufi Books, Audio and Videos by M.

"If you really want to just try to follow a path to God, I don't believe you need anything beyond [Jesus Christ], but it's just the idea that you're fixed on the only way and that everybody else is just completely misguided [...] that is a sort of obtuse attitude that can hurt your own spirit."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redefinemag.com/2009/mewithoutyou-band-interview-religion/ |title=REDEFINE magazine Interview With mewithoutYou, July 2009 |publisher=Redefinemag.com |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>
