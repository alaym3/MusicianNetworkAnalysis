'''Vika and Linda''', also known as '''Vika and Linda Bull''', are an Australian vocal duo consisting of '''Vika Susan Bull''' (born 1966) and her younger sister, '''Linda Rose Bull'''. They came to prominence after singing backing vocals in [[Joe Camilleri]]'s band [[The Black Sorrows]] from 1988. They left that group early in 1994 to start their duo with a [[Vika and Linda (album)|self-titled]] album appearing in June that year. The duo scored their first number 1 album in 2020, with their retrospective ''[['Akilotoa|'Akilotoa: Anthology (1994-2006)]]''.<ref name="debut1"/>

== History ==
===1966–1982: Early years===
Vika Susan Bull was born in 1966 in [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]], the older sister of Linda Rose Bull.<ref name="Valentish"/><ref name="ASCAP Search"/> Their mother, who was from [[Tonga]], arrived in Australia in 1959 as a nursing student.<ref name="NFSA Bio"/> Their father, whose parents were local [[orchardist]]s, was from [[Melbourne]].<ref name="Valentish"/><ref name="Genoux"/><ref name="McFarlane"/> The family maintained close links to the local Tongan community, and the sisters were taught traditional singing and dancing.<ref name="Valentish"/> As children, they regularly performed with the family at dinner dances and the Tongan church they attended.<ref name="Valentish"/> After church they would have a Tongan feast, Vika recalled in 1995, "It didn't matter what the occasion was we would sing. We had harmonies around us ..., and now we mainly sing gospel .... It's a way of letting loose, which is what gospel music is all about".<ref name="Hill"/> Vika received musical training. She had singing lessons, was taught the piano and how to read music. Vika and Linda both attended [[Camberwell Girls Grammar School]]. Vika left at the age of 17 to train as a legal secretary at Stotts College. Both worked at the Black Cat Cafe in their teens <ref name="O'Brien"/> in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].<ref name="Valentish"/>

While growing up, the sisters had separate ambitions: Vika wanted to be a professional singer; Linda wanted to be either a [[visual artist]] or a [[microbiologist]].<ref name="Genoux"/> Vika started training as a secretary, while Linda entered university.<ref name="Armitage"/> They both enjoyed singing, with their mother, an early coach, noticing their sibling [[vocal harmony]]. Vika recalled, "Our mother taught us to sing in harmony. [She] said, 'Linda, you got the low voice. You take the low part.' I took the high part".<ref name="Genoux"/> Vika's early influences were [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Etta James]] and [[Ruth Brown]].<ref name="Valentish"/> Linda's influences were [[Linda Ronstadt]], Aretha Franklin and [[Dolly Parton]].

===1983–1987: Blue Tomatoes, Fear of Flying, Sophisticated Boom Boom & The Honeymooners===
By 1983 Vika had started a band, Blue Tomatoes,<ref name="O'Brien"/> with one of the café's co-owners, Toni Edwards.<ref name="Valentish"/> They played cover versions of [[Soul music|soul songs]] and a few originals.<ref name="Valentish"/> In 1984 Vika became a backing singer in a Melbourne band, Fear of Flying<!-- Not the psychological state, Pteromerhanophobia -->.<ref name="Holmgren"/> After two years Vika joined Sophisticated Boom Boom<!-- Not the album by UK pop group, Dead or Alive -->.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Other members of that group were Jenny Tubbs (now Barbato), Louise Taunt, Steve Purcell, Steve Dagg, [[Kerri Simpson]], and Jeremy Rasmussen.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Vika started working as a receptionist at Platinum Studios<!-- Not the US media company -->, a recording studio.<ref name="Valentish"/>

In 1987, Linda left university and joined Vika in Sophisticated Boom Boom.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Swift"/> Vika also performed with John Justin and Thunderwings alongside Justin, Tony Featherstone, Paul Hines, Carl Manuel, Gordon Pitts, and Robert Woodrow.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Later in 1987 the sisters formed their own band, The Honeymooners,<ref name="Armitage"/><ref name="Byrne"/> with a line up of Jack Abeyratne, Thiery Fossmalle on bass guitar, and Steve Sedergreen.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane BfP"/> Vika met John Watson, drummer (ex-[[Australian Crawl]], [[Kevin Borich|Kevin Borich Express]]) in [[James Reyne|James Reyne Band]],<ref name="McFarlane JR"/> and they married in 1997.

Vika's first recording opportunity occurred when [[Rebecca Barnard]] was using the Platinum Studios and one of her backing vocalists "lost her voice".<ref name="Valentish"/> Vika, the receptionist, was now a backing singer.<ref name="Valentish"/> Early in 1988 Vika released her debut solo single, "Livin' Hell", which was soon followed by a second single, "My House".<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Vika and Linda worked with Barnard and Simpson in The Sacred Hearts of Sweet Temptation.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Swift"/>

===1988–1993: Success with the Black Sorrows===
By mid-1988, Vika and Linda had joined [[the Black Sorrows]], a blues-rock group, which had formed in 1983 by [[Joe Camilleri]] (ex-[[Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons]]) on lead vocals and saxophone.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane TBS"/> The group's drummer, [[Peter Luscombe]], recommended the sisters to Camilleri.<ref name="Valentish"/><ref name="Byrne"/> They provided backing vocals on the Black Sorrows' fifth studio album, ''[[Hold On to Me (album)|Hold On to Me]]'' (September 1988).<ref name="McFarlane TBS"/> The line-up was Vika and Linda, Camilleri, and Luscombe; with Wayne Burt on guitar; Jeff Burstin on guitar (both ex-Falcons); and Mick Girasole on bass guitar.<ref name="Woods"/> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AusCharts TBS"/> Vika and Linda provided backing vocals on the band's hits on the related ARIA Singles Chart, "[[Hold On to Me (The Black Sorrows song)|Hold On to Me]]", "[[Chained to the Wheel]]" and "[[The Crack Up (song)|The Crack-Up]]".<ref name="AusCharts TBS"/> For live gigs, Camilleri would give each their own "spots" displaying different voices: "Vika strong and soulful. Linda soft and gentle".<ref name="Nimmervoll Live"/>

Their second album with The Black Sorrows was ''[[Harley & Rose]]'' (November 1990) and saw the duo provide lead vocals on some of the album tracks. It peaked at No. 3 and provided two top 30 singles, "[[Harley + Rose]]" and "[[Never Let Me Go (Black Sorrows song)|Never Let Me Go]]".<ref name="AusCharts TBS"/> ''[[Better Times (album)|Better Times]]'' was released in September 1992 and peaked at No. 13.<ref name="AusCharts TBS"/> They followed with a compilation album, ''[[The Chosen Ones – Greatest Hits]]'', in November 1993 which reached No. 4. The group toured in support of its release, Nicole Leedham of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' noted that the band "has also been through the odd line-up change, with the latest incarnations offering the harmonies of Vika and Linda Bull, being the most successful".<ref name="Leedham"/>

Vika praised Camillleri saying that "He taught us that you have to take care of your own career, because no one else will do it for you. He taught us to watch every cent, to make sure your band is happy, and how to deal with the public".<ref name="Armitage"/> While members of The Black Sorrows, the duo provided vocals for other artists: [[Hunters and Collectors]]' ''[[What's a Few Men?]]'' (November 1987) and ''[[Ghost Nation (album)|Ghost Nation]]'' (November 1989); [[Ross Wilson (musician)|Ross Wilson]]'s ''Dark Side of the Man'' (July 1989); [[Archie Roach]]'s ''Charcoal Lane'' (May 1990); [[John Farnham]]'s ''[[Chain Reaction (John Farnham album)|Chain Reaction]]'' (September 1990); [[Seven Stories (band)|Seven Stories]]' ''Judges and Bagmen'' (1990); [[Deborah Conway]]'s ''[[String of Pearls (album)|String of Pearls]]'' (October 1991) and ''[[Bitch Epic]]'' (1993).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> During the recording of ''Charcoal Lane'', they met [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], its producer, and a singer-songwriter in his own right.
