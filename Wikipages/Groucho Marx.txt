'''Julius Henry''' "'''Groucho'''" '''Marx''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|aʊ|tʃ|oʊ}}; October 2, 1890 – August 19, 1977) was an American comedian, actor, writer, stage, film, radio, and television star.<ref name=obit/> He is generally considered to have been a master of quick wit and one of America's greatest comedians.<ref>''Billboard Magazine'' May 4, 1974 pg 35: "Groucho Marx was the best comedian this country ever produced – Woody Allen"</ref>

He made 13 feature films as a team with his siblings the [[Marx Brothers]], of whom he was the third-born. He also had a successful solo career, primarily on radio and television, most notably as the host of the game show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.<ref name=obit/>

His distinctive appearance, carried over from his days in [[vaudeville]], included quirks such as an exaggerated stooped posture, spectacles, cigar, a thick [[foundation (cosmetics)|greasepaint]] mustache, and eyebrows. These exaggerated features resulted in the creation of one of the most recognizable and ubiquitous novelty disguises, known as [[Groucho glasses]]: a one-piece mask consisting of [[horn-rimmed glasses]], a large plastic nose, bushy eyebrows and mustache.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Giddins | first =Gary | title =The New York Times Book Reviews 2000, volume 1 | publisher =Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers | year =2001 | isbn =1-57958-058-0}} "The most enduring masks of the 20th century—likely to take their place alongside Comedy and Tragedy or Pulcinella and Pierrot"</ref>

== Early life ==
Julius Henry Marx was born on October 2, 1890, in Manhattan, New York.<ref>The WWI draft registration of 1917 as Julius Henry Marx in Chicago, Illinois uses October 2, 1890. The 1900 census has him born in October of 1890.</ref> Marx stated that he was born in a room above a butcher's shop on East 78th Street, "Between Lexington & 3rd", as he told [[Dick Cavett]] in a 1969 television interview.<ref name="Cavett19690613"/> The Marx children grew up in a turn-of-the-century building on East 93rd Street off Lexington Avenue in a neighborhood now known as [[Carnegie Hill]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of the borough of Manhattan. His brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], in his memoir ''Harpo Speaks'', called the building "the first real home they ever knew". It was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans. Just across the street were the oldest [[brownstone]]s in the area, owned by people such as the well-connected Loew Brothers and William Orth. The Marx family lived there "for about 14 years," Groucho also told Cavett.

Marx's family was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Baum|title=L.A.'s Power Golf Clubs: Where the Hollywood Elite Play|date=June 23, 2011|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-power-golf-clubs-hollywood-205072|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> His mother was [[Minnie Marx|Miene "Minnie" Schoenberg]], whose family came from [[Dornum]] in northern Germany when she was 16 years old. His father was [[Sam Marx|Simon "Sam" Marx]], who changed his name from Marrix, and was called "Frenchie" by his sons throughout his life, because he and his family came from Alsace in France.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bland|first=Frank|title=The Marx Brothers Family|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/biography/marxes.htm|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> Minnie's brother was Al Schoenberg, who shortened his name to [[Al Shean]] when he went into show business as half of [[Gallagher and Shean]], a noted [[vaudeville]] act of the early 20th century. According to Marx, when Shean visited, he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.

Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career but had intense ambition for her sons to go on the stage like their uncle. While pushing her eldest son Leonard ([[Chico Marx]]) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Julius's early career goal was to become a doctor, but the family's need for income forced him out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, young Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of [[Horatio Alger]]. Marx would continue to overcome his lack of formal education by becoming very well-read.

After a few stabs at entry-level office work and jobs suitable for adolescents, Julius took to the stage as a boy singer with the Gene Leroy Trio, debuting at the [[Ramona Park#Ramona Theater Pavilion|Ramona Theatre]] in [[Grand Rapids, MI]], on July 16, 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bader|first=Robert S.|title=Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers on Stage|date=2016|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, IL|page=31|isbn=9780810134164}}</ref> Marx reputedly claimed that he was "hopelessly average" as a vaudevillian, but this was typical Marx, wisecracking in his true form. By 1909, Minnie Marx had assembled her sons into an undistinguished vaudeville singing group billed as "The Four Nightingales". The brothers Julius, Milton ([[Gummo Marx]]) and Arthur (originally Adolph, but Harpo Marx from 1911) and another boy singer, Lou Levy, traveled the U.S. vaudeville circuits to little fanfare. After exhausting their prospects in the East, the family moved to [[La Grange, Illinois]], to play the Midwest.
 
After a particularly dispiriting performance in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], Julius, Milton, and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers. They modified the then-popular [[Gus Edwards (vaudeville)|Gus Edwards]] comedy skit "School Days" and renamed it "Fun In Hi Skule". The Marx Brothers would perform variations on this routine for the next seven years.

For a time in vaudeville, all the brothers performed using ethnic accents. Leonard, the oldest, developed the Italian accent he used as Chico Marx to convince some roving bullies that he was Italian, not Jewish. Arthur, the next oldest, donned a curly red wig and became "Patsy Brannigan", a stereotypical Irish character. His discomfort when speaking on stage led to his uncle Al Shean's suggestion that he stop speaking altogether and play the role in mime. Julius Marx's character from "Fun In Hi Skule" was an ethnic German, so Julius played him with a German accent. After the sinking of the {{RMS|Lusitania}} in 1915, public [[anti-German sentiment]] was widespread, and Marx's German character was booed, so he quickly dropped the accent and developed the fast-talking wise-guy character that became his trademark.

The Marx Brothers became the biggest comedic stars of the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in New York, which billed itself as the "Valhalla of Vaudeville". Brother Chico's deal-making skills resulted in three hit plays on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. No other comedy routine had ever so infected the Broadway circuit. All of this stage work predated their Hollywood career. By the time the Marxes made their first movie, they were already major stars with sharply honed skills; and by the time Groucho was relaunched to stardom on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', he had been performing successfully for half a century.

== Career ==

=== Vaudeville ===
Marx started his career in [[vaudeville]] in 1905 when he joined up with an act called The Leroy Trio.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The New Humor in the Progressive Era|last=DesRochers|first=Rick|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-35742-7|location=New York, New York|pages=83, 84, 85}}</ref> He was asked by a man named Robin Leroy to join the group as a singer, along with fellow vaudeville actor Johnny Morris. Through this act, Marx got his first taste of life as a vaudeville performer. In 1909, Marx and his brothers had become a group act, at first called The Three Nightingales and later The Four Nightingales.<ref name=":0" /> The brothers' mother, [[Minnie Marx]], was the group's manager, putting them together and booking their shows. The group had a rocky start, performing in less than adequate venues and rarely, if ever, being paid for their performances.<ref name=":0" /> Eventually one of the brothers would leave to serve in World War I and was replaced by Herbert (Zeppo), and the group became known as the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref name=":0" /> Their first successful show was ''Fun In Hi Skule'' (1910).<ref name=":0" />

=== Hollywood ===
[[File:Marx Brothers 1931.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|The Marx Brothers in 1931 (from top, Chico, Harpo, Groucho and Zeppo)]]
Marx made 26 movies, 13 of them with his brothers Chico and Harpo.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.groucho-marx.com/bio.html|title=Groucho Marx Biography|access-date=2008-06-25|website=Groucho-marx.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119074319/http://internetserviceteam.com/|archive-date=2012-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> Marx developed a routine as a wisecracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint mustache and eyebrows and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy [[dowager]]s (usually played by [[Margaret Dumont]]) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of popular stage shows and movies.

Their first movie was a silent film made in 1921 that was never released,<ref name="bio"/> and is believed to have been destroyed at the time. A decade later, the team made two of their Broadway hits—''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' and ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''<ref name="bio"/>—into movies. Other successful films were ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' and ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref name="bio"/> One quip from Marx concerned his response to [[Sam Wood]], the director of ''A Night at the Opera''. Furious with the Marx Brothers' ad-libs and antics on the set, Wood yelled in disgust: "You can't make an actor out of clay." Marx responded, "Nor a director out of Wood."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boller|first1=Paul F.|last2=Davis|first2=Ronald L.|title=Hollywood Anecdotes|edition=reprint|year=1988|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-35654-3|page=220}}</ref>

Marx also worked as a radio comedian and show host. One of his earliest stints was a short-lived series in 1932, ''[[Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel]],'' costarring Chico. Though most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the [[Library of Congress]].
In 1947, Marx was asked to host a radio quiz program ''[[You Bet Your Life]].'' It was broadcast by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950, and ran for eleven years. Filmed before an audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases "Say the secret word and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars," "Who's buried in [[Grant's Tomb]]?" and "What color is the [[White House]]?" (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan|title=The Essential Groucho: Writings by, for and about Groucho Marx|publisher=Random House|year=2000|isbn=037570213X|location=New York|pages=209}}</ref>

Throughout his career, Marx introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including "[[Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]" and "[[Hello, I Must Be Going (song)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]", in ''Animal Crackers'', "[[Horse Feathers#Musical numbers|Whatever It Is, I'm Against It]]", "[[Horse Feathers#Musical numbers|Everyone Says I Love You]]" and "[[Lydia the Tattooed Lady]]". [[Frank Sinatra]], who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and [[Jane Russell]] in 1951 entitled ''[[Double Dynamite]]''.

=== Mustache, eyebrows, and walk ===
{{See also|Groucho glasses}}
In public and off-camera, Harpo and Chico were hard to recognize without their wigs and costumes, and it was almost impossible for fans to recognize Groucho without his trademark eyeglasses, fake eyebrows, and mustache.

[[File:Groucho Marx-Eve Arden in At the Circus trailer.jpg|left|thumb|Groucho and [[Eve Arden]] in a scene from ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939)]]
The greasepaint mustache and eyebrows originated spontaneously prior to a vaudeville performance in the early 1920s when he did not have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]],'' where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his mustache and eyebrows.

Marx was asked to apply the greasepaint mustache once more for ''You Bet Your Life'' when it came to television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore for the rest of his life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him to actually need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in ''[[Love Happy]],'' the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.

Marx did paint the old character mustache over his real one on a few rare occasions, including a TV sketch with [[Jackie Gleason]] on the latter's variety show in the 1960s (in which they performed a variation on the song "[[Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean]]," co-written by Marx's uncle [[Al Shean]]) and the 1968 [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]''. In his late 70s at the time, Marx remarked on his appearance: "I looked like I was embalmed." He played a mob boss called "God" and, according to Marx, "both my performance and the film were God-awful!"

The exaggerated walk, with one hand on the small of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist, was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, allowing the left hand to swing free with the gait. Edmund Morris, in his biography ''[[The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt]]'', describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Edmund|title=The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt|date=2001|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-375-75678-7|pages=143–144|edition=Modern Library Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-R37GQsVfgC|access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> Marx exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedic effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Marx Brothers 1948.jpg|left|thumb|The Marx Brothers (clockwise from bottom: Groucho, Chico, and Harpo) by [[Yusuf Karsh]], 1946]]
Marx's three marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was chorus girl Ruth Johnson (m. 1920–1942). He was 29 and she was 19 at the time of their wedding. The couple had two children, [[Arthur Marx]] and [[Miriam Marx]]. His second wife was Kay Marvis (m. 1945–1951), {{née}} Catherine Dittig,<ref>[https://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_060339/89 ''Boxoffice'', 3 June 1939, p. 89].</ref> former wife of [[Leo Gorcey]]. Marx was 54 and Kay was 21 at the time of their marriage. They had a daughter, [[Melinda Marx]]. His third wife was actress [[Eden Hartford]] (m. 1954–1969). He was 64 and she was 24 at the time of their wedding.

During the early 1950s, Marx described his perfect woman: "Someone who looks like [[Marilyn Monroe]] and talks like [[George S. Kaufman]]."<ref>{{cite book| work =[[Arthur Marx]]| title =Life With Groucho| url =https://archive.org/details/lifewithgroucho00marx| url-access =registration| publisher =Simon and Schuster| year =1954| location =New York| page =[https://archive.org/details/lifewithgroucho00marx/page/294 294]

Marx was denied membership in an informal [[symphonietta]] of friends (including Harpo) organized by [[Ben Hecht]], because he could play only the mandolin. When the group began its first rehearsal at Hecht's home, Marx rushed in and demanded silence from the "lousy amateurs". The musicians discovered him conducting the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the overture to ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' in Hecht's living room. Marx was allowed to join the symphonietta.<ref name="friedrich1997">{{cite book | title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s | publisher=University of California Press | author=Friedrich, Otto | year=1997|edition=reprint | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x8AFchW4JsC&pg=PP1 | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles | page=43 | isbn=0520209494}}</ref>

Later in life, Marx would sometimes note to talk show hosts, not entirely jokingly, that he was unable to actually insult anyone, because the target of his comment would assume that it was a Groucho-esque joke, and would laugh.

Despite his lack of formal education, he wrote many books, including his autobiography, ''Groucho and Me'' (1959) and ''Memoirs of a Mangy Lover'' (1963). He was a friend of such literary figures as [[Booth Tarkington]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Carl Sandburg]]. Much of his personal correspondence with those and other figures is featured in the book ''The Groucho Letters'' (1967) with an introduction and commentary on the letters written by Marx, who donated his letters to the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=mm%2082047845&searchType=1&permalink=y |title=Groucho Marx papers, 1930-1967 |work=[[Library of Congress]] Online Catalog|access-date=June 18, 2017}}</ref> His daughter Miriam published a collection of his letters to her in 1992 titled ''Love, Groucho.''

In ''My Life with Groucho: A Son's Eye View'', [[Arthur Marx]] relates that in his latter years Groucho increasingly referred to himself by the name Hackenbush, referring to the character of that name he played in [[A Day at the Races (film)]].<ref>Marx, Arthur (June 1991).

Marx made serious efforts to learn to play the guitar. In the 1932 film ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', he performs the film's love theme "Everyone Says I Love You" for costar [[Thelma Todd]] on a [[Gibson L-5]].<ref>Jerry McCulley, [http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/The-Surprisingly-Serious-Tale.aspx The Surprisingly Serious Tale of Comedian Groucho Marx and His Lifelong Quest to Master Guitar.]</ref>

In July 1937, an America vs England pro-celebrity tennis doubles match was organized, featuring Marx and [[Ellsworth Vines]] playing against [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Fred Perry]], to open the new clubhouse at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club. Marx appeared on court with 12 rackets and a suitcase, leaving Chaplin – who took tennis seriously – bemused, before he asked what was in it. Marx asked Chaplin what was in his, with Chaplin responding he didn't have one. Marx replied, "What kind of tennis player are you?" After playing only a few games, Marx sat on the court and unpacked an elaborate picnic lunch from his suitcase.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Marx brothers on film: souped-up comedy |url=https://www.ft.com/content/79d9cd22-89f7-11e4-8daa-00144feabdc0 |access-date=March 21, 2019 |work=Financial Times}}</ref>

[[Irving Berlin]] quipped, "The world would not be in such a snarl, had Marx been Groucho instead of Karl".<ref>Irving Berlin, Robert Kimball, Linda Emmet. ''The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin'', p. 489. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005. {{ISBN|1-55783-681-7}}</ref> In his book ''The Groucho Phile'', Marx says "I've been a liberal Democrat all my life", and "I frankly find Democrats a better, more sympathetic crowd.... I'll continue to believe that Democrats have a greater regard for the common man than Republicans do".<ref>Marx, Groucho. ''The Groucho Phile'', p. 238. Wallaby, 1977.</ref> However, just like some of the other Democrats of the time, Marx also said in a television interview that he disliked the [[women's liberation movement]]. On the July 7, 1967, ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' TV show, Marx said, “The Democratic Party is the Garden of Eden of incompetence, the whole political left." The quote can be located 11 minutes into the YouTube video of the show. The word at the end of Groucho's sentence is "left", not "life" as erroneously reported in edits.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXlIZBZpkoA&t=660s</ref>

== Later years ==
===''You Bet Your Life''===

Marx's radio career was not as successful as his work on stage and in film, though historians such as [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] and Michael Barson suggest that, in the case of the single-season ''[[Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel]]'' (1932), the failure may have been a combination of a poor time slot and the Marx Brothers' returning to Hollywood to make another film.

In the mid-1940s, he weathered a depressing lull in his career. His radio show ''[[Blue Ribbon Town]]'' had failed, he failed to sell his proposed sitcom ''The Flotsam Family'' only to see it become a huge hit as ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' with [[William Bendix]] in the title role. By that time, the Marx Brothers as film performers had officially retired.

Marx was scheduled to appear on a radio show with [[Bob Hope]]. Annoyed that he was made to wait in the [[green room]] for 40 minutes, he went on the air in a foul mood. Hope started by saying "Why, Groucho Marx! Groucho, what are you doing out here in the desert?" Marx retorted, "Huh, desert, I've been sitting in the dressing room for forty minutes! Some desert alright&nbsp;...". Marx continued to ignore the script, [[ad-lib]]bing at length, and took it well beyond its allotted time slot.

Listening in on the show was producer [[John Guedel]], who had a brainstorm. He approached Marx about doing a quiz show, to which Marx derisively retorted, "A quiz show? Only actors who are completely washed up resort to a quiz show!" Undeterred, Guedel proposed that the quiz would be only a backdrop for Marx's interviews of people, and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Marx replied, "Well, I've had no success in radio, and I can't hold on to a sponsor. At this point, I'll try anything!"{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}
[[File:You bet your life postcard 1953.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Marx as host of ''You Bet Your Life'', 1953]]
''You Bet Your Life'' debuted in October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), sponsored by costume jewelry manufacturer [[Allen Gellman]];<ref>Charlotte Chandler. Hello, I must be going: Groucho and his friends. Doubleday, 1978, p 190</ref> and then on CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC. The show was on radio only from 1947 to 1950; on both radio and television from 1950 to 1960; and on television only, from 1960 to 1961. The show proved a huge hit, being one of the most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With [[George Fenneman]] as his announcer and straight man, Marx entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since ''You Bet Your Life'' was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted — although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Marx ready-made lines in advance — the producers insisted that the network prerecord it instead of it being broadcast live. There were three reasons for this: prerecording provided Marx with time to fish around for funny exchanges, any intervening dead spots could be edited out; and most importantly to protect the network, since Marx was a notorious [[loose cannon]] and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile ''marque'' [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads, Marx would sometimes say: "Tell 'em Groucho sent you", or "Try a DeSoto before you decide". In 1975, episodes of the show were rebroadcast as ''The Best of Groucho''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kleiner |first=Dick  |title=Groucho's straight man back|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/116069539/|newspaper=The Anniston Star |location= Anniston, Alabama |date=August 23, 1975|access-date=September 1, 2021}}</ref>

The program's theme music was an instrumental version of "[[Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]", which became increasingly identified as Marx's personal theme song. A recording of the song with Marx and the Ken Lane singers with an orchestra directed by [[Victor Young]] was released in 1952. Another recording made by Marx during this period was "The Funniest Song in the World", released on the Young People's Records label in 1949. It was a series of five original children's songs with a connecting narrative about a monkey and his fellow zoo creatures.

An apocryphal story relates Marx interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx asked why she had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story is said to have replied, "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, "I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while." The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast.<ref>Dwan, R. As Long As They're Laughing : Groucho Marx and You Bet Your Life.

Another anecdote that may or may not be apocryphal recounts how Warner Brothers threatened to sue Groucho when they learned that the next Marx Brothers film was to be called "A Night in Casablanca", contending that that title was too similar to their own film Casablanca.  Groucho is reported to have replied: "I'll sue you for using the word Brothers."<ref>Clifton Fadiman (ed), Little Brown Book of Anecdotes, Boston 1985, p. 387</ref>

By the time ''You Bet Your Life'' debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Marx had grown a real mustache (which he had already sported earlier in the films ''[[Copacabana (1947 film)|Copacabana]]'' and ''[[Love Happy]]'').

During a tour of Germany in 1958, accompanied by then-wife Eden, daughter Melinda, Robert Dwan and Dwan's daughter Judith, he climbed a pile of rubble that marked the site of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Führerbunker|bunker]], the site of Hitler's death, and performed a two-minute [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Hallett |first = Judith Dwan |title = What's So Funny & Why? |publisher = Sarah Lawrence College |url = http://www.slc.edu/magazine/whats-so-funny/Whats_So_Funny_and_Why.php |access-date = 2007-07-29}}</ref> He later remarked to Richard J. Anobile in ''The Marx Brothers Scrapbook,'' "Not much satisfaction after he killed six million Jews!"

[[File:Groucho Marx Koko the Mikado Bell Telephone Hour 1960.JPG|thumb|Marx as Ko-Ko, 1960]]
In 1960, Marx, a lifelong devotee of the comic operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], appeared as Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, in a televised production of ''[[The Mikado]]'' on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Bell Telephone Hour]]''. A clip of this is in rotation on [[Classic Arts Showcase]].

Another TV show, ''Tell It to Groucho'', premiered January 11, 1962, on CBS, but only lasted five months. On October 1, 1962, Marx, after acting as occasional guest host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during the six-month interval between [[Jack Paar]] and [[Johnny Carson]], introduced Carson as the new host.

In 1964, Marx starred in the "Time for Elizabeth" episode of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', a truncated version of a play that he and [[Norman Krasna]] wrote in 1948.

In 1965, Marx starred in a weekly show for British TV titled ''Groucho'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The program was along similar lines to ''You Bet Your Life'', with [[Keith Fordyce]] taking on the Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.

Marx appeared as a gangster named God in the comedy movie ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968), directed by [[Otto Preminger]], and starring [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Carol Channing]]. It was released by the studio where the Marx Brothers began their film career, [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received almost universally negative reviews. Writer [[Paul Krassner]] published a story in the February 1981 issue of ''[[High Times Magazine|High Times]]'', relating how Marx prepared for the LSD-themed movie by taking a dose of the drug in Krassner's company, and had a moving, largely pleasant experience.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Marx developed friendships with rock star [[Alice Cooper]]—the two were photographed together for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine—and television host [[Dick Cavett]], becoming a frequent guest on Cavett's late-night talk show, even appearing in a one-man, 90-minute interview.<ref name="Cavett19690613">{{cite web|url=http://dickcavettshow.com/index.php/component/zoo/item/6-13-69|title=The Dick Cavett Show - 6/13/1969|website=Dickcavettshow.com|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> He befriended [[Elton John]] when the British singer was staying in California in 1972, insisting on calling him "John Elton". According to writer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], when Marx jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters, Elton John put up his hands and said, "Don't shoot me, I'm only the piano player," thereby naming [[Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player|the album he had just completed]]. A [[film poster]] for the Marx Bros. movie ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' is visible on the album cover photograph as an homage to Marx. Elton John accompanied Marx to a performance of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. As the lights went down, Marx called out, "Does it have a happy ending?" And during the Crucifixion scene, he declared, "This is sure to offend the Jews."{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Marx's previous work regained popularity; new books of transcribed conversations were published by Richard J. Anobile and [[Charlotte Chandler]]. In a [[BBC]] interview in 1975, Marx called his greatest achievement having a book selected for cultural preservation in the Library of Congress. In a Cavett interview in 1971,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dickcavettshow.com/index.php/component/zoo/item/5-25-71|title=The Dick Cavett Show - 5/25/1971|website=Dickcavettshow.com|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> Marx said being published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' under his own name,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/groucho-marx|title=Groucho Marx - Contributors|work=newyorker.com|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> Julius Henry Marx, meant more than all the plays he appeared in.<ref name="Cavett19690613"/> As a man who never had formal schooling, to have his writings declared culturally important was a point of great satisfaction.

As he passed his 81st birthday in 1971, Marx became increasingly frail, physically and mentally, as a result of a succession of minor [[Cerebrovascular Accident|strokes]] and other health issues.<ref name="pov1">[http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL238.htm Point of View] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021181758/http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL238.htm |date=2006-10-21 }}, Mark Evanier, 1999-06-04, retrieved, 2007-08-09.</ref><ref name="pov2">[http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL239.htm Point of View] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717220054/http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL239.htm |date=2012-07-17 }}, Mark Evanier, 1999-06-11, retrieved, 2007-08-09.</ref>  In 1972, largely at the behest of his companion [[Erin Fleming]], Marx staged a live one-man show at [[Carnegie Hall]] that was later released as a double album, ''An Evening with Groucho'', on [[A&M Records]]. He also made an appearance in 1973 on a short-lived variety show hosted by [[Bill Cosby]]. Fleming's influence on Marx was controversial. Some close to Marx believed that she did much to revive his popularity, and the relationship with a younger woman boosted his ego and vitality.<ref name=Opinionator/> Others described her as a [[Svengali]], exploiting an increasingly senile Marx in pursuit of her own stardom.  Marx's children, particularly Arthur, felt strongly that Fleming was pushing their weak father beyond his physical and mental limits.<ref name="pov2" />  Writer [[Mark Evanier]] concurred.<ref name="pov3">[http://www.newsfromme.com/2004/03/07/erin/ Erin Fleming, R.I.P.], Mark Evanier, 7 March 2004</ref>

On the [[46th Academy Awards|1974 Academy Awards telecast]], Marx's final major public appearance, [[Jack Lemmon]] presented him with an honorary [[Academy Award]] to a standing ovation. The award honored Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo as well: "in recognition of his brilliant creativity and for the unequalled achievements of the Marx Brothers in the art of motion picture comedy". Noticeably frail, Marx took a bow for his deceased brothers. "I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor," he said, naming his two deceased brothers (Zeppo, still alive, was in the audience). He also praised the late [[Margaret Dumont]] as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.<ref name="Cavett19690613"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1YsAxiiH98 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/a1YsAxiiH98| archive-date=2021-10-30|title=Groucho Marx receiving an Honorary Oscar® |website=Oscars.org |date=2009-11-24 |access-date=2013-09-25}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Marx's final appearance was a brief sketch with [[George Burns]] in the [[Bob Hope]] television special ''Joys'' (a parody of the 1975 movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'') in March 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_T3H-DS1w&?t=18m19s| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210182051/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_T3H-DS1w&?t=18m19s| archive-date=2017-02-10| title=Bob Hope Special: Bob Hope in ''Joys'' |publisher=Hope Enterprises |date=1976-03-05 |access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> His health continued to decline the following year; when his younger brother [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] died at age 83 on April 21, 1977, Marx was never told for fear of eliciting still further deterioration of his health.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gummo Marx, Managed Comedians |quote=[[Palm Springs, California]], April 21, 2007 ([[Reuters]]) Gummo Marks, an original member of the Marx brothers' comedy team, died here today.

Marx maintained his irrepressible sense of humor to the very end, however. George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story of one of his final visits to Marx's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Marx from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to "walk" the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: "Fenneman," whispered Marx, "you always were a lousy dancer."<ref>"George Fenneman, Sidekick To Groucho Marx, Dies at 77" [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/05/us/george-fenneman-sidekick-to-groucho-marx-dies-at-77.html ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 5, 1997)].

Groucho Marx was considered the most recognizable of the Marx Brothers. Groucho-like characters and references have appeared in popular culture both during and after his life, some aimed at audiences who may never have seen a Marx Brothers movie. Marx's trademark eyeglasses, nose, mustache, and cigar have become icons of comedy—glasses with fake noses and mustaches (referred to as "[[Groucho glasses]]", "nose-glasses," and other names) are sold by novelty and costume shops around the world.

The cover of [[The Firesign Theatre]]'s 1969 album, ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', subtitled ''All Hail Marx and Lennon'', features images of Groucho Marx and John Lennon.

[[Nat Perrin]], close friend of Groucho Marx and writer of several Marx Brothers films, inspired [[John Astin]]'s portrayal of [[Gomez Addams]] on the 1960s TV series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' with similarly thick mustache, eyebrows, sardonic remarks, backward logic, and ever-present cigar (pulled from his breast pocket already lit).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.unisa.edu.au/unisanews/2015/July/feature.asp|title= The return of Gomez Addams  |access-date=July 21, 2020 }}</ref>

''[[Minnie's Boys]]'', a 1970 Broadway musical, focused on the younger years of Marx (played by [[Lewis J. Stadlen]]), his brothers, and his mother (played by [[Shelley Winters]]). Marx received credit as the show's advisor and appeared on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' to promote the production.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Minnie's Boys|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/minnies-boys-3517|access-date=October 21, 2020|website=Internet Broadway Database}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=J.

A meeting with [[Elton John]] led to a press photo of Marx pointing both of his index fingers and thumbs at Elton like revolvers. John's spontaneous response of holding up his hands and replying, "Don't shoot me! I'm only the piano player!" was so amusing that Elton John reused it as the [[Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player|title of a 1973 album]]. An added Marx homage was that a poster for the Marx Brothers' movie ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' was included on the cover art.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=David |date=2007 |title=Elton The Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVXrl8aZP0kC&pg=PA144

The reason was that in [[communism|communist]] Hungary, the name 'Marx' was associated with [[Karl Marx]] and it was not allowed to use it in such a light, humorous context.<ref>{{cite web|title=Már 40 éve nem szeretnénk olyan klubhoz tartozni, amelyik elfogadna tagnak|url=https://hvg.hu/kultura/20170420_annie_hall_40_woody_allen_diane_keaton |website=hvg.hu|date=20 April 2017 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>

Woody Allen's 1996 musical ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'', in addition to being named for one of Marx's signature songs, ends with a Groucho-themed New Year's Eve party in Paris, which some of the stars, including Allen and [[Goldie Hawn]], attend in full Groucho costume.
