'''Noel John Christopher Harrison''' (29 January 1934 – 19 October 2013) was an [[English people|English]] actor and singer who had a hit singing "[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]" in 1968, and was a member of the British [[Olympics|Olympic]] [[skier|skiing]] team in the 1950s. He was the son of the actor [[Rex Harrison]].

==Early life==
Harrison was born on 29 January 1934 in [[Kensington]], [[London]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p24418/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Linda Seida |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref> His mother, Ethel Margery Noel Collette-Thomas, was the first of Rex Harrison's six wives; they divorced in 1942. Ethel and her cousin Richard Michael Collette Thomas (later a Lieutenant-Colonel killed in action, 1944, in France) were brought up together by their grandparents, Major John Cyril Collette-Thomas & Jessie Maud Scott-Brown, in [[Bude]], North Cornwall. At age 15, Ethel took young Noel out of school at [[Radley College|Radley]] to live in the Swiss Alps.

Harrison never returned to school and began ski-racing.<ref>[http://www.noelharrison.co.uk/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023125326/http://www.noelharrison.co.uk/ |date=23 October 2013 }}</ref> He joined the Ipswich repertory theatre group and taught himself guitar, but his main interest and most of his spare time was spent skiing. At an early age he was a member of the British ski team, becoming its first giant-slalom champion in 1953, and representing [[Great Britain]] at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in [[Oslo, Norway]], and at the [[1956 Winter Olympics]] in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy]].

Harrison undertook [[National Service]] and, after leaving the [[British army|army]] in the 1950s, toyed with the idea of becoming a journalist, but instead, concentrated on his guitar. His early break came when he took a regular part in the [[BBC Television]] programme, ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]'', as part of a team who sang the day's news in a [[Calypso music|calypso]] style.

When Harrison was 20, he started playing professionally, around the tables in a Greek restaurant in London. He also made a living playing in bars and nightclubs all over Europe, including appearances at the Blue Angel (nightclub), Mayfair, London where one show was recorded for a [[live album]].

==Move to United States==
After appearing in small roles in British films such as ''[[The Best of Enemies (1961 film)|The Best of Enemies]]'' (1961), ''[[Hot Enough for June]]'' (1964) and ''[[Where the Spies Are]]'' (1965) Harrison left for the [[United States]] in 1965, working as a nightclub entertainer at such venues as the [[Hungry I]] in [[San Francisco]], and at the Persian Room in [[New York City]]. Thanks to his managers [[Robert Chartoff|Bob Chartoff]] and [[Irwin Winkler]], who went on to produce the ''[[Rocky]]'' films, he had a [[Gramophone record|record]] reach the [[record chart|charts]]. The track was "A Young Girl", written by [[Charles Aznavour]].  In the 1966-67 television season he appeared as Mark Slate in 29 episodes of the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' as the costar of [[Stefanie Powers]] (April Dancer).<ref name="AMG"/> A year earlier, Norman Fell originated his Mark Slate character on the original U.N.C.L.E. series, ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' in a 2nd season episode titled "The Galatea Affair".

"A Young Girl" was included as one of the tracks on Harrison's debut album, ''Noel Harrison'', in 1966. Two years later, he recorded  "[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]", the [[theme music|theme tune]] from the [[film]] ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'',<ref name="AMG"/> which won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] in 1968,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{cite book

| page= 245}}</ref> Despite the song winning the 1968 Oscar for best original song, Harrison did not sing it at the ceremony. Instead his place was taken by [[Jose Feliciano]]. The change was made because he was working on the film, ''[[Take a Girl Like You (film)|Take A Girl Like You]]'' in England, with [[Oliver Reed]] and [[Hayley Mills]]. Coincidentally, his father had sung the Oscar-winning song ("[[Talk to the Animals]]") only the previous year (1967).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2"/>

The television series, plus the [[Top 40]] record, landed Harrison a [[recording contract]] with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]], who released three of his albums, ''Collage'', ''Santa Monica Pier'' and ''The Great Electric Experiment Is Over''.<ref name="AMG"/> ''Collage'' reached #135 in the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda Seida |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/noel-harrison-mn0000882782/awards |title=Noel Harrison &#124; Awards |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref> He also toured with the [[Beach Boys]], and [[Sonny and Cher]], appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', featured on a music program, ''Hullabaloo'' and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

In 1968, Harrison played the male lead in ''[[The Fantasticks]]'', in touring theatres in the round, including The Cape Cod Melody Tent in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 1970, he played the male lead role in "Blithe Spirit" at The Cape Playhouse in Dennis, MA and returned in 1983 for the lead male role in "The Housekeeper".

==Move to Canada==
In 1972, Harrison left the United States for [[Nova Scotia]],<ref name="AMG"/> settling in rural [[Mount Hanley]]. He bought a farmhouse with 320 acres of farmland, and from there he commuted to Halifax where he hosted a show called ''[[Take Time With Noel Harrison|Take Time]]'' for [[CBC Television]].<ref name="AMG"/> In winter 1974, the wood stove caught fire and his house burned down, inspiring him to write the humorous song, "The Middleton Fire Brigade", which appeared on his 1979 album ''Mount Hanley Song''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mount Hanley Song (about the album)|url=http://www.thewindmillsofyourmind.com/mounthanleysong|work=The Windmills of Your Mind (Noel Harrison fan site)|access-date=8 November 2012}}</ref> He subsequently built a new house from scratch with no electricity, inspired by the fashionable pioneers [[Helen Nearing|Helen]] and [[Scott Nearing]] and their self-help bible, ''Living The Good Life''.

==Touring shows==
During the 1970s, Harrison toured the United States in productions of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. He also played Henry Higgins in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', the part first performed by his father in the musical's original stage production and film version. Other touring roles included King Arthur in ''Camelot'', Baron von Trapp in ''The Sound of Music'', Don Quixote in ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', Brian Runicles in ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'' and Lloyd Dallas in ''[[Noises Off]]''.<ref name="AMG"/>

He later began acting again, appearing in the cinema films ''[[Power (1986 film)|Power]]'', and ''[[Déjà Vu (1997 film)|Déjà Vu]].'' An admirer of [[Jacques Brel]], Harrison created a one-man musical, ''Adieu, Jacques'', and in 2002 released an album of songs from the show.

==Return to England==
In 2004, Harrison returned to the UK, relocating his home to the county of [[Devon]]. He continued to sing, appearing in occasional concerts to finance the recording and release of his self-produced albums, such as ''Hold Back Time''. A compilation album of his work titled ''Life Is a Dream'' was released by the American 'Reprise' record label in 2003, and his debut album, ''Noel Harrison'', was re-released in 2008. In 2010, he recorded a new album, ''From the Sublime to the Ridiculous!''. The record was made as part of the Internet event, ''The RPM Challenge'', which challenged musicians to record a new album from scratch during the month of February.

In June 2011, Harrison played [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s "Spirit of '71" stage, marking 40 years since his appearance at the second staging of the festival. The performance was televised by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], including a backstage acoustic version of the song "The Windmills of Your Mind".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Personal life==
Harrison was married three times. In 1959, he married Sara Lee Eberts Tufnell, with whom he had three children: [[Cathryn Harrison|Cathryn]], Simon, and Harriet. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1969. His second marriage was in 1972 to Margaret Benson. The couple had two children, Chloe and Will, and later divorced in 1989. Harrison's final marriage was in 1991 to Lori Chapman, to whom he remained married until his death in 2013.<ref name="Yahoo News">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/windmills-mind-singer-noel-harrison-dies-110418246.html|title="Windmills of Your Mind" singer Noel Harrison dies|work=Yahoo News|date=22 October 2013|access-date=22 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="guardian death">{{cite web|title=Noel Harrison obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/22/noel-harrison|work=The Guardian|access-date=22 October 2013}}</ref>
