'''Peter Sommer Christensen''' (born 28 August 1974 in [[Skanderborg]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] singer and songwriter. His lyrics are often characterized by interesting puns and word plays. Besides his solo career, he was in the duo Superjeg with [[Carsten Valentin Lassen]], and is currently part of the duo [[De Eneste To]] alongside [[Simon Kvamm]].

==In duo Superjeg==
In the early 2000s, Peter Sommer and [[Carsten Valentin Lassen]] formed the pop rock duo Superjeg. Sommer was lead vocals and also played bass, whereas Lassen played guitar and keyboards. The duo utilized many double meanings and puns in their musical output and released two albums: ''Alt er ego'' in 2002 and ''Øst/Vest'' in 2003, both on the label [[Auditorium (2)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/42107-Auditorium-2|title=Auditorium (2)}}</ref> The duo has never officially disbanded, but they have not produced any content together since.

==Solo==
In 2004, Peter Sommer released his debut solo album, ''[[På den anden side]]'', which cracked the Top 5 in Denmark. The single "Valby Bakke" was selected as ''Ugens Uundgåelige'' (week's pick), a label given to rising artists by Danish radio station [[DR P3|P3]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/underholdning/et-hit-at-synge-paa-dansk-igen|title = Et hit at synge på dansk igen|date = 17 October 2004}}</ref> however, it never charted. In 2006, his follow-up album ''[[Destruktive vokaler]]''won him a prize from [[Statens Kunstfond]] (the Danish Arts Foundation), and, in 2007, won the title of "Danish Pop Album of the Year".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kunst.dk/db/files/skf_aarsberetning_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924135714/http://www.kunst.dk/db/files/skf_aarsberetning_2006.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
In 2008, he released his album ''[[Til rotterne, til kragerne, til hundene]]'', which came with his first charting single "Rødt kort" and, in 2009, earned the title of "Danish Rock Album of the Year".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Sommer won "Danish Male Artist of the Year" and "Danish Songwriter of the Year" at the [[Danish Music Awards#Danish Music Awards 2009|2009 Danish Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} His album producer [[Henrik Balling]] won Producer of the Year for his work with Sommer.
