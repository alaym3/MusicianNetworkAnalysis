==History==
Born in 1989 in [[Long Island]], Rose grew up in [[Center Moriches, New York]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Caroline Rose Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/caroline-rose-mn0002626689/biography|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BFP>{{cite web|last=Hallenbeck|first=Brent|title=Caroline Rose ready to blossom|url=https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/entertainment/2014/09/10/caroline-rose-ready-blossom/15314571/|work=Burlington Free Press|date=September 11, 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref> The daughter of two artists, Rose began writing songs and poems at age 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valslist.com/pages/show/caroline-rose-interview|title=Val's Chat with artist Caroline Rose - valslist|website=valslist.com|access-date=2018-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705180053/http://valslist.com/pages/show/caroline-rose-interview|archive-date=2018-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rose attended [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, where she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in architecture.<ref name=Addison>{{cite web|url=http://www.addisonindependent.com/201304jer-coons-launching-debut-album-musical-partner|title=Jer Coons launching debut album with musical partner|last=Chiang-Waren|first=Xian|work=Addison County Independent|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713231757/http://www.addisonindependent.com/201304jer-coons-launching-debut-album-musical-partner|archive-date=July 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://issuu.com/wellesley/docs/commencement2011|title=One Hundred and Thirty-Third Annual Commencement, Friday, May 27, 2011|page=8|publisher=Wellesley College|year=2011}}</ref>

In 2012, a 22-year-old Caroline Rose and producer/multi-instrumentalist Jer Coons launched a Kickstarter to fund the production of Rose's first album, ''America Religious''. The campaign exceeded its goal of $8000, eventually raising $10,115.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carolinerosemusic/caroline-rose-and-jer-coons-make-a-record|title=Caroline Rose and Jer Coons Make A Record!|website=Kickstarter}}</ref> The album, blending [[American folk music]], [[country music|country]], and [[rockabilly]] styles was self-published later that year. Two years later, Rose released her first nationally distributed album, ''I Will Not Be Afraid'' on Little Hi! Records. Like the first album, it was produced with Jer Coons and featured music in a variety of Americana musical styles, including two songs previously released on ''America Religious''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ktswblog.net/2014/09/19/review-caroline-rose-i-will-not-be-afraid/|title=Review: Caroline Rose — 'I Will Not Be Afraid'|date=19 September 2014|website=ktswblog.net}}</ref>

Following the release of ''I Will Not Be Afraid'', Rose took an extended hiatus from touring and releasing new material, while she explored new musical directions that would broaden her sound. After three years, numerous personnel changes, and a switch to [[New West Records]], Rose released her third album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/wjz5yq/caroline-rose-would-like-you-to-think-about-how-dumb-money-is|title=Caroline Rose Would Like You to Think About How Dumb Money Is|date=6 December 2017|website=vice.com}}</ref> The new album, ''Loner'', was co-produced by Rose and [[The Bees (band)|Paul Butler]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/20997122/meet-the-many-sides-of-caroline-rose-on-loner|title=Meet the Many Sides of Caroline Rose on Loner|website=nashvillescene.com}}</ref> and represented a radical shift away from the musical style of her previous work, blending [[pop music|pop]] and [[alternative rock]] elements, and incorporating prominent [[synthesizer]]s throughout. Notably, this album also saw a change in lyrical tone, incorporating a number of overtly humorous, sarcastic, and satirical songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-caroline-rose-talks-tour-change-inspiration-from-radiohead-s-128827|title=Interview: Caroline Rose talks tour, change, inspiration from Radiohead's 'garbage album'|website=axs.com}}</ref> Although Rose played most of the instruments on the album, she formed a new band to perform on tour.

On January 7, 2020, Rose announced a new album called ''Superstar'', releasing a single and a music video for the song "Feel The Way I Want".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Caroline |title=Caroline Rose - "Feel The Way I Want" [Clip] |url=https://www.facebook.com/carolinerosemusic/videos/2183108278664213/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBqV1CAR0cMUOyZt6On9nxMwSGFUuAlkJ2slV1gOo1bdvm_1guMZhMv26XBn9sRqm1r00Rajp2wbwm13CyhuEU529RICho5CtWri7P77xDLYPdwoot0S59bcyGUZalnnsMAuEqOi2aMV57NThPzhfFJgjfq0gjuwlXI7DWQOXyWfNAFqwsihSNaEsdI80l07Ohjsp_H0whw2zEyEbXc-1NnYRdRUJi9JMsbPAsL-1zQgSXtfuUGO9ndD3gEpnAUAgmckz02QWCasvRcCZS_-yit6axX_QQeUPEnRw46wDVrTb9m6RrcjU1YXJ596YyvApj5OYL6309iMY-OG41N1XfyTQECc-vJab9VbyDxegAvksY&__tn__=-R |website=Facebook |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref> The single was accompanied by a video, shot entirely on the iPhone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2020/01/caroline-rose-new-album.html|title=Caroline Rose Announces New Album Superstar, Shares First Single|website=pastemagazine.com|date=6 January 2020}}</ref> According to Rose, the album is a "cinematic pop album that tells a story of someone who leaves behind everything they (gen neutral) know and love in search for something bigger and more glamorous. It’s a story about losing yourself but also finding the brazen self-confidence to follow a dream."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Caroline |title=carolinerosemuzak |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B7EK_2kBZsp/ |website=Instagram |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref>  The album ''Superstar'' was released on March 6, 2020,<ref>{{cite web |last1= Magazine |first1=Glide |title=Caroline Rose Announces New Album 'Superstar' Out 3/6 & North American Tour |url=https://glidemagazine.com/237994/caroline-rose-announces-new-album-superstar-out-3-6-north-american-tour// |website=Glide Magazine |accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/superstar-mw0003347739|title=Superstar - Caroline Rose &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-03-07}}</ref> Caroline Rose made her television debut on February 24, 2020 performing "Feel The Way I Want" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/caroline-rose-shines-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/press-release/|title=Caroline Rose Shines on Late Night with Seth Meyers|date=2020-02-25|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>
