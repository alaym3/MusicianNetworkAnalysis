'''Barenaked Ladies''' is a<!--awards and nominations don't belong here--> Canadian [[rock band]] formed in 1988 in [[Scarborough, Ontario]]. The band developed a cult following in Canada, with their [[Barenaked Ladies (EP)|self-titled 1991 cassette]] becoming the first independent release to be certified gold in Canada. They reached mainstream success in Canada when their debut with Reprise Records, ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]'', featuring the singles "[[If I Had $1000000]]" and "[[Brian Wilson (song)|Brian Wilson]]", was released in 1992. The band's popularity subsequently spread into the US, beginning with versions of "Brian Wilson" and "[[The Old Apartment]]" off their 1996 live album ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', followed by their fourth studio album ''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]'', their breakout success in 1998. The album featured their highest-charting hit, "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]", as well as "[[It's All Been Done]]".<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite book |author=Powell, Bettsy |title=There's no place like home |work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58 |date=16 January 1999 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=and 58 |issn=0006-2510 |access-date=December 19, 2016 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424014435/https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'', featuring the lead single "[[Pinch Me]]", also charted highly. In the 2010s the band became well-known for creating the theme song for the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.

Initially a duo of [[Ed Robertson]] and [[Steven Page]],<ref name="MMMBio">{{cite video |people=Bill Welychka (executive producer) |title=MuchMoreMusic Bio |medium=TV-series |publisher=[[MuchMoreMusic]] |location=Toronto, Ontario |date=2003}}</ref> the band quickly grew to a quintet adding brothers [[Jim Creeggan|Jim]] and [[Andy Creeggan]] and [[Tyler Stewart]] by 1990. Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995 and was replaced by [[Kevin Hearn]]. Page left in 2009, reducing the group to a quartet.

The band's style has evolved throughout their career, and their music, which began as exclusively acoustic, quickly grew to encompass a mixture of pop, rock, hip hop, rap, etc.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The band's live performances feature comedic banter and free-style rapping between songs.<ref name="Behind the Music">{{cite video |people=Moll, George (executive producer) |title=[[Behind the Music]] |medium=TV-series |publisher=[[VH1]] |location=New York, NY |date=2000}}</ref> They have won multiple [[Juno Award]]s and have been nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barenaked-ladies|title=Barenaked Ladies|date=November 19, 2019|website=Grammy.com|access-date=November 29, 2019|archive-date=October 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007213857/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barenaked-ladies/15786|url-status=live}}</ref> The group has sold over 15 million albums and singles and were inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in March 2018.

==History==
===Indie origins (1988–1991)===
Barenaked Ladies began as the duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page.<ref name="MMMBio"/> The two went to school together since Robertson was in grade four (Page was a grade ahead)<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus">{{cite video | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] | title = The Barenaked Truth (bonus interviews) | medium = DVD | publisher = Take 3 Productions/Casablanca Media Television | date = 2004 }}</ref> at [[Churchill Heights Public School]] but were not friends until they met each other at a [[Harvey's (restaurant chain)|Harvey's]] restaurant after a [[Peter Gabriel]] concert.<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus"/> Each was pleased to find that the other liked Gabriel; they began talking and found they had many of the same tastes. The two became friends and bonded further when they were both counsellors at Scarborough Music Camp located in [[McKellar, Ontario]]. Steve was impressed by Ed's ability to harmonize when they began playing songs together.<ref name="Barenaked Truth">{{cite video | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] | title = The Barenaked Truth | medium = Television documentary/DVD | publisher = Take 3 Productions/Casablanca Media Television | date = 2004 }}
</ref>

Page had an extra ticket to a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at [[Exhibition Stadium]] and asked Robertson to join him.<ref name="Talk to the Hand">{{cite video | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] | title = [[Talk to the Hand]] ("behind the scenes" feature) | medium = DVD | publisher = Morningstar Entertainment/Desperation Records | date = 2007 }}</ref> Bored, they amused each other by pretending they were rock critics and inventing histories about the Dylan band. They also invented fictional band names, one of which was "Barenaked Ladies."<ref name="Talk to the Hand"/><ref name="Distinguished Artists">{{cite video | people = [[Ed Robertson|Robertson, Ed]] & Frohman, Lorne (Interviewer/Host) | title = Distinguished Artists | medium = TV-series | publisher = Humber College School of Media Studies | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada | date = 2005 }}</ref>

[[File:EdRob1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Co-founder Ed Robertson in 2005]]
On another front, Robertson had agreed to perform with his cover band in a [[battle of the bands]] at [[Nathan Phillips Square]] for the [[Second Harvest]] [[food bank]], but the band broke up. A week before the show, Robertson received a phone call to confirm the gig, so he improvised the band had changed its name to "Barenaked Ladies." He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all.<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/><ref name="Talk to the Hand"/><ref name="Distinguished Artists"/> Instead of competing at the show on 1 October 1988,<ref name="Star89">{{cite news | title=We finally get date with Barenaked Ladies | last = Potter | first = Mitch | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date= November 24, 1989}} "But they finally managed a first-ever rehearsal the morning of Oct. 1, 1988, about ''five hours'' before making a stage debut at a Nathan Phillips Square benefit concert."</ref> while the other bands set up they played every song they both knew. The show went well, and they were invited to open for another established local band, [[The Razorbacks]], at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] the coming weekend. Missing three more scheduled rehearsals, they improvised their set once again. These acts set a precedent for Barenaked Ladies concerts, which still almost always contain improvised raps, songs, and banter.<ref name="Behind the Music"/><ref name="Talk to the Hand"/><ref name="Distinguished Artists"/>

[[File:StevenPageMassey.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Co-founder Steven Page in 2005]]
Page and Robertson continued performing and began writing songs together. The band's first tape, ''[[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Buck Naked|Buck Naked]]'' (1989), was made using a four-track recorder<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/> in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]], to whom they give credit for exposing them to the idea of comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour.<ref name="Distinguished Artists"/> One night in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited friends from music camp, brothers [[Andy Creeggan]] (percussion) and [[Jim Creeggan]] (bass),<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus"/> to play with them at a Christmastime club show. Featuring the two new band members, [[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Barenaked Lunch|''Barenaked Lunch'' (a.k.a. ''The Pink Tape'')]] was released in 1990 despite being mastered incorrectly and playing too fast.<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus"/>

[[File:JimCreeggan1.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Jim Creeggan in 2008]]
After six months, Andy Creeggan went on a student exchange trip to South America, leaving the band without a percussionist. While playing at a [[busking|buskers]]' festival in [[Waterloo, Ontario]] in the summer of 1990, they met drummer [[Tyler Stewart]], and he took over the position.<ref name="Behind the Music"/> During Andy Creeggan's travels, the band gained attention winning the 1990 [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]] Achievement Awards.<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/> and by squeezing into a small "[[Speakers' Corner (television series)|Speaker's Corner]]" video booth in Toronto to perform "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]".<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/> The popular clip noticeably increased the band's fanbase. Andy Creeggan returned in early 1991 to find that Stewart had taken over the role of percussionist. Causing him some concern, Creeggan began playing keyboards more, though he still performed on some songs with [[congas]] and other percussion. The band would soon embark upon their first full Canadian tour.<ref name="Behind the Music"/>

===Early Canadian success (1991–1992)===
The full band's first commercial release was 1991's ''[[The Yellow Tape]]''. A demo tape originally created for the band's performance at [[South by Southwest]], it was the first recording to feature all five members<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus"/> and cost them $2,000–$3,000. They sent copies to all the labels in Canada; all of them refused.<ref name="Distinguished Artists"/> As they began selling more and more copies off the stage, through word of mouth people began asking for the tape in local stores. When retailers began asking the band for more tapes, the demo became a commercial release.<ref name="Distinguished Artists"/> Sales began to snowball based merely on word of mouth and their live shows.<ref name="Behind the Music"/> Page's father, Victor, created the independent label Page Publications to handle the cassette's manufacturing and distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Paul|title=Barenaked Ladies: Public Stunts, Private Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTRuJKlUoHcC&pg=PP1|date=October 2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-3835-9}}</ref> (After the band signed to a major label, Page Publications remained in operation, later releasing albums by artists such as [[The Lowest of the Low]], [[Leslie Spit Treeo]], [[Annette Ducharme]], [[David Gogo]], and [[Bodega (Canadian band)|Bodega]].)

During this era, the band garnered radio airplay with a live cover of [[Dean Friedman]]'s "I'm in Love With a McDonald's Girl", which included a rap break incorporating lyrics from [[Beastie Boys]]' "[[Hey Ladies]]".<ref>"Goofiness is its own reward for boys from the 'burbs". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 10, 1991.</ref> Another major break for the band came in November 1991 when Barenaked Ladies contributed a cover of [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s "[[Lovers in a Dangerous Time]]" to the Cockburn tribute album ''[[Kick at the Darkness]]''. The song became the band's first Top 40 hit in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id%3Db5392b2e-b0c7-4143-a013-4645a0600fc6%26k%3D24078 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-11-17 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206013841/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=b5392b2e-b0c7-4143-a013-4645a0600fc6&k=24078 |archive-date=December 6, 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:TylerStewart2.jpg|thumb|right|Tyler Stewart in 2005]]
Sales of ''The Yellow Tape'' were jump-started when the band was removed from the lineup of the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in [[Nathan Phillips Square]] outside [[Toronto City Hall]] because a staffer for then-mayor [[June Rowlands]] believed the band's name objectified women;<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-mayor-says-sorry-to-miss-universe-1.550549 | title=Toronto mayor says 'sorry' to Miss Universe | publisher=CBC News | date=July 20, 2005 | access-date=August 12, 2014 | archive-date=August 16, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816012719/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-mayor-says-sorry-to-miss-universe-1.550549 | url-status=live }}</ref> the decision was affirmed by city councillor [[Chris Korwin-Kuczynski]].<ref name=newrules>"Barenaked Ladies ban prompts new city rules". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 25, 1992.</ref> The group shrugged it off and booked another show at [[McMaster University]].<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus"/> However, the media picked up the story and presented it as an example of [[political correctness]] gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision as the story became increasingly prominent. A week after New Year's, the band was asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for the front page of the ''[[Toronto Star]]''. The newer stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved with removing the band from the concert and was out of town when the decision was made. The following week, sales of the ''Yellow Tape'' exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'', [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[We Can't Dance]]'', and [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' in some downtown Toronto record stores.<ref>"Ladies don't have record deal yet". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 7, 1992.</ref> They received enough publicity from the incident that [[MuchMusic]] offered them its second-ever ''[[Intimate and Interactive]]'' special on 17 January.<ref>"Looking for a hit". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 1, 1992.</ref> The tape eventually became the first-ever [[indie rock|indie]] release to achieve [[platinum record|platinum]] status (100,000 copies) in Canada.<ref name="Behind the Music"/>

By the end of February, [[Toronto City Council]] revised its rules for event bookings at Nathan Phillips Square in the hopes of avoiding another similar controversy.<ref name=newrules /> The City Hall story has followed the band ever since; Robertson credits the scale of the story to it being a slow news week.<ref name="Behind the Music"/><ref name="Barenaked Truth"/><ref name="Distinguished Artists"/>

===First albums (1992–1997)===
[[File:Andrew creeggan.jpg|thumb|upright|Andy Creeggan performing with The Brothers Creeggan in London, Ontario, Canada, in 2002]]
The band was signed to [[Sire Records]] in April 1992<ref>"Barenaked Ladies sign U.S. deal". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', April 30, 1992.</ref> after a long period of being rejected by every label they approached.

The band's first full album, ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]'', was released in July 1992 and was a big success in Canada;<ref name="MMMBio"/> by the end of August, it had already been certified [[platinum record|platinum]].<ref>"The Ladies and Gordon". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 27, 1992.</ref> It included some of the band's most well-known songs, including "[[Enid (Barenaked Ladies song)|Enid]]", the first single; "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]", the single which helped fund the album; "[[If I Had $1000000]]", which spawned a tradition of throwing [[Kraft Dinner]] during live shows, which the band later discouraged;<ref name="Talk to the Hand"/><ref name="Distinguished Artists"/> and "[[Brian Wilson (song)|Brian Wilson]]", named after [[Beach Boys|Beach Boy]] [[Brian Wilson]] (who later covered the song on [[Live at the Roxy Theatre|a live album]]). ''Gordon'' benefited from a number of its songs (including the latter three) being live favourites and had been recorded for past releases like ''The Yellow Tape''. Although the band was doing remarkably well in Canada, they found it translated into little success in the US.<ref name="Behind the Music"/>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JimCreeggan2008.png|thumb|Left|Jim Creeggan in 2008]] -->

The band's second album, ''[[Maybe You Should Drive]]'' (1994),<ref name="MMMBio"/> was much less popular with the Canadian public.<ref name="Behind the Music"/> Their tour of the US was deemed a failure and lost money despite an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Before the next release, Andy Creeggan decided to leave the band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/> and was not comfortable with their new fame.<ref name="MMMBio"/> According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the ''Drive'' album; the rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album and for the subsequent touring. Also, Creeggan wanted to attend [[McGill University]] to study music further.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/13/kaleidoscope|title=Kaleidoscope|website=Mcgill.ca|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=April 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418163316/http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/13/kaleidoscope/|url-status=live}}</ref> Tyler Stewart has also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as a percussionist.<ref name="Behind the Music"/> Andy Creeggan's departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of one other, with Page and Robertson rarely communicating. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with alcohol abuse and depression.<ref name="Behind the Music"/><ref name="Barenaked Truth"/> In an attempt to correct the band's downward slide, they signed with [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]] and [[Nettwerk]] as their management.<ref name="Barenaked Truth"/>

The band released ''[[Born on a Pirate Ship]]'' as a quartet in 1996.<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies"/> The album received two large boosts from the inclusion of the song "[[Shoe Box]]" on the ''[[Friends]]'' soundtrack<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies"/> and from the [[Jason Priestley]]-directed video for "[[The Old Apartment]]", which got notable U.S. airplay<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies"/> and while the album had stronger sales than ''Maybe You Should Drive'', it still did not match the success of "Gordon".<ref name="MMMBio"/> The group appeared as the guest band on an episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ("Spring Breakdown" original airdate: 2 April 1997), immediately preceding their 1997 tour; they performed "The Old Apartment", "Life, In A Nutshell", and "Brian Wilson" at the Peach Pit After Dark night club. Tyler Stewart invited his friend [[Kevin Hearn]] to replace Andy Creeggan as a keyboardist for the tour, ultimately joining the band full-time. The group also had a cameo in the Canadian film ''[[The Wrong Guy]]'' with Dave Foley in 1997. They performed the song "Gangster Girl" as police officers in an alley on their break.<ref name="Behind the Music"/><ref name="Barenaked Truth"/>

From two dates on the ''Born on a Pirate Ship'' tour during 1996, Barenaked Ladies recorded and released a live album called ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', which had a modest American radio hit with "Brian Wilson". The album became the band's first gold record in the US, and the success of "Brian Wilson" and "The Old Apartment" led to a new situation for the band. They knew their next album would be their chance to make it big in the States.<ref name="Behind the Music"/><ref name="Barenaked Truth"/>

===Breakthrough success in the US (1998–2004)===
''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]'' (1998) became their greatest mainstream success, buoyed by the single "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]", which spent—coincidentally—one week at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''Stunt'' reached No. 3 in the US [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]] and No. 9 in Canada. Kevin Hearn was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] shortly after the album was released, eventually receiving bone marrow transplants from his brother and missing most of the ''Stunt'' tour.

[[File:KevinHearn2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Kevin Hearn in 2005]]
The band toured, with friends [[Chris Brown (Canadian singer)|Chris Brown]] and [[Greg Kurstin]] both filling in on keyboards until Hearn recovered enough to rejoin them on tour. The singles "[[It's All Been Done]]" (used as the opening theme song on the short-lived animated television series ''[[Baby Blues]]'') and "[[Call and Answer]]" (which later appeared in the film ''[[EdTV]]'') were also modest hits. The band was asked to contribute a song ("[[Get in Line]]") to the soundtrack of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] cartoon ''[[King of the Hill]].''<ref name="Barelaked Nadies">{{cite video | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] [[Andy Creeggan]] | title = [[Barelaked Nadies]] (DVD Commentary) | medium = DVD | publisher = Warner Bros. Records | date = 2002 }}</ref> Barenaked Ladies also had a guest appearance in a 1999 episode of ''[[Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place]]''.

Led by the "Pinch Me" single, in the US ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'' (2000)<ref name="MMMBio"/> did not perform as well as ''Stunt'' had, reaching only No. 5 on the Billboard Top 100, however, it topped the Canadian charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003394/Barenaked-Ladies.html|title=Barenaked Ladies Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=April 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418083157/http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003394/Barenaked-Ladies.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2001, they released a compilation album entitled ''[[Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991–2001)]]'',<ref name="MMMBio"/> referencing a line from "Box Set". It contained 15 singles from previous albums, two singles from other compilations, and two new tracks (dubbed "our new greatest hits" by Robertson during the subsequent tour).

After finishing a tour on 31 December 2001 in [[Rosemont, Illinois]] to promote the compilation, the band decided to take a year off, occasionally playing shows such as the Medals Plaza at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City before returning to the studio in April 2003.

''[[Everything to Everyone]]'' was released on 21 October 2003,<ref name="MMMBio"/> coincided by the first show of the unique [[Peepshow tour]]. The first single off the album was "[[Another Postcard]] (Chimps)", which received modest radio play. "[[Testing 1,2,3]]" was the second single from the album and received a video, but no CD single, while "[[Celebrity (Barenaked Ladies song)|Celebrity]]" was released later in the UK with a CD single, but no video. "Maybe Katie" (and an edited version of "For You" from a concert in [[Glasgow]]) were also released as singles to radio. The album was their weakest seller in years and had a short chart life. The release fulfilled their contract with [[Reprise Records]], and they did not re-sign. This made the group independent for the first time since 1992 (though they retained a distribution relationship with [[Warner Bros. Records]]). On the subsequent Everywhere For Everyone tour, in early 2004, the band began offering their full live shows for purchase as a download or CD-R via their website, as well as subsequent studio releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnlmusic.com/store |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-09 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213091104/http://www.bnlmusic.com/store/ |archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

The band recorded the theme song for the 2000 children's program ''[[Seven Little Monsters (TV series)|Seven Little Monsters]]''. They also appeared in "The Honeymoon's Over", the premiere of ''[[Charmed]]'''s third season, performing "[[Pinch Me]]" onstage at the fictional night club P3. In 2003 they recorded the theme song for ''[[Odd Job Jack]]''.

===Return to independence (2004–2008)===
[[File:Kevin Hearn with fellow Barenaked Ladies, Steven Page (left) and Ed Robertson (right).jpg|right|upright|thumb|125px|Steven Page, Kevin Hearn and Ed Robertson live in 2005]]
The band's next album was ''[[Barenaked for the Holidays]]'', released on 5 October 2004.

They broke from the studio in November and December to play a 22-show holiday tour, playing one of their new songs each night. An [[iTunes Originals]]&nbsp;– a collection of interviews and live songs (coupled with some old album tracks) was recorded while the band was in the studio. It was released in February 2006, when the band went back into the studio to finish up the recordings they started the previous fall. Initially unsure how to release so many songs, the band decided to release a single-disc album in early September entitled ''[[Barenaked Ladies Are Me]]''. Several alternate versions are available, including downloadable versions and a [[USB flash drive]] version. The B.L.A.M. tour in support of the album and its follow-up, ''[[Barenaked Ladies Are Men]]'', which hailed from the same sessions, ran in fall 2006 and briefly in June 2007 for the US, February 2007 for Canada, and later in 2007 for the UK. That same year the band wrote and recorded the theme song for the television series ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.

On 6 May 2008, the band released an album of original material aimed at children entitled ''[[Snacktime!]]''. The album features artwork by Hearn in its [[liner notes]], which is also available in the form of a hardcover book with CD included. The album was promoted with a series of television and in-store appearances at bookstores in the US northeast, the West Coast, and Toronto.

Robertson commented on the departure of one of the band's founding members:

{{quote|Our relationship with Steve Page was great and very fruitful. It lasted almost 20 years, but it was time to move on. Now we're doing something that feels really fresh and exciting to me.

On 25 March 2018, the band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] at the [[Juno Awards of 2018|Juno Awards]] in [[Vancouver]]. The band performed alongside former members Steven Page (who was included in the induction) and Andy Creeggan.

Starting 29 March 2020, the band began releasing a series of [[webcam]]-based performances that they have dubbed #SelfieCamJam on their [[YouTube]] channel in response to the need for isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Their 13th studio album, ''[[Detour de Force]]'', was released on 16 July 2021, aided by the singles "Flip", "Good Life" and "New Disaster".

In September 2021, Robertson revealed that Barenaked Ladies are working on a "secret project" with [[Rush (band)|Rush]] bassist [[Geddy Lee]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/barenaked-ladies-are-working-on-a-secret-project-with-geddy-lee|title=Barenaked Ladies are working on a "secret project" with Geddy Lee|last=Scarlett|first=Elizabeth|date=8 September 2021|publisher=[[Louder Sound]]|accessdate=8 September 2021}}</ref>

==Innovation and technology== <!-- This title is linked to. If you change the section title, please change the links-->
Barenaked Ladies has often attempted to use new technologies to promote themselves and their music. They were among the early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an "Interactive Press Kit" on a 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]] for ''Maybe You Should Drive'' in 1994, which earned them a [[MuchMusic Video Award]]. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs ("Be My Yoko Ono" and "Alternative Girlfriend") for inclusion on their greatest hits CD ''[[Disc One]]'' (though polling was nearly tied and both songs were included).

Beginning in April 2003, the band started a [[blog]] on its website to keep fans updated personally, coinciding with the band's return to the studio for ''Everything to Everyone''. During a subsequent studio session for ''Barenaked Ladies Are Me'', Ed Robertson began a [[podcast]] in addition to the blog, which ran from February to August 2006 (with a series of four videos added in early 2007 with highlights from the [[#Ships and Dip cruises|band's first cruise]]).

The band has adopted many of the current online social networking sites, including accounts on [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]]. The Twitter feed has been integrated into the band's website, and it also typically announces new blog posts with a link. These accounts have been used for contests and to debut new tracks. Different band members have also had individual accounts on these sites at times.

Barenaked Ladies has sold recordings of almost all of its live concerts since early 2004. Initially, shows were sold on [[CD-R]] or as [[MP3]] downloads. By the end of 2004, lossless [[FLAC]] files were also offered. Professionally printed copies of some concerts were later offered through some isolated record stores, and some shows have been added to the [[iTunes Music Store]]s and other digital retailers.

The band was praised for a unique use of [[USB flash drive]] technology. The group offered its 2004 ''Barenaked For the Holidays'' album on a customized flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks and photos and videos from the studio sessions for the album. The band used a 128 MB USB flash drive, limiting the bitrate of the music included. The group described the product as a test of the technology and the market for that technology. It subsequently released ''Are Me'' in the USB format as well (on a 256 MB flash drive). The band also incorporated the technology into its live music sales, offering fans a copy of concerts in MP3 format on a USB stick at the merchandise booth directly after the show.

In 2009 the band took part in an interactive documentary series, ''[[City Sonic]]''. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, includes Tyler Stewart reflecting on his memories of the (now closed) Ultrasound Showbar. The films were accompanied by an [[iPhone]] application, which uses [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology to unlock more videos when the user is close to the specific location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |title=citysonic.tv |website=Citysonic.tv |access-date=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104210212/http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In February 2013, Barenaked Ladies participated in what was billed as the "first space-to-earth musical collaboration"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAnfi8WpVE |title=Chris Hadfield and Barenaked Ladies: I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing) |publisher=CBC Music |access-date=2013-02-20 |archive-date=February 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220150310/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAnfi8WpVE |url-status=live }}</ref> involving the band and [[Chris Hadfield]], a Canadian astronaut and commander of the [[International Space Station]], along with the [[Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts|Wexford Gleeks]], a Canadian student choir. The group, Hadfield, and the choir performed a song "I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing)" that was commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Canadian Space Agency]].

==Ships and Dip cruises==
Following a lead from other artists, the band held a fan cruise called "Ships and Dip", from 15–19 January 2007. Other artists who joined included side projects [[The Brothers Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]] and [[The Vanity Project]], as well as friends of the band, [[Guster]], [[Jason Plumb]], [[The New Odds]], and others. The ship also featured comedy from band friends [[Seán Cullen]] and [[Harland Williams]].

The success of the cruise led to a second cruise, incongruously named "Ships and Dip III", held 27 January 27 – 1 February 2008. Many of the same artists were joined by newcomers such as [[Great Big Sea]], who were a headlining performer. The third annual cruise, "Ships and Dip V," sailed from 1-6 February 2009, again featuring some returning and some new artists, adding [[Sarah McLachlan]] as an opening act for each of the band's three main theatre shows. Other new performers included [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], [[Luke Doucet]], [[The Mountain Goats]], and [[The Weakerthans]]. Page left the band shortly after Ships and Dip V, so his performances onboard were his last known with the band.

The fourth Ships and Dip cruise (dubbed "Ships and Dip 4", breaking with the odd-numbered naming convention of the first three cruises) sailed from 6-11 February 2011 on the ''Norwegian Dawn'' from Miami. "Ships and Dip 4" was their first (and, thus far, only) cruise since the departure of Page.

The artists on the Ships and Dip cruises sailed on board with the rest of the passengers for the duration of the cruises; this contrasted some other music cruises at the time on which the artist or artists travelled separately to one of the cruise destinations and performed there, or joined the cruise for only a portion of the trip. Band members enjoyed other artists' shows and most of the ship's amenities freely with the other guests. Barenaked Ladies performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly sat in with other artists at their shows.

==Beyond music==
===Biography===
Barenaked Ladies have an authorized biography, which was released in 2001, titled ''[[Public Stunts Private Stories]]'', written by a friend of the band and fellow Scarborough native [[Paul Myers (musician)|Paul Myers]] with input from the band.<ref name="MMMBio"/> It is published in Canada by Madrigal Press. An updated version of the biography was released in 2003 in the US with a different cover, several corrections, and additional information about ''Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits'' and ''Everything to Everyone'', which were released after the initial printing.

===Canadian Music Creators Coalition===
In May 2006, Barenaked Ladies, along with other prominent Canadian musicians, formed the [[Canadian Music Creators Coalition]] in response to plans by the Canadian government to revisit and update copyright laws. Steven Page has acted as a conduit between the CMCC and the press, urging the government to focus on the Canadian cultural scene. Page has said the formation of the CMCC was in response to what he believes is the wrong direction taken by the [[RIAA]] and the major labels, by suing fans for filesharing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricsky.net/?p=145|title=Steven Page on the Canadian Music Creators Coalition - Electric Sky|website=Electricsky.net|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=February 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213042756/http://www.electricsky.net/?p=145|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Barenaked Planet===
The band has also become a proponent of environmentalism, following from Page's passion for greening (he is himself a board member of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Canada]]). The group began bringing an "[[eco-village]]" organized by the [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]] organization on their 2004 Au Naturale tour. The band has since partnered with Reverb to form the "Barenaked Planet" project, which is the group's label for their project to progressively "green" their touring. Efforts the band have made include ensuring backstage materials are recycled, using [[biodiesel]] in their tour vehicles (B20 as of December 2006), and [[carbon offset|offsetting carbon emissions]] with wind power. This includes both band-sponsored offsets for their own emissions, as well as having volunteers sell "Barenaked Planet" stickers to concertgoers with the money going to offset their drives to the venues.<ref name="GillDec28">{{cite video

===If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours ice cream===
In May 2009, Barenaked Ladies partnered with American ice cream company [[Ben & Jerry's]] to create the flavour If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours. Named after the song "[[If I Had $1000000]]", the confection consists of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cups, chocolate-coated toffee chunks, white chocolate chunks and chocolate-coated almonds. In the United States, this ice cream flavour is sold under the name Everything But The....

Barenaked Ladies is the first Canadian band to receive their own ice cream flavour, following in the footsteps of other band-themed Ben & Jerry's flavours such as Cherry Garcia ([[Jerry Garcia]]), One Sweet Whirled and Magic Brownies ([[Dave Matthews Band]]) and Phish Food ([[Phish]]). All royalties from the sale of If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours are donated to the ABC Canada Literacy Foundation, a Toronto-based organization that promotes reading to children at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html |title=newswire.ca |website=Newswire.ca |date=May 2, 2011 |access-date=2011-06-06| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609190558/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html| archive-date= June 9, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Bianca |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |title=chartattack.com |website=Chartattack.com |date=May 12, 2009 |access-date=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826153041/http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |archive-date=August 26, 2010 }}</ref>

Barenaked Ladies have supported hunger relief organization Rock Can Rol and together with their fans have helped to feed people in need.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jethrotull.proboards.com/thread/1331/musicians-rock-roll-hungry|title=Musicians rock CAN roll For the Hungry {{!}} The Jethro Tull Forum|website=jethrotull.proboards.com|access-date=2020-02-20|archive-date=February 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220094942/https://jethrotull.proboards.com/thread/1331/musicians-rock-roll-hungry|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Side projects==
Tyler Stewart, Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, and Ed Robertson all have past or present side projects during their time off from Barenaked Ladies. Stewart was part of a short-lived trio called Don't Talk Dance, which released a self-titled album in 1995 featuring [[Chris Brown (Canadian singer)|Chris Brown]] (who later sat in for Hearn with Barenaked Ladies during his late-90s cancer treatment). The album was made for charity, and all profits went to Casey House, an AIDS charity in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnlweb.tripod.com/tyler.htm|title=Tyler Stewart|website=Bnlweb.tripod.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615111738/http://bnlweb.tripod.com/tyler.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Stewart also plays occasionally with the rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo which he first joined in high school. The band reunited in the early 2010s and has since played occasional concerts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca/post/46261040504/ovc-surgeons-passion-for-cycling-music-making-a|title=OVC surgeon's passion for cycling, music making a difference for kids with cancer|website=Bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074711/http://bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca/post/46261040504/ovc-surgeons-passion-for-cycling-music-making-a|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jim Creeggan formed the alternative/jazz group [[The Brothers Creeggan]], with brother and former Barenaked Ladies member Andy Creeggan, later joined by Ian McLauchlan (who died in 2009).<ref name="BrosCreeg">{{cite web|url=http://www.brotherscreeggan.com|title=Brothers Creeggan|website=Brotherscreeggan.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418082919/http://www.brotherscreeggan.com/|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group (variously as a duo and a trio) recorded four albums between 1995 and 2002. The group stopped performing regularly in the mid-2000s and have only played together on rare occasions, such as for the Barenaked Ladies' cruises. Andy Creeggan also has several solo albums, with the most recent one released in 2010.<ref name="BrosCreeg"/>

Since 1995, Kevin Hearn has released four albums as the frontman of [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]] and three others with solo billing (with members of Thin Buckle as well as other musicians backing him). Hearn's albums feature a mix of alternative rock and jazz with many other eclectic influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinhearn.com|title=Kevin Hearn|website=Kevinhearn.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=December 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213180153/http://www.kevinhearn.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> Hearn continues to perform in the Toronto area and occasionally tours with Thin Buckle. Hearn was also the musical director and keyboardist for [[Lou Reed]]'s band from the mid-2000s until Reed's passing in October 2013. He has also released an album of love songs as "The Cousins" in 2004 with his cousin, comedian [[Harland Williams]].

Robertson joined a supergroup called [[Yukon Kornelius]] in 2008 with [[Dave Matthews Band]] bass player [[Stefan Lessard]], singer/guitarist [[Adam Gardner]] of [[Guster]], and drummer Eric Fawcett of [[Spymob]]. To date, the band has played four shows, but they anticipate doing a short tour when work with their other bands permit. Special guests usually join Yukon Kornelius during their shows, including [[Dee Snider]] of [[Twisted Sister]], [[Carl Bell (musician)|Carl Bell]] (formerly of [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]), Tyler Stewart, and other members of the Dave Matthews Band. Robertson also hosted three seasons of the 2006 television program called ''Ed's Up'' for OLN Canada in which he flew his own plane to various locations to experience and publicize a variety of interesting occupations.

Former member Steven Page had a side project called [[The Vanity Project]]. The first self-titled album was written mostly with long-time collaborator [[Stephen Duffy]]. In the wake of a band decision to try to keep songwriting amongst its then-five members, Page said that the project was an opportunity for him to write with non-Barenaked Ladies writers. He indicated that a future release might include other writers and not necessarily Duffy. However, Page did not record a second Vanity Project album before his departure from Barenaked Ladies and has released his post-Barenaked Ladies works in his own name. Page has also hosted a season of the reality television series ''[[The Illegal Eater]]'', which features Page travelling to showcase food and drink experiences that are in some way taboo, illicit, or outright illegal.

Also, band members (both individually and together) have often collaborated with other artists, such as making guest appearances on their albums, performing live, or co-writing songs with them.

In February 2019 all four band members joined Canadian rock musician [[Kim Mitchell]] in recording a rework of Mitchell's former band [[Max Webster]] song [[Diamonds Diamonds]] from their 1977 album ''High Class in Borrowed Shoes''. A video of the collaboration was released on [[YouTube]].

==Reception==
In December 2008 former member of [[The Beatles]] [[Paul McCartney]] was reportedly asked by a session musician which bands he enjoys in the current music scene. The response was the Barenaked Ladies: "Their harmonies are right on. They could outsing us any day of the week. I don't think [[John Lennon|John]] and myself ever had the sort of range they do." McCartney added that he would not mind recording with the band in the future.<ref name="http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four/">{{cite web |url=http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |title=IUC Exclusive: Paul McCartney says Barenaked Ladies sing Much better than Fab Four; Would Consider Joining Them |website=Ianundercover.com |access-date=2009-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525162258/http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2018, notable Ontarian musical historians Liam Coholan, Patrick Murphy, and Jon "The Don" Dilario acknowledge in their latest Canadian music history issue that "BNL was one of the most impactful bands when it comes to discussing the development of Canadian society in the 21st century."<ref>{{cite document|title=Canadian Music History Issue #412|id={{ProQuest|1772089760}}}}</ref>
