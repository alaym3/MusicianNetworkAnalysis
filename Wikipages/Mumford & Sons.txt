'''Mumford & Sons''' are a British [[folk rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/10/29/londoncalling_mumford_and_sons_feature.shtml|title=Mumford and Sons|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The band consists of [[Marcus Mumford]] (lead vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), [[Ben Lovett (British musician)|Ben Lovett]] (vocals, keyboards, piano), and [[Ted Dwane]] (vocals, bass guitar, [[double bass]]). Banjo player [[Winston Marshall]] left the band in 2021.

Mumford & Sons have released four studio albums: ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'' (2009), ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'' (2012), ''[[Wilder Mind]]'' (2015), and ''[[Delta (Mumford & Sons album)|Delta]]'' (2018). Their debut ''Sigh No More'' peaked at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, with ''Babel'' and ''Wilder Mind'' both debuting at number one in the UK and US, the former becoming the fastest-selling rock album of the decade<ref name=BabelUK/><ref name=BabelUS/> and leading to a headline performance at the [[Glastonbury Festival in 2013]]. The band has also issued three live albums: ''Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire'' (2011), ''The Road to Red Rocks'' (2012) and ''Live from South Africa: Dust and Thunder'' (2017).

The band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, with ''Sigh No More'' earning the band the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[2011 BRIT Awards|Best British Album]] in 2011, a [[Mercury Prize]] nomination and six overall [[Grammy Award]] nominations. The live performance at the 2011 Grammy ceremony with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Avett Brothers]] led to a surge in popularity for the band in the US. The band received eight total Grammy nominations for ''Babel'' and won the Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. The band also won the Brit Award for [[2013 BRIT Awards|Best British Group]] in 2013 and an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for International Achievement in 2014.

==History==
===Early years (2007–2009)===
Mumford & Sons was formed in late 2007 <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mumford-and-Sons|title=Mumford & Sons &#124; British music group|website=Britannica.com}}</ref> by multi-instrumentalists [[Marcus Mumford]], [[Ben Lovett (British musician)|Ben Lovett]], [[Winston Marshall]] and [[Ted Dwane]]. Band members play acoustic guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as [[banjo]], [[mandolin]] and [[resonator guitar]].<ref>{{Cite document|id = {{ProQuest|1686669917}}}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/10/29/londoncalling_mumford_and_sons_feature.shtml|title=London – Radio – Mumford and Sons|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> The band name originates from Marcus Mumford being the most visible member, organizing the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to evoke the sense of an "antiquated family business name".<ref name=Collis>Collis, Clark (4 March 2011). [http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/03/04/mumford-and-sons-sigh-no-more/ "Mumford and Sons: Ben Lovett talks about playing with Dylan, recording with Ray Davies, and high-fiving R. Kelly"]. ''Entertainment Weekly Music Mix''. Retrieved 6 January 2011.</ref>

A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in [[West London (sub region)|West London]] around the same time, giving rise to the label "West London folk scene". Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggeration—Mumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in the same general area at the time. In an interview with the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', Marcus Mumford said, "It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive." Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as [[Noah and the Whale]], [[Johnny Flynn (musician)|Johnny Flynn]] and [[Laura Marling]], whose backing band had included Marshall, Mumford, and Dwane.<ref>Walker, Tim (28 July 2008).

In early 2008, the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents [[Keane (band)|Keane]] and Laura Marling.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Bloom.html |title=Interview With Louis Bloom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=4 April 2011 |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704123311/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Bloom.html |archive-date=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons was exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told [[HitQuarters]] that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: "There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

In February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from [[Alessi's Ark]], [[Sons of Noel and Adrian]], [[Peggy Sue (band)|Peggy Sue]] and others. June 2008 marked the band's first appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="bbc"/> They also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude towards Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere.<ref name=Betts>Betts, Marianne (25 March 2010).

===''Sigh No More'' (2009–2012)===
Throughout 2008 and into 2009, Mumford & Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US, exposing audiences to ''Love Your Ground'' tracks and other material that would eventually become ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]''. The band finally recorded ''Sigh No More'' with [[Markus Dravs]], who had produced albums with artists such as [[Arcade Fire]].<ref name=Betts/> At the time, band members did not even own their own instruments—Dravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mumfordandsons/46631|title=Mumford And Sons: 'We were banished from studio by producer'|date=12 August 2009|work=NME.COM|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> The only track from ''Love Your Ground'' to be included on ''Sigh No More'' was "[[Little Lion Man]]".

==Musical style and development==
[[File:Mumford drums.jpg|thumb|right|The band members play multiple instruments in live performances. Here Marcus Mumford sits at a drum kit.]]
Mumford & Sons have been described by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' as a [[folk rock]] band.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www3.forbes.com/business/the-worlds-highest-paid-musicians-of-2016/4/ |title=The World's Highest-Paid Musicians Of 2016 |author=Greenburg, Zack O'Malley |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=December 2016 |access-date=14 December 2016|author-link=Zack O'Malley Greenburg }}</ref> They began by using [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[Folk music|folk]] instrumentation, with the core instruments of acoustic guitar, banjo, piano and a double bass, played with a rhythmic style based in [[alternative rock]] and folk. In the documentary ''Big Easy Express'', Marcus Mumford recognises the [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] influence: "I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I'd listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadn't really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow was the band that made me fall in love with country music."<ref name=Hight>{{cite news|last=Hight|first=Jewly|title=Old Crow Medicine Show: The Wheel Of Life|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/08/old-crow-medicine-show-the-wheel-of-life/|access-date=5 September 2012|newspaper=American Songwriter|date=30 August 2012}}</ref> Mumford acknowledges that "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London."

Much of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, their debut album name deriving from a line in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. The track "Sigh No More" includes lines from the play such as ''Serve God love me and mend'', ''For man is a giddy thing'', and ''One foot in sea and one on shore.'' The title of the song "Roll Away Your Stone" is an allusion to ''[[Macbeth]]''; the song includes the line ''Stars hide your fires/ And these here are my desires'' which borrows and pares down Macbeth's line in act 1, scene 4: ''Stars, hide your fires,/ Let not light see my black and deep desires.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T14.html|title=MACBETH, Act 1 Scene 4|publisher=Shakespeare-navigators.com|access-date=24 September 2012}}</ref> Additionally, "The Cave" includes several references to ''[[The Odyssey]]'', in particular the sirens that Odysseus encounters on his journey home. The song also contains many references to [[G.K. Chesterton]]'s book, ''St. Francis of Assisi'', in which Chesterton uses [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato's Cave]] as a way of explaining how [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] views the world from God's perspective. "Little Lion Man" appears to be a retelling in dramatic monologue form of Chretien de Troyes' ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', which is the story of a knight who goes mad after betraying a promise to his wife to return to her. Both "Timshel" and "Dust Bowl Dance" draw heavily from the [[John Steinbeck]] novels ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''.

The band's change in sound on their third album was described by Lovett as a "natural departure." At the end of the ''Babel'' tour Winston Marshall traded his banjo for electric guitar in sound checks and Mumford started playing more drums as the band jammed on heavy instrumentals and even some Radiohead tunes. Banjo does not feature on the record, an instrument that had become synonymous with the band. [[NME]]<ref name="nme.com"/> reported that the band's sound is "More expansive than ever and decidedly heavier, thanks to the shift in instrumentation." The group also employed a full drumkit instead of kick drum. "We've had our standard line-up of instruments for the last six years and we felt like that was our palette, [but] we started picking up other stuff," said Lovett. "It's a very natural departure from some of that rootsier stuff."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Doyle |first=Patrick |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mumford-sons-talk-going-electric-on-new-album-wilder-mind-20150302?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305064359/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mumford-sons-talk-going-electric-on-new-album-wilder-mind-20150302?page=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 March 2015 |title=Page 2 of Mumford & Sons Talk Going Electric on New Album 'Wilder Mind' |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2 March 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

Lovett told [[NME]] that working with [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] for ''Wilder Mind'' was part of trying something new. "We felt a need for change. Not from Markus [Dravs], but he was so closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It felt like, if we do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as we collectively felt like it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up [with Dravs], we're just playing the field!"<ref name="nme.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mumford-and-sons/83246 |title=NME News Mumford & Sons say going electric on new album is 'a natural departure' |publisher=Nme.Com |date=3 March 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>
