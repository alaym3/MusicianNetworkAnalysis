In an interview with [[Beats Per Minute (website)|Beats Per Minute]] in August 2020, Casey revealed that the lyric "''shouted slogans of leapers''" from the track "The Aphorist" off of ''[[Ultimate Success Today]]'' is a reference to "the young bands [that] I feel are attacking us and doing a shitty job at it, or a watered down version of us.
