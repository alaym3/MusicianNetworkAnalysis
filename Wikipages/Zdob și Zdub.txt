==Band history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
"Zdob și Zdub" ("Hit the Drum") musical band was put together in 1994 in [[Moldova]]. Before that, the singer Roman Iagupov, the bass-player Mihai Gincu and the drummer Anatol Pugach had together attended a school in a small town from the suburbs of Chisinau, called Straseni. They found the missing musicians during their studies at the Sports College in Chisinau. The line-up of the band was constantly changing: sometimes the band had two singers, sometimes - two guitarists. As a result, one guitarist became a singer, the clarinettist - a drummer, and the drummer - a bass-player.

In the spring of 1994, Roman Yagupov met the future producer of "Zdob și Zdub" - Igor Dinga, the singer of the seminal band "Cuibul". In June, the band got some attention from the music media in Chisinau, while playing before the "Cuibul" performance.

In November 1994, the first demo was recorded in a professional studio, and one song, "The Lost World" passed the selection of the "Learn To Swim I" Festival in Moscow, where the band appeared for the first time as "Zdob și Zdub". The band managed to immediately capture the attention and sympathies of Moscow extreme youth and made friends with the local alternative bands, especially with the "IFK", that accepted "Zdob și Zdub" invitation to play at the "10 Years After Chernobyl" Action in [[Chișinău]].

In July 1996, "Zdob și Zdub" participated at the "Learn to Swim II" Festival, where they played before the world-famous [[Rapcore]] band [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Two songs were recorded for the "Learn To Swim II" compilation: "V dome moiom" ("In My House") in [[Russian language|Russian]], and "Hardcore Moldovenesc" in Romanian. The second song has become an absolute hit, and it still is the "visit card" of the band. All national radio stations broadcast "Hardcore Moldovenesc", which became the hymn of the alternative youth in Moldova, being in the top of the hit parades. The same song was included in the "Romanian Underground" compilation in [[Romania]], attracting attention due to the obvious Moldovan dialect.

At the end of 1996, as a result of the deal with the Russian label "FeeLee", "Zdob și Zdub" recorded their debut album "Hardcore Moldovenesc". The entire album is in Russian, with the exception of the title track.

In January 1997, the band had an opening performance for [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[Rollins Band]] in [[Moscow]].

In March 1997, the band made a promotion tour with the Russian band "Tequilajazzz" in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Chisinau.

In 1998, "Zdob și Zdub" toured a lot, and at the end of the year had a two weeks tour in Germany. After that, "Zdob și Zdub" started to work on a new album, heading away from the American hardcore-concept, making more use of ethnic instruments, using them in the same extreme way, but with a more melodic, lyrical Moldovan touch. All the new songs are written in the Moldavian dialect of Romanian language. This was the beginning of a new stage: preparation for the recording of a new album under the name "Tabara Noastra". The album was recorded with the help of the famous Moldovan musicians, and, namely, Anatol Stefanet from "Trigon" (violin alt), Valeriu Cascaval from the folk music band "Barbu Lautaru" (dulcimer), and Eugen Didic from "Cuibul" (trumpet). The album consists of 12 songs, three of which are in Russian and the remaining in Romanian. Three songs have been recorded and submitted for promotion: "Draga Otee", an old hit of the well-known Moldovan musician Iurie Sadovni, the soulful ballad "Maria Blues", and "Zdubii Bateti Tare", resembling the Moldovan hardcore. After the debut and triumphal concert in Bucharest, "Zdob și Zdub" has shot its first video clip on the title-track "Zdubii Bateti Tare" at the Romanian music channel Atomic TV in Bucharest.

In May 1999, "FeeLee" released the Russian version of the album "Zdubii Bateti Tare" under the name "Tabara Noastra".

At the end of 2014, under the guidance of the German producer Jan Rubach, the band recorded two songs: La o margine de munte and Caloianul.

On 5 and 6 June, Zdob și Zdub will hold two great concerts, at Moscow and Sankt Petersburg. Both events are dedicated to the 15 years anniversary of the song Videli Noch’ (the Zdob și Zdub version), performed for the first time at the KINOproby Festival Tribute Victor Tzoy. The song became very popular in the post-Soviet countries, won a lot of awards and continues to be performed at each concert of the band.

In autumn 2014, Zdob și Zdub will celebrate its 20 years anniversary, by holding several great concerts in Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
