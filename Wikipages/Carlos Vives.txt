'''Carlos Alberto Vives Restrepo''' (born 7 August 1961) is a Colombian singer, songwriter and actor.

==Biography==
Carlos Vives was born on 7 August 1961<ref name="bio">[http://www.biografias.es/famosos/carlos-vives-kmj.html biografías.es], .</ref> in [[Santa Marta]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], Colombia, where he spent his first 12 years of life. At that age, he and his family moved to [[Bogotá]] in search of a better life. He enrolled in [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano University]] and holds a degree in Advertising from the university. In Bogotá, he also acquired a taste for rock, getting involved in the local music scene, and started playing in bars and cafés around the city.

===1982–1989===
In 1982, Vives began acting in a number of shows and [[telenovelas]] including "Pequeños Gigantes" (Little Giants – 1983) and "Tuyo es Mi Corazón" (Yours is My Heart – 1985). He finally found fame in 1986 by playing the title role of ''Gallito Ramírez'', which told the story of a Colombian Caribbean coast boxer who falls in love with an uptight girl, who was portrayed by his first wife, [[Margarita Rosa de Francisco]]. That same year, he released his first album, [[Por Fuera y Por Dentro]]. The album, primarily made of ballads, failed to gain any success. 
In 1987, he released his second ballad album, [[No Podrás Escapar de Mí]]. Though the title track reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, the album did not sell well. His next album, [[Al Centro de la Ciudad]], would become his last album to feature synthesizer-romantic ballads. Some of the songs got some attention being featured in telenovelas, but the album, just as its predecessors, failed to gain success.

In 1989, he was offered an acting job in [[Puerto Rico]], and upon moving, he took a break in his music career. He is remembered for his leading roles in the soaps [[La Otra]] and [[Aventurera]].<ref name="bio" /> He married Herlinda Gómez,<ref name="bio" /> his second wife (they have since divorced). Vives would spend his time between Colombia, Miami and the city of [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], Herlinda's hometown, during his marriage to her.

===Since 1991===
[[Image:CarlosVives.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Carlos Vives]]
Upon his return to Colombia in 1991, he was offered a TV role that would change his life forever. He was cast in the leading role of a fantasy series based in the life of [[vallenato]] composer [[Rafael Escalona]] called, not surprisingly, ''Escalona''.<ref name="bio" /> He sang the composer's songs in the series, and that's when he retooled his career towards vallenato,<ref name="vall">[http://www.elvallenato.com/artistas/biografia.php?artista=16&mas=Carlos%20Vives Vallenato.com], .</ref> gaining national success with the release of the Telenovela's two soundtrack albums, ''[[Escalona: Un Canto a la Vida]]'' and ''[[Escalona: Vol. 2]]''.

In 1993, backed by the band "La Provincia", Vives released the album [[Clásicos de la Provincia]] in which he started fusing Vallenato with rock,<ref name="bio" /> pop and other Caribbean Colombian ethnic rhythms. This fusion scandalized Vallenato purists. This style of vallenato was a huge success not only in Colombia but all over Latin countries, and the albums' lead single, [[La Gota Fría]], became a hit all over Latin America. ''Clásicos de la Provincia'', won the [[Billboard Latin Music Awards]] Best Album and would become a timeless classic in Colombian and Latin American music, introducing Vallenato to both Colombia and the rest of the world.

The follow-up album, ''[[La Tierra del Olvido]]'' would mark a further step in Vives' desire to fusion rock, funk and pop music with traditional Colombian genres. The album gave Vives classic hits such as the title track, and the up-tempo opening track ''[[Pa' Mayte]]''.

His subsequent releases, ''[[Tengo Fé]]'' (1997), ''[[El Amor de Mi Tierra]]'' (1999), ''[[Déjame Entrar (album)|Déjame Entrar]]'' (2001) and ''[[El Rock de Mi Pueblo]]'' (2004), were all commercially successful and were well received by the critics. In 2002 Carlos Vives' album "Déjame Entrar" won him his first Grammy award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album.

In 2009 he released the album ''[[Clásicos de la Provincia II]]'', which was sold exclusively in Colombian supermarket chain "Almacenes Éxito." The album saw Vives' return to covering famous Vallenato songs in his own style. It sold massively and the single ''Las Mujeres'' received wide radio airplay in all Colombia.

His hits include "Matilde Lina", "La Hamaca Grande", "[[La Gota Fría]]", "Alicia Adorada", "Pa' Mayte", "La Tierra del Olvido", "[[Tu Amor Eterno]]", "[[Fruta Fresca]]", "[[Déjame Entrar (Carlos Vives song)|Déjame Entrar]]", "[[Luna Nueva (song)|Luna Nueva]]", "Carito", "Papadio", "[[Como Tú (Carlos Vives song)|Como Tú]]" and "Décimas Del Parecido" (this last one a tribute to Guillermo Martínez, a Cuban-born radio host who resides in Mayagüez, and for whose program Vives was an occasional [[master control]] technician).

In 2012 Carlos Vives began a new era in television and music.

With more than 40 songs written in that year, the new album was released in April 2013 and featured 11 tracks.

Carlos also graced the small screen for all Colombia to see when he joined fellow artists Ricardo Montaner, Fanny Lu, and Andrés Cepeda as one of the coaches for the first season of the vocal competition series phenomenon The Voice Colombia, which premiered October 2012 via Colombian TV network Caracol TV.

On 27 May 2016, "[[La Bicicleta]]" with fellow Colombian singer [[Shakira]] was released as a single.
