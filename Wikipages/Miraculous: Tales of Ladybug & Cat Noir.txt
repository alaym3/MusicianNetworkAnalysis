==Production==
=== Conception and creation ===
The series is based on an original concept created by French writer and storyboarder, Thomas Astruc.<ref name="Author">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/duo-prep-s3d-superhero-toon-1118025064/|title=Duo prep S3D superhero toon – 'Lady Bug' to involve toys, comic books, Apple apps |last=Keslassy |first=Elsa |date=4 October 2010 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=26 January 2016 |quote=Univergroup Pictures and Onyx Films are joining forces to produce 'Miraculous Lady Bug'}}</ref> He was inspired by a meeting with a certain lady and "decades of comics binge reading".<ref name="faq">{{cite web|url=http://miraculoushawkdaddy.tumblr.com/post/138545579746/miraculous-faq?is_related_post=1|title=Miraculous Thomas Astruc FAQ | first=Thomas | last=Astruc |work=Tumblr | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321011502/http://miraculoushawkdaddy.tumblr.com/post/138545579746/miraculous-faq | archive-date=21 March 2016 | url-status=dead | access-date=24 August 2016 }}</ref> In an interview with [[Nolife (TV channel)|Nolife]], Astruc said he was working as an animator on the show ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'' when he met a woman wearing a T-shirt with a ladybug on it. They began to share drawings, some of which were ladybug-themed. Astruc also noted that Marinette's signature pigtail hairstyle was fashioned after the woman. They also worked on the cartoon ''[[A.T.O.M.]]'' around 2004–05. Astruc first drew ''Ladybug'' on [[Post-it note|sticky notes]] and remarked about how strong the Ladybug character was. He had had no memories of seeing ladybug-themed superheroes in comics.<ref name="nolife interview"/>

Astruc had intended to make ''Ladybug'' a comic book series until he met [[Jeremy Zag]], who loved the project and wanted to produce it as a [[cartoon]]; Zag was 25 at the time and not originally from the cartoon industry.<ref name="nolife interview"/>

In developing Cat Noir, Astruc said that ladybugs represented good luck, so it was natural to partner her with a black cat character with bad luck powers. Cat Noir was a tribute to comic characters, like [[Catwoman]]. So it was like having Catwoman and [[Spider-Man]] in the same show but reversed genders and roles.<ref name="nolife interview"/>

A character named Félix was originally going to have the role of Cat Noir,<ref name="AboutFLX">{{cite tweet | title=@WatermelonSoup in the trailer, the male character you're talking is called Félix. | user=Thomas_Astruc | number=646653283516444672 | date=23 September 2015 | access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> but he was later scrapped in favor of Adrien Agreste because the creative team felt that Félix was a cliché of a male anime protagonist and that Adrien would allow them to tell more interesting stories.<ref>{{cite tweet | title=@raff_rafflesia Me too.

=== Hiring companies ===
In 2010, the show was announced at Cannes' [[MIPCOM]] with French production groups Univergroup Pictures and Onyx Films heading the project and working with [[Method Animation]] and [[Zagtoon]].

The producers had also planned to animate it in stereoscopic 3D (currently, the show is produced using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animation).<ref name="Author"/>

On 21 November 2012, a [[memorandum of understanding]] between Zagtoon, Method Animation, [[SAMG Animation]] and [[SK Broadband]] was announced: together, the companies would invest US$50 million through 2017 into five projects. The first of these projects was developed into ''Miraculous''<!--which is called "Ladybug" in Korean articles back then.-->, which received an investment of $10&nbsp;million.

When Toei Animation joined as a co-producer in the summer of June 2012, it was also announced that the show would be drawn in a colorful [[manga]]-like style.<ref name="variety 2012"/> Later in September, Zagtoon, Method, & Toei released a traditionally-animated promotional video for ''Miraculous'' ''Ladybug''.<ref name="crunchy2012"/><ref name="anime201209"/> The video featured Marinette (in different clothes similar to the clothes in the current series) as Ladybug, and a (now-scrapped, later Adrien's cousin) different character named Félix as Cat Noir,<ref name="AboutFLX"/> Marinette and Félix's [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Kwamis|Kwamis]], Tikki and Plagg, Hawk Moth/Gabriel (without the mask and with a different outfit, look, and lair compared to the current series), and also the akumatized villains, The Mime and Mr. Pigeon. Their Miraculous and their transformation sequences had a different look similar to the Miraculous and the transformations in the current series. The demo song from the promotional music video was performed & composed by [[Noam Kaniel|Noam]], who would later compose music and perform songs for the current series.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/654642875704209409|title=Thomas Astruc on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onascaleof1tomarkwebber.tumblr.com/post/126013472695/at-last-the-lyrics-to-the-miraculous-ladybug-pv|title=At last!

The whole anime concept was a complete success; but there were concerns about the marketability of traditional 2D animation and the difficulty in animating Ladybug's costume of red with black spots, as it caused some strobing effects.<ref name="nolife interview"/> Executive producer Jared Wolfson said that Zag wanted the animation to be cinematic and epic, unique and different, and said that they are continuing to partner with Toei as it brings in the Asian inspiration and that a 2D version of the show might be a potential product for future purposes.<ref name="kitsune jared wolfson">{{cite web | url=https://thekitsunetwork.net/2015/12/24/miraculous-ladybug-interview/ | author=Krystal Kitsune | date=24 December 2015 | work=The Kitsune Network | title=INTERVIEW WITH: Miraculous Ladybug executive producer, Jared Wolfson }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-10/zag-ceo-miraculous-ladybug-has-2d-original-animation-video-in-development/.97430|title=Zag CEO: Miraculous Ladybug Has 2D Original Animation Video in Development|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/_lfIvPyQ3A/|title=Jeremy Zag on Instagram: "Miraculous Ladybug working session at Toei Animation Japan"|website=Instagram|language=en |access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/679310947933102080|title=Thomas Astruc on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/miraculous-ladybug-2d-ova-is-confirmed/E3tP_uxpVNq6rN0dMg1z23V35P5mRx|title=Miraculous Ladybug 2D OVA is Confirmed! {{!}} Anime Amino|website=Anime {{!}} aminoapps.com|access-date=2018-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718174719/https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/miraculous-ladybug-2d-ova-is-confirmed/E3tP_uxpVNq6rN0dMg1z23V35P5mRx|archive-date=18 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Winny_BayDay/status/745484929258004482|title=Yes.

<!--Any idea *how* SAMG got involved in the production?-->
The aforementioned problem with 2D animation was resolved by moving to CGI animation; the switch also allowed for easier implementation of mobile camera angles.<ref name="nolife interview"/> [[SAMG Animation]], a CGI animation studio located in South Korea which officially joined in the production in the fall of November 2012,<ref name="SKB PRel Nov 12"/><ref name="YNA Nov 12"/> produced modeling and animation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/702901.html |title=S.

On 18 April 2021, It was confirmed that in addition to season 4 and 5 the show will have two more seasons (season 6 and 7)<ref>{{cite web|title=Confirmation of season 6 and 7 by Thomas Astruc|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1383880260970713088|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Confirmation of season 6 and 7|url=https://miraculousladybugnews.com/2021/04/18/miraculous-seasons-6-and-7-officially-confirmed/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Themes, writing, and process ===
While the show is marketed as a Western [[Superhero fiction|superhero]] narrative, its thematic base is the Japanese [[Magical girl|''mahō shōjo'']] (magical girl) genre, with its focus on [[transformation sequence]]s, a school cast, the gathering of a team of heroes, animal friends, and end-of-episode collages.<ref name="SH" /> In particular, ''Ladybug'' is strongly influenced by the genre's landmark entry ''[[Sailor Moon]]'': Not only does the name of Marinette ("little sailor girl") recall ''Sailor Moon's'' title, but the main characters' magical companions reflect ''Sailor Moon''<nowiki/>'s [[Luna (Sailor Moon)|Luna]] and [[Artemis (Sailor Moon)|Artemis]], the main villain's power resembles that of [[Queen Beryl]], and the show's entire plot parallels the story of [[Sailor Saturn]].<ref name="SH" /> ''Ladybug'' features numerous other direct and indirect references to its inspiration.<ref name="SH" />

The concept for the show originally dealt with political themes, geared towards teens and young adults. However, after failing to gain traction with networks, it was retooled for a younger target audience.<ref name="tf1presskit">{{cite web|url=https://tf1pro.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/miraculous.pdf|title=Miraculous press kit |language=fr |date=22 September 2015 |publisher=tf1pro.com | last=Binoist | first=Aurélie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011123721/http://www.tf1pro.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/miraculous.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|40}} Astruc said that he is delighted that the show is able to reach younger and older people.<ref name="nolife interview" />

Each episode takes around 3 months to write, from scratch to final validation of broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miraculoushawkdaddy.tumblr.com/post/139190744381/how-long-does-is-take-on-average-to-write-an|title=How long does it take on average to write an episode?|author=Thomas Astruc|date=12 February 2016|work=Tumblr|access-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320043942/http://miraculoushawkdaddy.tumblr.com/post/139190744381/how-long-does-is-take-on-average-to-write-an|archive-date=20 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Assistant director, Wilfried Pain, said that each episode is composed of two parts: a sitcom aspect where the characters have to speak for themselves, and an action element where the camera is always moving.<ref name="nolife interview"/>

[[Noam Kaniel]] writes the music and songs. Kaniel has also worked on action superhero shows such as ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Code Lyoko]]'', ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes|Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' and ''[[Smile PreCure!|Glitter Force]]''.<ref name="kitsune jared wolfson"/><ref name=":1frog">{{cite web|url=https://www.frogtoon.com/Track/Noam+Kaniel/Miraculous+Ladybug|title=Noam Kaniel|work=Frogtoon Music|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Kaniel and Zag wrote the theme song.

She "quickly realized there was a far cooler and broader Miraculous movement underway".<ref name="cooper">{{cite web|url=https://literatigurl.com/2016/02/27/biracial-diversity-in-animation-thomas-astruc-scores-big-with-miraculous-ladybug/|first=Kimberly|last=Cooper|title=Biracial Diversity in Animation: Thomas Astruc Scores Big with Miraculous Ladybug|work=Literatigurl|date=27 February 2016|access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref><!-- https://twitter.com/literatigurl --> Caitlin Donovan of the entertainment website, Epicstream, listed it as one of her top 10 animated series of 2015. She wrote that "The characters are so charming that the tropey aspects of the show are merely a lot of fun, rather than irritating." with creative fights and good CGI animation. She wrote that "Marinette is an adorable lead who is genuinely awkward as a civilian, but confident as a superhero, which makes for an interesting contrast."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epicstream.com/features/Top-10-Animated-Series-of-2015|title=Top 10 Animated Series of 2015|first=Caitlin |last=Donovan|date=30 December 2015|publisher=epicstream.com|access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> Ella Anders of BSCKids wrote that the show stands out because of "how it meshes both the magical girl and superhero genre together".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2015/07/part-magical-girl-part-superhero-ladybug-arrives-state-side-fall/|title=Part Magical Girl, Part Superhero; Ladybug Arrives State-Side in Fall|first=Ella |last=Anders|date=2 July 2015|work=BSCkids|access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> Robert Lloyd of the [[Los Angeles Times]] described the show as "clever, romantic, fun, the way some of us prefer our superhero stories".

The North American Precis Syndicate called the show "authentic and aspirational – a story of today's modern everygirl superhero who comes to life.
