The [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominated ''[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)|Chapter V]]'' most notably demonstrates his versatility, vocal range, lyricism and melodic girth as he expresses his eternal love for his woman through singles such as "[[Simply Amazing]]" with "[[Heart Attack (Trey Songz song)|Heart Attack]]" showcasing his vulnerable side that discusses trials and tribulations of love and heartache. "[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)#Track listing|Ladies Go Wild]]" is a dance-friendly track that stems from his experiences of his international nightlife and travels. The "[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)#Track listing|Hail Mary]]" track balances sensuality against grittiness and likens the pleasures of a woman to a 'hail mary' football throw, while "[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)#Track listing|Without A Woman]]" exemplifies his appreciation for women over a classic 1970s R&B sound. Moreover, "[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)#Track listing|Check Me Out]]" effortlessly combines Trey's rap flow and melodic skills, in extension to "[[Dive In (Trey Songz song)|Dive In]]" which is considered to be his most signature-sounding record that uses suave wordplay to compare his pending conquest of a woman's body to taking a dive in the pool. Songz describes his albums as work "that will take you many places, emotionally and sensually."<ref name="About Trey Songz" />

On January 24, 2021, Songz was arrested in Kansas City, Missouri, while attending the conference championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills. Songz was being heckled by fans, and he asked them to "chill out". An officer came over, and from sources and a video released by TMZ, an altercation ensued. This altercation lead to Songz arrest, and charges of trespassing, resisting arrest, both misdemeanors, and for assaulting a police officer, a low-grade felony. He was released from custody the next day. Sources connected to Songz with direct knowledge told TMZ he believes the officer in question had it in for him long before the altercation, and when the officer came over to him he was immediately aggressive.  Another source says the officer's issue before the incident was that Trey and his crew were not wearing masks and refused to put them on.<ref>{{cite web |title=TMZ |url=https://www.tmz.com/2021/01/24/trey-songz-chiefs-game-fight-police-officer-arrest/?fbclid=IwAR2mwir5y_dqnhTZqsPIssxW3uPTuBbH9AuXQt4c0l7aFQvZ6kyqDpfsUOg |access-date=January 25, 2021}}</ref> Kansas City Police Department released the security video from their section, which showed that his Songz' party had several warnings after multiple encounters with security and police, eventually resulting in Songz being escorted out of the seating area, at which point he threw the first punch at the police officer.<ref>{{cite web |title=KCPD |url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article248758380.html |access-date=January 25, 2021}}</ref>
