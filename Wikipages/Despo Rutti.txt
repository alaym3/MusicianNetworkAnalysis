'''Pascal Trésor Azu'Simba''', better known as '''Despo Rutti "Rutt's"''' (born 26 June 1982 in [[Kinshasa]]), is a French rapper from Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Spending his life in Kinshasa and in Brazzaville, he immigrated to France in 1992. He released his first recordings in 1999 "Tout c’que j'n'aurais pas" and "Les reufs meurent" and was featured in a number of rap compilations through producer Fabrice Yahiaoui and label Hématome Concept eventually signing with label Soldat Sans Grade Records releasing ''Les sirènes du charbon'' on 28 November 2006, as a double CD, being an EP of 9 titles and a street album mixed by DJ Boudj. It denounced the social inequalities and a protest for expulsion of immigrants. It was followed by another provocative release, ''Convictions suicidaires'', his debut studio full album treating taboo subjects of French society including national identity in face of changing immigration trends. This was followed by the mixtape ''Discographie parallèle'' mixed by DJ Uka and highlighting a number of collaborations. 

He prepared the materials for his second studio album ''Les funérailles des tabous'' in 2012, but put it on hold<ref>[http://www.13or-du-hiphop.fr/le-blog/2013/01/21/despo-rutti-les-funerailles-des-tabous-ne-sortira-pas/ 13or du HipHop: Despo Rutti - ''Les funérailles des tabous'' ne sortira pas] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> instead starting a collaboration with rapper Guizmo and Mokless (from [[Scred Connexion]]) for a musical project in 2012,<ref>[http://www.fnac.com/Mokless-Despo-Rutti-et-Guizmo-s-allient-pour-un-album-de-qualite/cp21938/w-4 Fnac.com: Mokless, Despo Rutti et Guizmo s'allient pour un album de qualité] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> that resulted in the issue of the joint EP ''Jamais 2 sans 3'' followed by the joint studio album ''Jamais 203''.
