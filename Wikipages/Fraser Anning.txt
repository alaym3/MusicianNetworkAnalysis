Anning was elected to the Senate after a special recount was triggered by the removal of [[One Nation Party|One Nation]] senator [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]].

==Personal life and family history==
Anning grew up in north-west Queensland on Wetherby Station, one of the Anning family's pastoral properties near the town of [[Richmond, Queensland|Richmond]]. He is a direct descendant of Charles Cumming Stone Anning, a [[Squatting (Australian history)|pastoral squatter]] who [[Immigration to Australia|immigrated]] to the Australian colonies in the mid-19th century to acquire landholdings. Charles and several of his sons established the Reedy Springs property north of [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] in 1862, and soon expanded their claims by forming the nearby properties of Chudleigh Park, Mount Sturgeon, Charlotte Plains and Cargoon.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63080682 |title=Anroud [sic] the Campfire |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |volume=LXIX |location=Queensland, Australia |date=16 November 1949 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In response to the spearing of their cattle by [[Aboriginal Australians]], the Annings would ride out with firearms, attack Aboriginal campsites and capture young boys who survived in order to use them as labour on their cattle and sheep stations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Loos |first=Noel |title=Invasion and Resistance |date=2017 |publisher=Boolarong Press |location=Salisbury |pages=44, 57 |edition=2}}</ref> The Annings at times also requested the services of the local [[Native Police]] paramilitary unit to assist in clearing "blacks" off their runs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=Robert |title=Reminiscences of India and North Queensland |date=1913 |publisher=Constable and Company |location=London |page=198 |url=https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesofi00gray/page/198}}</ref> [[Frank Hann]], another pastoralist in the region who regularly participated in extrajudicial punitive raids on Aboriginals, described in his diary in 1874 that he saw "Anning [coming] back from hunting blacks".<ref>{{cite web |last=Babidge |first=Sally |title=Family Affairs: an historical anthropology of state practice and Aboriginal agency in a rural town, North Queensland |url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/942/2/02whole.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>

Fraser Anning's grandfather Francis "Frank" Albert Anning spent much of his time at Reedy Springs but also bought into further properties such as Wollogorang, Savannah Station and Compton Downs.

===Christchurch mosque shootings and egg incident===
Anning was sharply criticised for his comments about the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in New Zealand, in which 51 Muslim worshippers were killed. He claimed that immigration of "Muslim fanatics" led to the attacks, and that "while Muslims may have been victims today, usually they are the perpetrators". Anning also stated that the massacre "highlights...the growing fear within our community...of the increasing Muslim presence."<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last=Bedo |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/politics/politician-lashes-out-at-muslims-after-christchurch-shootings-they-are-the-perpetrators/news-story/8e3f11fe73821dc3e65d75432ac76f2e |title=Politician lashes out at Muslims after Christchurch shootings: 'They are the perpetrators' |work=News.com.au |date=15 March 2019 |access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/australian-senator-fraser-anning-criticised-blaming-new-zealand-attack-on-muslim-immigration Fury as Australian senator blames Christchurch attack on Muslim immigration], The Guardian, 16 March 2019</ref> The comments received international attention and were overwhelmingly criticised as being insensitive and racist, and sympathetic to the views of the perpetrator.

Anning subsequently slapped Connolly twice in the face. Connolly was then tackled by several of Anning's supporters, including United Patriots Front leader [[Neil Erikson]], one of whom held the youth in a choke hold until police arrived and took the teenager away. The teenager was taken into custody by police, but was released without charge, while they launched an investigation into the violence.<ref>Egg boy:

However, the AEC said the use of "Fraser" and "Anning" in the party's name was "sufficient to aurally and visually distinguish the party's name and abbreviation from other names and abbreviations on the ballot paper". There were similar objections to the request to adopt the abbreviation "The Conservative Nationals". Registration was only granted following the withdrawal of that proposal.<ref name=registered/>

On 26 April 2019, during the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 Federal Election]] campaign, Anning used the site of the 2005 [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla race riots]] in Sydney to announce his party's candidates for [[New South Wales]].

In November 2020, the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) brought legal action against Anning, seeking a penalty of up to $26,640 for allegedly failing to lodge required financial returns for the 2018-19 financial year. On 16 February 2021, the AEC dropped the case because they were unable to locate Anning in Australia despite several attempts to contact him, with the AEC believing him to be overseas.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=20 February 2021|title=Australian Electoral Commission drops case against missing former far-right senator Fraser Anning|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/20/australia-electoral-commission-drops-case-against-missing-former-far-right-senator-fraser-anning|url-status=live|access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref>
