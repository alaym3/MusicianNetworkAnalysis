'''Jay Chou''' ({{lang-zh|t=周杰倫|s=周杰伦|p=Zhōu Jiélún|first=t}}; born 18 January 1979)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Ching-yi|last2=Hsiao|first2=Scully|title=Pop star Jay Chou confirms marriage plan|url=http://focustaiwan.cna.com.tw/news/afav/201412220019.aspx|access-date=28 December 2014|date=22 December 2014|archive-date=27 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227194610/http://focustaiwan.cna.com.tw/news/afav/201412220019.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, actor, film director, businessman and magician. Dubbed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Mandopop]]", and having sold over 30 million records, Chou is one of the best-selling artists in the [[Greater China Area]] and is known for his work with lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]], with whom he has frequently collaborated on his music.

In 2000, Chou released his debut studio album, ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'' (2000), under the record company Alfa Music to moderate success. Chou rose to fame with the release of his second studio album, ''[[Fantasy (Jay Chou album)|Fantasy]]'' (2001), which combined Western and Eastern music styles. The album won five [[12th Golden Melody Awards|Golden Melody Awards]], including Album of the Year. He has since further released twelve more studio albums, spawning a string of hit singles and gaining significant prominence in Asian communities such as [[Taiwan]], [[mainland China]],  [[Hong Kong]], 
[[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. Chou has embarked on six world tours, performing in cities around the world to more than 10 million spectators as of 2019.<ref name="Time"/>

In 2007, Chou established his own record and management company JVR Music.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Susan|title=China Breaking Through: Busting Barriers to Big Business on the Mainland-An In-Depth Look|date=27 May 2006|publisher=Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 118.21|pages=22–25}}</ref> Outside of music, Chou has served as the President of his own fashion brand PHANTACi since 2006. As an actor, Chou made his acting debut in the film ''[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]'' (2005), followed shortly by a starring role in the epic ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (2006). He has since starred in a number of movies, becoming known to Western audiences when he made his [[Hollywood]] debut in 2011 with ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'', starring alongside [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Christoph Waltz]], followed by ''[[Now You See Me 2]]'' (2016).

== Early life ==
Jay Chou was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. Both his parents were secondary school teachers: his mother, Yeh Hui-Mei ({{zh|t=葉惠美|p=Yè Huìměi|labels=no}}), who was a music teacher, taught fine arts, while his father, Chou Yao-Chung ({{zh|s=周耀中|p=Zhōu Yàozhōng|labels=no}}), is a [[biomedical]] researcher. His mother noticed his sensitivity to music and took him to piano lessons at the age of four.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/03/ta.jaychou/index.html#cnnSTCText|title=Jay Chou: Asia's reluctant superstar|date=8 September 2008|publisher=CNN|access-date=21 February 2009|archive-date=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218130137/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/03/ta.jaychou/index.html#cnnSTCText|url-status=live}}</ref> During his childhood, he was fascinated with capturing sounds and songs with his [[tape recorder]], which he carried everywhere with him. In the third grade, he became interested in [[music theory]] and also started cello lessons. He was an only child and loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks. His favorite composer was, and still is to this day, [[Chopin]]. His parents divorced when he was 14 and he was teased by his classmates, which caused him to become reclusive and introverted. He had no friends and preferred to be alone, listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Tamkang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed a talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music and began to write songs.<ref name="Time" /><ref name="gddm812">{{cite book| last = Chou| first = Jay| title = Grandeur de D Major| date = 1 November 2004| publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu| location = China | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 | pages = 8, 12|language=zh}}</ref>

Chou was [[Conscription in Taiwan|conscripted for mandatory military service]] after graduating from high school with inadequate grades for university. However, severe back pain triggered by sports eventually led to the diagnosis of [[ankylosing spondylitis]] ([[HLA-B27]]), and he was exempted from military service.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2003-04-28/2225147402.html | title = Jay Chou discusses the wonder of life in illness 二度造访心情电视 周杰伦谈病痛中的精彩人生 | date = 28 April 2003 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = sina.com.cn | format = News article | language = zh | archive-date = 9 April 2005 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050409222218/http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2003-04-28/2225147402.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="zaobaoak">{{cite news | url = http://stars.zaobao.com/pages3/zhoujielun060225.html | title = Jacky Wu: Jay Chou takes 12 painkillers 吴宗宪：周杰伦一度服12颗止痛药 | publisher = zaobao.com | date = 25 February 2006 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | format = News article | language = zh | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012055042/http://stars.zaobao.com/pages3/zhoujielun060225.html | archive-date = 12 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Meanwhile, he found a job as a waiter.<ref name="waiter">{{cite web| url = http://gbtimes.com/life/jay-chou-asias-own-eminem| title = Jay Chou - Asia's own Eminem| access-date = 11 April 2015| date = 23 March 2007| publisher = gbtimes.com| archive-date = 14 April 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150414123123/http://gbtimes.com/life/jay-chou-asias-own-eminem| url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:周杰伦的职业生涯揭秘:从侍应生到乐坛巨星_职场频道_新华网|url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/employment/2009-04/29/content_11280274_2.htm|website = news.xinhuanet.com|access-date = 30 November 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090502215505/http://news.xinhuanet.com/employment/2009-04/29/content_11280274_2.htm|archive-date = 2 May 2009|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="seeds">{{cite book |author=Liu Dongji|script-chapter=zh:《周杰伦：太阳的背后不是光》|chapter=Jay Chou: The Back of the Sun Is Not Light |script-title=zh:《青年文摘》|trans-title=Youth Literary Digest |year=2008 |publisher=Youth Literary Digest Agency |location=Chaoyang District, Beijing |pages=4–5 |isbn=978-7-5006-6468-0 |language=zh}}</ref>

== Early career ==
Chou's mother initially inspired Chou to become a music teacher, while Chou remained relatively clueless on what to do with his life. Without his knowledge, a friend registered both their names in a talent show called ''Super New Talent King'' in 1998. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as "lousy". Although they did not win, the show's host, [[Jacky Wu]] – an influential character in Taiwan's entertainment business – happened to glance at the music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu then asked who wrote it, discovered Chou and hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]].<ref name="Time" /><ref name="seeds"/> for his then record company, Alfa Music. Chou then spent most of his time in Wu's studio learning music producing, sound mixing, recording and writing songs. Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines [[Music of China|Chinese]] and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], rock and pop genres. <!--  His songs written for artists such as Jacky Wu, Power Station, Landy Wen and Coco Lee became widely popular but he is still relatively unknown. There were no plans to make him a singer because his mentor Wu thought he was too shy and not good-looking.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} -->However, Wu told Chou that he would help Chou release an album after he wrote 50 songs and he would pick 10 from there. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD album, ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'', released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[hip hop music|rap]], classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly in Chinese-speaking regions throughout Southeast Asia.<ref name="jcbio">{{cite web | url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html | title = King of the new generation 周杰伦：新声代之王 | date = 8 January 2007 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = sina.com.cn | language = zh | archive-date = 25 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525230525/http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="starsrising" /><ref name="revolutionary" />

== Music career ==

=== 2000 to 2003 ===

In 2000, under the recommendation of JR Yang (楊峻榮), Jay Chou began to sing his own songs.  Chou launched his debut album ''Jay'' under Alfa Music in 2000. Chou arranged the compilation, harmony, and production of all the songs. The album combines R&B, hip-hop, and other musical styles. Among them, the hit song "星晴" won the 24th China Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs.  The album was promoted heavily by [[Jacky Wu]] in the entertainment shows he hosted. Chou himself also appeared on a few television programs to promote the album. Chou was marketed as a talented singer-composer with a unique tune. His collaboration with [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] and Vivian Hsu on the release brought about a few hits.

After promoting his debut album, Chou returned to the studio for the next twelve months to record and produce his next album, 范特西''Fantasy'', which helped him become an established star. This album was released in September 2001 and became a big hit, selling an estimated two million copies in Taiwan alone. ''Fantasy'' helped Chou secure ten nominations and five wins at the [[13th Golden Melody Awards]] 第13届金曲奖 in 2002. R&B hits such as "簡單愛" (Simple Love) "愛在西元前" (Love before BC), which won Chou the Best Composer award, and "開不了口" (Can't Express Myself) are considered Chou's signature songs and are still sung in concerts today.

Chou's music has been a much-discussed topic across Chinese regions, because it differed greatly from mainstream popular Chinese music released at that time. His pieces combine ancient themes with futuristic ones, including things like space ships, all while employing graphic storytelling skills to evoke vivid imagery to his audience. His enunciation, or lack thereof, whether rapping or singing, was also critiqued when listeners often found that they could not decipher the words sung until they looked up the lyrics. Critics referred to his singing as "mumbling". This garnered a lot of attention and reporters often quiz Chou on his singing style. Chou defended this as his signature style to infuse the vocals with the music and "make it blend" well together. Chou also stated that he wants the listeners to look at the lyrics stating the lyrics written by Vincent Fang are very deep.

Chou's third album, ''The Eight Dimensions''八度空间, became another commercial success and is similar in style to his second. Another collaboration with Fang, ''The Eight Dimensions''八度空间 included songs that invoke imagery, Chou's "mumbling" style and mainly R&B tunes. The singer has sold over 750,000 copies of ''Fantasy'' as of 2002, throughout the region. In the same year, Chou held his debut concert tour ''The One''. There was also more crossover activity between Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as steadily increasing activity by Japanese acts in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClure|first1=Steve|title=The Year in Asia: Ongoing Piracy and Sliding Sales Trouble the Region, But New Artists in New Genres Begin to Make an Impact|date=28 December 2002|publisher=Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 114–115.52–1|page=sec Year in Music 2002: YE–24}}</ref>

=== 2003 to 2005 ===
In 2003, Chou released his fourth album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' named after his own mother. After the release of this album, he attended the Golden Melody Awards for his previous album's nomination. The album ''The Eight Dimensions'' was nominated for 5 categories but won none. Chou didn't take this too lightly, as he wrote on his next album the song "外婆" (Grandmother) that he actually takes the Golden Melody Awards too seriously. Ironically, his then-current album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' would go on to win a Golden Melody 金曲奖 "Best Album of the year 年度最佳专辑奖" award in 2004.

''Yeh Hui-mei'' was both a commercial and musical success. The album features songs on Mafia and drug lords "以父之名" (In the name of the father) which at first hearing was very unorthodox but displays Jay's creative writing and producing ability. This album can be seen as Jay's second milestone because it gained extremely positive reaction from both critics and supporters of his music. Jay also wanted to prove that he is a versatile artist and does not only write R&B songs, he ventured into more rock-flavoured tunes such as "晴天" which was one of the most played songs of the year. This song gained widespread popularity and high school students started learning guitar to play the drift of the song's intro.

In 2004, his album 七里香''[[Common Jasmin Orange]]'', released by Sony Music, excelled in the [[Greater China]] region. In 2004, his album 七里香 Qilixiang, or Jasmine, released by Sony Music, excelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China Mainland.<ref name=":0" /> Despite overwhelming piracy in Taiwan-which has reduced the recording industry to 5 to 10 percent from its heyday-as a Taiwan singer, Jay produced an album that sold a record 300,000 copies. In Hong Kong, his album surpassed local albums with sales of 50,000 units. In China the official figure reached 2.6 million units, a figure no other Chinese artist has attained. The World Music Awards in September 2004 held in Las Vegas acknowledged him as the most popular Chinese singer based on sales.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Anthony|title=western style, Chinese Pop: Jay Chou's Rap and Hip-Hop in China|year=2008|pages=69–80}}</ref>

In 2005, his album 11月的蕭邦''Chopin of November'' continued this record of success with sales of 2.5 million units in Asia.<ref name=":0" />

=== Single released in 2018 ===
He published his new single 'Waiting For You'. He released the song on his birthday, January 18. The content is about a young man who secretly fell in love with a girl. He regretted that he didn't study well and couldn't enter the same university with her. In order to wait for her to finish class, he rented a house near the girl's residence, waited for her silently, played the piano and wrote a love letter. He just wanted to convey his mind to her, but he couldn't find the time and way. He had to wait for the girl to finish class every day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=杰威爾音樂 JVR Music|url=http://www.jvrmusic.com/news/detail/1152141405221687296|access-date=2021-11-23|website=www.jvrmusic.com|language=zh-TW}}</ref>

=== Single released in 2019 ===
He recently made his chart comeback after a three-year hiatus with his long-awaited new single "Won't cry". The song, which features [[Mayday (Taiwanese band)|Mayday]] vocalist, [[Ashin]], was released on 16 September 2019, and its music video has since been viewed over 22 million times on YouTube.

In fact, the song was streamed so many times that it was reported to have caused QQ music – China's biggest streaming platform – to crash on the day of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.8days.sg/sceneandheard/entertainment/jay-chou-s-lyricist-speaks-up-for-the-singer-after-his-new-11945500|title=Jay Chou's Lyricist Speaks Up for the Singer After His New Single Gets Bad Reviews|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-09-30|archive-date=30 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930083323/https://www.8days.sg/sceneandheard/entertainment/jay-chou-s-lyricist-speaks-up-for-the-singer-after-his-new-11945500|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Single released in 2020 ===
He published his new single "Mojito". It caused a sensation on the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://radiichina.com/jay-chou-mojito/ |title=Jay Chou's "Mojito" is China's Most Viral Song of 2020 So Far |date=15 June 2020 |access-date=9 February 2021 |archive-date=20 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120164109/https://radiichina.com/jay-chou-mojito/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The song, which effuses amorous feelings of [[Cuba]], was released as a single album on June 12, 2020.

== Musical style ==
Chou's compositions are loosely categorized as pop music. While many of his works fall into contemporary [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[hip hop music|rap]], and rock genres, the term "Chou Style" ({{zh|t=周氏風格|p=zhōu shì fēnggé|labels=no}})<ref name="2mill">{{cite news |url=http://newsserver.ccwb.net/html1/2006/10/11/f110918.shtml |title="Still Fantasy" Two million albums sold recognized for Jay Chou 《依然范特西》两百万销量力证周董 |publisher=ccwb.net | date=11 October 2006 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070505141311/http://newsserver.ccwb.net/html1/2006/10/11/f110918.shtml| archive-date = 5 May 2007|language=zh}}</ref> has been popularized to describe his trademark cross-cultural music and insistence on singing with slurred enunciation. 台北時報''[[Taipei Times]]'' once described the meaning of "Chou Style": "In what has become the archetypal Chou style, Taiwan's favorite son blends pop, rap, blues and a smorgasbord of esthetic elements of world music to create his dream-like never-never land..."<ref>{{cite web |last = Phipps |first = Gavin |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/08/29/2003200785 |title = CD Reviews |work = The Taipei Times |date = 29 August 2004 |page = 19 |access-date = 28 February 2007 |archive-date = 9 July 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709103749/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/08/29/2003200785 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Chou regularly fuses traditional Chinese instruments and styles with R&B or rock to form a new genre called "[[Zhongguo feng]]" ({{zh|t=中國風|p=Zhōngguó fēng|labels=no}}), which literally means "[[China Wind music|Chinese Style Music]]",{{Ref label|A|a|none}} some of which are written in the [[Pentatonic Scale]] as opposed to the more common seven-note scale ([[Diatonic scale]]) to accentuate an oriental style. Besides his own culture, he also incorporated [[Flamenco guitar|Spanish guitar]] in "Red Imitation" ({{zh|t=紅模仿|p=hóng mófǎng|labels=no}}), American [[techno]]/[[electronic music|electronica]] in "Herbalist's Manual" ({{zh|t=本草綱目|p=Běncǎo Gāngmù|labels=no}}), rap with subtle classical music undertones in "Reverse Scales" ({{zh|t=逆鱗|p=nìlín|labels=no}}), [[Blues]] style in "Free Tutorial Video" ({{zh|t=免費教學錄影帶|p=Mian Fei Jiao Xue Lu Ying Dai|labels=no}}) and [[Bossa nova|Bossanova]] style in "Rosemary" ({{zh|t=迷迭香|p=mídiéxiāng|labels=no}}), to name a few. Sound effects from everyday life are frequently woven into his music, such as bouncing ping pong balls, touch tone phone dialing, helicopter blades, dripping rain, and radio static noise ([[Musique concrète]]).{{Ref label|B|b|none}}

His formal musical training is evident by the use of classical [[Musical texture|textures]] in his compositions. For example, [[counterpoint]] was used in "Perfection" ({{zh|t=完美主義|p=wánměizhǔyì|labels=no}}) and "Sorry" ({{zh|t=對不起|p=duìbuqǐ|labels=no}}), while [[polyphony]] can be found in "The Wound That Ends War" ({{zh|t=止戰之殤|p=zhǐ zhàn zhī shāng|labels=no}}) and "Twilight's Chapter Seven" ({{zh|t=夜的第七章|p=yè de dì-qī zhāng|labels=no}}).

Chou's albums have been noted for the lack of change compared to his earlier works, yet he firmly stated that he will not alter his style: "They say I've been standing still&nbsp;... but this is the music I want, and I don't see what I want by moving ahead."<ref name="appetite" /> To demonstrate his point, he named his 2006 album 依然范特西 ''Still Fantasy'' after his 2001 album ''Fantasy''.

=== Lyrics ===
Chou is considered more of a singer-composer than a lyricist. Several "regulars" write the lyrics for most of his music,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ccjk.com/amazing-english-translation-jay-chous-chinese-style-songstwo/ | title=English Translation of Jay Chou's Chinese Style Songs | date=22 December 2014 | access-date=1 January 2015 | archive-date=18 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118105134/http://www.ccjk.com/amazing-english-translation-jay-chous-chinese-style-songstwo/ | url-status=live }}</ref> but the content and style is unified with his own personality and image, covering a diverse range of topics and ideas. Vincent Fang accounts for more than half of the lyrics in his albums, helping to establish an important element in Chou's music: the use of meaningful, imagery- and emotionally rich lyrics, sometimes written in the form of ancient Chinese poetry with reference to Chinese history or folklore.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} In addition to writing romantic hits,{{Ref label|D|d|none}} he also touches on war, the [[Bible]], sports, and martial arts.{{Ref label|E|e|none}} [[Vivian Hsu]] is a singer herself and has helped with Chou's earlier hits.{{Ref label|F|f|none}}

Chou himself has written lyrics for many ballads,{{Ref label|G|g|none}} but has also discussed societal ills such as drug addiction in "Coward" ({{zh|t=懦夫|p=nuòfū|links=no}}) and loss of the rural countryside to urbanization in "Terrace fields" ({{zh|t=梯田|p=tītián|links=no}}). Domestic violence discussed in "Dad, I am back" ({{zh|t=爸,我回來了|p=bà, wǒ huílai le|links=no}}) received a great deal of commotion since he was the first to bring up this taboo subject in Sanscript music.<ref name="aiyo">{{cite news |url=http://www.mass-age.com/audio_article.php?id=1230 |title=Aiyo, Aiyo, Jay Chow 唉唷，唉唷，周杰倫 |publisher=chinatimes.com, Mass-age | date=28 February 2007 | access-date = 2 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011210/http://www.mass-age.com/audio_article.php?id=1230 |archive-date = 27 September 2007}}</ref>

Chou's parents divorced when he was 14 years old. According to Jay's accounts of his childhood in interviews, his father had subjected his mother to daily verbal and physical abuse, often witnessed by traumatized young Jay. Once grown and starting to realize fame among southeast Asian singers, his difficult childhood experiences influenced the young artist's penning of songs like "In the Name of Father" detailing the cruelty and brutality of the domestic violence he'd witnessed at his father's hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.shs.edu.tw/works/essay/2010/03/2010033008400260.pdf|title = Jay Chou's mocking lyric for his dad|date = 30 March 2010|access-date = 4 September 2015|website = 爸，我回來了─從周杰倫的歌曲探討社會上家暴的問題|last = Hsu (許)|first = Yuan-chen(元誠)|archive-date = 24 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924101607/http://www.shs.edu.tw/works/essay/2010/03/2010033008400260.pdf|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Chinese cultural elements ===
{{Main|Zhongguo feng}}  
Chou leads a new trend of music which combines western musical elements and Chinese literature terms. Because of this unique combination, he makes distinction between himself and other musicians by leading a "[[Zhongguo feng]]"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08949468.2011.525492|title=Blowing in the China Wind: Engagements with Chineseness in Hong Kong's ''Zhongguofeng'' ''Music'' Videos|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=24|pages=59–76|year=2010|last1=Chow|first1=Yiu Fai|last2=De Kloet|first2=Jeroen|issue=1–2|s2cid=145521590}}</ref> in Asian music history. The success of his Western-Chinese musical combination is built on his marketing strategies and the musical elements involved in his works.

In early 21st century, the People's Republic of China was in an economic transition model. The new generation was looking for a consumption pop culture which would reflect individual uniqueness in the social circumstance.<ref name="journals1.scholarsportal.info">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1353/amu.2007.0047|title=Western Style, Chinese Pop: Jay Chou's Rap and Hip-Hop in China|journal=Asian Music|volume=39|pages=69–80|year=2007|last1=Fung|first1=Anthony Y. H.|s2cid=191532050}}</ref>

Jay has successfully generated airtime on CCTV by fitting in with the mainland's political and cultural agenda and celebrating traditional Chinese values.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gorfinkel|first1=Lauren|title=Ideology and the Performance of Chineseness: Hong Kong Singers on the CCTV Stage|pages=107–128}}</ref>

The traditional Chinese cultural elements involved in Chou's music contribute to his status in Asian popular music culture. The blowing "Chinese style" 中國風 in his music leads a new trend of Chinese pop music which involves a vast amount of traditional Chinese components, rather than simply following Western music format. Chou's Zhongguo feng is highlighted in his lyrics and the use of traditional musical instruments in his music. Lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] has worked with Jay Chou since 2000. Fang's work is featured by addressing Chinese traditional elements, such as poetry and [[Confucianism]]. His representative work "Chrysanthemum Terrace" ({{zh|links=no|c=菊花台|p=juhua tai}}), released in 2006, shows a vast amount of cultural elements. In this work, Fang puts images which indicate certain traditional ideas to build an ancient monarchy setting. He uses [[chrysanthemum]] as a metaphor of love. In the line "Chrysanthemums broken, scattered across the floor, your smile has faded" ({{zh|links=no|c= 菊花殘 滿地傷 你的笑容已泛黃}}),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/Taiwan-Jay-Chou/aa3d8a884eab8a9af6f0b70dffa28a57?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&current=3&orderBy=Relevance&hits=41&referrer=search&search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26startd%3D%26endd%3D%26orderBy%3DRelevance%26from%3D1%26allFilters%3DMusic%253ASubject%252CSINGERS%253AKeyword%252CTaiwan%253ALocations&allFilters=Music%3ASubject%2CSINGERS%3AKeyword%2CTaiwan%3ALocations&productType=IncludedProducts&page=1&b=a28a57 | title = Jay Chou on his new album, new look, and Korean pop music | date = 24 January 2013 | access-date = 14 April 2015 | publisher = AP Archive | archive-date = 23 September 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174421/http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/Taiwan-Jay-Chou/aa3d8a884eab8a9af6f0b70dffa28a57?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&current=3&orderBy=Relevance&hits=41&referrer=search&search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26startd%3D%26endd%3D%26orderBy%3DRelevance%26from%3D1%26allFilters%3DMusic%253ASubject%252CSINGERS%253AKeyword%252CTaiwan%253ALocations&allFilters=Music%3ASubject%2CSINGERS%3AKeyword%2CTaiwan%3ALocations&productType=IncludedProducts&page=1&b=a28a57 | url-status = live }}</ref> as well with "Blue and White Porcelain" and "Orchid Pavilion".

He performs in a rhythm and blues style, but within this western form, he has inserted Chinese melodies, themes, and rhythms. His song Dong Feng Po (东风破) (East Wind, 2003) features a typical Chinese melody performed in R&B style; its instrumentation also creates a Chinese atmosphere with [[Pipa|the pipa (琵琶)]]. In the lyrics, Jay expresses sadness and loneliness subtly, similar to traditional Chinese poetry.<ref>Fung, A. "Western style, Chinese pop: Jay chou's rap and hip-hop in China". ''Asian Music, 39''(1), 69-80. 2008</ref>

Chou also uses traditional musical instruments, combining traditional Chinese elements of music with Western pop.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Movie career ==
Chou formally entered the film industry in 2005 with the release of the movie ''[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]'' (頭文字Ｄ). He has since acted in three other movies, directed one film and more than a dozen music videos. Chou, who once said "I live because of music",<ref name="gddm109">{{cite book | last = Chou | first = Jay | title = Grandeur de D Major | publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu |date=December 2004 | page = 109  | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 |language=zh}}</ref> ventured into movies because he felt the need for a new challenge. As fans have grown concerned that movies will compromise his music career, Chou has repeatedly reassured that movies are a source of inspiration and not a distraction; at the same time, he realizes the need to balance both careers and maintain his place in the music field to garner the continued support of fans.<ref name="directorsroad">{{cite web | url = http://ol.mingpao.com/cfm/star5.cfm?File=20070107/saa01/mak1.txt | title = Jay Chou on the director's road周杰倫攻陷導演路 | date = 7 January 2007 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = Mingpao | language = zh | archive-date = 4 May 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504231853/http://ol.mingpao.com/cfm/star5.cfm?File=20070107%2Fsaa01%2Fmak1.txt | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="movietomusic">{{cite news | url = http://music.yule.sohu.com/20070329/n249054788.shtml | title = Plans to slowly distance from movies and "other occupations"/ Jay Chou will return to music 規划逐漸遠离電影等"副業" 周杰倫要回歸音樂 | date = 29 March 2007 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = /Sohu | language = zh | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720190627/http://music.yule.sohu.com/20070329/n249054788.shtml | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="invincible">{{cite web | url = http://ent.tom.com/2006-12-14/0016/32559464.html | title = The invincible Jay Chou: it's good to be number one | date = 14 December 2006 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = ent.tom.com | language = zh | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321075201/http://ent.tom.com/2006-12-14/0016/32559464.html | archive-date = 21 March 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

=== Directing ===
[[File:Jay Chou in 2007 at Shanghai Film Festival.jpg|thumb|Chou at the 2007 [[Shanghai Film Festival]]]]
Chou acquired his first directing experience in 2004 through music videos. He initially experimented with a song by the group [[Nan Quan Mama]] titled "Home" ({{zh|c=家|p=jiā|links=no}}) where he was involved throughout the entire process from research to editing. After learning the difficulties of being a director, he refused to direct again even at the request of his record company.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book | last = Chou | first = Jay | title = Grandeur de D Major | publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu |date=December 2004 | page = 106  | isbn = 957-29371-4-6|language=zh}}</ref> However, his interest resurfaced again as he directed music videos for 4 of the 12 songs in own album ''[[November's Chopin]]'' in 2005,<ref name="huoyuanchiaep">Huo Yuan Chia.

== Other works ==

=== Book: ''Grandeur de D Major''===
Chou published his first book titled ''Grandeur de D Major'' ({{zh|t=D調的華麗|s=D调的华丽|p=D diào de huálì|links=no}}) on 25 November 2004.{{Ref label|J|j|none}} This 200-page book features a prologue written by his family, friends, and co-workers; the main section is a compilation of his personal attitudes, philosophies, and recollections of childhood experiences along with pictures from his music videos, many of which have never been released; and lastly, a list of the artist's major awards, musical and lyrical compositions, and discography. For the usually low-profile singer, this book revealed his personality and convictions that has served as the basis of his musical and public image. He demonstrated a strong appreciation of family values with an especially deep connection with his mother and maternal grandmother. His confidence and dedication towards music is evident as he dedicated 2 out of 7 chapters to music: the current state of the industry, his composition methodology, and the importance of individualism to his success in music. This pride is contrasted against his modesty and self-assessed naïveté about many aspects in life, particularly regarding relationships and marriage.

=== J Gaming ===
In 2016, Jay Chou bought the [[eSports]] ([[League of Legends]]) team Taipei Assassins and renamed it [[J Gaming]]. Chou only serves as an investor and owner, and despite holding the title of a 'captain/leader', he will only play in celebrity matches, and would not involve in the day-to-day operating and coaching of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.techinasia.com/taiwanese-megastar-jay-chou-bought-league-legends-team|title= Why Chinese megastar Jay Chou just bought a League of Legends team|author= C.

In 2017, Jay Chou spent about 18 million RMB to build a Jay eSports building in 深圳 Shenzhen, which provided updated computer devices and the streaming areas for eSports players in China. More importantly, Jay decides to hold more and more eSports events in the Jay eSports building, which is helpful for the development of eSport industry in China.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://topick.hket.com/article/1848936/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB%E7%B5%84%E6%88%90%E3%80%8CJ%E6%88%B0%E9%9A%8A%E3%80%8D%E3%80%80%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%871,800%E8%90%AC%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E9%96%8B%E9%9B%BB%E7%AB%B6%E9%A4%A8%E3%80%80| title=周杰倫組成「J戰隊」 投資1,800萬深圳開電競館| trans-title=Jay Chou formed "J Team" to invest 18 million in Shenzhen| date=3 July 2017| access-date=15 September 2018| archive-date=15 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915122119/https://topick.hket.com/article/1848936/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB%E7%B5%84%E6%88%90%E3%80%8CJ%E6%88%B0%E9%9A%8A%E3%80%8D%E3%80%80%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%871%2C800%E8%90%AC%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E9%96%8B%E9%9B%BB%E7%AB%B6%E9%A4%A8%E3%80%80| url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Response to the news media and paparazzi ===
As with other stars, Chou has expressed a strong dislike of the [[paparazzi]]. In the early years of his career, unwanted attention by the media was usually dealt with by avoidance. In-line with his quiet nature, he frequently wore baseball caps and hoods while lowering his head and evading eye contact during interviews.<ref name="allhailjay" /> In recent years however, he has been less passive about the invasion of his privacy. To discourage the paparazzi from taking unsolicited pictures, Chou is known to photograph the paparazzi that follow him.<ref name="confrontation">{{cite news |url=http://www.singtao.com/index_archive.asp?d_str=20051223&htmlpage=main&news=1223fo01.html |title=Jay Chou and the paparazzi in a direct confrontation 周杰倫與狗仔隊打埋身戰 |publisher=Singtao Daily (Hong Kong) |date=23 December 2005 |access-date=2 June 2007 |language=zh |archive-date=26 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225519/http://www.singtao.com/index_archive.asp?d_str=20051223&htmlpage=main&news=1223fo01.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He openly calls the paparazzi "dogs" and tabloids "dog magazines", as shown in his lyrics for ''Besieged From All Sides'' ({{zh|c=四面楚歌|p=sìmiànchǔgē|links=no}}).

=== Fanbase ===
[[File:Jay Chou wax figure in Hongkong's Madame Tussauds museum.jpg|thumb|Chou's wax statue at [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]]]]
It is difficult to estimate the size and global spread of Chou's fanbase. Jay's fanbase originated from [[Taiwan]] and grew extensively to other Mandarin-speaking regions. The Chinese-speaking populations of China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Malaysia make up a significant percentage of Chou's fans. Despite rampant [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] issues in this region of Asia, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed 2 million sales. According to [[Baidu]], the most popular internet search engine in China, Chou is the number one searched male artist in 2002, 05, 06 and 07.<ref name="baidu2002">[http://www.baidu.com/2002/ Baidu's Top Searches 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116080456/http://www.baidu.com/2002/ |date=16 January 2011 }} {{in lang|zh}}</ref><ref name="baidu2005">[http://www.baidu.com/2005/ Baidu's Top Searches 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116140046/http://www.baidu.com/2005/ |date=16 January 2011 }} {{in lang|zh}}</ref><ref name="baidu2006">[http://www.baidu.com/2006/ Baidu's Top Searches 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116080457/http://www.baidu.com/2006/ |date=16 January 2011 }} {{in lang|zh}}</ref><ref name="baidu2007">[http://www.baidu.com/2007/ Baidu's Top Searches 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116080502/http://www.baidu.com/2007/ |date=16 January 2011 }} {{in lang|zh}}</ref>

Currently, Chou remains largely unknown outside of Asia, except in cities with large Chinese speaking immigrant populations such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, [[Seattle]], Vancouver, [[Toronto]], Sydney, Melbourne, [[Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane]]. He has held concerts in major venues such as the [[Acer Arena]] (Sydney – 3 July 2009), [[HP Pavilion at San Jose]] (San Jose – 31 December 2010), [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] (Los Angeles – 8 January 2011), [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] (Las Vegas – 25 December 2002), [[Rogers Arena]] (Vancouver – 23 December 2010),<ref name="Time" /> [[Shrine Auditorium]] (Los Angeles – 18 December 2004),<ref name="2005shrine">{{cite news | last = Quah | first = Junie | url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | title = Jay Chou in LA: An Incomparable Breakthrough | date = 2 March 2005 | access-date = 2 June 2007 | publisher = UCLA Asia Institute | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218175742/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | archive-date = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Galen Center]] (Los Angeles – 24 December 2007), the [[Air Canada Centre]] (Toronto – 18 December 2008) and [[Wembley Arena]] (London – 17–18 March 2017). His intention to increase his prominence in the Western world beyond Chinese audiences is clear. In 2006, Chou composed and sang the theme song for ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'', a movie released in major theatres in most English-speaking countries,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/1/2006/0111/61386.html |title=Jay Chou pens theme song for new Jet Li movie 'Fearless' |agency=Associated Press |date=1 November 2006 |access-date=2 June 2007 |archive-date=15 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615050350/http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/1/2006/0111/61386.html |url-status=live }}</ref> though the impact to his fame has been minimal. His role in ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (limited release) marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story's plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress. Although Chou is still far from being well known to English audiences, this movie has brought him international exposure. Chou gained further exposure to western audiences in his starring role as crimefighter [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] in January 2011's ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]''.

== Personal life ==
Chou was rumored to have a relationship with Taiwanese singer [[Jolin Tsai]] with the former being featured on Tsai’s song "Can't Speak Clearly", which appeared on her fourth studio album ''[[Lucky Number (album)|Lucky Number]]'' (2001).<ref name=":60">{{Cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.tw/books/leisure/barticle/14583.html|title=愛就是這樣：周杰倫和蔡依林的恩怨情仇-閱讀-新浪新聞中心|website=news.sina.com.tw|access-date=2016-12-19|archive-date=16 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516035818/https://news.sina.com.tw/books/leisure/barticle/14583.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2001, Tsai and Chou were first spotted dining at an [[izakaya]] in [[Shinjuku]], Japan.<ref name=":60" /> Although they did not admit to their relationship, their romance was an open secret in those years.<ref name=":61">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lollipop.sg/newsroom/truth-behind-jay-chous-love-triangle-jolin-tsai-and-patty-hou-revealed-after-years|title=Truth behind Jay Chou's love triangle with Jolin Tsai and Patty Hou revealed after years - The Newsroom - Lollipop|date=2016-08-08|newspaper=STOMP|access-date=2016-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205171445/http://www.lollipop.sg/newsroom/truth-behind-jay-chous-love-triangle-jolin-tsai-and-patty-hou-revealed-after-years|archive-date=February 5, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in February 2005, Chou was spotted shopping intimately with Taiwanese news presenter [[Patty Hou]] in [[Shibuya]], Japan.<ref name=":61" /> After that, Tsai deliberately avoided meeting Chou and Hou during public events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asianpopnews.com/jolin-tsai-reveals-reason-behind-her-split-with-jay-chou/|title=Jolin Tsai reveals reason behind her split with Jay Chou {{!}} Asianpopnews|website=asianpopnews.com|access-date=2016-12-19|archive-date=15 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515063215/http://asianpopnews.com/jolin-tsai-reveals-reason-behind-her-split-with-jay-chou/|url-status=live}}</ref> In June 2010, Tsai and Chou finally made amends, and Tsai appeared as a special guest at Chou's concert in Taipei, which shocked the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100618-222771.html|title=Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai back in business|website=news.asiaone.com|access-date=2016-12-19|archive-date=23 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223183715/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100618-222771.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In July 2013, when being interviewed by Taiwanese TV host [[Tao Ching-Ying|Matilda Tao]], for the first time, Tsai admitted she used to be in love with Chou, and that she broke up with him after he cheated on her.<ref name=":62">{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinatopix.com/articles/767/20130731/jolin-tsai-admits-broke-up-jay-chou.htm|title=Jolin Tsai admits she broke up with Jay Chou because he cheated on her|last=Zhao|first=Angie|date=2013-07-31|newspaper=Chinatopix|access-date=2016-12-19|archive-date=16 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516154207/http://www.chinatopix.com/articles/767/20130731/jolin-tsai-admits-broke-up-jay-chou.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>
