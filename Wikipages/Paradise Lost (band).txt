Their line-up has remained stable for such a long-standing [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, consisting of singer [[Nick Holmes]], guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy, and bassist Steve Edmondson. Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal [[composers]], with almost all of the band's songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers.

== History ==
=== Early years and Peaceville Records (1988–1991) ===
After their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, ''Paradise Lost'', ''Frozen Illusion'', and ''Plains of Desolation'', before being signed to [[Peaceville Records]] in 1989. They recorded their debut album, [[Lost Paradise (album)|''Lost Paradise'']], at Academy Music Studio in December of that year. The album was released in February 1990.<ref name=allmusicBio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13905|pure_url=yes}} Paradise Lost Biography, at allmusic.com]</ref>

In November 1990, Paradise Lost returned to Academy Music Studio to record their second album, ''[[Gothic (Paradise Lost album)|Gothic]]'', which was released in March 1991. The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments.<ref name=AllmusicGothic>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost – Gothic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gothic-mw0000096112|website=Allmusic|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref>

=== Music for Nations (1992–1998) ===
[[File:Paradiselost91.JPG|thumb|left|Paradise Lost performing live, 1991]]
Paradise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the [[Music for Nations]] label and released ''[[Shades of God]]'' in July 1992.<ref name=allmusicBio /> The band's musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song's compositions, the softening of vocalist [[Nick Holmes (singer)|Nick Holmes]]'s [[death grunt]], and Gregor Mackintosh's incorporation of [[acoustic guitar]] to his sound.<ref name=allmusicShades>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost – Shades of God review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shades-of-god-mw0000107277|website=Allmusic|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref> The album contained the song "As I Die", later released as a [[As I Die|single/EP]].

In summer 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, ''[[Icon (Paradise Lost album)|Icon]],'' released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of "As I Die" from their previous album. On ''Icon'', Nick Holmes abandoned his death grunt and started using a "[[James Hetfield]]-style bark".<ref name=allmusicIcon>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Christopher|title=Paradise Lost – Icon review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/icon-mw0000107875|website=Allmusic|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref> It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer [[Lee Morris (musician)|Lee Morris]].

The band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, ''[[Draconian Times]]'', which was released in June 1995. Mackintosh says about ''Draconian Times'', "that it's the album by which everything else we do gets judged. Rightly so, as it's the backbone of our career and sound."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/09/01/rank-defile-greg-mackintosh-orders-paradise-losts-records/|title=Rank and Defile: Greg Mackintosh Orders Paradise Lost's Records {{!}} Decibel Magazine|date=1 September 2017|work=Decibel Magazine|access-date=22 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The album charted in the Top 20 album chart in a number of countries including the UK and Germany.

Following the success of Draconian Times, and after four years of continuous touring, the band began to get bored with their signature sound and started to experiment with [[Depeche Mode]]-esque [[synth-pop]] and [[electronica]].<ref name=base>{{cite web|url=http://basementbar.com/DefaultN1.asp?GoTo=CurrSelN1.asp?ID=2860&Page=Archive |title=Transcending the Mundane: Metal at its Best! |website=Basementbar.com |access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref> This new direction shaped their next album ''[[One Second (Paradise Lost album)|One Second]],'' released in 1997, and was most epitomised by the lead single, "[[Say Just Words]]". The album was one of the band's most successful releases, particularly in Northern Europe, cracking the German, Swedish, and Finnish top ten charts.<ref name=GermanCharts>{{cite web|title=German charts|url=http://www.officialcharts.de/album.asp?artist=Paradise+Lost&title=One+Second&cat=a&country=de|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=SwedishCharts>{{cite web|title=Swedish charts|url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Paradise+Lost&titel=One+Second&cat=a|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=FinnishCharts>{{cite web|title=Finnish charts|url=http://www.ifpi.fi/tilastot/virallinen-lista/artistit/Paradise+Lost/One+Second|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref>

=== EMI (1999–2001) ===
The band moved to [[EMI]] Electrola in Germany for its next album, ''[[Host (Paradise Lost album)|Host]]'', released in 1999, on which they continued to experiment with new sounds, appearing to shed their [[Heavy metal music|metal]] roots.<ref name=allmusicHost>{{cite web|last1=Ravelin|first1=Antti|title=Paradise Lost – Host review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/host-mw0000470698|website=Allmusic|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref> While this album continued to alienate their traditional fanbase in places like the UK, it was their highest charting album in Germany, entering at number 4 on the Album Chart.

On the next album, 2001's ''[[Believe in Nothing]]'', Paradise Lost continued this synth direction but adding rock elements to the music, forcibly by EMI at the time. Due to the loss of creative control, Mackintosh said that the album "doesn't really exist for him".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paradise-lost-frontman-believe-in-nothing-represented-a-really-dark-time-in-my-life|title=PARADISE LOST Frontman: 'Believe In Nothing' Represented A Really Dark Time In My Life |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |author=Justin Donnelly|date=27 September 2007 |access-date=18 August 2013}}</ref>

=== GUN Records (2002–2005) ===
In May 2002, the band signed to [[GUN Records]], and on the album that followed, ''Symbol of Life'', the metallic roots of the band began to resurface;<ref name=allmusicSymbol>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost – Symbol of Life review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/symbol-of-life-mw0000225106|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref> the band decided to work with producer [[Rhys Fulber]] to reestablish their metal sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wllwAjKfwA|title=RHYS FULBER – Behind The Scenes of 5 Albums That Define His Producing Career &#124; Metal Injection|access-date=20 July 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The album included guest musicians [[Devin Townsend]], [[Jamie Muhoberac]], and [[Lee Dorrian]].<ref name=allmusicSymbolCredits>{{cite web|title=Symbol of Life credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/symbol-of-life-mw0000225106/credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 February 2015}}</ref>

In March 2004, [[Lee Morris (musician)|Lee Morris]] left the band due to "personal and musical differences"<ref name="Blabbermouth (a)">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=20286|title=PARADISE LOST Part Ways With Drummer LEE MORRIS|date=12 March 2004|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Jeff Singer]].

Paradise Lost released their tenth, eponymous album in 2005, also on GUN Records.

=== Century Media (2006–2016) ===
[[File:Paradise Lost - Kavarna Rock Fest 2011 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Paradise Lost at [[Kavarna Rock Fest]] in Bulgaria in 2011]]

The eleventh album, ''In Requiem'', was released in the spring of 2007 on [[Century Media]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=91|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310162356/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=91|url-status=dead|title=Paradise Lost on Century Media Records|archive-date=10 March 2008}}</ref> it was generally well-accepted and highly rated by both critics and fans, pleased to see the band returning to their heavier, gothic metal sound similar to that of earlier albums like ''Draconian Times''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blackie |first=Andrew |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/42122/paradise-lost-in-requiem/ |title=Paradise Lost: In Requiem < Music |website=Popmatters.com |access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref> The full-length was preceded by a single, "The Enemy" and on the single, Singer was finally listed as a permanent band member. In a recent video interview, Mackintosh and Holmes revealed that Singer had already auditioned for the band when Archer left, but they chose Morris instead because Singer "had a pink drumkit".<ref>[http://194.242.113.241/rockmetal000/emission.htm Prod vidéo metal et production indépendante<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021091832/http://194.242.113.241/rockmetal000/emission.htm |date=21 October 2007 }}</ref>

In November 2007, Century Media released the DVD ''Over The Madness'', which documents the impact Paradise Lost has had on [[gothic metal]] and provides insight into the mindset and workings of Paradise Lost. Disc 2 includes further interviews, rehearsal footage, plus backstage and memorabilia sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27017_0_2_0_C |title=Double doc.

On 13 August 2008, drummer [[Jeff Singer]] announced his departure from the band on the Paradise Lost official website. He wanted to be with his family, had an upcoming job, and the then-upcoming South American tour would interfere with that. As a result, Paradise Lost had to cancel the South American tour dates that they had planned.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=102734 Paradise Lost Drummer Quits; South American Tour Cancelled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306112225/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=102734 |date=6 March 2010 }} blabbermouth.net. 13 August 2008.</ref> Soon after, on 28 August 2008, the Paradise Lost official website announced that the canceled South American tour has been reconfirmed<ref>[https://archive.today/20120907183759/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=104369 Paradise Lost Not Cancelling South American Tour] blabbermouth.net. 9 September 2008.</ref> and that [[Mark Heron]] from [[Oceansize]] would take over on drums.

At the beginning of 2009, Paradise Lost recorded an album with producer [[Jens Bogren]] at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden. At the time there was no full-time replacement for Jeff Singer and drums were played by Swedish drummer Peter Damin.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120912032922/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=114034 Paradise Lost Begins Recording New Album; Video Available] blabbermouth.net. 9 February 2009.</ref> On 16 March 2009, when recording for the album was already finished, the band recruited [[Adrian Erlandsson]] ([[At the Gates]], ex-[[Cradle of Filth]]) as a full-time drummer for the band.<ref>[http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=43152 Ex-Cradle Of Filth Drummer Adrian Erlandsson Joins Paradise Lost] metalunderground.com. 16 March 2009.</ref>

The album was released on 23 April 2012.<ref>[http://www.paradiselost.co.uk/news/2011/paradise-lost-new-album-tragic-idol.html Paradise Lost Announce New Album for 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130032801/http://www.paradiselost.co.uk/news/2011/paradise-lost-new-album-tragic-idol.html |date=30 November 2011 }} paradiselost.co.uk. 28 November 2011.</ref>{{update after|2012|04|23}}. Adrian Erlandsson was unable to play a few live shows for this album so the band got Jeff Singer again to fill in.

Paradise Lost performed some of their songs at the ''Metal Hammer Golden Gods'' awards with [[Cristina Scabbia]] on Paradise Lost's song "[[Say Just Words]]" and with [[Gus G.]] of a [[Black Sabbath]] cover, "[[Into the Void (Black Sabbath song)|Into the Void]]".
