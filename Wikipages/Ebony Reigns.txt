Her assistant and longtime friend Franklina Yaa Nkansah Kuri and soldier Atsu Vondee were also killed in the fatal accident.

Her final funeral rites were held at the forecourt of the [[State (polity)|state]] house, [[Accra]], and she was buried at [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] [[cemetery]] on [[Saturday]], March 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://yen.com.gh/amp/107924-7-crucial-facts-ebonys-burial-know.html|title=7 crucial facts about Ebony's burial you should know today|last=Mensah|first=Jeffrey|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}</ref> In preparation for the funeral, the late Ebony's family received a lot of donations from prominent personalities, [[government]] and private institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/Top-donors-of-late-Ebony-Reign-s-funeral-638616|title=Top donors of late Ebony Reign's funeral|website=www.ghanaweb.com|date=29 March 2018|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> Some of the top donors at the funeral were:

==Controversies surrounding her death==
After Ebony Reigns died, controversies became rampant and the [[nation]] was divided into many passive factions. There were those that believed that it could have been prevented if roads were properly constructed and adequately lighted. Apparently, the [[Mankranso]] road she was traveling on that fateful night was in a very bad state<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/politics/ahafo-ano-south-to-make-mankranso-commercial-hub.html|title=Ahafo Ano South to make Mankranso commercial hub|last=Kyei-Boateng|first=Joseph|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}</ref> and to some critics, that influenced the accident. Others believe her death is an [[Act of God]] and that though it was harsh, it could not have been prevented.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adomonline.com/ghana-news/hot-audio-ebonys-death-act-god-ken-agyapong/|title=HOT VIDEO: Ebony's death an Act of God – Ken Agyapong|last=Abedu-Kennedy|first=Dorcas|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}</ref> Still, others attribute her death to what they consider her racy lifestyle and several pastors came out after her death to say that they had prophesied that Ebony [[reign]]s would die if she didn't change her "lifestyle".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/These-pastors-predicted-Ebony-s-death-625022|title=These pastors predicted Ebony's death|last=Web|first=Ghana|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}</ref>

Dr. Lawrence Tetteh, a renowned pastor in [[Ghana]], also spoke about how some musicians and businesses were taking advantage of Ebony Reigns' death to make profits.<ref name="dailyguideafrica.com">{{Cite web|url=http://dailyguideafrica.com/i-spent-more-on-ebonys-funeral-dr-lawrence-tetteh/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329070041/http://dailyguideafrica.com/i-spent-more-on-ebonys-funeral-dr-lawrence-tetteh/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=March 29, 2018|title=I Spent More On Ebony's Funeral – Dr Lawrence Tetteh - Daily Guide Africa|website=dailyguideafrica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> [[Ghana]] [[Textile]] Printing Limited (GTP), for example, is set to manufacture newly customized cloths with some of Ebony’s songs such as 'Aseda' and 'Maame Hw3’ for naming ceremonies and funerals, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/GTP-to-produce-customized-cloths-with-Ebony-s-songs-631054|title=GTP to produce customized cloths with Ebony's songs|website=www.ghanaweb.com|date=2 March 2018|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> He insisted that he spent more money on the funeral than anyone and did not appreciate the fact that some companies were making money from her death.<ref name="dailyguideafrica.com"/> This sparked a lot of controversy because some people believed that his comments were not necessary as a pastor and took to social media to express their views. Ebony's death also raised all forms of prophecies concerning deaths of other artists, a typical example is Shatta Wale, known to be Ghana's number one dancehall artist. A pastor revealed Shatta Wale was going to die before the 25th of December 2018, but added, something can be made to stop it. Fans who believed in Ebony's prophecies wished the dancehall king not to die but the artist posted videos on social media threatening to burn churches if he lives after the said date. As to relate Ebony's death to the prophecies or to consider it a normal accident is unknown, each and everyone has the right to believe in what his/her heart directed him/her.  <ref name="dailyguideafrica.com"/>

==Aftermath==
After Ebony Reigns died, some celebrities in Ghana, [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] and [[Stonebwoy]] started road safety campaigns to reduce the number of [[accident]]s on the roads. On the exact one year after her death, most Ghanaians showed love and concern for the musical artist by posting condolences and pictures of her on social media.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://citifmonline.com/2018/03/27/ebonys-death-stonebwoy-embark-road-safety-campaign/|title=Ebony's death: Stonebwoy to embark on road safety campaign - citifmonline.com|date=2018-03-27|work=citifmonline.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] has released a song titled ‘Wake Up Call’ to address some causes of road accidents and what to do to reduce them.
