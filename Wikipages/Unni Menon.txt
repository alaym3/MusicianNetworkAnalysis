==Career==

Unni Menon is basically a Malayalam film playback singer. Kunjunni, a violinist for music director Ilaiyaraaja introduced him to [[B. A. Chidambaranath]], a music director, and Unni's musical career was launched in 1981–82. His maiden song "Amudhum Thenum" was never released, but with "Pon maane kobam eno" he became a noted singer in 1984.<ref name="Fact"/> He was a track singer and after listening to his tracks for the film, ''Kadathu'', KJ Yesudas asked to the music director, Shyam, to make it straight.  And after the huge success of the ''Kadathu'' songs ("Olangal Thaalam Thullumbol", "Punnaare Poonthinkale", etc.), Unni became a regular singer for the hit music director, Shyam. Shyam has given him a good number of popular songs like "Maanathe Hoori Pole" (''Ee Naadu''), "Valakilukkam Oru Valakilukkam" (''Munnettam''), "Kaayampoo Korthu Tharum" (''Aarorumariyaathe'') and "Thozhuthu Madangum Sandhyayumetho" (''Aksharangal''). After Shyam's decline from the film music field, Unni's career in Malayalam film musicdom also went into shades.  During that period, he has given some hit private albums such as ''Raagageethi'' and ''Raaga Lahari'', with his contemporary playback singer, Ashalatha.''Paanchajanyam'' an Hindu devotional audio album on Lord Guruvayurappan brought him a lot of fame in the Malayalam audio world.

Unni Menon moved to [[Chennai]] (then Madras) where he had a job in the Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi. Many of the prominent recording studios of South India were located in Chennai. His interest in music led him to visit these studios regularly and formed acquaintances with many prominent artists like the singer [[Yesudas|K. J. Yesudas]] and composer Ilayaraaja. Soon he had graduated from singing tracks for prominent singers and was becoming a singer sought after by many music directors.<ref name=chennaionline>[http://chennaionline.com/columns/mallu/mallu14.asp Chennai Online interview], additional text.</ref>

In 1980s he had few lone hits, "Pon maane kobam eno" in Tamil film 'Oru kaidhiyin dairy', with a nickname Vijay, singing for Ilayaraja. His career got a major boost in 1992 when A. R. Rahman offered him the song "Puthu Vellai Mazhai". That song went on to become a huge hit, as were all the other songs from the film. Since then he has sung many songs which have become big hits.

In 2003, Unni Menon added a new dimension to his career when he acted and composed music for the Malayalam film ''[[Sthithi]]'' besides singing the songs in the film.<ref name=officialsite>Official site</ref>
