He was for decades one of the most popular singer-songwriters in Italy.

==Biography==

===Early years and experimental period===
Batiiato was born in [[Giarre-Riposto|Ionia]], [[Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/franco-battiato-mn0000659277/biography|title = Franco Battiato Biography, Songs, & Albums}}</ref> After graduating from high school at the Liceo Scientifico "Archimede" in [[Acireale]], and following the death of his father (truck driver and longshoreman in New York),<ref name="de Cesco" > Andrea Federica de Cesco,  [https://www.corriere.it/pianeta2020/21_maggio_18/franco-battiato-cantore-dell-ecologismo-maestro-aveva-previsto-crisi-climatica-b92ee882-b7c6-11eb-add6-98a2b51489e2.shtml 'Franco Battiato, cantore dell’ecologismo: il Maestro aveva previsto la crisi climatica,']  [[Corriere della Sera]] 18 May 2021</ref> in 1964 he moved  first to [[Rome]], and then to [[Milan]] at age 19, and soon after won his first musical contract.

His single, "La Torre", was released and Battiato appeared on TV to perform the song. He scored some success with the romantic song ''È l'amore''. After some works as a guitarist and sound engineer for popular singers, he traveled to America for a small tour where he had considerable success. After that, Battiato met the experimental musician [[Juri Camisasca]] in 1970 and collaborated with [[:it:Osage Tribe|Osage Tribe]], an Italian psychedelic-[[progressive rock]] band. As a solo artist, he released the science-fiction single ''La convenzione'' (''The convention''), one of the finest Italian progressive rock songs of the 1970s.

Starting from 1971, Battiato devoted much of his efforts to experimental [[electronic music]], producing a series of LPs that remained almost unknown at the time, but are now eagerly sought by collectors worldwide. Starting out with electronic [[progressive rock]] with some emphasis on vocals, his music became increasingly experimental, gradually moving into the realms of [[musique concrète]] and [[minimalist music|minimalism]]. ''Fetus'', his first album,  was produced in January 1972,<ref name="de Cesco" /> followed by ''[[Pollution (album)|Pollution]]'' (1973), ''Sulle Corde di Aries'' (1973), ''[[Clic (album)|Clic]]'' (1974) and ''M.elle le “Gladiator”'' (1975).

In 1975, he moved to the [[Casa Ricordi|Dischi Ricordi]] label, producing ''Battiato'' (1977), ''Juke Box'' (1978) and the experimental ''[[:it:L'Egitto prima delle sabbie]]'' ("Egypt Before the Sands", 1978), which won the [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]] award for contemporary music. Battiato’s early research about sound represented an important innovation as the basis of the THX and Stereophonic Sound.

===National success===
[[File:F Battiato.jpg|thumb|left|Battiato in 2005]]
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:VOCPADR.jpg|thumb|''La voce del padrone'' (His Master's Voice) was the first Italian album to sell more than 1,000,000 copies, and launched Battiato as a star of the music industry.]] -->
After the Ricordi label failed to re-sign him, Battiato signed with [[EMI]]. He abandoned the progressive rock experiments of the previous years and moved to a more pop-oriented style which afforded him ever increasing popularity with Italian and worldwide audiences. In this period his albums were usually in collaboration with the renowned musician and violinist [[Giusto Pio]], whose two later albums were produced by Battiato.<ref>{{cite book|last1=La Posta|first1=Annino|title=Franco Battiato|publisher=Giunti}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After ''L'era del cinghiale bianco'' (The Era of the White Boar, 1979)  Patriots was released, and it was his first LP of the 80s.  That album was successful enough to reach the thirtieth position on the charts.  It contains a few songs which have become Battiato's classics, such as "Le Aquile" (The Eagles), and "Prospettiva Nevskij" (Nevsky Prospect).  This new era of his music marks the beginning of his collaboration with the singer [[Alice (singer)|Alice]] and the violinist [[Giusto Pio]].  His following LP was "La Voce del Padrone" (The Master's Voice).  He had even more success with this album than with "Patriots".  His compositions sound both elegant, yet easy to listen to.  This was the key to his growing fan base, of course. "La Voce del Padrone" contains many songs which became classics of Italian music.  It stayed in the number one position for six months, becoming the first Italian LP with more than one million copies sold in only a month.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Fabio|last1=Alcini|url=https://www.google.it/books/edition/Italia_d_autore/_rOXDwAAQBAJ?hl=it&gbpv=1&dq=battiato%2B1%2Bmilione%2Bcopie&pg=PT124&printsec=frontcover|title=Italia d'autore. 1965-1985: il periodo d'oro dei cantautori dal vinile al Cd|isbn=9788862316545|year=2019|language=Italian|oclc=1105723521}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Flavio|last1=Russo|url=https://www.lumsanews.it/i-75-anni-di-franco-battiato-luomo-che-invento-lelettronica-italiana/|title=I 75 anni di Franco Battiato. Il cantautore che inventò l'elettronica italiana|date=March 23, 2020|access-date=April 21, 2021|publisher=[[LUMSA University]]}}</ref> His commercial success was confirmed by ''L'arca di Noè'' (''Noah's Ark'') in 1982. Songs such as "L'era del cinghiale bianco" (1979), "Prospettiva Nevskij" (1980), "Centro di gravità permanente" ("Permanent Gravity Centrepoint", 1981), "Bandiera bianca" ("White Flag", 1981), and "Voglio vederti danzare" ("I Want To See You Dance", 1982) established Battiato in Italy. ''Orizzonti perduti'' (''Lost Horizons'', 1983) was followed by the successful ''[[Mondi Lontanissimi]]'' (''Faraway Worlds'', 1985), which featured a solo version of the popular "[[I treni di Tozeur]]" ("The Tozeur Trains)", originally a duet with Alice performed at the 1984 [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name="auto"/>

1988's ''Fisiognomica'' (''Physiognomy'') sold more than 300,000 copies and it confirmed Battiato's success. The album, considered by Battiato himself his best work for the balance between music and lyrics, contained the hit "Nomadi" ("Nomads"), originally recorded by Alice and written by his old friend [[Juri Camisasca]], who in the meantime had retired to a [[Benedictine monastery]]. The album also included the songs "E ti vengo a cercare", which was performed by director/actor [[Nanni Moretti]] in his 1989 movie ''Palombella Rossa'', and "Veni l'autunnu" with lyrics entirely in the [[Sicilian dialect|Sicilian]] and [[Arabic]] languages. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} 
In 2013 he signed a publishing deal with [[Roberto Mancinelli (A&R)|Roberto Mancinelli]] and [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockol.it/news-488321/franco-battiato-firma-contratto-amministrazione-editoriale-sony-atv|title=√ Franco Battiato firma un contratto di amministrazione editoriale con Sony/Atv|first=Rockol.com|last=s.r.l.}}</ref>

===Collaboration with Manlio Sgalambro===
In 1994 Battiato began to collaborate with the Sicilian philosopher [[Manlio Sgalambro]], who was to write almost all the lyrics of his following albums. After the tentative ''L'ombrello e la macchina da cucire'' of 1995, in 1996 the duo published what is considered their best work so far, ''L'imboscata'', containing the romantic hit "La cura" ("The care"), elected best Italian song of the year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=La Posta|first1=Annino|title=Franco Battiato. Soprattutto il silenzio.|date=2010|publisher=[[Giunti Editore|Giunti]]|isbn=9788809742536|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uQf4eewxJoC&q=la+cura+canzone+dell%27anno&pg=PA223|access-date=19 December 2015|language=it}}</ref> ''[[Gommalacca]]'' (1998, with an unusual stress on hard rock), ''Ferro battuto'' (2000) and ''Dieci stratagemmi'' (2004) continued on the same path, with variations mainly set by Battiato's unceasing desire for musical experimentation. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2003 Battiato released his first feature film, ''Perduto amor'' (Lost love), for which he also composed the soundtrack. The movie won the [[Nastro d'Argento for Best New Director|Silver Ribbon for the best debutant director]] and was screened, out of competition as a Battiato request, with excellent critics in prestigious film festivals like Berlin, Cannes, Venezia, New York among others. His following movie was, ''Musikanten'', an experimental work about [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s last four years of life. The German musician was played by the Chilean director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. In November 2012, Maestro Battiato accepted an offer from newly elected Sicilian regional president [[Rosario Crocetta]] to become the new Regional Minister for Tourism and Culture, announcing he will not take any compensation for the job, but was subsequently fired soon after his controversial claim that there were "troie in Parlamento" (whores within Parliament). {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Later career and death===
Ten years later he issued ''Fleurs 1'', ''Fleurs 3'', and ''Fleurs 2'', one after the other, in that specific order. They included covers of songs originally recorded by very famous Italian singers and singers-songwriters, as well as covers of French and English songs, plus three new songs. He went on releasing his music, always on a thin border between pop, rock and electronics, until 2010. He toured with Alice for the whole of 2016, but in 2017 he held his last concert in Catania. He would have continued his work, but he had to give up for health reasons. At the end of 2019, his manager announced his definitive retirement from the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.fanpage.it/franco-battiato-si-ritira-definitivamente-ma-il-manager-conferma-lesistenza-di-un-altro-inedito/|title=Franco Battiato si ritira definitivamente, ma il manager conferma l'esistenza di un altro inedito|website=Music Fanpage}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/musica/13516152/franco-battiato-salute-dramma-ultima-canzone-inedita-testamento-musicale-cassetto-vuoto.html|title=Franco Battiato, l'ultima canzone della sua carriera: "Non sta abbastanza bene", voci drammatiche|website=www.liberoquotidiano.it}}</ref> 

Battiato was [[vegetarian]]<ref>[ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/06/25/battiato-una-scelta-di-vita-aiuta-il.html]</ref> and was a follower of the ideas of [[ecumenism]] and [[polytheism]].<ref>[https://pierluigipiccini.it/franco-battiato-dalla-mia-crisi-a-gurdjieff/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2021}}</ref>

Battiato died on 18 May 2021, at his home in [[Milo, Catania]], surrounded by rumours about a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disease]], [[osteoporosis]] or [[cancer]]. The real cause of death remains as a secret in order to respect Battiato’s last request and family petition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Online|first=Redazione|date=2021-05-18|title=È morto Franco Battiato|url=https://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/21_maggio_18/franco-battiato-morto-243321f2-b79f-11eb-add6-98a2b51489e2.shtml|access-date=2021-05-18|website=Corriere della Sera|language=it}}</ref>
