'''Vince Vance & the Valiants''' are an American [[country pop]], [[rock and roll]] and [[novelty music]]al group from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]. The title character Vince Vance is portrayed by Andy Stone, the only permanent member of the group. He was born Andrew John Franichevich Jr. The remainder of the Valiants (or, if female, Valiantettes) are rotating musicians.

The group's most sustained hit record, and one that is uncharacteristic of their usual stylings, is the country ballad "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You (Vince Vance & The Valiants song)|All I Want for Christmas Is You]]",<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic |class=artist |id=p143612 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Vince Vance biography |last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=29 September 2010}}</ref> which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts on six separate occasions in the 1990s. As a novelty band, their best-known record was their 1980 version of the parody song "[[Bomb Iran]]", which [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|narrowly missed]] the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1981.<ref>[http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/09/vince_vance_looks_back_at_40_y.html Vince Vance looks back at 40 colorful years with the Valiants], Nola.com</ref>

Vince is famous for his ability to play multiple instruments, and his intense demand of his fellow performers. Vince once fired a keyboard player mid-set and took over duties for the remainder of the set. The keyboard player left the show and took a bus home.

On November 20, 2010, Vince Vance was surprised during his performance at a "Louisiana Legends" fundraiser at New Orleans Rock'n Bowl venue, with induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding career, including the Christmas icon "All I Want for Christmas is You" and his most current "I Am New Orleans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://louisianamusichalloffame.org/content/view/274/304/|title=Louisiana Music Hall of Fame - VINCE VANCE|website=Louisianamusichalloffame.org|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref>
