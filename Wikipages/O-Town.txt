'''O-Town''' (also known as '''OTWN/OTOWN''') is an American [[boy band]] formed from the first season of the [[reality television]] series ''[[Making the Band]]'' in 2000. As of 2015 the group consisted of Erik-Michael Estrada, Trevor Penick, Jacob Underwood, and Dan Miller. The line up also included [[Ashley Parker Angel]]. Ikaika Kahoano was originally part of the band but was replaced by Miller after dropping out of the group. 

After releasing two albums near the end of the boy band fad of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group disbanded in 2003.  The group was originally managed by [[Lou Pearlman]] during their first season of ''Making the Band'', but later managed by Mike Cronin and Mike Morin for their debut album and remaining television seasons.
