==Career==
===Dolemite records and wider acclaim===
By his own account, he was working at the world famous [[John Dolphin (music producer)#Dolphin's of Hollywood|Dolphin's of Hollywood]] record store in Los Angeles, California in 1970 when he began hearing obscene stories of "Dolemite" recounted by a local man named Rico.   Moore recorded a number of street poets, including [[Big Brown (poet)|Big Brown]] who, before he moved to Los Angeles, had been an influence on Bob Dylan, among other artists, while living in Greenwich Village. (Dylan said Brown's poetry was the best poetry he had ever heard.)<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Flanagan interviewed Bob Dylan in New York in March 1985 for his 1985 book "Written In My Soul." |url=https://www.interferenza.net/bcs/interw/85-mar.htm |access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>  In 1973, Moore produced Brown's album, ''The First Man of Poetry, Big Brown: Between Heaven and Hell''.

According to Moore, there was a wino named Rico, and Moore heard him on the street corner doing all these raps and rhymes:<ref>Interview with Moore on DVD "The Legend of Dolemite: Bigger and Badder"</ref>
{{blockquote|Rico, you do "Dolemite", I'm gonna give you some money for soup. He did "Dolemite" in the middle of the floor in the store I was working and the people just rolled. So I thought then, he's not a professional; I'm a professional comedian. What if I did "Dolemite"? Sure enough, I invited him to my house, give him a little reefer and some wine. He put "Dolemite" on tape, I recorded it, the rest is history.}}

Moore began recording the stories, and assumed the role of "Dolemite" in his club act and on recordings.<ref name=latimes>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081231052832/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/21/local/me-moore21 Jocelyn Y Stewart, "Obituary: Rudy Ray Moore", ''Los Angeles Times'', 21 October 2008]. Retrieved February 23, 2014</ref> In 1970–71 he recorded three albums of material, ''Eat Out More Often'', ''This Pussy Belongs To Me'', and ''The Dirty Dozens'', where "with [[jazz]] and R&B musicians playing in the background, [Moore] would recite raunchy, sexually explicit rhymes that often had to do with [[pimps]], prostitutes, players, and hustlers."<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-pussy-belongs-to-me-mw0000094218 Alex Henderson, Review of ''This Pussy Belongs To Me'' at Allmusic.com]. Retrieved February 23, 2014</ref>

Moore was influenced by more mainstream comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Richard Pryor]], as well as by traditions such as [[the Dozens]]. The recordings were usually made in Moore's own house, with friends in attendance to give a party atmosphere. The album covers and contents were often too racy to be put on display in record stores,<ref name=latimes/> but the records became popular through word of mouth and were highly successful in Black American communities,<ref name=NYT/> where his "warped wit and anti-establishment outlook" were embraced.<ref name=chicago/>

===''Dolemite'' movie and later success===

Moore spent most of his earnings from the records to finance the movie ''[[Dolemite]]'', which appeared in 1975 and has been described as "one of the great [[blaxploitation]] movies" of the 1970s.<ref name=ALLMUSIC/><ref name=chicago/> The character was "the ultimate ghetto hero: a bad dude, profane, skilled at kung-fu, dressed to kill and hell-bent on protecting the community from evil menaces. He was a pimp with a [[Kung fu (term)|kung-fu-fighting]] [[clique]] of prostitutes and he was known for his sexual prowess."<ref name=latimes/>

The film was successful and was followed by ''[[The Human Tornado]]'', ''[[The Monkey Hustle]]'', and ''[[Petey Wheatstraw (film)|Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Son-in-Law]]''. Moore continued to release albums that appealed to his enduring fanbase through the 1970s and 1980s, but little of his work reached a white audience. His "rapid-fire rhyming salaciousness exceeded the wildest excesses" of Foxx and Pryor,<ref name=NYT/> and his highly explicit style kept him off television and major films.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref name=latimes/> At the same time, Moore often spoke in his church and regularly took his mother to the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]]. He said that: "I wasn't saying dirty words just to say them... It was a form of art, sketches in which I developed ghetto characters who cursed. I don't want to be referred to as a dirty old man, rather a ghetto expressionist."<ref name=latimes/>

===Later career===
In 1990, Moore appeared on [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s album ''[[Taste of Chocolate]].''

In 1994, Moore appeared [[2 Live Crew]]'s album ''[[Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4]]''.

In 1995, Moore appeared in an episode of ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' titled "The Players Came Home".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Martin {{!}} TV Guide|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/martin/episode-18-season-3/all-the-players-came/202949|access-date=2020-09-05|website=TVGuide.com|language=en}}</ref>

In 1997, Moore reprised his Dolemite character for a voiceover in the intro of [[Busta Rhymes]]' platinum album ''[[When Disaster Strikes...]].<ref>{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=BHvp8mcJfAoC |page=55 }}|title=Billboard|date=2009-06-06|access-date=2014-06-29}}</ref>''

In 2001, Moore was a featured guest in the intro of [[Busta Rhymes]]' platinum selling album ''[[Genesis (Busta Rhymes album)|Genesis]]''.<ref name="liner notes">{{cite AV media notes|title=Genesis|year=2001|type=booklet|publisher=[[Flipmode Records|Flipmode]], [[J Records|J]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=RIAA|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2006, Moore voice-acted in the show ''[[Sons of Butcher (TV series)|Sons of Butcher]]'', as Rudy in season 2.

In 2008, Moore reprised the character [[Petey Wheatstraw (film)|Petey Wheatstraw]] on the song "I Live for the Funk", which featured [[Blowfly (musician)|Blowfly]] and Daniel Jordan. It marked the first time Blowfly and Moore collaborated on the same record together, as well as the 30-year anniversary of the movie ''Petey Wheatstraw''; it was also the final recording Moore made before his death.<ref name="I Live 4 The Funk - Analog Medium">[http://blog.analogmedium.com/2008/04/i-live-4-funk-by-daniel-jordan.html I Live 4 The Funk – Analog Medium]</ref>
