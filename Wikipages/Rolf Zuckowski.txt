In 1978, he released his first record for children, "Rolfs Vogelhochzeit" (Rolf's Wedding of the Birds) which is a German [[singspiel]]. In this record, he sings and tells the story of a bird couple that marries, builds a nest, and cares for offspring. Many songs followed, and Zuckowski's popularity increased. 
In 1979, Zuckowski published the album "Rolfs Schulweg-Hitparade," which promotes road safety to children in a musical manner. The album is a cooperation with the German aid agencies Ein Herz für Kinder (A Heart for Children) and "Kind und Verkehr."

Zuckowski became popular on the radio and gained international recognition with the song "Du da im Radio," the LP/MC "Radio Lollipop," and the radio-series "Hallo du da." He gained more recognition through several television appearances: In the German television series [[ZDF-Hitparade]], he achieved the first place with his song "...und ganz doll mich." In 1982, he was invited to perform his songs "...und ganz doll mich" and, in 1987, "In der Weihnachtsbäckerei" (In the Christmas bakery)<ref>[http://lyricstranslate.com/de/der-weihnachtsbaekerei-christmas-bakery.html Lyrics "In der Weihnachtsbäckerei/In the Christmas Bakery"]</ref> in the entertainment television show [[Wetten, dass?]] (German for "Wanna Bet That...?").

In 1983, Zuckowski made the drafts for the album [[Tabaluga]], for which he also composed various songs. The album turned into a great success. One year later, he developed the television show "Große Show für kleine Leute." In 1990, "Rolfs Vogelhochzeit" was shown on the German TV channel [[ZDF]]. Two years later, his [[song cycle]] "die Jahresuhr" and the new "Schulweg-Hitparade" were published as videos. In 1994, he set up his own company under the umbrella of the [[Universal Music Group]]. In 1999, he published the children's musical ''[[Der kleine Tag]]''.

The hit theme song "[[Neues vom Süderhof#Opening theme song|We are the children of the Suderhof]]" from the popular children's TV show [[Neues vom Süderhof]] was composed by Zuckowski.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://fudder.de/klauen-die-aerzte-bei-rolf-zuckowski--120385210.html |title=Do artists steal from Rolf Zuckowski?}}</ref>
