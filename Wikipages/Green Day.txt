'''Green Day''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]]<!-- Do not change; this is the genre settled on for the lead section after much discussion on the talk page. Other genre labels are discussed further down and are listed in the infobox --> band formed in the [[East Bay]] of [[California]] in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] and bassist and backing vocalist [[Mike Dirnt]]. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tré Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Green Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock in California|late-'80s/early-'90s Bay Area punk scene]] that emerged from the [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major-label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Social Distortion]], with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

Though the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[¡Uno!]]'', ''[[¡Dos!]]'', and ''[[¡Tré!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.

Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.

In 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have also collaborated on the side projects [[Pinhead Gunpowder]], [[The Network]], [[Foxboro Hot Tubs]], [[The Longshot (band)|The Longshot]], [[The Coverups]], and have worked on solo careers.

After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on its next album in 1997.

In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director [[Michael Mayer (director)|Michael Mayer]] to adapt the group's [[rock opera]] ''American Idiot'' into a one-act stage [[American Idiot (musical)|musical]] that premiered at the [[Berkeley Rep]] on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of ''American Idiot: The Musical'' have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." Jed Gottlieb of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' enjoyed the premise of the show but found that "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&position=0|title=Tale told by 'Idiot' lacks sound, fury|last=Gottlieb|first=Jay|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=April 19, 2010|access-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007042217/http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&position=0|archive-date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

Michael Kuchiwara of the [[Associated Press]] found the show to be "visually striking [and] musically adventurous", but noted that "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development". Paul Kolnik in ''[[USA Today]]'' enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative." He concluded that "''American Idiot'', despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers—for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway."<ref>Zoglin, Richard. "Punks Take Broadway", ''Time'' magazine, May 3, 2010, pp. 62–63</ref> Peter Travers from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in his review of ''American Idiot'', wrote "Though ''American Idiot'' carries echoes of such rock musicals as ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you.

Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes "true [[Punk rock|punk]]".<ref name="softpedia2005">{{cite web|url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|title= Green Day Still A Punk Band|date= October 5, 2005 |access-date=December 4, 2010|first=Mihaela|last=Stroia|publisher=Softpedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728121625/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|archive-date=July 28, 2013}}</ref> In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, [[John Lydon]], former frontman of the 1970s punk band the [[Sex Pistols]] commented, "So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves.

Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, "Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'"<ref name="softpedia2005"/>

On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&B artist [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes Left", saying "You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!" He also told the crowd he "was not [[Justin Bieber]]" and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] smashed his bass.
