'''Hanson''' is an American [[pop rock]] band from [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], United States, formed by brothers Isaac Hanson (guitar, vocals, bass, piano), [[Taylor Hanson]] (keyboards, vocals, percussion), and Zac Hanson (drums, vocals, piano). Supporting members include Dimitrius Collins (guitar) and Andrew Perusi (bass), who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007. They are best known for the 1997 hit song "[[MMMBop]]" from their debut album released through [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]/[[Polygram Records]], entitled ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'', which earned three [[Grammy]] nominations. The group's label Mercury Records was merged with its sister labels and the band was moved to [[Island Def Jam Music Group]]. After releasing one album on Island Def Jam, the label and the group parted ways. Hanson has sold over 16 million records worldwide and have had three Top 20 albums in the United States. They have had three Top 20 US Hot 100 singles and eight UK Top 20 singles. The band now records under its own [[independent record label]], [[3CG Records]].

==History==
===1992–1996: Early years===
In the early to mid-1990s, Isaac, [[Taylor Hanson|Taylor]], and Zac sang [[a cappella]] and recorded such classic songs as "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]", "[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]", and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]", as well as their own material. Their first performance as a professional group took place in 1992 at the Mayfest Arts Festival in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].<ref name="official">{{cite book| last =Gollihare| first =Jarrod| author2 =Jill Matthews| title =Hanson: The Official Book| publisher =Billboard Books| year =1997| isbn =0-8230-8323-3| url-access =registration| url =https://archive.org/details/hansonofficialbo00goll}}</ref> They were known as the Hanson Brothers, before shortening the name to Hanson in 1993.<ref>{{LoC catalog record|n97100326|Hanson Brothers|long=yes}}</ref>

Hanson also appeared on [[Carman (singer)|Carman]]'s ''Yo! Kidz: The Vidz'', which cast Taylor as a young Biblical [[David]] facing [[Goliath]], Isaac as an event announcer, and Zac and other members of the family in the stands cheering on this "sporting event".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Carman-Yo-Kidz-Vidz/dp/B000A2R8XK|title=Amazon.com – Carman: Yo Kidz! The Vidz|access-date=May 5, 2011|website=Amazon.com}}</ref>

All three boys started their musical careers as pianists, but Isaac eventually started playing guitar and Zac started playing drums, while Taylor continued as the keyboard player. The band recorded two independent albums in their hometown of Tulsa, ''[[Boomerang (Hanson album)|Boomerang]]'' (recorded in autumn 1994, released in 1995) and ''[[MMMBop (album)|MMMBop]]'' (released in 1996). The latter featured the original version of the song "MMMBop", which later became the runaway single on their debut commercial record ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]''. The band played in Austin during the [[South By Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]], which led to them being signed by manager [[Christopher Sabec]].<ref name="official"/> He shopped them to several record companies, most of which dismissed the band as either a novelty before [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]], an A&R representative for [[Mercury Records]], heard them play a set at the [[Wisconsin State Fair]]. After this performance, they were signed almost immediately by Mercury. They soon became a worldwide sensation with the release of their first major-label album, ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'', which was produced by Stephen Lironi and the [[Dust Brothers]].

===1997–2000: Commercial success===
[[File:Taylor in Madrid.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Taylor in concert in [[Madrid]], 2000]]
''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'' was released in the US on May 6, 1997, selling 10 million copies worldwide. [[May 6]] was declared 'Hanson Day' in Tulsa by Oklahoma's then-governor [[Frank Keating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/97_issues/970824/970824inside_hanson_mmmbop.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105021544/http://www.usaweekend.com/97_issues/970824/970824inside_hanson_mmmbop.html|url-status=dead|title=&#124; USA WEEKEND|website=Usaweekend.com|archive-date=January 5, 2013|access-date=April 4, 2007}}</ref> Although 'Hanson Day' was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, many Hanson fans all over the world still recognize May 6 as Hanson Day every year. Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and [[Mercury Records]] released Hanson's first documentary ''Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere'' and their Christmas album ''[[Snowed In]]'' in the wake of their success.  Hanson also launched ''MOE'' (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsincredible.com/band/cat?page=MOE+Magazine |title=MOE Magazine |website=Itsincredible.com |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography.  ''Hanson: The Official Book'' reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/01/bsp/bestpapernonfiction.html |title=HANSON: THE OFFICIAL BOOK, by Jarrod Gollihare.

They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style.  A live album, titled ''[[Live From Albertane]]'', was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary ''[[The Road to Albertane]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0201893/ |title=The Road to Albertane at the Internet Movie Database |website=Imdb.com |date=May 1, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>

In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released ''[[MMMBop (album)|MMMBop]]'' as ''[[3 Car Garage]]'', minus four tracks, in May 1998. Three tracks from ''[[Boomerang (Hanson album)|Boomerang]]'' ("Boomerang", "More Than Anything", and "Rain (Falling Down)") and two of the remaining tracks from ''[[MMMBop (album)|MMMBop]]'' ("Incredible" and "Baby (You're So Fine)") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members.

During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what became the songs for their second major studio album, ''[[This Time Around (Hanson album)|This Time Around]]''. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. Almost immediately following the changeover in May 2000, Hanson released their second album, ''[[This Time Around (Hanson album)|This Time Around]]'', but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour. The band toured through the summer and fall of 2000 on their own funds.<ref name="hanson.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.hanson.net/site/sections/107 |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905083114/http://www.hanson.net/site/sections/107 |archive-date=September 5, 2011 }}</ref>

===2001–2005: Independent career===
After a three-year struggle, the brothers left [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam Records]] to seek more creative freedom. Label executives had refused over 80 songs from the band, believing new material lacked marketability.<ref name="hanson.net"/> The documentary film ''[[Strong Enough to Break]]'' follows these events.

Hanson now records for their own [[Independent record label|independent label]], [[3CG Records]].<ref name=access>{{cite video| people = Paulina Williams (director)| url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_all_access/78349/episode_about.jhtml| title = VH1 All Access: Spotlight – Hanson| medium = TV-series| publisher = Viacom|date=   2004}}</ref> The label has distribution deals through [[Alternative Distribution Alliance]] in the United States, [[Cooking Vinyl]] in Europe, [[Sony Music]] in Asia and with various other distributors throughout the world.<ref name=hnet>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanson.net/Band/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129081029/http://www.hanson.net/Band/|url-status=dead|title=Hanson.net band information|archive-date=January 29, 2007}}</ref>  During the dispute with their former label, Hanson signed with the management company, 10th Street Entertainment, which also manages artists such as [[Meat Loaf]] and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.10thst.com/ |title=Tenth Street Entertainment |website=10thst.com |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>

The band's Underneath Acoustic tour occurred during the Summer and Fall of 2003. Music included acoustic versions of songs from the then-forthcoming release, ''[[Underneath (Hanson album)|Underneath]]''. The tour ended November 5, 2003 with a performance at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://people.com/celebrity/isaac-hanson-weds-longtime-girlfriend/|title=Isaac Hanson Weds Longtime Girlfriend

In autumn 2005, Hanson toured in the US and Canada to support ''[[The Best of Hanson: Live & Electric]]''. They also visited colleges to showcase ''[[Strong Enough to Break]]'', the documentary chronicling difficulties with and departure from Island Def Jam. During college visits, the band held question-and-answer sessions about independent artists' role in the music industry.<ref name=nique>{{cite news| last = Lipko| first = Hillary| title = Think radio sucks?

In March 2007, Hanson began a "preview tour" to promote ''The Walk'' and give fans a taste of recent work. Over six days, Hanson performed at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey, Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, The Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and The Supper Club in New York City. On March 30, Taylor and Zac appeared in [[Dallas|Dallas, TX]] to screen their documentary at the [[AFI Fest|AFI Film Festival]]. Afterward, the brothers held a Q&A session along with director [[Ashley Greyson]]. Hanson performed in the UK during April 2007, playing songs from ''The Walk''.

On May 6, 2007, the 10th anniversary of Hanson Day, the band re-recorded their first major label album, ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle Of Nowhere]]'', at The Blank Slate bar in their hometown of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band invited fan club members, causing hundreds to fly to Oklahoma for the acoustic event.  Hanson played concerts in the summer of 2007, supporting release of ''The Walk''.  The band appeared in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Boston]], New York City, [[Toronto]], and Los Angeles.
The record ''[[Middle of Nowhere Acoustic]]'' was released at the end of that year, exclusively on Hanson.net. The record included all but three songs of those originally in ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'' ("Speechless", "Thinking of You" and "With You in Your Dreams") and featured the song ''Yearbook'', never performed live before.

===2009–2012: ''Shout It Out''===
In June 2009, Hanson completed the album ''[[Shout It Out (Hanson album)|Shout It Out]]'' and planned to release it on June 8, 2010.

Hanson also released a five-song EP titled ''[[Stand Up, Stand Up (Hanson EP)|Stand Up, Stand Up]]'' that was available at shows and on the band's official website. The tracks are acoustic versions of four new Hanson songs, plus the album version of "World's on Fire" which was originally going to be on their album ''Shout It Out'' but was ultimately left off the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/19695.html |title=Hanson teams up with HelloGoodbye for fall outing >> Tour dates at LIVE DAILY |website=Livedaily.com |date=July 21, 2009 |access-date=November 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207212235/http://www.livedaily.com/news/19695.html |archive-date=February 7, 2010 }}</ref> It was released worldwide on iTunes on December 8, 2009.[[File:Hansonmadison.JPG|alt=Hanson and fans|thumb|Hanson leading fans as part of their "Take the Walk" initiative in 2008.]]In December 2009, Hanson announced they would play five consecutive concerts at New York's [[Gramercy Theater]]. Each concert featured one of the band's four previous albums in its entirety, and the premiere of their upcoming Spring 2010 release. Dubbed 'Five of Five', the engagement began with a performance of Hanson's debut, ''[[Middle of Nowhere (Hanson album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'', on April 26, 2010 and then moved onto 2000's ''This Time Around'' on April 27, 2004's ''Underneath'' followed on April 28 with 2007's ''The Walk'' on April 29. On April 30, the band unveiled their new album, ''Shout It Out''.

On March 6, 2010, Hanson shot dance and other sequences for their upcoming music video of their new single, "[[Thinking 'Bout Somethin']]", at Greenwood Avenue in [[Tulsa]]. Hanson recruited professional dancers for the shoot and also invited fans and local residents to take part in the video, which is an homage to the [[Blues Brothers (film)|Blues Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/04/19/hansons-thinking-bout-somethin-video/ |title=5 Reasons We Love Hanson's 'Thinking 'Bout Somethin" Video » MTV Buzzworthy Blog |website=Buzzworthy.mtv.com |date=April 19, 2010 |access-date=November 14, 2010}}</ref> The video was directed by Todd Edwards, co-founder of Blue Yonder Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=12095612 |title=Hundreds Shake Their Tail Feathers On Tulsa Hanson Video |website=Newson6.com |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=269&articleid=20100306_298_0_Portio819557 |title=Hanson music video shot in Greenwood |website=Tulsaworld.com |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> It was released for public viewing on their [[MySpace]] channel on April 15, 2010.

The tour kicked off in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]] on July 21, with the final show in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ont.]], on November 23. Throughout the tour, the band broadcast live streams from their website.

The band released a second single from ''Shout It Out'' in 2011. "Give a Little" reached Top 40 on the US Hot AC charts, making it the first top 40 hit for the band since their 2000 single "If Only".

The band resumed their touring activity in September 2011. The US Musical Ride Tour lasted from September 4 to November 1. Starting on November 6 in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]], they proceeded to tour Latin America and Europe in order to promote their ''Shout It Out'' album internationally. In early 2012, they toured Canada with [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]. Later in 2012, they took the Shout It Out world Tour to Philippines and Australia as well.
