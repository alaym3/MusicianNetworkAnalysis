'''Jukebox the Ghost''' is an American three-piece [[power pop]] band formed in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metro area. The band consists of Ben Thornewill (vocals & piano), Tommy Siegel (vocals & guitar) and Jesse Kristin (drums). The band has been active since 2006.

==History==
In 2003, Thornewill, Siegel, and Kristin met while attending [[George Washington University]].<ref name="naturalselections">[http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2008/01/natural_selections_jukebox_the_ghost.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403130111/http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2008/01/natural_selections_jukebox_the_ghost.php|date=April 3, 2008}}</ref> and formed a band called "The Sunday Mail".<ref name="byt">[http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/music/getting-a-little-bit-excited-with-jukebox-the-ghost/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222182754/http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/music/getting-a-little-bit-excited-with-jukebox-the-ghost/|date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> After two years, they decided to change their name.

After they thought they had enough new material, they renamed themselves "Jukebox the Ghost". The name was a combination of words chosen democratically, with "jukebox" originating from the lyrics of a [[Captain Beefheart]] song and "ghost" as a reference to a [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]] novel. In a 2020 interview, Siegel said that the idea to add the word "ghost" to the band name occurred to Thornewill in particular, as "he really wanted something involving ghosts".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-15|title=A head full of comics, cartoons and songs: interview with Tommy Siegel of Jukebox the Ghost|url=https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/tommy-siegel-interview/|access-date=2021-06-05|website=The Shortlisted|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2008, they released their first album, ''Let Live & Let Ghosts'' which was recorded during winter break of their senior year of college.

Jukebox the Ghost recorded a cover of [[Ace of Base|Ace of Base's]] "Beautiful Life" for [[Engine Room Recordings]]' compilation album ''[[Guilt by Association Vol. 2]]'', which was released in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Solarski|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34070-my-brightest-diamond-frightened-rabbit-do-covers/|title=My Brightest Diamond, Frightened Rabbit Do Covers|publisher=Pitchfork|date=19 November 2008 |access-date=2009-06-11}}</ref>

After releasing their debut album, they toured with [[Say Hi]] and [[Nightmare of You]], among others. In 2009 they toured with [[Ben Folds]], followed shortly by a tour with [[Jenny Owen Youngs]] in the United States. The band began recording their sophomore album "Everything Under the Sun" on September 29, 2009 at Tarquin Studios in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], an indie recording studio that specializes in analog recording.

In February 2010, Jukebox the Ghost toured Europe with [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]] of [[The Moldy Peaches]]. This was followed by more touring in the United States with the bands [[Tally Hall (band)|Tally Hall]] and [[Skybox (band)|Skybox]]. They took another break and started playing live shows once again in late May 2010 with the band [[Free Energy (band)|Free Energy]], and once headlined as a minor band at [[Lollapalooza]] in [[Chicago]].

September 1, 2010 marked a major milestone for the band, as they appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Jukebox the Ghost opened for [[Barenaked Ladies]] during the fall of 2010 from October through November, and were a featured band on the [[Barenaked Ladies]]-hosted Sixthman cruise, Ships & Dip 4, in February 2011. Jukebox The Ghost also was a featured band on another Sixthman Cruise "Rombello" in September 2011, and toured with [[Guster]] soon after. The band opened for [[Jack's Mannequin]] and [[Motion City Soundtrack]] in 2012.

On June 12, 2012, Jukebox the Ghost released their third album, ''Safe Travels''. The album marked a departure from their often-fictional narratives in favor of more personal lyrics. In an interview with Jukebox the Ghost, Ben Thornewill stated that "this record has a lot of songs that are directly from our own life experience. Whether they are journalistically accurate or not, probably not, but they come from something in our lives, not something we’re imagining.”<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Rutledge|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/jukebox-the-ghost-gets-introspective-with-safe-travels/|title=Jukebox The Ghost Gets Introspective With Safe Travels|publisher=American Songwriter|date=11 June 2012 |access-date=2012-06-12}}</ref>

On May 23, 2014, they released a new single, "The Great Unknown" from their self-titled fourth record, ''Jukebox the Ghost'' which was released on October 21, 2014.

On January 21, 2015, the band announced they had signed with preeminent pop alternative label Cherrytree Records. Cherrytree Records is a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Jukebox the Ghost re-released their self-titled album in February 2015, under their new label. This was quickly followed by the band's performance of "Postcard" on [[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'s late night show on January 26. As of January 2016, they are no longer affiliated with Cherrytree Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jukeboxtheghost/posts/10153401559010017|title=Jukebox the Ghost|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>

In late March 2015, the group announced a national summer tour with [[Ingrid Michaelson]]. In early April they released the music video of "Postcard."

The band also wrote a song called "Black Hole" for [[The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show|The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show]]. "Black Hole" was featured on an episode in 2015, and the entire TV series has since been added to Netflix.

That year, the band began their annual "HalloQueen" shows, a series of performances around Halloween in which the band wears costumes inspired by and covers songs by Queen. What began as a pair of small shows in 2015 evolved to tours in 2018 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Borba |first1=Ryan |title=Jukebox The Ghost’s ‘HalloQueen’ Gets Fans In The Spirit, Creates Touring Opportunity |url=https://www.pollstar.com/article/jukebox-the-ghosts-halloqueen-gets-fans-in-the-spirit-creates-touring-opportunity-141557 |website=Pollstar |access-date=4 October 2020 |date=31 October 2019}}</ref>

On March 6, 2017, after nearly three years on tour leave from recording, the group released the single, "Stay the Night."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7752350/jukebox-the-ghost-new-single-stay-the-night-listen-queen|title=Jukebox the Ghost Premieres a Queen-Inspired Single 'Stay the Night': Premiere}}</ref> This song was featured in the second season of Rob Schneider's Netflix Series, [[Real Rob]].

While performing in late 2017, the group announced that they had recently finished recording a new album and debuted a new song from that album, "Boring."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/30/jukebox-ghost-slims-halloqueen/ |title=Jukebox the Ghost conjures ghost of Queen at Slim’s HalloQueen show |first=Madeline |last=Wells |date=30 October 2017 |access-date=27 November 2017 |publisher=The Daily Californian}}</ref>
