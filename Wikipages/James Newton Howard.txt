==Early life and career==
Howard was born in Los Angeles. He is from a musical family; his grandmother was the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]]'s concertmaster and violinist during the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/304123/james-newton-howard/biography |title=James Newton Howard |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2014-01-28}}</ref>

Howard began studying music as a child, taking classical piano lessons at the age of four.<ref name="billboard1"/> He went on to attend the [[Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]] and the [[Music Academy of the West]]<ref name="MAotW">{{cite web|title=Alumni Roster|url=http://www.musicacademy.org/school/alumni/alumni-roster/piano|website=musicacademy.org|access-date=19 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605021001/http://www.musicacademy.org/school/alumni/alumni-roster/piano|archive-date=5 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> in [[Santa Barbara, California]] with Reginald Stewart and Leon Fleischer.<ref name="billboard1"/> He then attended the [[University of Southern California]], studying at the School of Music as a piano performance major, but dropped out after 6 weeks because "He wanted to do other things than practicing the piano."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/music/about/board/newtonhoward.html |title=USC Thornton School of Music : About Us: Board of Advisors: James Newton Howard |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227092843/http://www.usc.edu/schools/music/about/board/newtonhoward.html |archive-date=December 27, 2010 }}</ref>

After Howard left college, he joined a short-lived rock band called Mama Lion.  The band was led by [[Neil Merryweather]] (bass, backing vocals) and featured lead singer [[Lynn Carey]], Coffi Hall on drums, and Rick Gaxiola on guitar.  Mama Lion recorded two full-length albums.  Members of Mama Lion also formed the band Heavy Cruiser with Merryweather now on lead vocals, recording two albums whose genre was closer to hard rock, but also displayed psychedelic and progressive influences. He then worked for a couple of years as a session musician with artists including [[Diana Ross]], [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Harry Nilsson]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elton's 'Tour de Force' Remembered|url=https://www.eltonjohn.com/stories/eltons-tour-de-force-remembered|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Elton John|language=en}}</ref> In the early 70s, he described himself as being "dirt poor", until his big break in 1975 when his manager got him an audition with [[Elton John]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3goGcCxl5Y |title=James Newton Howard – Elton John Story |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2014-01-28}}</ref> He joined John's band and toured with them as keyboardist during the late 70s and early 80s. He was part of the band that played [[Central Park]], [[New York City|New York]], on September 13, 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|title=James Newton Howard Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/factsJames-Newton-Howard|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> Howard also arranged strings for several of John's songs during this period including the hits "[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]" and "[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]", and played additional keyboards and synthesizers on studio albums including ''[[Rock of the Westies]]'' (1975), ''[[Blue Moves]]'' (1976), ''[[21 at 33]]'' (1980), and ''[[The Fox (Elton John album)|The Fox]]'' (1981).

In 1982, Howard was featured on ''[[Toto IV]]'' as the strings conductor and orchestrator for "I Won't Hold You Back", "Afraid of Love", and "Lovers in the Night". A year later, he released the live album ''James Newton Howard and Friends'', which featured [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s [[David Paich]] (keyboards), [[Steve Porcaro]] (keyboards), [[Jeff Porcaro]] (drums), and [[Joe Porcaro]] (percussion).<ref>{{Citation|title=James Newton Howard and Friends - James Newton Howard {{!}} Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/james-newton-howard-and-friends-mw0000190237/credits|language=en|access-date=2020-12-26}}</ref>

After briefly touring with [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]], he took an opportunity brought to him by his manager to write a film score for a small-time movie. This career move would lead to his becoming a successful film music composer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} During this early foray into film music, he did not entirely abandon his previous musical path and returned for a brief collaboration with Elton John on his Tour De Force of Australia in the fall of 1986. He conducted both his own and [[Paul Buckmaster]]'s arrangements during the second half of the set, which focused on orchestrated performances of selected songs from the Elton John catalog.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==1990s–2000s==
Howard scored the surprise blockbuster [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990) and received his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for his score for [[Barbra Streisand]]'s drama ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'' (1991). Setting the musical mood for numerous films throughout the decade, Howard's skills encompassed a plethora of genres, including four more [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|best original score Oscar]] nominations, for the [[Harrison Ford]] action feature ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993), the [[Julia Roberts]] romantic comedy ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'' (1997), [[M.
