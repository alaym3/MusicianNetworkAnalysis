'''Cheech & Chong''' are a [[double act|comedy duo]] consisting of [[Cheech Marin]] and [[Tommy Chong]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Up In Smoke|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/67518/Cheech-Chong-s-Up-In-Smoke/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422211011/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/67518/Cheech-Chong-s-Up-In-Smoke/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-04-22|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Tracie Cooper|date=2014|access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> The duo found commercial and cultural success in the 1970s and 1980s with their [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routines, studio recordings, and feature films, which were based on the [[hippie]] and [[free love]] era, and especially [[drug culture|drug]] and [[counterculture]] movements, most notably their love for [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=NYT/>

==Career==
The duo met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], in the late 1960s. Chong was a Canadian citizen, and Cheech had moved there from southern California to avoid the draft at the height of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Greasy Love Songs |title-link=Cruising with Ruben & the Jets |others=Frank Zappa |year=2009 |first=Cheech |last=Marin |publisher=[[Zappa Records]] }}</ref> The pair performed stand-up shows, released many successful comedy record albums, and starred in a series of low-budget films.<ref name=NYT/> Some of their best-known comedy routines and songs include "[[Earache My Eye]]", "[[Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces|Basketball Jones]]", "[[Santa Claus and His Old Lady]]", and "[[Sister Mary Elephant]]". Perhaps their most famous line is ''"Dave's not here",'' from their [[Cheech and Chong (album)|self-titled debut album]].

Their early success culminated with the release of their first feature-length movie, ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', in 1978.<ref name=NYT/> It became something of a [[cult classic]], and was also successful enough at the box office (grossing over $44&nbsp;million despite a low budget)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=upinsmoke.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Up in Smoke, Box Office Information|access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> to warrant two sequels: ''[[Cheech and Chong's Next Movie]]'' in 1980, and  ''[[Nice Dreams]]'' in 1981. These were followed by the less successful ''[[Things Are Tough All Over]]'' (1982) and ''[[Still Smokin (film)|Still Smokin]]'' (1983). The pair attempted a departure from their stoner comedy with 1984's ''[[Cheech & Chong's The Corsican Brothers]]''. To date, their most recent starring vehicle as a duo was 2014's ''[[Cheech & Chong's Animated Movie]]''.

Tommy Chong directed four of their films while co-writing and starring in all seven with Cheech Marin.

They also appeared in smaller supporting roles in [[Graham Chapman]]'s ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]''.

In 1985 the duo released their album ''Get Out of My Room'', which included the novelty hit song "[[Born in East L.A. (song)|Born in East L.A.]]" (based on [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]").  This song later served as the basis for 1987 [[Born in East L.A. (film)|film of the same title]], in which [[Cheech Marin]] played the starring role. Immediately following the release of the album, Cheech Marin separated himself from the pair's drug-inspired act by working on a solo career. <!-- Marin and Chong have articles describing their solo careers in more detail. -->

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Cheech & Chong among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Reunion===
After their contentious parting in the 1980s,<ref>{{cite book |last=Marin |first=Cheech |date=2017 |title=Cheech is not my real name – but don't call me Chong! |location=New York |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |pages=175–178 |isbn=9781455592340 |author-link=Cheech Marin }}</ref> the duo spent years without working together. In 1992 the two worked together for the first time in several years, voicing characters in the animated film ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wollman |first=Jane |date=8 May 1992 |title=Speaking Up Stars lend their voices to animated characters |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |page=1G }}</ref> In 1997, Chong made an appearance on Marin's TV series ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', in an episode titled "Wild Card," which contained a reference to their iconic "Dave" skit from their 1972 debut album. In 2000 both performers voiced characters in the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' for the episode "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]", but their voices were recorded separately.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://southpark.cc.com/news/355585/116-breayle-april-23-2001|title=116 - breayle: April 23, 2001 - News - South Park Studios|publisher=South Park Studios|date=April 22, 2001|access-date=December 27, 2012}}</ref> Both Marin and Chong indicated in a 2003 episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' that they were willing to reunite.

The duo had plans to reunite for another film when Chong's California-based company, Chong's Glass, was raided by federal officials in February 2003, as part of a federal crackdown on "drug-related paraphernalia".  In a plea bargain which allowed his son and wife to remain out of jail, Chong pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to distribute drug paraphernalia in May, and in September 2003 was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, fined $20,000, and forced to forfeit $120,000 in assets. He was released in July 2004. His cellmate was [[Jordan Belfort]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jordan-belfort-cringeworthy-la-convention-center-2014-11 |title=Jordan Belfort Cringeworthy Talk At LA Convention Center |publisher=Business Insider |date=2014-11-03 |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref>

With Chong released, the duo planned to resume production on a reunion film. A variety of titles were rumored, including ''Grumpy Old Stoners''. But they announced in September 2005 that the reunion film had been canceled.  Beginning in September 2008, Cheech and Chong reunited for the Light Up America comedy tour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cinemablend.com/music/Cheech-And-Chong-Light-Up-America-On-Reunion-Tour-11540.html |title=Cheech And Chong Light Up America On Reunion Tour |publisher=Cinemablend.com |date=2008-07-31 |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> which opened in [[Ottawa]], making a radio program appearance on ''[[The Bob & Tom Show]]''. In March 2009, they recorded two shows at the [[Majestic Theatre (San Antonio, Texas)|Majestic Theatre]] in [[San Antonio]] for a DVD release of the reunion tour.

In 2011, both performers were guests stars on the animated sitcom [[The Simpsons]], on the episode "[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]]". The episode focuses on a fictitious separation of the duo, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] taking Chong's place.

The pair appeared together on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' on April 23, 2018, in response to recent news that [[John Boehner]] had joined the board of a marijuana company. The pair expressed displeasure that marijuana was no longer rebellious, Cheech remarking that he could now buy weed "from a store in a strip mall" when before he could only buy it from "behind a store in a strip mall." They then claimed they would no longer be doing stoner comedy and would do comedy about things that were still illegal, such as unpasteurized dairy products, importing exotic reptiles, taping and distributing football games without the consent of the NFL, and burning leaves without a permit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Proctor|first1=Steven|title=Cheech and Chong are moving on from 'stoner comedy'|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cheech-chong-moving-stoner-comedy-072049728.html|website=Yahoo|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

==Unproduced films==

In 1980, there were plans to make a film called ''Riding High with Cheech & Chong''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/cheech-chong-unmade-movie-sequel-1980-1841240894 |title=Cheech and Chong Unmade Movie Sequel * 1980 Original Storyboards Script * &#124; #1841240894 |website=Worthpoint.com |access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>

[[Ivan Reitman]] conceived ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' as a Cheech and Chong vehicle. Cheech and Chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control, so Reitman told the screenwriters to rewrite it for [[Bill Murray]] and [[Harold Ramis]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Gillis |first = Michael |title = Stars and Stripes |work = Stripes Special Edition DVD |publisher = [[Columbia Pictures]]| year = 2006}}</ref>

Screenwriter [[Tom McLoughlin]] also pitched a sequel to the [[slasher film]] ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' in which Cheech and Chong, playing camp counselors, faced off against killer [[Jason Voorhees]], as a [[comedy horror]] movie in the vein of ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/cheech-and-chong-in-friday-the-13th/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023161621/https://www.slashfilm.com/cheech-and-chong-in-friday-the-13th/ |archive-date=2019-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/movies/2017/11/22/cheech-and-chong-friday-the-13th-jason-voorhees/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023161624/https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/22/cheech-and-chong-friday-the-13th-jason-voorhees/ |archive-date=2019-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The hyenas Banzai and Shenzi in the 1994 animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'' were storyboarded as being characters modeled after Cheech and Chong. Due to the duo not getting along with each other at the time, and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] taking interest in the role of Shenzi, Chong was not cast, but Cheech played the part of Banzai.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.civilized.life/articles/the-lion-king-was-originally-a-cheech-and-chong-movie/ |title='The Lion King' Was Originally a 'Cheech and Chong' Movie |website=Civilized.life |access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>
