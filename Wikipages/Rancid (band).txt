'''Rancid''' is an American [[punk rock]]<!-- Do not change genres without discussing on the talk page. Changing the genre without discussing is considered vandalism. --> band formed in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1991. Founded by former members of the band [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]], Rancid is often credited as being among the wave of bands that revived mainstream interest in punk rock in the [[United States]] during the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Punk Rock: An Oral History |url=https://archive.org/details/punkrockoralhist00robb |url-access=registration |last=Robb |first=John |publisher=PM Press, Ebury Press |isbn=978-1-60486-005-4 |quote=I saw Green Day, Rancid and the Offspring, taking punk to the mall rats and the stadiums with multi-million-selling albums. |year=2006}}</ref> Over their {{Age|1991|1|1}}-year career, Rancid retained much of its original fan-base, most of which was connected to its [[underground music]]al roots.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim.

Rancid has had two lineup changes since its inception, with [[Tim Armstrong]] and [[Matt Freeman]] being continuous members. Their current lineup consists of Armstrong on [[guitar]] and vocals, Freeman on [[Bass guitar|bass]] and vocals, [[Lars Frederiksen]] on guitar and vocals, and [[Branden Steineckert]] on [[Drum kit|drums]]. The band was formed by Armstrong, Freeman, and former drummer [[Brett Reed]], who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Steineckert. This lineup recorded [[Rancid (1993 album)|their first album]], with Frederiksen joining the band on their subsequent tour.

To date, Rancid has released nine studio albums, one split album, one compilation, two extended plays, and a series of live online-only albums, and has been featured on a number of compilation albums.<ref name="discography">For album and single sales information, see the [[Rancid discography]] page.</ref> The band has sold over four million records worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diversevinyl.com/news/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121217140001/https://diversevinyl.com/htm/news.php?id=1035|url-status=dead|title=Your one-stop vinyl web shop|first=Diverse|last=Vinyl|date=May 13, 2019|website=Diverse Vinyl|archive-date=December 17, 2012|access-date=December 18, 2019}}</ref> making it one of the most successful punk rock groups of all time. The band rose to fame in 1994 with its second studio album, ''[[Let's Go (Rancid album)|Let's Go]]'', featuring the single "[[Salvation (Rancid song)|Salvation]]". In the following year, Rancid released its highly successful album ''[[...And Out Come the Wolves]]'', which produced its best-known songs "[[Roots Radicals]]", "[[Ruby Soho]]", and "[[Time Bomb (Rancid song)|Time Bomb]]", and was certified gold and platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]],<ref name="RIAAcertification">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Certification (type in "Rancid" in the artist box)|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|access-date=May 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701082704/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|archive-date=July 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> selling over one million copies in the United States alone. Its next five albums – ''[[Life Won't Wait]]'' (1998), ''[[Rancid (2000 album)|Rancid]]'' (2000), ''[[Indestructible (Rancid album)|Indestructible]]'' (2003), ''[[Let the Dominoes Fall]]'' (2009), and ''...[[Honor Is All We Know]]'' (2014) – were also critically acclaimed, though not as successful as ''...And Out Come the Wolves''. Their most recent studio album, ''[[Trouble Maker (album)|Trouble Maker]]'', was released on June 9, 2017, and they are currently working on a follow-up album.

==History==

===Early history (pre-1993)===
Childhood friends Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman grew up together in [[Albany, California]], a small, then–working-class community near Berkeley. The two had been playing together in the influential<ref name="Conoley">{{cite web |last=Conoley |first=Ben |title=Interviews: Jesse Michaels (Classics of Love) |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/33911 |access-date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> [[ska punk]] band [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]] from 1987 to 1989. The band became popular in the punk scene at [[924 Gilman Street]], a club and concert venue featuring Bay Area punk bands. When Operation Ivy broke up, Armstrong and Freeman decided to form a new band, and formed a ska punk band called [[Downfall (band)|Downfall]], which disbanded after a few months. They then started a [[hardcore punk]] band called Generator,<ref>from [[BYO Split Series Volume III]] liner notes</ref> which also disbanded shortly after. They also started the ska influenced [[Dance Hall Crashers]], though they left the band shortly after it was formed. During this time, Armstrong was struggling with [[alcoholism]], and to keep him focused on other interests, Freeman suggested they form a new band.<ref name="Huey">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=rancid-p41116/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Rancid Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 6, 2010}}</ref> In 1991, they recruited Armstrong's roommate Brett Reed as their drummer and formed Rancid.

A few months after the band's inception, Rancid began performing around the Berkeley area, and quickly developed a fan following. Rancid's first recorded release was a [[Rancid (EP)|1992 EP]] for Operation Ivy's old label [[Lookout! Records]]. Shortly after releasing the extended play, the band left Lookout! and was signed to [[Bad Religion]] guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]]'s record label, [[Epitaph Records]]. Rancid released its [[Rancid (1993 album)|self-titled debut album]] through Epitaph in 1993.

===Breakthrough success (1994–1996)===
[[File:Mattlive (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Matt Freeman]]
While Rancid was writing for a follow-up album, [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] joined them to co-write the song "Radio", which resulted in Armstrong playing a live performance with Rancid. Tim had previously asked Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid's second guitarist, but he turned down the request initially as he was playing with the [[UK Subs]] at the time. After Billie Joe turned down the request, Frederiksen changed his mind and joined Rancid.

Frederiksen played with the band on its second studio album ''[[Let's Go (Rancid album)|Let's Go]]'' (1994). That year, its then-label-mates, [[The Offspring]], experienced huge success with its album ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]''. Rancid supported the Offspring's 1994 tour,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/tourArchive?year=1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101101354/http://www.offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/tourArchive?year=1994|url-status=dead|title=Tour Archive: The Offspring|archive-date=January 1, 2009}}</ref> which helped ''Let's Go'' reach number 97 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Heatseekers and the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts, respectively. The album also provided its first widespread exposure when [[MTV]] broadcast the video for the single "[[Salvation (Rancid song)|Salvation]]." ''Let's Go'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] on July 7, 2000,<ref name="Huey" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | title = RIAA Certification | work = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] | access-date = February 26, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701082704/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | archive-date = July 1, 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> and with the success of the album, the band was pursued by a number of major record labels, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s label Maverick Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.ca/artist/763486?brand=none |title=Rancid tickets, concerts and tour dates. Official Ticketmaster site |publisher=Ticketmaster.ca |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Many rumors circulated during this time period. Some of the rumors were Epitaph employees were not allowed to discuss matters with the press, Rancid convinced an A&R man from [[Epic Records|Epic]] to shave a blue mohawk, and Madonna sent the band nude pictures of herself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cushing |first=Ellen |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/eastbay/white-punks-on-warner-bros/Content?oid=1072038 |title=White Punks on Warner Bros. &#124; Feature &#124; Oakland, Berkeley & Bay Area News & Arts Coverage |date=November 5, 2003 |publisher=Eastbayexpress.com |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

The band eventually decided to remain signed to Epitaph, and the next year released its third album ''[[...And Out Come the Wolves]]'' on August 22, 1995. The album quickly surpassed ''Let's Go'' in terms of success, and reached number 45 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite magazine|title=...And Out Come the Wolves' entry at Billboard.com| magazine=Billboard.com|url= {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rancid|chart=all}}|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref> on January 22, 1996, the album was certified gold.<ref name="goldcertification">{{cite web | url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | title = RIAA Certification (type in "Rancid" in the artist box) | work = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] | access-date = June 23, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701082704/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | archive-date = July 1, 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> The album received positive reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] described the album as having "classic moments of revivalist punk". Erlewine praised the music and claims the album "doesn't mark an isolationist retreat into didactic, defiantly underground punk rock". Three of the album's singles, "[[Roots Radicals]]", "[[Time Bomb (Rancid song)|Time Bomb]]", and "[[Ruby Soho]]" all charted on the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks]], and earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on [[MTV]] and radio stations to date.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=...And Out Come the Wolves| website=[[AllMusic]]|url= http://allmusic.com/album/and-out-come-the-wolves-r220837/charts-awards/billboard-single|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref> The band also performed "Roots Radicals" and "Ruby Soho" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304010134/http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/seasons/Season_21.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Saturday Night Live - NBC.com|archive-date=March 4, 2009|website=NBC}}</ref>

===Middle years (1997–2003)===
[[File:Larslive.jpg|thumb|left|Lars Frederiksen]]
After two years of touring for ''...And Out Come the Wolves'', Rancid returned to the studio in 1997 to begin recording its fourth studio album, ''[[Life Won't Wait]]'', which was released on June 30, 1998. The album branched out from Rancid's previous musical styles, and combined punk rock with elements of [[roots reggae]], [[rockabilly]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[funk]], drawing comparisons to [[the Clash]]'s ''[[Sandinista!]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rancid/albums/album/306290/review/5943740/life_wont_wait|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012124332/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rancid/albums/album/306290/review/5943740/life_wont_wait|url-status=dead|title=Rancid: Life Won't Wait: Music Reviews: Rolling Stone|archive-date=October 12, 2007}}</ref> Though the album did not achieve the success of ''...And Out Come the Wolves'', but has since garnered a strong [[cult following]] in recent times. In 1999, Rancid decided to end its seven-year relationship with Epitaph and signed with Armstrong's founded [[Hellcat Records]] (which is a sub-label of Epitaph).

A [[Rancid (2000 album)|second self-titled album]] was released on August 1, 2000 and would be its first album released through Hellcat. The album failed to achieve the success of Rancid's previous three albums and reached number 68 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="billboard">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rancid|chart=all}} Billboard.com – Artist Chart History – Rancid]</ref> On the album, the group largely abandoned its ska-punk influences, recording a more [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced album.<ref name="Huey" /> The next year the band took part in the Vans Warped 2001 tour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011109075022/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/08/2304.cfm "LIVE: Vans Warped 2001"]. ''Chart Attack'', August 23, 2001. Review by: Vanessa Bruno</ref>

The three original members of Rancid released three songs under the name [[Devil's Brigade (band)|Devil's Brigade]] in 2002, one on the ''[[Give 'Em the Boot III]]'' compilation album, and two on a 12-inch [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. In March of the same year, a split album with [[NOFX]] titled ''[[BYO Split Series Volume III]]'' was released, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.

After a break from touring in 2001, Rancid returned to the studio with Gurewitz in 2002 to record its sixth studio album, ''[[Indestructible (Rancid album)|Indestructible]]'', which was released on August 19, 2003 and was their highest-charting album to date, reaching number 15.<ref name="billboard" /> Unlike the band's previous albums, ''Indestructible'' was distributed by not only Epitaph/Hellcat but major record label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], a move that received some backlash from the band's fans who questioned their loyalty to the independent scene. When released, the album didn't feature the Warner logo anywhere on the packaging, a move to hide the major label move from fans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe D'Angelo |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472813/20030617/rancid.jhtml |title=Rancid Jump To Major Label For New LP, Indestructible – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=June 17, 2003 |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The album was warmly received by most critics however met with mixed reviews from fans, some of which felt the album contained a "poppier" sound (some accusing Warner of having an influence on the music) while others felt it was a mixture of ''..And Out Come the Wolves'' and ''Life Won't Wait''. The album's music video for the first single, "[[Fall Back Down]]" was also met with some criticism from fans due to members of [[Good Charlotte]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]] making appearances.

===Hiatus (2004–2005)===

In 2004, after a tour for ''Indestructible'', Rancid went on an extended hiatus. The band members worked with side projects, although it had not officially disbanded. Armstrong continued to play with his side project the [[Transplants (band)|Transplants]], who released their second album, ''[[Haunted Cities]]'', in 2005. He also contributed guitar and backing vocals on [[Cypress Hill]]'s song "What's Your Number?" from its tenth album ''[[Till Death Do Us Part (Cypress Hill album)|Till Death Do Us Part]]''. Armstrong also released a solo album, ''[[A Poet's Life]]'' in May 2007. Frederiksen continued working with his side-project [[Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards]] and released their second studio album, ''[[Viking (album)|Viking]]'', in 2004, the album was co-written and co-produced by Armstrong. Freeman briefly toured with [[Social Distortion]] in 2004 as [[John Maurer]]'s replacement until the band found its current bassist [[Brent Harding]]. Freeman and Frederiksen both had children during this time as well—Freeman had two, and Frederiksen had one.<ref>{{cite web|author=Darryl Sterdan |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/R/Rancid/2009/06/02/9645116-sun.html |title=Canoe – Jam!

===Reformation and ''Let the Dominoes Fall'' (2006–2010)===
[[File:Rancidband1.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Rancid performing in 2006]]
In early 2006, Rancid reformed to embark on a successful tour and played a number of acoustic performances as part of [[Hellcat Records]]' Hellcat Nights concert series at [[The Echo (venue)|the Echo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_433|title=Rancid to put on four "Hellcat Nights" in L.A. this March|work=Alternative Press|date=February 8, 2006|access-date=June 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816211052/http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_433|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was the band's first live performance since its hiatus. On April 13, 2006, Rancid announced plans for a worldwide tour beginning in July 2006, and the release of a DVD consisting of 31 of its music videos, as well as a tentative release date of Spring 2007 for a new as-yet-unnamed studio album.

Similar to a number of other bands signed to [[Lookout! Records]], in September 2006, Rancid had taken its self-titled extended play from the label's catalog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lookoutrecords.com/bands/band.php3?sd=647996426&bnd_id=51|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319115452/http://www.lookoutrecords.com/bands/band.php3?sd=647996426&bnd_id=51|url-status=dead|title=Lookout! Records – Rancid|archive-date=March 19, 2007}}</ref>

On November 3, 2006, Reed left Rancid and was replaced by [[Branden Steineckert]], formerly a member of [[the Used]].

Rancid released a compilation album, ''[[B Sides and C Sides]]'', on December 11, 2007. The album consists of various b-sides, "c-sides", and songs from other compilations.

Rancid toured Japan in April 2008 for a number of shows following its two days headlining the Punkspring 2008 festival.<ref name="RancidJapan2008">{{cite web |date=February 18, 2008 |title=Rancid (Japan) |website=Punknews.org |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/27774 |access-date=February 19, 2008}}</ref> Following the Japanese tour, Rancid embarked on a full tour of the United States during the summer and a tour of the United Kingdom in the winter.<ref name="Rancidcompile2008">{{cite web |date=April 1, 2008 |title=Rancid compile music videos on new DVD, announce tour dates |website=Punknews.org |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28337 |access-date=April 6, 2008}}</ref>

Rancid used to host a one-hour once a week XM radio show. The show was called Rancid Radio and was on "Fungus" channel 53 Saturday at midnight. However, the show was canceled due to Fungus 53 being taken from XM's programming.

Although plans for a follow-up to ''Indestructible'' had been mentioned during 2005, 2006 and 2007, it would not materialize until January 2008, when Rancid entered [[Skywalker Sound]] to record it. The resulting seventh studio album, ''[[Let the Dominoes Fall]]'', was released on June 2, 2009. In late May, the full album was streamed from the band's [[MySpace]] page. It was Rancid's first album without its "classic" lineup, with [[Branden Steineckert]] replacing [[Brett Reed]] on drums in 2006. The album was written at Branden's Unknown Studios in Utah and was recorded at [[Skywalker Sound]] in [[Nicasio, California]].<ref name="idiomag 090331">{{cite web |url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/73252/rancid |title=News: Rancid Announce New Album Details |author=Rock Sound |access-date=March 31, 2009 |date=March 31, 2009 |publisher=[[idiomag]] }}</ref> Music legend [[Booker T.
