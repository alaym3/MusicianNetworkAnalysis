'''Old Gray''' was an American [[emo]] band from [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] and [[Auburn, New Hampshire]].

==History==
Old Gray began in 2011. The band was formed by Cameron Boucher, Charlie Singer, Zane McDaniel, and Raphael Bastek. In 2013, Boucher would form punk band [[Sorority Noise]] in which would later feature Singer. Due to the prominent rise in popularity of Sorority Noise, Old Gray would often have to take long periods of inactivity aside for some one-off shows. Since then, they have released two full-length albums, three EPs, six splits, and two singles. Their debut album, ''An Autobiography'', was released in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zarrillo|first1=Zack|title=POZ Review: Old Gray - An Autobiography|url=http://propertyofzack.com/post/49107710567/poz-review-old-gray-an-autobiography|publisher=Property of Zack|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Harri|title=Listen: Old Gray – "An Autobiography"|url=http://lostinthesound.com/2013/03/listen-old-gray-an-autobiography/|publisher=Lost In The Sound|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Their second full-length album, ''Slow Burn'' was released on December 9, 2016 via Boucher's Flower Girl Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flowergirlrecords.limitedrun.com/products/579572|title=old gray - slow burn|website=Flower Girl Records|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>   

In April 2018, the band announced their final shows but cancelled them due to the mental well being of Boucher after a third party claimed they had sexually assaulted a friend of theirs. In December 2018, these claims were refuted in a joint post by both Boucher and the person involved, saying that "they were pressured into making this statement" and that "anything that did occur was not purposeful or malicious."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/sorority-noise-issue-new-statement-about-sexual-assault-allegation/|title=Sorority Noise Issue New Statement About Sexual Assault Allegation|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>
