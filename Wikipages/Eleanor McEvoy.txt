'''Eleanor McEvoy''' (born 22 January 1967) is an Irish singer-songwriter.<ref name="Northern Irish Music Commission">{{cite web|url=http://www.nimusic.com/shownews.asp?id=518 |title=Singer/Songwriter |publisher=NIMIC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915103834/http://www.nimusic.com/shownews.asp?id=518 |archive-date=15 September 2008 }}</ref> She composed the song "Only a Woman's Heart", title track of ''[[A Woman's Heart (compilation album)|A Woman's Heart]]'', the best-selling Irish album in Irish history.<ref name="Billboard" />

== Early life and beginnings ==
McEvoy's life as a musician began at the age of four when she began playing piano. At the age of eight she took up violin. Upon finishing school she attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where she studied music by day and worked in pit orchestras and music clubs by night.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://stairnaheireann.net/2014/01/22/1967-eleanor-mcevoy-musician-singer-and-songwriter-is-born-in-dublin/|title=1967 – Eleanor McEvoy, musician, singer and songwriter, is born in Dublin. – Stair na hÉireann/History of Ireland}}</ref> McEvoy graduated from Trinity with an Honors Degree in music, and spent four months busking in New York City. In 1988, she was accepted into the [[RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra]] where she spent four years before leaving to concentrate on songwriting.
==Career==

===1992–2000===

McEvoy built up a following in clubs in [[Dublin]] with her three piece band, Jim Tate on bass, Noel Eccles on drums, and latterly Bill Shanley on guitar. During a solo date in July 1992, she performed a little-known, self-penned song, "Only a Woman's Heart". [[Mary Black]], of whose band McEvoy was a member, was in the audience and invited her to add the track to an album of Irish female artists.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The album was subsequently titled ''[[A Woman's Heart (compilation album)|A Woman's Heart]]'' and the track was released as the lead single.

A few days before ''A Woman's Heart'' was released, Tom Zutaut [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] from [[Geffen Records]], who had previously signed [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[Edie Brickell]], offered McEvoy a worldwide recording deal after watching her perform at The Baggot Inn in [[Dublin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The album went on to sell over three-quarters of a million copies in Ireland alone and was (and remains) the biggest selling Irish album of all time.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eleanor mcevoy|bio=true}}|title=Only A Woman's Heart|magazine=Billboard.com|year=2007}}</ref>

''[[Eleanor McEvoy (album)|Eleanor McEvoy]]'', her first album, recorded in [[Windmill Lane Studios]], was released in February 1993, and tours in the [[United States]], [[Asia]], and Europe followed. Back on Irish soil, McEvoy was awarded Best New Artist, Best New Performer, and Best Songwriter Awards by the Irish entertainment and music industries. In 2011, Portuguese singer Luis Represas included a version of ''Go Now'' from McEvoy's eponymous album on his recording ''Reserva Especial''.

As she began writing her second album, Tom Zutaut left [[Geffen Records]], and McEvoy was offered and accepted a new deal with [[Columbia Records]] US. The new album, ''[[What's Following Me?]]'', was released in 1996. The single "Precious Little" became a top-10 radio hit in the United States, giving McEvoy the exposure she needed for a headline tour of the US. She was invited to contribute to a number of movie and TV soundtracks.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

At home, the success of ''A Woman's Heart'' continued to overshadow McEvoy's solo work and fans of the mammoth hit were disappointed with the rock elements of the second album and those that might have identified with her bittersweet lyrics, sensual vocals, and loud guitars turned a blind eye to the album.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

McEvoy released her third album, ''[[Snapshots (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Snapshots]]'', in 1999. Her primary goal was to make ''Snapshots'' her most song-oriented album to date.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Toward that goal, McEvoy teamed up with producer [[Rupert Hine]] (who worked with [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Suzanne Vega]], and [[Duncan Sheik]]) and recorded the album at Rupert's "Chateau de la Tour de Moulin" and then in Metropolis Studios in London. The extensive use of drum loops was a complete change in style from her previous work.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The album was greeted by rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. "... her sophisticated voice and compassionate seasoned lyrics ... make Eleanor McEvoy's album a gem...." declared [[The Boston Globe]],<ref name="Boston Globe">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/|title=Snapshots|newspaper=Boston Globe}}</ref> while [[The Sunday Times]] described it as "her strongest album to date, with well appointed social comment topics...McEvoy's take on matters emotional also hits pay dirt with the likes of the excellent 'Did You Tell Him?'"<ref name="The Sunday Times">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news//|title=Snapshots|newspaper=The Sunday Times| location=London}}</ref> However, [[Columbia Records]] had been unprepared for the complete stylistic change and relations between the company and McEvoy became strained. Despite this, a sell-out, 24-date tour of the United States accompanied the release of ''Snapshots'' in the summer of 1999, followed by the "Snapshots Unplugged" tour March–April 2000, which culminated in a performance in [[Boulder, Colorado]] accompanied by the E Town Band where she duetted with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]].

Columbia Records had bought her first album ''Eleanor McEvoy'' from [[Geffen Records]], but had not released it by 2000. Neither ''What's Following Me?'' nor ''Snapshots'' had enjoyed major chart success, and McEvoy's public perception, particularly in Ireland, was caught in a limbo state between rock and folk, with "A Woman's Heart" and its many incarnations still lurking in the back of the minds of the record-buying public.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Increasingly, McEvoy started to work on outside projects. The [[Bert Jansch]] tribute album ''People on the Highway – A Bert Jansch Encomium'' (2000) saw a newly recorded version of Jansch's song about [[Sandy Denny]], "Where Did My Life Go?", recorded by McEvoy especially for the album. Participating artists included [[Al Stewart]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], [[Bernard Butler]], [[Donovan]], and [[Ralph McTell]].

===2001–2005===

McEvoy decided to take her fourth album and head down the independent road. ''[[Yola (Album)|Yola]]'' was a turning point in McEvoy's musical direction. Released in 2001, it reflected the acoustic, jazz-influenced style she had developed on stage with Brian Connor.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For McEvoy it was a new departure and one that found favour with music media. Irish Music Press described it as .... "her finest album", "a brave rejection of the predictable", "musically daring....beautifully atmospheric". International press lauded it as "a back to basics triumph", "beautifully restrained", "a classic", and "McEvoy's best release to date". Extensive touring throughout the US and the UK followed. In 2002, ''[[Yola (album)|Yola]]'' was named "Record of the Year" by Hi-Fi+ Magazine.<ref name="Hi-Fi+ Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://hifiplus.com|title=Record of the Year|publisher=Hi-Fi+ Magazine}}</ref>

March 2004 saw the release of ''[[Early Hours]]'', produced by McEvoy and Brian Connor. The album featured McEvoy on vocals, guitar, and fiddle; Connor on piano, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Hammond organ, and keyboards; Liam Bradley on kit percussion and backing vocals; Calum McColl on guitars and backing vocals; Nicky Scott on bass; and Lindley Hamilton on trumpets. The style differed from McEvoy's previous work, taking on a jazz/blues feel for many of the songs.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} ''Early Hours'' continued the high-quality audio work that had been established with ''Yola''. This album was the first to use TiMax (unique audio imaging) technology, mixed in 5.1 surround-sound onto multi-channel [[Super Audio CD]] (SACD). ''Early Hours'' was voted Best Contemporary Album 2004–2005, by Irish Music Magazine Readers Poll.<ref name="Irish Music Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/|title=Best Contemporary Album 2004–2005|publisher=Irish Music Magazine}}</ref>

McEvoy continued to tour with Brian Connor until April 2005. She then began performing solo, accompanying herself on bass guitar, electric guitar, mandolin and violin. 

===2007–2010===

McEvoy's sixth album, ''[[Out There (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Out There]]'', was recorded in The Grange Studio in Norfolk and released in early 2007. It was self-penned, self-produced and featured McEvoy performing all of the instruments with the exception of a guitar part on "Quote I Love You Unquote" played by [[Dave Rotheray]] (formerly of [[Beautiful South]]) and the drumming of Liam Bradley ([[Van Morrison]], Ronan Keating) on three tracks. On track 5, ''Vigeland's Dream'', McEvoy eloquently describes a walk she once took in Vigeland Sculpture Park which is a part of [[Frogner Park]] (Frognerparken), a public park located in the borough of [[Frogner]], in [[Oslo]], Norway. McEvoy toured the album extensively in Britain, Ireland, Spain and Australia throughout 2007 and early 2008. In 2007, ''Out There'' brought McEvoy her second "Record of the Year" award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine.<ref name="Hi-Fi+ Magazine" />

''[[Love Must Be Tough]]'' (MOSCD404, released 2008), her seventh album, is a departure from previous albums, where all the songs were typically her own. Half of the album features covers of songs originally written and performed by men about women.
[[File:Eleanor McEvoy.jpg|thumb|McEvoy performing in 2008]]
The lead single, "Old, New, Borrowed and Blue", written by McEvoy and long-time friend [[Dave Rotheray]] ([[Beautiful South]]/[[Homespun (band)|Homespun]]), is a twist on the jaundiced over-optimism of the standard wedding song.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Another track by the duo, "The Night May Still Be Young, But I Am Not", is also on the album. In 2008, McEvoy received her third "Record of the Year" award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine.<ref name="Hi-Fi+ Magazine" />

In 2007, McEvoy was awarded "Best Traditional Act" at the 7th annual Big Buzz Awards, which are voted for entirely by the general public.<ref name="The Big Buzz">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbuzzawards.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914101801/http://www.bigbuzzawards.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2008|title=Best Traditional Act|publisher=The Big Buzz}}</ref>

In 2008, McEvoy toured from January to November in the UK, Australia, Spain, Germany, Poland and Ireland, with additional one-off dates in the Far East and elsewhere in Europe, including an appearance at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] in June 2008.

On 21 November 2008, "Easy in Love" from the album ''Love Must Be Tough'' was released as a single to highlight McEvoy's visit to [[Uganda]] on behalf of [[Oxfam]] Ireland.

McEvoy's album ''[[Singled Out (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Singled Out]]'' was released on 28 September 2008. The album is a compilation of singles taken from McEvoy's four award-winning, independently released albums. Three of the albums, ''Yola'', ''Out There'', and ''Love Must Be Tough'', received the Album of the Year Award from ''Hi-Fi+'' Magazine.<ref name="Hi-Fi+ Magazine" />
''Early Hours'' was voted Best Contemporary Album 2004–2005 by Irish Music Magazine Readers Poll.<ref name="Irish Music Magazine" /> The album includes "Did I Hurt You" and "Isn't It a Little Late" from McEvoy's [[double A-side]] single, the world's first single to be released on SACD format.<ref name="SingSong">{{cite web|url=http://www.singsongpr.biz/msm_case1.htm|title=First SACD single|publisher=SingSong}}</ref>
''Singled Out'' includes one new song, "Oh Uganda", which was written by McEvoy after her visit to Northern Uganda as part of her support for the work of ''Oxfam Unwrapped''.

''[[I'd Rather Go Blonde]]'', released 20 September 2010, is McEvoy's eighth album, and was met with good reviews including the five-star review in 2010 Maverick Magazine: "This absolutely stunning album, has been a real find – one of the most compelling female singer-songwriters I've heard in a long time."<ref name="I'd Rather Go Blonde Review">{{Cite journal|url=http://maverick-country.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407175138/http://maverick-country.com/|url-status=live|archive-date=7 April 2004|title=''I'd Rather Go Blonde'' Review|journal=Maverick Magazine|page=72|date=September 2010}}</ref>

===2011–2014===

''[[Alone (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Alone]]'', McEvoy's ninth album, released 12 September 2011, is a collection of twelve stripped-down solo numbers. Says McEvoy, ""There was a time when I was stranded in a long gap between tour dates and, with time to kill, I headed for the peace of The Grange; a small studio tucked away in the Norfolk countryside." The product of those tranquil sessions is an album of incredibly haunting performances, up close, personal, and timeless. This is McEvoy in her most intimate setting, running through the journey of her writing and singing career.

''[[If You Leave...]]'' McEvoy's tenth studio album was released 6 May 2013. It features eight new songs and four interpretations including "[[God Only Knows]]", "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]", and "Lift The Wings" from ''[[Riverdance]]''. Said McEvoy, "I'd been listening to a lot of 60s albums, Stones, Beatles, Beach Boys stuff like that and it was with the spirit of those albums in my musical soul that I entered the studio."

"[[STUFF (Eleanor McEvoy album)|STUFF]]" McEvoy's eleventh studio album, was released on 21 March 2014. The tracks on the album were compiled to meet the requests from fans for songs they couldn't find elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} McEvoy chose the songs from her collection of single mixes, audiophile tracks, and songs written and performed on other artists records. McEvoy then went into the studio to record tracks that weren't found in her collection. After all songs were recorded the entire album was re-mastered.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
===2015–present===
[[File:Eleanor McEvoy (March 16, 2014).jpg|thumb|McEvoy in 2014]]
''[[Naked Music (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Naked Music]]'' is McEvoy's twelfth studio album, recorded at the Grange Studio in Norfolk, UK. McEvoy recorded the tracks by "studio-performing", in other words, playing the songs as she would in a live performance. The album's concept was partially inspired by a painting entitled 'Champagne Sheila' by [[Chris Gollon]], and the cover artwork features four of his paintings. In January 2016 in association with IAP Fine Art, the album was launched in London, in an exhibition of Gollon's paintings inspired by the album's songs. Later the same year NAKED MUSIC: ''The Songbook'' was published by Hot Press, documenting the association and collaboration, the songs and the paintings they inspired, with text and interviews by Jackie Hayden.<ref name="auto16">{{cite book| title=NAKED MUSIC: The Songbook. |year=2016 |publisher=Hot Press |isbn=978-0-9576114-2-9 }}</ref> One of the songs on the album, Eleanor McEvoy co-wrote with [[Lloyd Cole]] entitled 'Dreaming of Leaving', which then inspired a painting by Chris Gollon 'Dreaming of Leaving (I)', which was featured inside the album cover. This painting in turn inspired McEvoy to write the song 'Gimme Some Wine', which she wrote for and dedicated to [[Chris Gollon]]. This unusual and ongoing experiment in artistic 'boundary crossing' proved very fruitful, as songs inspired paintings, which in turn inspired songs that inspired paintings. [[Chris Gollon]] responded to the song 'Gimme Some Wine' by painting 23 works, some on paper, some on canvas, and they were his last great series of paintings before his untimely death in April 2017. They were first exhibited at IAP Fine Art in Monmouth in the 'Gimme Some Wine' exhibition, with Eleanor McEvoy performing the song that inspired them at the private view.

In 2017 McEvoy was appointed Chairperson of the [[Irish Music Rights Organisation]] (IMRO).<ref name="

In January 2019, McEvoy appeared as a contestant on [[RTÉ]]'s ''[[Home of the Year|Celebrity Home of the Year]].''

In 2019, the two-year collaboration with [[Chris Gollon]] featured in the three-month major museum retrospective at [[Huddersfield Art Gallery]], showing Gollon's music-related works and including the canvas 'Gimme Some Wine – Final Version', for which Eleanor McEvoy made a special recording of the song 'Gimme Some Wine'.<ref name="auto12">{{cite book| title=Chris Gollon: Beyond the Horizon | publisher=IAP Fine Art | year=2019 | isbn=978-0-9530584-3-3 }}</ref>

== "Only a Woman's Heart" ==

"Only a Woman's Heart" written by McEvoy is the title song of the album ''[[A Woman's Heart (compilation album)|A Woman's Heart]]'' which went on to sell over three-quarters of a million copies in Ireland alone and was (and remains) the biggest selling [[Irish Albums Chart|Irish]] album of all time.<ref name="Billboard" />

The song "Only A Woman's Heart" has been covered by a number of artists including:
*[[Emmylou Harris]] with [[Mary Black]] on Black's 1996 album ''Wonder Child''
*[[Phil Coulter]] on his 2005 album ''Recollections''
*French Canadian singer [[Isabelle Boulay]]. Boulay's version appeared on her album ''[[De retour à la source]]'', which was nominated as one of the five finalists for the 2008 [[Juno Awards]] for the category "Francophone Album of The Year".
*''Les mejores canciones dance del Siglo XX – Vol. 11'', 2011
*[[Celtic Woman]] 2012 album ''[[Celtic Woman: Believe]]''

"Only A Woman's Heart" also has a page and half mention in [[Charles Webb (author)|Charles Webb]]'s book ''New Cardiff'', which was made into the movie ''[[Hope Springs (2012 film)|Hope Springs]]''. Webb's book, ''The Graduate'', was the basis for the award-winning film ''[[The Graduate]]''.

2012 marks the twentieth anniversary of ''A Woman's Heart''. The anniversary was celebrated with four sold-out performances at the [[Olympia Theatre (Dublin)|Olympia Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. Eleanor McEvoy, [[Mary Coughlan (singer)|Mary Coughlan]], [[Sharon Shannon]], [[Dolores Keane]], [[Wallis Bird]], and Hermione Hennessy were on the bill. Further anniversary concerts are being planned.

In April 2012, Kiera Murphy produced at documentary entitled ''Our Woman's Hearts''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2012/0419/647060-documentary-podcast-womans-heart/|title=Our Women's Hearts | work=RTÉ News}}</ref> which explores how ''[[A Woman's Heart (compilation album)|A Woman's Heart]]'' came about, why it became so popular, as well as the effect it has had on three generations of women. The documentary is a part of [[RTÉ Radio 1]]'s series ''Documentary on One''.

''[[The Secret of Living (single)|The Secret of Living]] '', written by McEvoy, was released in July 2012 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the iconic ''A Woman's Heart''. The song is performed by McEvoy, Mary Coughlan, [[Sharon Shannon]], [[Gemma Hayes]], and Hermione Hennessey. In a review from ''[[Hot Press]]'', ''The Secret of Living'' was described as a classy new single from the ''A Woman's Heart'' group.<ref name="Hot Press">{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/9056489.html|title=New Woman's Heart gig and single|publisher=Hot Press.com|date=1 August 2012}}</ref>

== Other projects ==

; OXFAM

In October 2008, at the invitation of [[Oxfam]] Ireland, McEvoy visited Uganda. Travelling throughout the [[Kitgum]] region of Northern Uganda, she experienced first hand the benefits of Oxfam Ireland Unwrapped, an initiative that sends meaningful presents like clean drinking water, school books and vegetable gardens to developing countries throughout Africa. This visit provided the inspiration for a new song "Oh Uganda".

; Midge Ure

[[Midge Ure]]'s top-twenty album ''Breathe'' features McEvoy on three tracks, "Fallen Angel", "Fields of Fire" and "Lay My Body Down". McEvoy contributed the [[Irish Gaelic|Gaelic]] lyrics on "Fallen Angel". The album was produced by Richard Feldman.

; RTÉ Concert Orchestra

In 2005, the [[RTÉ Concert Orchestra]] commissioned arrangements for 16 of McEvoy's compositions to be performed at a concert in August 2005 at the National Concert Hall in Dublin.
