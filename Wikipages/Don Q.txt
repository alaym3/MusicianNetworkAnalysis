==History==
The Serrallés family migrated from [[Catalonia]] to [[Puerto Rico]] in the mid-1830s, and established a [[sugar cane]] [[plantation]] in the outskirts of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. They were successful in harvesting and refining cane sugar and exporting it to the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. The plantation became very prosperous, and virtually became a [[company town]], with its own [[Rail transport|rail]] line, workers' housing, transportation fleet, commissary, and private—later public—airport (Ponce's [[Mercedita Airport]]). Most of these operations were eventually annexed to the municipality of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], in whose lands the plantation is based.<ref>[http://www.destileriaserralles.com/history.swf Destileria Serralles History]</ref>

In 1865, the family opened a [[rum]] manufacturer at the [[plantation]], ''"[[Hacienda Mercedita]]"''. On that year, [[Juan Serrallés]], who would go down as one of the most successful liquor salesmen in Puerto Rican history, imported a still from [[France]], which enabled him to produce his first casks of rum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6ex-yW0Ds8C&pg=PA99|title=Rum: The Epic Story Of The Drink That Conquered The World|first=Charles A.|last=Coulombe|date=July 6, 2005|publisher=Citadel Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The Serrallés operation produced various local rum brands, most of which were short-lived. Inspired by the success of other rum producers in the island, the family decided to launch a refined brand with the intention of exporting it elsewhere. The Don Q brand was launched in 1932, and became popular with locals who considered rival [[Bacardi]] either harsher in taste or a foreign brand (when Bacardí opened its distilling operations in Puerto Rico in the early 1930s it was considered a Cuban brand since its headquarters were in [[Cuba]]; since the 1960s Cuban revolution, Bacardi has had its headquarters in [[Bermuda]]).

By the 1960s, Don Q was available on most of Puerto Rico's important supermarket chains, such as [[Pueblo Supermarkets|Pueblo]] and others. It also became available at [[Amigo Supermarkets|Amigo]].<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cruisemates.com/articles/ports/sanjuan.cfm|title=San Juan, Puerto Rico; Cruise Ship Ports and Cruising Regions|website=www.cruisemates.com}}</ref>

==Distillation process==
Don Q is [[distillation|distilled]] from [[sugar cane]]. The combination of the type of [[yeast]]s employed for [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]], distillation method, aging conditions, and blending determines the characteristic flavor of rum. Made with [[molasses]], water, [[Mashing|mash]], and yeast, ''Don Q'' is distilled in a continuous still. Once distilled, the clear spirit is aged in oak barrels for up to a year per Puerto Rican law, adding a golden color and character to the rum. Flavors and spices, if any, are added as an option at this point. The brand’s taste is achieved through a proprietary recipe, which is blended into the rum mixture at the final stages of production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://is4ie.org/Content/Documents/Document.ashx?DocId=79424|title='''2003 Industrial Symbiosis in Rum Production.'''

==International awards and recognitions==
Despite focusing on the middle and lower end of the price spectrum, five of seven Don Q offerings have achieved a modicum of success at international [[spirit ratings]] competitions.  For example, its Don Q Gran Añejo rum earned one double gold, two silver, and one bronze medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competitions between 2008 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proof66.com/rum/don-q-gran-anejo-rum.html|title=Proof66.com Website|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

Also, in 2010, Don Q scored high at the Spirits International Prestige (SIP) Awards, in [[San Diego, California]]. Competing against hundreds of rums from around the globe, Don Q Añejo, Don Q Gran Añejo, Don Q Cristal, Don Q Coco, Don Q Mojito and Don Q Limón were awarded rankings in the “Platinum-Best in Class” and “Gold” categories. In this competition, according to Alberto "Tito" Torruella Bartolomei, Don Q's VP for Manufacturing, all of the Don Q products brought to the competition received awards. Unlike other awards, the SIP Awards select consumers for judges. "It is not the first time that Destilería Serrallés receives an international award. In a recent competition in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], Don Q Cristal received the top award within the category “Best Mojito”. Don Q Oro also received an award.<ref>
