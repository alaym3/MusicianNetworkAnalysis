==History==

===Early history (1999–2002)===
Dashboard Confessional's first recording was the [[2000 in music|2000]] [[LP record|LP]] ''[[The Swiss Army Romance]]'', initially a solo side project of Chris Carrabba while he was in the band [[Further Seems Forever]]. The following year, [[Further Seems Forever]], with [[Chris Carrabba]], recorded its debut album, ''[[The Moon Is Down (album)|The Moon Is Down]]''. Carrabba left the band before the album was released<ref>{{Cite web|title=Further Seems Forever: A Tale of Three Singers (S1 Ep1)|url=https://soundcloud.com/tooth-and-nail-records/further-seems-forever-a-tale-of-three-singers-s1-ep1|language=en|access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> to record and release his second solo album, ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'', and a follow-up EP, ''So Impossible''; both were released under the name Dashboard Confessional.

By 2002, three other musicians had joined Dashboard Confessional. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', and the subsequent [[MTV Unplugged 2.0|live release]] marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band. Also in 2002, the music video for "[[Screaming Infidelities]]" won the MTV2 award at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, beating out [[Norah Jones]], [[The Strokes]], [[The Hives]], [[Nappy Roots]], and [[Musiq]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilcha|first=Kristin|date=September 6, 2002|title=SuperMega/Palomar and FM Rocks Top MTV Awards|url=http://www.shootonline.com/node/28469|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413011520/https://www.shootonline.com/node/28469|archive-date=2016-04-13|access-date=|website=SHOOTonline|publisher=DCA Business Media LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458151/20021015/dashboard_confessional.jhtml |first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|title=New Dashboard Confessional: Still Emotional, But More Musical |date=October 15, 2002|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=July 9, 2009}}</ref> This video starred Carrabba in both the performance and the storyline.

===''A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar'' (2003–05)===
In [[2003 in music|2003]], Dashboard Confessional released its third album, ''[[A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar]]''. Peaking at No.&nbsp;2 on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, the album proved to be the band's most commercially viable album yet. In the fall of 2003, Dashboard Confessional toured with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2003/10/06/brand-new-gives-the-teenage-girls-tremors-dashboard-goes-unnoticed/|title=Brand New gives the teenage girls tremors; Dashboard goes unnoticed|first=James|last=Cocoran|date=October 6, 2003|work=[[The Chicago Maroon]]}}</ref><ref name="DC_BrandNew">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57213/dashboard-brand-new-re-team-for-fall-tour|date=September 18, 2006|title=Dashboard, Brand New Re-Team for Fall Tour|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/11/qa-dashboard-confessionals-chris-carrabba/|title=Q&A: Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba|first=Kevin|last=O'Donnell|date=November 19, 2010|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref>

In the summer of 2004, Dashboard Confessional recorded the song "[[Vindicated (song)|Vindicated]]" for the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. It was featured on the soundtrack and played over the film's end credits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Valmero|first=Anna| date=May 27, 2010 |url=http://loqal.ph/arts-and-entertainment/2010/05/27/chris-carabba-shares-stories-behind-dashboard-confessionals-music/| title=Chris Carrabba shares stories behind Dashboard Confessional's music|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217075253/http://loqal.ph/arts-and-entertainment/2010/05/27/chris-carabba-shares-stories-behind-dashboard-confessionals-music/ |archive-date=December 17, 2011|work=loQal.ph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Richardson |first=Sean|date=June 24, 2004|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/future/documents/03910180.asp |title=Vindication: Emo superhero Chris Carrabba puts a new spin on ''Spider-Man''| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402062609/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/future/documents/03910180.asp |archive-date=April 2, 2013|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/super/super/view/20100529-272645/Chris-Carrabba-knows-how-to-be-funny|first=Jed-Angelo Q.|last=Segovia|title= Chris Carrabba knows how to be funny|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209101724/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/super/super/view/20100529-272645/Chris-Carrabba-knows-how-to-be-funny |archive-date=December 9, 2013|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=kNxzdnZVIp0|title=Dashboard Confessional – Vindicated}}</ref> Due to such usage, the band gained a sizable audience for their next release the following summer, ''[[Dusk and Summer]]''. "Vindicated" was not, however, released on ''A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar'' but was included on most versions and deluxe edition versions of ''Dusk and Summer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dashboard-Confessional-Dusk-And-Summer-Deluxe-Edition/release/1288391|title=Dashboard Confessional – ''Dusk and Summer'': Deluxe Edition|publisher=[[Discogs]]|access-date=January 23, 2014}}</ref>

===''Dusk and Summer'' (2005–06)===
In May [[2005 in music|2005]], Dashboard Confessional entered the studio to record their fourth album with acclaimed producer [[Daniel Lanois]]. The album, ''[[Dusk and Summer]]'', was released on June 27, 2006; its first single was "[[Don't Wait (Dashboard Confessional song)|Don't Wait]]". Following the release of ''Dusk and Summer'', Dashboard Confessional went on a summer tour of the U.S. with special guests [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]] and [[Ben Lee]],<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.spin.com/2006/05/dashboard-tour-through-dusk-summer/|title=Dashboard to Tour Through Dusk, Summer|date=May 11, 2006|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> followed by co-headlining an arena tour with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]].<ref name="DC_BrandNew" />

===''The Shade of Poison Trees'' (2007–09)===
In [[2007 in music|2007]], Dashboard Confessional released its follow-up to ''Dusk and Summer'', ''[[The Shade of Poison Trees]].'' Unlike its predecessor, this album reflects back on the earlier influence of Carrabba's acoustic harmonies from ''The Swiss Army Romance'' and ''The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most''.

===''Alter the Ending, The Swiss Army Romance'' re-release (2009–10)===
Dashboard Confessional began recording their sixth studio album, ''[[Alter the Ending]]'', in 2008. Carrabba stated that the album could have turned into a concept album:
<blockquote>
"...only with the last three has it become, like, 'All right, these have a continuity, and there's something going on,' so I'm excited to see where that leads."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049381/carrabba-already-14-songs-into-next-dashboard-cd |title=Carrabba Already 14 Songs Into Next Dashboard CD|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| first=Gary|last=Graff|date=September 11, 2007}}</ref>
</blockquote>

On February 14, 2009, as a special [[Valentine's Day]] gift to fans, Carrabba released a free download on his [[MySpace]] page entitled "Even Now (Acoustic Version)" from their forthcoming studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://archives.collegian.com/2009/12/17/dashboard_confessionals_new_album/|title=Dashboard Confessional's new album doesn't ''Alter'' the style|first=Ian|last=Mahan|date=November 10, 2009|work=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]}}</ref> In June 2009, the band began "sequencing the album," suggesting that the upcoming album was close to completion.

In August 2009, Dashboard Confessional contributed a song to the motion picture soundtrack for the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'', titled "Finishing School."<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Zahn|url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/reviews/3693-jennifers-body-music-from-the-motion-picture-review.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828134408/http://www.fangoria.com/musick/reviews/3693-jennifers-body-music-from-the-motion-picture-review.html |archive-date=August 28, 2009|title=Jennifer's Body - Music from the Motion Picture (Review)|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=August 25, 2009 }}</ref> It was not featured on ''Alter the Ending''.

It was found out that the album would be released on two discs, the first of which consisted of the full-band version of the album and the second consisted of the acoustic version. In addition, Carrabba stated that Dashboard Confessional would be touring with [[New Found Glory]] and [[Never Shout Never]] in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Carrabba |url=https://twitter.com/ChrisCarrabba |title=Chris Carrabba (ChrisCarrabba) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266856/dashboard-confessional-doubles-down-with-alter-the-ending|first=Laura|last=Leebove|title=Dashboard Confessional Doubles Down With 'After The Ending'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 30, 2009|access-date=November 1, 2009}}</ref> On October 30, 2009, however, Carrabba announced via Twitter and [[Facebook]] that, due to a last-minute family emergency, the band would be cancelling their ''Alter the Ending'' tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never with the exception of a November 7 concert with the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. Although the longer tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never was cancelled, Carrabba announced on his website on November 10, 2009, that he and John Lefler would begin a 13-date acoustic tour with New Found Glory (who played acoustic sets as well) on November 30, 2009.
