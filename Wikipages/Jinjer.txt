'''Jinjer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|dʒ|ər}} "ginger") is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[metalcore]] band from [[Donetsk]], formed in 2009. None of the founding members remain with the band. The current lineup considers 2010 as its official year of formation, with the arrival of singer Tatiana Shmailyuk and guitarist Roman Ibramkhalilov.<ref name="Formation">{{cite web | author = Jinjer – Official Site |title=Biography|url=http://jinjer-metal.com/bio#full |access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref> The band has since added bassist Eugene Abdukhanov and drummer Vladislav Ulasevich. Their most recent album ''Wallflowers'' was released in August 2021.

== History ==
Jinjer was formed in 2009 by singer Maksym Fatullaiev, guitarist Dmitriy Oksen, and drummer Vyacheslav Okhrimenko. This lineup released the four-song EP ''Objects in Mirror Are Closer than They Appear''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jinjer : Objects in Mirror Are Closer Then They Appear|url=https://www.spirit-of-metal.com/en/album/Objects_in_Mirror_Are_Closer_Then_They_Appear/361791|access-date=2021-09-19|website=www.spirit-of-metal.com}}</ref> In 2010, Fatullaiev was replaced by Tatiana Shmailyuk and Roman Ibramkhalilov joined on second guitar. The band then expanded to a five-piece with the addition of bassist Eugene Abdukhanov in 2011,<ref name = "Eugene joined">{{cite web |author= FenrirXXII |title=Jinjer Backstory |url= https://www.last.fm/music/Jinjer/+wiki |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> while Okhrimenko was replaced by Oleksandr Koziychuk.

This lineup self-released the EP ''Inhale, Do Not Breathe'' in 2012. Jinjer began relentlessly touring on their own funds.<ref name="Popularity Spike">{{cite web | author =Jinjer – Official Facebook Site |title=Biography-FB |url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/JinjerOfficial/about/?ref=page_internal |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> They were noticed by The Leaders Records in late 2012, and ''Inhale, Don't Breathe'' was officially re-released in 2013 in an extended format with three live tracks. The band won the "Best Ukrainian Metal Act" award held by Kyiv's InshaMuzyka label in 2013 (they would win that award again in 2016).

Jinjer self-released their first full-length album ''Cloud Factory'' in 2014; the album featured another new drummer, Yevhen Mantulin. The album would later be picked up and re-released by their current record label, [[Napalm Records]].<ref name = "Cloud Factory">{{cite web |author=GhostCultMag |title=Jinjer – Cloud Factory |url=https://www.ghostcultmag.com/album-review-jinjer-cloud-factory-napalm-records/ |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref> Jinjer began touring internationally and personally booked their own shows.<ref name="Formation"/> The final remaining founding member, Dmitriy Olsen, departed in 2015 and was not replaced, leaving Ibramkhalilov as sole guitarist.

After several tours around the world, they released their second full-length album ''King of Everything'' in 2016, along with the single "Pisces". Dmitriy Kim served as drummer on this album. Videos for "Pisces" and "I Speak Astronomy" became popular on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pms4F5OyM3g|publisher=YouTube|author=[[Loudwire]]|title=Jinjer on War in Ukraine, Rejecting Popularity + 'Macro'}}</ref><ref name="Jinjer">{{cite web |author=Jinjer – Official Band Site |title=Biography |url=http://jinjer-metal.com/about |access-date=13 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306152553/http://jinjer-metal.com/about |archive-date=6 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2021 [[Metal Hammer]] included "Pisces" at No. 74 in their list of "The 100 Greatest Metal Songs of the 21st Century".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-metal-songs-21st-century/3|title=The 100 greatest metal songs of the 21st century|last=Metal Hammer|date=16 May 2021|website=loudersound.com|access-date=10 July 2021}}</ref> Shortly after the release of ''King of Everything'', drummer Vladislav Ulasevich joined and the band's lineup has remained stable since.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frays|first=Claire|date=2020-03-17|title=Jinjer Drummer Vladislav Ulasevich Interviewed December 2019|url=https://www.rocksins.com/2020/03/interview-with-jinjers-vladislav-ulasevich-i-dont-know-what-we-will-do-next-time-just-yet-you-will-have-to-come-along-to-see-39210/|access-date=2021-09-19|website=Rock Sins|language=en-GB}}</ref>
