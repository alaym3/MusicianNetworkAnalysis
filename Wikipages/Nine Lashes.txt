'''Nine Lashes''' is an American [[Christian rock]] band from [[Birmingham, Alabama]] formed in 2006. They independently released their first album, ''[[Escape (Nine Lashes album)|Escape]]'', in 2009 before [[Trevor McNevan]] of [[Thousand Foot Krutch]] brought them to the attention of [[Tooth & Nail Records]]. Upon signing to the label, the band recorded their second album ''[[World We View]]'' and released it on February 14, 2012. The album sold well, making several [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. The band released their third album, ''[[From Water to War]]'' on January 21, 2014. After a change in direction, the band released their fourth album, the [[electronica]] and [[Christian rock]] styled ''[[Ascend (Nine Lashes album)|Ascend]]'' on March 11, 2016.

==History==
The band was formed in 2006 around founding members guitarist Adam "Tank" Jefferson and original drummer Keith Cunningham, who had played together in another band for several years prior. Jared "Gus" Lankford and Adam's brother Jon Jefferson joined as bassist and guitarist, and lead singer Jeremy Dunn joined in 2007 after the band's original vocalist got married and decided to settle down. During this early period, the band opened for [[Day of Fire]] at [[Life Church]] in [[Trussville, Alabama]], was interviewed on [[WDJC-FM]], and worked extensively with the organization [[Teen Challenge]].<ref name="RNB interview">{{cite web|title=The World We View.

To this end, Jon sent a copy of ''Escape'' to Joe Posey, the festival's [[tour promoter|promoter]]. Posey liked the album and decided to attend one of the band's concerts to see if they could play live. Even more impressed by the band's live performance, he forwarded his copy of ''Escape'' along with a recommendation to his longtime friend [[Trevor McNevan]], himself a well-known musician and producer. Recovering at home from a [[ruptured appendix]], McNevan was able to hear the album despite his busy schedule, shared Posey's enthusiasm, and passed the album on to [[Brandon Ebel]], president and CEO of [[Tooth & Nail Records]] (to which McNevan's own bands [[Thousand Foot Krutch]] and [[FM Static]] were signed).<ref name="RNB interview" /><ref name="Cross Rhythms" /><ref name="Christian Post" /><ref>{{cite web|title=How Nine Lashes got its start!|url=http://www.hearitfirst.com/artisthome.aspx?f=artisthome&artist_id=4796&vid=1054888|work=Hearitfirst.com|publisher=[[EMI Christian Music Group]]|access-date=May 11, 2012|format=video interview}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The World According To Nine Lashes|url=http://jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/NineLashes2012.asp|publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout|access-date=May 11, 2012|author=Michael Weaver|format=interview|date=Feb 2012}}</ref> This resulted in Nine Lashes signing with the label, which was officially announced on June 27, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tooth & Nail Brings Nine Lashes Into The Family!|url=http://www.toothandnail.com/news/3647/Tooth_Nail_Brings_Nine_Lashes_Into_The_Family/|publisher=[[Tooth & Nail Records]]|access-date=May 11, 2012|format=press release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203110200/http://www.toothandnail.com/news/3647/Tooth_Nail_Brings_Nine_Lashes_Into_The_Family/|archive-date=February 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', Dunn stated: "We really pushed ourselves to add to our sound with this album. We really wanted to take the digital aspect of our sound from the last album, like the 'Anthem [of the Lonely]' intro or 'The Intervention,' and expand upon it. I think we ended up with a really well-rounded album."<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/2013/nov/azp3f/CCM_November_2013.pdf | title=Rock Spotlight: Nine Lashes | magazine=[[CCM Magazine]] | date=November 2013 | access-date=November 1, 2013 | author=Argyrakis, Andy | page=71}}</ref>

The band's fourth album, ''Ascend'', was released on March 11, 2016.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The album largely abandons the group's [[hard rock]] sound in favor of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[dubstep]]-inspired music. However, seven singles released between 2018 and 2020 show a return to hard rock.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
