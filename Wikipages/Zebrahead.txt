=== 1996–2001: Formation and early years ===
[[File:Zebrahead-Logo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Zebrahead's logo]]
Zebrahead was formed in [[La Habra, California]] in summer 1996<ref>{{cite web | last = Boehm | first = Mike | date = October 13, 1998 | title = Bold News Stripe

All four musicians, whose bands at the time shared the same practice space, became acquainted with one another after experimenting with different music styles together. This led to all four leaving their respective bands and forming their own and naming it Zebrahead.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Inspired by bands such as [[Fugazi]] and [[Descendents]] and uninterested in the [[ska-punk|local musical trends of the time]], Zebrahead began experimenting and incorporating elements of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] into their sound, leading to the inclusion of rapper [[Ali Tabatabaee]] as a co-vocalist.<ref name="Zebrahead Biography">{{cite web|title=Zebrahead Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zebrahead-mn0000965438/biography|work=AllMusic|publisher=Jason Ankeny|access-date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>  The first song ever composed was "Check", which was later included on their first demo tape, ''One More Hit'', released shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiponline.com/504/zebrahead.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427150130/http://www.hiponline.com/504/zebrahead.html|url-status=live|archivedate=April 27, 2021|title=Zebrahead|date=January 7, 2008|publisher=Hip Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zebrahead.org/disco.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305035147fw_/http://www.zebrahead.org/disco.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=March 5, 2001|title=Zebrahead Discography|date=March 5, 2001|publisher=Zebrahead.org}}</ref>

The band issued their [[Zebrahead (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 1998 through indie label [[Doctor Dream Records]], before signing with major label [[Columbia Records]] to release their mainstream debut ''[[Waste of Mind]]'' later that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Waste of Mind at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Zebrahead-Waste-Of-Mind/release/4977505|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2013|format=Database|year=1998}}</ref> The album contains several re-recorded songs from their demo release alongside new tracks, including the minor radio hit "[[Get Back (Zebrahead song)|Get Back]]", which charted at No. 32 on the U.S. [[Alternative Songs|Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] charts. The band's follow-up ''[[Playmate of the Year (album)|Playmate of the Year]]'' was released in August 2000 and charted at No.4 on the U.S. [[Top Heatseekers]] chart. The extended play ''Stupid Fat Americans'' followed in February 2001 as a Japan-exclusive release.

=== 2002–2005: ''MFZB'' and Mauriello's departure ===
Zebrahead recorded and released their fourth studio album, ''[[MFZB]]'', in 2003; this was their last publication under Columbia Records. The album is noted for trading in the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] [[funk]] elements of the band's previous releases in favor of a heavier [[punk rock]] sound that would eventually carry over and develop in future releases. Zebrahead spent the majority of 2004 promoting the album at various festivals in Japan, including the [[Summer Sonic Festival]].<ref name="Summer Sonic 2003">{{cite web|title=Summer Sonic 2003|url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/24221-summer-sonic/id/2956951-summer-sonic-tokyo-2003|work=SongKick.com|publisher=SongKick|access-date=April 3, 2014}}</ref> The band's extensive touring earned them a sizeable fanbase in the country, leading ''MFZB'' to chart at No.9 on the [[Oricon|Japanese Charts]] and earn a [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] certification. A follow-up to ''MFZB'' titled ''[[Waste of MFZB]]'' – containing songs that didn't make the final cut of the former – was released exclusively in Japan in July 2004<ref name="Waste of MFZB on Sony Music">{{cite web|title=Waste of MFZB on Sony Music|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/artist/Zebrahead/discography/SICP-609|work=sonymusic.co.jp|publisher=Sony Music|access-date=January 12, 2014|language=ja|quote="The songs in the album are songs that were recorded for previous album "MFZB", but it's not because they were not good, but because they were dangerously good! "- Justin}}</ref> where it topped the ''[[Billboard Japan]]'' chart.

Shortly after Zebrahead's Japanese tour, co-vocalist/rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello left the band due to creative differences.<ref name="Justins departure">{{cite web|last=Kloke|first=Joshua|title=Zebrahead|url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/zebrahead|work=Beat.com|publisher=Beat|access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> As the singing/rapping dynamic between Mauriello and co-vocalist Ali Tabatabaee was crucial to Zebrahead's sound, the band immediately began the search for a replacement. [[Matty Lewis]], a former member of the band [[Matty Lewis|Jank 1000]] that had previously toured with Zebrahead, was advised by Udhus and Osmundson to try out for the part in December 2004, to which he won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the59thsound.com/matty-lewis---zebrahead-09112012.html|title=Matty's interview|access-date=November 3, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211001704/http://www.the59thsound.com/matty-lewis---zebrahead-09112012.html|archive-date=December 11, 2015}}</ref> Lewis' inclusion was announced at a private concert at the Anaheim House of Blues, California on March 8, 2005, before the group started recording their next studio album.

=== 2006–2012: ''Broadcast to the World'',  ''Phoenix'', ''Panty Raid'' and ''Get Nice!'' ===
[[File:Zebrahead 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Zebrahead performing in 2006]]
Zebrahead's sixth album ''[[Broadcast to the World]]'' debuted in February 2006 in Japan, where it certified gold. It was later issued in other countries as the year progressed. During that time, the band toured the U.S. as part of the [[Warped Tour]] festival<ref name="Vans Warped Tour 2006 Lineup">{{cite web|title=Vans Warped Tour 2006|url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/1550-vans-warped-tour/id/2283056-vans-warped-tour-2006|work=songkick.com|publisher=Song Kick|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref> and later Europe, notably playing at the UK's annual [[Download Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DOWNLOAD FESTIVAL 2006|url=http://www.downloadfestival.co.uk/history/2006|work=Downloadfestival.co.uk|publisher=Download Festival|access-date=January 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403014303/http://www.downloadfestival.co.uk/history/2006|archive-date=April 3, 2014}}</ref>

The band later returned to the UK and performed at the Download, Leeds Slam Dunk and Greenfield festivals, before going on to tour the rest of Europe and Japan for the remainder of the year. An American leg of the tour was originally planned to take place after, however, Lewis became ill, and in order to avoid permanent damage to his voice, the tour was cancelled.<ref name="Zebrahead pull US tour in 2008">{{cite web|title=Zebrahead pull US tour|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2008/08/zebrahead-pull-us-tour.html|work=Alterthepress.com|publisher=Alter The Press|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

In Spring 2009, Zebrahead announced the release of a [[Cover version|cover album]] featuring songs originally sung by female musicians from the 1990s–2000s for the following November. ''[[Panty Raid (album)|Panty Raid]]'' is preceded by the single "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)#Zebrahead|Girlfriend]]" originally by [[Avril Lavigne]].<ref name="Zebrahead covers Avril Lavigne">{{cite web|title=Zebrahead covers Avril Lavigne|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/11226/Zebrahead-Cover-Avril-Lavigne/|work=Sputnik Music|publisher=J.

After recording in the first half of the year, Zebrahead's tenth studio album ''[[Call Your Friends]]'' was released worldwide in August 2013. Around the same time, the band announced the departure of guitarist Greg Bergdorf, who chose to leave in order to spend more time with his family.

In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of Zebrahead's formation, the band released their first compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits? – Volume 1]]'' on March 11, 2015, exclusively in Japan. As well as familiar material, the compilation features several re-recorded songs from the band's earlier albums with former lead singer/rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello, this time featuring current lead Matty Lewis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/artist/Zebrahead/info/450335 |script-title=ja:インフォメーション |publisher=Sony Music |access-date=August 1, 2015|language=ja}}</ref> The re-recorded songs were released separately outside Japan as the band's eleventh studio album under the title ''[[The Early Years – Revisited]]'' on April 21, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gironas |first=Maria |url=http://substreammagazine.com/2015/02/zebrahead-re-record-early-material-with-new-vocalist-for-the-early-years-revisited/ |title=Zebrahead re-record early material with new vocalist for 'The Early Years—Revisited' |publisher=Substream Magazine |access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref>
