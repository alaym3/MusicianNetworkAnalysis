==Artistry==

===Styling===
Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by [[Giorgio Armani]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/life/article/Il-Divo-just-can-t-go-casual-1587293.php|title=Il Divo just can't go casual|first=Joy|last=Sewing|date=17 June 2009|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}</ref> (Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ueberlingen2020.de/95TvDlDF/ttnS/5XYy/Jsy/|title=Il Divo viste de Gucci}}</ref> and costumes and accessories: [[William Hunt, Luxury British Menswear|William Hunt]], [[Versace]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Tom Ford]] and [[Gucci]].
{{Quote|Il Divo is a powerful and fascinating presence, in these years have been a great inspiration for me. I remember the first time I saw them performing live: I was impressed by their elegance and their fascinating way to communicate emotions through his music orig.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designtaxi.com/interstitial.html?v=1&advertiser=External&return_url=http://designtaxi.com/news/22559/Giorgio-Armani-Il-Divo-Collaborate-For-The-Promise/?month=11&year=|title=DesignTAXI - Interstitial Advertisement|website=Designtaxi.com}}</ref>|Giorgio Armani}}
{{Quote|Il Divo's style is so elegant, it describes our music. It's a dress in the style of the ''Rat Pack'' which was composed of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wvw.aldia.cr/ad_ee/2012/septiembre/18/espectaculos3322327.html|title=Soy un toro español|date=18 September 2012 |location=Costa Rica}}</ref>|Carlos Marín}}

===Musical style===
Il Divo changed the genre of opera with their musical combination of opera singing and classical music, with themes of different [[genres]], including [[Latin]], [[folk music|folk]], [[ballads]], [[church music]], [[bolero]] and pop.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.infobae.com/opera/2012/10/19/il-divo-no-es-opera/|title="Il Divo" no es ópera | date=19 October 2012 | publisher=[[Infobae]] | access-date=26 January 2015 }}</ref>
But his [[Emotion|lyrical]] voices kept playing emblematic songs, it is not synonymous with opera, nor pop.<ref name="magia-de-la-ópera-pop">{{cite news|url=http://www.laopinion.com/Il_Divo:__magia_de_la_opera_pop|title=Il Divo: magia de la ópera pop|date=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[La Opinión]]|access-date=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205094534/http://www.laopinion.com/Il_Divo:__magia_de_la_opera_pop|archive-date=5 December 2014}}</ref> There is talk of an intermediate term, but not of a merger between the two, since such lines that can not be merged, as David describes himself:
{{Quote|Pop is here, the opera is there and we ''(Il Divo)'' are in the middle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.infobae.com/opera/2012/10/19/il-divo-no-es-opera/|title="Il Divo" no es ópera}}</ref>|David Miller}}

===Multilingual===
The quartet records their songs in several languages Spanish ("Regresa A Mi", "Hasta Mi Final", "La Vida Sin Amor"), English ("Mama", "Amazing Grace", "Don't Cry For Me Argentina"), Italian ("Senza Parole", "Passera", "Notte Di Luce"), French ("Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore", "Le Temps des Cathedrales"), one in [[Latin]] ("Panis Angelicus") and a few in Portuguese ("Volta Pra Mim") and Japanese ("Furusato").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ildivo.com/uk/news/il-divo-world-tour-japan-0|title=Il Divo arrived in Japan over the weekend, to embark on their biggest tour of the country to date|website=todomusica.org|year=2012|access-date=16 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110916/http://www.ildivo.com/uk/news/il-divo-world-tour-japan-0|archive-date=27 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todomusica.org/il_divo/|title=Biografía de Il Divo|website=todomusica.org|year=2006|language=es}}</ref> Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song: "The Man You Love" (Spanish & English), "Ave Maria" (Italian & Latin), "I Believe In You" (English & French) are recorded this way; whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: "She" (Italian & English) and "Bring Him Home" (English & Spanish).

Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as the group themselves have said that "Spanish is the language of Romanticism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sevilla.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-21-10-2008/sevilla/Espectaculos/il-divo-el-espa%C3%B1ol-es-el-idioma-del-romanticismo_91729059343.html|title=El español es el idioma del romanticismo para el cuarteto de ópera pop Il Divo|website=abc.es|date=21 October 2008|language=es|access-date=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109212042/http://sevilla.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-21-10-2008/sevilla/Espectaculos/il-divo-el-espa%C3%B1ol-es-el-idioma-del-romanticismo_91729059343.html|archive-date=9 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
