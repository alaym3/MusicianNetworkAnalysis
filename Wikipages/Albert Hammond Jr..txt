== Career ==

=== The Strokes ===
{{Main|The Strokes}}
After moving to New York City in September 1998, Hammond reconnected with his former school friend Casablancas, who later invited him to join the Strokes.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theknow.denverpost.com/2014/09/09/seven-bands-didnt-know-formed-school/94334/|title=Seven bands you didn't know formed at school|date=September 9, 2014|work=The Know|language=en-US}}</ref> Made up of Casablancas' other schoolmates [[Nikolai Fraiture]], [[Nick Valensi]], and [[Fabrizio Moretti]], Hammond Jr. was the last person to join the band in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/24/how-we-made-is-this-it-the-strokes|title=The Strokes: how we made Is This It|last=Simpson|first=Interview by Dave|date=March 24, 2015|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In the following two years, the band practiced and performed tirelessly, all while Hammond Jr. was also attending NYU and working at [[Kim's Video and Music|Kim's Video]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Goodman|first=Lizzy|title=[[Meet Me in the Bathroom|Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001–2011]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]/Dey St.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-06-223309-7|location=New York|pages=123–136|chapter=Like a Gang}}</ref> The Strokes released their first demo in January 2001, beginning a record label bidding war and years of critical acclaim. Since 2001, Hammond Jr., as part of the Strokes, has released two EPs and six full-length albums, most recently ''[[The New Abnormal]]'' in 2020.

Hammond is usually seen playing a 1985 '70s reissue Olympic White [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/09/17/albert-hammond-hails-five-favorite-guitarists/SMMXxBfiKPZot1Jr4Gz4jJ/story.html|title=Albert Hammond Jr. hails five favorite guitarists |work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref> or [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul Jr.]] that is sometimes used by bandmate [[Nick Valensi]]. On the majority of the Strokes' songs he plays rhythm guitar, and solos are played by Valensi. The songs in which Hammond does play solos are "[[Last Nite]]", "[[Trying Your Luck]]", "Take It or Leave It", "Under Control", "[[The End Has No End]]", "Ize of the World", "Threat of Joy", "Vision of Division", and "Drag Queen".{{Update inline|reason=Does note reflect contributions on New Abnormal|date=November 2020}} His solos tend to focus largely on more emotional, "bluesy"-type melodic work, and the guitar tends to have a cleaner, softer tone in comparison to Valensi's (with a notable exception found in "Vision of Division"). He often holds his guitar in a high horizontal position, similar to [[Buddy Holly]], which he says is so that he can dance better.

Although vocalist Julian Casablancas is the primary songwriter in [[the Strokes]], Hammond co-wrote the track "Automatic Stop" with Casablancas for the group's second album ''[[Room on Fire]]''. He has been credited with writing three mostly instrumental songs ("Swiss Beats", "Holland", and "By the Way") for the band's 2001 tour video titled ''In Transit''. These songs were reworked for his later solo album and have different titles ("Everyone Gets a Star", "Bright Young Thing", "In Transit").{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} He wrote "Elephant Song" when he was required to record a song for his Sound 101 class during his freshman year and used the school's recording equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hogan|first=Marc|date=October 12, 2006|title=Albert Hammond Jr.: Yours to Keep Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9509-yours-to-keep/|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> The song was played at a few shows before the release of the Strokes' debut album. They later re-recorded the song as a special giveaway for fan club members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

=== Solo career ===
==== ''Yours to Keep'' and ''¿Cómo Te Llama?'' (2006–2013) ====
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2020}}
In October 2005, Hammond and [[Ben Kweller]] released a version of "[[Wait (The Beatles song)|Wait]]" on ''[[This Bird Has Flown – A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul]].''

Hammond released a solo album titled ''[[Yours to Keep (Albert Hammond Jr. album)|Yours to Keep]]'' in the U.K. through [[Rough Trade Records]] on October 9, 2006 and in North America through [[New Line Records]]/[[Scratchie Records]] on March 6, 2007. Produced by [[Thin Lizard Dawn]] vocalist Lattimer and recorded at the [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, the album features several musical guests, such as [[Sean Lennon]], Ben Kweller, The Strokes' manager [[Ryan Gentles]], [[Jody Porter]] of [[Fountains of Wayne]], Chris Feinstein, Mikki James, Sammy James Jr. ([[The Mooney Suzuki]]) and the Strokes' lead singer, Casablancas. Bassist Josh Lattanzi and drummer Matt Romano serve as the backing band, with Hammond on guitar and vocals. The first single taken from the album, "101,"  was released exclusively through iTunes on September 4, 2006. "101" was the follow-up single to "Everyone Gets a Star". The music video debuted online in March 2007.<ref>[http://www.blender.com/video/980/AlbertHammond,Jr.101.video?pn=1&vsid=7&src=blender_ed]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227134251/http://www.blender.com/video/980/AlbertHammond%2CJr.101.video?pn=1&vsid=7&src=blender_ed|date=December 27, 2008}}</ref> It was going to be available in general music stores, unlike "Everyone Gets A Star" which was only available through UK iTunes Music Store. It was released on November 27, 2006. The music video for "In Transit" was directed by [[Joaquin Phoenix]].

Hammond has said to have been "waiting to make a record like this for years".<ref>[http://albert.shesfixingherhair.co.uk/gallery/magazines/albertmagazines_05.jpg]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108202336/http://albert.shesfixingherhair.co.uk/gallery/magazines/albertmagazines_05.jpg|date=November 8, 2006}}</ref> Early support from his bandmates in the Strokes was only evident after Casablancas' role playing bass and back-up vocals on the track "Scared", though all of the members (with the exclusion of [[Nick Valensi]], who was busy taking care of his newborn children) attended his shows in and around New York.

On March 16, 2007, at the [[South by Southwest]] festival, Hammond performed a 12-song set including covers of [[Frank Black]]'s "Old Black Dawning" and [[Guided By Voices]]' "Postal Blowfish".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/albert-hammond-jr/27132 |title=Albert Hammond Jr previews new material at SXSW &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=March 17, 2007 |access-date=June 26, 2014}}</ref> Hammond also regularly covered [[the Cars]]' "Don't Cha Stop" in live performances. He supported [[Bloc Party]] on their world tour before making stops at Montreal's Metropolis and [[Toronto]]'s Kool Haus. After this, Hammond headlined two North American tours along with a European tour. The North American tour featured his friends, [[the Mooney Suzuki]]. In November 2006, Hammond was announced to be joining [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] on tour during their North American tour for their new album ''[[Light Grenades]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=February 1, 2007|title=The Strokes resting while Hammond goes solo|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hammond/the-strokes-resting-while-hammond-goes-solo-idUSN3147028420070201|access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref>  [[File:Domskibum2.jpg|thumb|left|Hammond Jr., 2007]]On August 29, 2007, Hammond announced on MySpace that he was going back into the studio to record [[¿Cómo Te Llama?|his second album]] in October 2007 for five weeks.

On March 20, 2008, Hammond posted a blog entry on MySpace in which he revealed the title of his second album: ''¿Cómo Te Llama?'' He wrote that it contained 13 songs with a total length of 46 minutes and 30 seconds. He stated he hoped to be touring with the new album until the end of 2008. On May 27, 2008, Hammond released "GfC", the first single off ''¿Cómo Te Llama?'', on iTunes in the U.S. The song was played extensively live on his 2007 tour. A non-album song titled "& So It Goes" was released as a B-side along with the single. The album was released on July 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nme.com/news/albert-hammond-jr/36297 |title=Albert Hammond Jr. releases new album details – exclusive &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=April 30, 2008 |access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

On May 29, 2008, Hammond was Myspace's featured artist and exclusively premiered his new album ''¿Cómo Te Llama?'' uploading all the tracks of the album on his official Myspace page. He celebrated the release of his album with a  July 8 small show at the Virgin Megastore, [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], in New York City. A noted absence from Hammond's band was recording bassist Josh Latzanni. [[Steve Schiltz]] of the band [[Longwave (band)|Longwave]], who toured with Hammond on his first album also was missing. Although Hammond was supposed to play only two or three songs, he ended up playing almost 10, with a selection that included both new and old tracks. This show kicked off his worldwide tour in support of ''¿Cómo Te Llama?'' with the next show being sold-out at the landmark venue Spaceland in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. This was his only appearance on the West Coast. The following month, Hammond's website officially announced that Hammond would be the support act of the British band [[Coldplay]] during their European Tour, which kicked off on September 1 in [[Strasbourg]], France.

==== ''AHJ'' EP and ''Momentary Masters'' (2013–2017) ====

In an interview with Har Mar Superstar in July 2013, Hammond revealed that he had recorded a five-song EP to be released via Julian Casablancas' [[Cult Records]].

Albert's main guitar is a [[Fender Stratocaster]] Arctic White 1985 Reissue of a 1972. He owns three white Stratocasters, a Gibson Les Paul special single cutaway, a Rickenbacker 325, and a Gretsch hollowbody. His amplifier is a Fender Hot Rod DeVille 2x12. His pedal board is made up of an old version of the MXR Micro Amp, a V1 Jekyll and Hyde Ultimate Overdrive and Distortion, and a BOSS TU-2 tuner. In later shows, he adds another Micro Amp, and Jekyll and Hyde, and a Boss Digital Delay. He now uses a Mad Professor Deep Blue Delay pedal instead of the Boss Digital Delay.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}
