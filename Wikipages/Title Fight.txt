They have released 3 studio albums – ''[[Shed (album)|Shed]]'' (2011), ''[[Floral Green]]'' (2012) and ''[[Hyperview (album)|Hyperview]]'' (2015) – gradually shifting from a [[hardcore punk]]-oriented sound towards an emphasis on mellow atmospheres.

==History==

===Early years===
Title Fight formed in 2003 as a three-piece band consisting of Jamie Rhoden on guitar and vocals, Ned Russin on bass and Ned's twin brother Ben on drums, playing local shows in [[Kingston, PA|Kingston]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, PA]]. Ned Russin claims his older brother, Alex Russin is a huge influence in their formation of Title Fight. Their name came from the cover of an old HBO showtime guide that Ned had read in the attic when he was younger. In addition to popular punk bands, Rhoden claims the Positive Numbers Fest (an annual hardcore/punk music festival in Wilkes-Barre, PA) was an influence on the band's formation.<ref name=APmag>{{cite journal|last=Ham|first=Robert|title=Small Town Sound|journal=Alternative Press Magazine|date=November 2011|pages=70–74}}</ref> The band produced a demo entitled "Down for the Count" in 2003 that is still available on the internet.

In 2005, the band added Shane Moran on second guitar and recorded two demos in 2005 and 2006, during which they played shows in what they call a "small, tight-knit community" around Kingston, PA.<ref name=APmag /> These included several shows at the Doylestown, PA YMCA Teen Center.

In September 2010, the local venue, Cafe Metropolis in Wilkes-Barre, PA, where Title Fight played their first show, closed. To give back to the rising hardcore community, Title Fight and other local friends took action by opening Redwood Art Space, a venue in Wilkes-Barre. The venue opened in March 2011. However, in June 2012 the venue was forced into moving. They will be raising money to have a new venue, due open later this year. Bands such as [[Touché Amoré]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Bane (band)|Bane]] have played shows there.<ref name=APmag />
