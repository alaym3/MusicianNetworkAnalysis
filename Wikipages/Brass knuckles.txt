'''Brass knuckles''' (variously referred to as '''knuckles''', '''knucks''', '''brass knucks''', '''knucklebusters''', '''knuckledusters''', '''knuckle daggers''', '''English punch''', '''iron fist''', ''' paperweight''', or a '''classic''') are "fist-load [[weapon]]s" used in [[Hand to hand combat|hand-to-hand combat]]. [[Brass]] knuckles are pieces of metal shaped to fit around the [[knuckle]]s. Despite their name, they are often made from other metals, plastics or carbon fibers. Designed to preserve and concentrate a [[Punch (strike)|punch]]'s force by directing it toward a [[Elasticity (physics)|harder]] and [[Pascal's law|smaller]] contact area, they result in increased [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Blunt trauma|disruption]], including an increased likelihood of [[Bone fracture|fracturing]] the intended target [[bone]]s on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads across the attacker's palm the [[Newton's Third Law of Motion|counter-force]] that would otherwise be absorbed primarily by the attacker's fingers, reducing the likelihood of damage to the attacker's fingers. It also allows its user to break glass [[window]]s without injuring their hands, thus are widely utilized in [[vehicle theft]] to break car windows.

Metal ring and knuckle style weapons date back to ancient times and have been used all over the world for many hundreds of years. [[Vajra-mushti|Vajra mushti]] has been practiced in India since at least the 12th century and mentioned in [[Manasollasa]]. The [[Nihang|Nihang Sikh]]s used an early variant called Sher Panja in the 18th century. [[Cast iron]], brass, [[lead]], and [[wood]] knuckles were made in the United States during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). Soldiers would often buy cast iron or brass knuckles. If they could not buy them, they would carve their own from wood, or cast them at camp by melting lead [[bullets]] and using a mold in the dirt.

Some brass knuckles have rounded rings, which increase the impact of blows from moderate to severe damage. Other instruments (not generally considered to be "brass knuckles" or "metal knuckles" ''per se'') may have spikes, sharp points and cutting edges. These devices come in many variations and are called by a variety of names, including "knuckle knives."

By the late 19th century, knuckledusters were incorporated into various kinds of [[pistols]] such as the [[Apache revolver]] used by criminals in France in the late 19th to early 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horstheld.com/0-blades.htm|title=0-Blades & Barrels|website=www.horstheld.com}}</ref> During [[World War I]] the [[US Army]] issued two different knuckle knives, the US model 1917 and US model 1918 [[Mark I trench knife|Mark I]] [[trench knife|trench knives]]. Knuckles and knuckle knives were also being made in England at the time and purchased privately by British soldiers. By [[World War II]], knuckles and knuckle knives were quite popular with both American and British soldiers. The Model 1918 trench knives were reissued to American paratroopers. British Commandos even had their very own "Death's Head" knuckle knife, featuring a [[Human skull symbolism|skull-shaped]] brass knuckle handle.

A notable knuckle knife still in use is the [[Cuchillo De Paracaidista|Cuchillo de Paracaidista]], issued to [[4th Parachute Brigade (Argentina)|Argentinian paratroopers]]. Current-issue models have an emergency blade in the crossguard.

In Germany, brass knuckles are by law "illegal weapons" ("Verbotene Waffen") and are forbidden for carry or possession in any known variant. The German term is "Schlagring", which literally means "punch ring".

In [[Italy]] and [[Mexico]], brass knuckles are legal and freely sold to people of legal age (over 18 years old), but carrying them is forbidden.

In [[Russia]] brass knuckles were illegal to purchase or own during times of [[Russian Empire]] and are still forbidden according to Article 6 of 1996 Federal Law On Weapons.<ref>[http://www.consultant.ru/popular/weapon/40_1.html#p169 Федеральный закон РФ «Об оружии»]</ref> They are called "кастет" (French ''casse-tête'', literally "head breaker").

In [[Sweden]], brass knuckles are legal to purchase and own (for people 21 years of age) but are not legal to sell in stores or carry in public. The carrying of brass knuckles carries the same penalty as carrying a knife and falls under the same law. They are called "knogjärn", literally "knuckle iron".

In [[Serbia]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paragraf.rs/propisi/zakon_o_oruzju_i_municiji.html|title=Zakon o oružju i municiji|website=www.paragraf.rs|language=hr|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> knuckles are legal to purchase and own (for people over 16 years old) but are not legal to carry in public. They are called "боксер" literally "boxer".

In the [[Republic of China in Taiwan]], according to the [[Law of the Republic of China]], possession and sales of brass knuckles are illegal. Under the regulation, brass knuckles are considered weapons. Without the permission of the central regulatory agency, it is against the law to manufacture, sell, transport, transfer, rent, or have them in a collection or on display.<ref name="刀械法"/>

In the [[United States]], brass knuckles are not significantly regulated at the federal level, but various state, county and city laws prohibit their purchase and/or possession. Some state laws require purchasers to be 18 or older. Most states have statutes regulating the carrying of weapons, and many specifically prohibit brass knuckles or "metal knuckles." Where they are legal, brass knuckles can normally be purchased online or at [[flea market]]s, [[swap meet]]s, [[gun shows]], and at some sword and weapon shops. Some companies manufacture belt buckles or novelty paper weights that function as brass knuckles and are sold "for entertainment purposes only".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.local6.com/news/8608247/detail.html |title=14,000 Brass Knuckles Found Disguised As Belt Buckles |publisher=[[WKMG-TV]] |work=Local 6 News |date=10 April 2006 |access-date=8 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927045834/http://www.local6.com/news/8608247/detail.html |archive-date=September 27, 2008 }}</ref> Brass knuckles made of hardened plastic, rather than metal, have been marketed as "undetectable by airport metal detectors."<ref>[[ABC News]]: [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/new-undetectabl.html "New Undetectable Weapon Could Slip By Security At Airports This Summer"]</ref> Several states that ban brass knuckles also ban plastic knuckles.

==Illegality of Knuckles used to target minorities==

Some laws in the United States making brass knuckles illegal have been used in such a manner as to target minorities that might otherwise have encountered police, but the mere possession of brass knuckles then serves as pretense for an arrest. Some states, such as the state of [[Texas]],<ref name="Texas Tribune Brass Knuckles article" /> have passed laws repealing earlier prohibitions on the ownership and carry of brass knuckles (and knuckles made from other materials used for defensive purposes). The use of brass knuckles as a weapon to initiate an attack is still criminalized, so only defensive use of brass knuckles is legalized. The carry of brass knuckles before the Texas law came into effect on September 1, 2019, resulted in the arrest of "93 people" in 2017, "...often used to target young people of color" said the sponsor of the bill, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Joe Moody (politician)|Joe Moody]] of [[El Paso]] to a [[Dallas Morning News]] correspondent.<ref name="Texas Tribune Brass Knuckles article">{{cite web |last1=Roldan |first1=Riane |title=Brass knuckles and other self-defense items will be legal in Texas starting Sept. 1 |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/28/brass-knuckles-now-legal-texas/ |website=www.texastribune.org/ |publisher=Texas Tribune |access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref>

Prior to brass knuckles becoming regularly legal for carry, ownership, and possession in 2019, they were considered as regulated, or illegal, as "explosives" and "machine guns" according to a report by [[ABC News]].<ref name="It's now legal to carry brass knuckles in Texas for 'self-defense' - ABC News">{{cite web |last1=La Rosa |first1=Leah |title=It's now legal to carry brass knuckles in Texas for 'self-defense' |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/legal-carry-brass-knuckles-texas/story?id=63400399 |website=abcnews.go.com/ |publisher=ABC News |access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref>
