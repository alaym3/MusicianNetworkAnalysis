'''K.I.Z''' is a [[German hip hop]] group from [[Berlin]]. The members are the three rappers Tarek, Nico and Maxim. Until 2018, DJ Craft was also part of the group. Their lyrics often contain a lot of black humor and irony as well as sociocritical content.

== Meaning of the name ==
The name K.I.Z has several meanings. Members of the band have suggested numerous meanings for the acronym, such as Kriegsverbrecher im Zuchthaus (war criminals in penitentiary), Kannibalen in Zivil (cannibals in plain clothes), Künstler in Zwangsjacken (artists in straitjackets), or Kreuzritter in Zentralasien (crusaders in central Asia), Krüppel im Zwinger (cripples in the kennel), Kommunismus ist Zauberhaft (literally: "communism is magical", meaning "communism is lovely"), Klosterschüler im Zölibat (Monastic novices in celibacy) or Karotten, Ingwer, Zwiebel (carrots, ginger, onion).

K.I.Z rapper Maxim said in his humorous autobiography that graffiti artists came up with the letters because they "sound so aggressive". In an interview with the BerlinBlock K.I.Z explained that they were using the name since their career as graffiti artists when it only had "an embarrassing English meaning".

== Style ==
Characteristic for the group are sexist, provocative lyrics containing black humour, irony, sarcasm and cynicism. They also like to parody other rappers, people or the Hip-Hop genre itself, as heard on the song "Die kleinen Dinge im Leben" feat. Sido (engl. The Small Things in Life) where they have a competition of who has the smallest penis. K.I.Z satirically criticize the society, politics and phenomena such as airs and graces, or life in the precariat. Nico considers his style to be pop, while Tarek sees the group as "something like the Onkelz of Reggae".

== History ==
The three members of K.I.Z started their careers in the Reimliga Battle Arena RBA (engl. Rhyme-League Battle Arena). Tarek named himself "Schwiegersohn" (engl. son-in-law), Maxim "Stiefvater" (engl. step-dad) and Nico "Warmer Bruder" (engl. warm brother).

After the foundation of K.I.Z their first album ''RapDeutschlandKettensägenMassaker'' (engl. RapGermanyChainsawMassacre) was released on May 9, 2005, on the Label Royal Bunker. On February 17, 2006, their Mixtape ''Böhse Enkelz'' (engl. Evil Grandchildren, pun on [[Böhse Onkelz]]) was released. In August 2006, they were a supporting act for the [[Bloodhound Gang]] on the German leg of their tour, and in early 2007 for Prinz Pi on his !Donnerwetter! tour.

They were supposed to play at the aftershow party of the rock festival [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring]] in 2007, but their appearance was canceled shortly before because one of the festival's sponsors considered their lyrics to be too offensive. But they insisted on appearing there, so they played from the rooftop of a bus in the camping area in 2008. Playing hip-hop at a rock festival was considered to be a huge affront, prompting audience members to throw beer cans onto their stage.

On August 17, 2007, they were the center point of an XXL Edition of the [[MTV Germany|MTV]] show Urban TRL. They played a live show presenting their first single "Geld essen" (engl. Eating Money) and were interviewed.

On August 20, 2007, they organized a concert with the motto "Reclaim your [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]" in front of the train station [[Schlesisches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Schlesisches Tor]] in Berlin Kreuzberg. Originally, the concert was slated to take place inside a train, but the [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|BVG]] closed down the entire station and called the police, who appeared in riot gear. They tried to dissolve the gathering of approximately 1000 people and arrested eight.

Their album ''Hahnenkampf'' (engl. Cock Fight) was released on August 24, 2007, and distributed with the help of [[Universal Music Group#Berlin|Universal]], and was ranked 9th in the German sales charts.

In summer 2007 K.I.Z went on tour through Austria, Germany and Switzerland.  In the video based on their song "Geld essen" (engl. To Eat Money) one scene shows two homosexual men kissing. According to K.I.Z this is a personal statement against homophobia in hip-hop.

In 2008 the Berlin-based group was nominated for the German music award [[Echo Music Prize|Echo]] in the category "Video national".  In spring 2008 K.I.Z again went on tour. DJ Craft and Nico, two of the band members, additionally performed as a Duo called "Turntable Hools" in all of the concerts of this tour.

The last single of their album ''Hahnenkampf'', called "Neuruppin", was published in June 2008. It is a cover of a classic track "House of the Rising Sun" by The Animals. The lyrics deal with murder and cannibalism against women. The lyrics refer to the crimes of [[Carl Großmann]], a serial killer born in Neuruppin in 1863. K.I.Z claim to not have known about this parallels between the lyrics and Großmann's crimes.
 
On July 10, 2009, the album ''Sexismus gegen Rechts'' (engl. Sexism Against The Right). The album criticizes, social, political and economical deficiencies.
In April 2010 K.I.Z started working on their new album ''Urlaub fürs Gehirn'' (engl. Vacation for the Brain), whose sound aesthetic was supposed to tie in with ''Hahnenkampf''. The album was released on June 3, 2011, and hit the charts in position 4.

The International Women's Day in 2011 was the first time K.I.Z gave a concert in Berlin Kreuzberg which only women were allowed to visit. Such a concert was also played in 2012, 2013, 2014, and again in 2016. Furthermore, K.I.Z has toured as the opening act for the band [[Die Ärzte]].

In January 2013 K.I.Z, in collaboration with the Berlin rapper Flexis, released the song "Strahlemann und Söhne" (engl. Big Smile Guy and Sons) via 16bars.de, that can be found on Flexis’ album ''Egotrips''.

In June 2013 K.I.Z released their new video "Ich bin Adolf Hitler" (I am Adolf Hitler). The song is featured on the mixtape ''Ganz oben'' (engl. At the Very Top), which was released on July 9, 2013. In the video, the German-Jewish comedian Oliver Polak plays the role of [[Adolf Hitler]].

On April 24, 2015, K.I.Z announced that they would release their fifth studio album ''Hurra die Welt geht unter'' (engl. Hooray, the Apocalypse is here) on July 10, 2015. Its tone is supposed to be more serious than their previous albums and mixtapes. Instead of a collection of several songs simply thrown together, there is going to be a central topic that the songs revolve around, like a [[concept album]]. The end of the world here is not supposed to be a negative event but rather a new start or a revolution.

In 2015 and 2016 they received a ''[[1LIVE]] Krone'' music award as best live music act.<ref>http://www1.wdr.de/radio/1live-krone/videos/video-kiz-wird-bester-live-act-100.html</ref>

2017 saw the release of a song called "Glück gehabt" in which the group appears under the pseudonym [[Black Forest gateau|"Die Schwarzwälder Kirschtorten"]], containing topics such as [[Sex tourism]] in Thailand.

In March 2018, it was announced that DJ Craft had left the group.

In August 2018, the first album by ''Verbales Style Kollektiv'', a group formed in 2013 by all K.I.Z members and various other artists, was released.

K.I.Z returned with a new song entitled "Berghainschlange" in 2020 and announced a new album, ''Und das Geheimnis der unbeglichenenen Bordellrechnung'' which was released on 4 December 2020. They also announced a tour in 2021 promoting their forthcoming album, ''Rap über Hass'', scheduled for release on 28 May 2021.

== Political commitment ==
In February 2010 K.I.Z uploaded a YouTube video in which they called people to participate in the anti-fascist protest Dresden Nazifrei (Nazi-free Dresden). On March 8, 2011, it was announced that Maxim and Nico would run in the [[Berlin state election, 2011|2011 Berlin state election]] as leading candidates for [[Die Partei]] in the Berlin borough of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]. In 2016 they once more were leading candidates for Die PARTEI for the Berlin state election in the same borough. In September 2018 K.I.Z participated in a concert with other artists and bands in the German city of [[Chemnitz]] to make a statement against far-right protests and anti-immigrant violence. The show was attended by 65,000 people.
