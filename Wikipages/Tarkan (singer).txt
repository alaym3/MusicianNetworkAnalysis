'''Tarkan Tevetoğlu''' ({{IPA-tr|taɾˈkan teveˈtoːɫu}}; born 17 October 1972) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] singer-songwriter. Since the early 1990s, with the successful sales of his albums, he has been a prominent figure of the [[Turkish pop music]], being known in Turkey, Europe and Western Asia.

Tarkan was born and raised in [[Alzey]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1986, he moved to Turkey together with his family. Tarkan, who had been interested in music since his childhood, went to high school at [[Karamürsel]] and took music lessons. In the following years, he met the owner of İstanbul Plak, Mehmet Söğütoğlu, and signed a contract to release his own album.

Tarkan released his first album ''[[Yine Sensiz]]'' in late 1992 with "Kıl Oldum" being chosen as its [[lead single]]. His second and third albums, ''[[Aacayipsin]]'' and ''[[Ölürüm Sana]]'', were released in 1994 and 1998 respectively. The song "[[Şımarık]]" from ''Ölürüm Sana'' became popular in a number of countries. In 1998, he signed a new contract with [[Universal Music Group]]. In 1999, his compilation album, ''[[Tarkan (album)|Tarkan]]'', received platinum and gold certifications in several countries. In 2001, he made music videos for the songs "[[Kuzu Kuzu]], "Hüp" and "Verme" from his fourth studio album ''[[Karma (Tarkan album)|Karma]]''. Two years later, extended play ''[[Dudu (album)|Dudu]]'' performed well on the sales charts, and in 2006 with the release of his first English album, ''[[Come Closer (album)|Come Closer]]'', he became known in Europe. "[[Bounce (Tarkan song)|Bounce]]" and "[[Start the Fire (Tarkan song)|Start the Fire]]" were the lead singles of this album. The lyrics of the songs included in the album ''[[Metamorfoz]]'' were praised by the [[Turkish Language Association]]. In 2010, his seventh studio album, ''[[Adımı Kalbine Yaz]]'', became the best-selling album of the year in Turkey. In 2016, his ninth album, ''[[Ahde Vefa]]'', which has a [[Ottoman classical music|Classical Turkish theme]], was released.

Alongside his music career, Tarkan has taken part in numerous social projects and is known as "Megastar" and "Prince of the [[Bosporus]]" in the press.<ref>Tarkan's titles appearing in a number of sources:

In 1994, he experienced a dip in his celebrity status after he made a gaffe during an interview on a live broadcast marking the anniversary of the private Turkish TV channel [[ATV (Turkey)|ATV]]. When asked how he was on live television, his response was "Çişim var, ağabey." ("I've gotta pee, man.") He was publicly criticised for the comment and only after performing [[Turkish classical music|traditional songs]] on another TV special did he endear himself again to the nation.<ref name="washingtonpost" /> In part to remove himself from media scrutiny, Tarkan moved to New York in 1994 to learn English and complete his education at [[Baruch College]].<ref>[http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=15693 Tarkan: From the stage to the barracks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510203246/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=15693 |date=10 May 2008 }} – Turkish Daily News</ref> During this period he filmed a video to another song from his second album, "Dön Bebeğim", in New York.

In 1997, Tarkan found his own production company [[HITT Production|Hitt Müzik]] and in the same year he released his third studio album ''[[Ölürüm Sana]]'', which sold three and a half million copies.<ref name=albumsatis/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/Tarkan-%C3%96l%C3%BCr%C3%BCm-Sana/release/483481 | title = Tarkan - Ölürüm Sana (CD, Album) at Discogs | access-date = 7 June 2013 | publisher = [[Discogs]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506022835/http://www.discogs.com/Tarkan-%C3%96l%C3%BCr%C3%BCm-Sana/release/483481 | archive-date = 6 May 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> Tarkan himself did the songwriting and composition for many of the songs on this album. "[[Şımarık]]", "İkimizin Yerine", "[[Salına Salına Sinsice]]", "[[Ölürüm Sana]]" and "[[Bu Gece|Kır Zincirlerini]]" were the songs for which music videos were made. "Şımarık" became a hit in many countries; ranking third in France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland; second in Norway; and first in Belgium; it also ranked 26th on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' list of [[Latin Pop Airplay|Latin Pop Songs]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Tarkan&titel=Simarik&cat=s | title = Tarkan - Simarik - hitparade.ch | publisher = swisscharts.com | access-date = 7 June 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206031028/http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Tarkan&titel=Simarik&cat=s | archive-date = 6 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/281610/tarkan/chart?f=372 | title = Tarkan - Chart history | publisher = [[Prometheus Global Media]] | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | access-date = 7 June 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326223339/http://www.billboard.com/artist/281610/tarkan/chart?f=372 | archive-date = 26 March 2016}}</ref> The song was later performed by many other artists.

The music was initially credited as composed by Aksu, Tarkan and Çolakoğlu, but Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu's consent, and that Aksu was the true copyright owner.

His song "Şımarık" has been sampled by various artists in these countries, and the film industry in India has also used several Tarkan hits, including "Şıkıdım", "Kuzu Kuzu" and "Dudu", for various [[Bollywood]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movietonic.com/2007/04/02/part-1-pritam-is-a-copy-cat/|title=Pritam is a copy-cat Part 1|work=Movie Tonic|access-date=2 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movietonic.com/2007/04/10/part-2-pritam-is-a-copy-cat/|title=Pritam is a copy-cat Part 2|work=Movie Tonic|access-date=2 April 2007}}</ref> His "[[A-Acayipsin#Track listing|Kış Güneşi]]" song has been chosen as one of "The Unforgettable Hits of Turkish Music" by ''[[Hürriyet]]'' newspaper.<ref>[http://fotoanaliz.hurriyet.com.tr/galeridetay.aspx?cid=5837&p=31&rid=4369 Türk müzigin unutulmayan sarkilari] – Hürriyet</ref>

==Personal life==
===Military service===
At the height of his fame in 1999, Tarkan was called up for military service, which had been legally deferred since 1995. The deadline for beginning his service had passed in 1998, but due to contractual obligations abroad after the success of his compilation album he did not return to Turkey to do his military service. The media discussed whether Tarkan should be viewed as a [[deserter]] and stripped of his [[citizenship]]. Even the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish parliament]] discussed the issue.<ref name="trouble">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1664129.stm|title=Turkish star's trouble over 'explicit' video|date=19 November 2001|access-date=16 November 2018|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>[http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ekler/gazete_pazar/981108/haber/hab2.html Tarkan Fransa ve Belçika'da pop listelerinde hizla yükseliyor] – Milliyet</ref> After the [[1999 İzmit earthquake|August 1999 earthquake]] shook Turkey, legislation was enacted that allowed those covered by the law to pay $16,000 for the benefit of the earthquake victims in return for shortening their military service obligation to 28 days.<ref name="washingtonpost" /> Tarkan returned to Turkey in 2000, took advantage of this law, and completed his service. Of his shortened time in military training, he said: "It was January and snowing like crazy. It was tough; the food was terrible. Eighteen months of my life for nothing? I thought my own dreams were more important."<ref name="washingtonpost"/>

===Relationships and rumours===
Tarkan was in a relationship with a French model in the early 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2006/05/30/gny/gny133-20060530-200.html|title=SABAH - 30/05/2006 - Hollywood starlarının saçı Jülyet'e emanet|website=Arsiv.sabah.com.tr|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref> and with a Turkish journalist<ref name="hurriyet.com.tr">{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/portakali-elif-kapti-26739376|title=Portakalı Elif kaptı|website=Hurriyet.com|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref> between 1994 and 1996.<ref name="hurriyet.com.tr"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/1236384-bir-megastarin-evliligi|title=Bu fotoğrafa uzmanlar ne dedi?|website=Haberturk.com|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref> Because Tarkan does not like to talk about his personal life, there has been speculation about his sexual orientation in the popular press. Photos stolen from his house in New York in 2001 were portrayed as compromising; they were photos with other men in swimwear at a public nude beach. In one of the pictures he appears to be kissing a man.<ref name="Boyfriend Süleyman Şahin">{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2001/06/08/magazin/amag.html|title=ABD'de bir plajda çekilen fotoğraflar TV'de yayınlanınca Tarkan çok sinirlendi (Tarkan angry about US beach pictures shown on TV)|work=Hürriyet |access-date=20 December 2015}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Hürriyet]]'', Tarkan contested the widespread assumption that he was [[gay]].<ref name="gentle">{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ayse-arman-sadece-sevisirken-macoyum-39245477|title=Sadece Sevişirken Maçoyum|work=Ayşe Arman|publisher=[[Hürriyet]]|access-date=27 May 2001}}</ref> He said that men spread the rumours, because he didn't conform to their image of being a man.<ref name="gentle"/> One of his ex-girlfriends also denied he was gay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/1-5-yil-kari-koca-gibiydik-38335331|title=1.5 yıl karı-koca gibiydik|website=Hurriyet.com|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref> Tarkan later gave fewer and fewer interviews and television appearances, limiting himself to a small number of trusted journalists.

On 29 April 2016, Tarkan married his long-time girlfriend, Pınar Dilek. The couple met in 2011 after a concert in Germany.
