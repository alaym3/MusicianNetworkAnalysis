'''ItaloBrothers''' is a German [[dance music|dance]] project from [[Nordhorn]], [[Germany]]. The band consists of vocalist Matthias Metten, who works in the studio with Zacharias Adrian (also known as Zac McCrack) and Christian Müller (also known as Kristian Sandberg). However as of 2020, Matthias is the remaining member and uses Italobrothers as his stage name. They are most successful in [[Nordic countries|Scandinavia]] and [[Central Europe]], but also have gone on tour in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20130405125420/http://www.italobrothers.de/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=13 Tourdates of ItaloBrothers from April to July 2013]</ref> They release all their songs on [[Zooland Records]]. Their most successful singles to date include: "[[Stamp on the Ground]]", "[[My Life Is a Party]]", "[[This Is Nightlife]]" and "Summer Air".

==Music style==
The general musical style of ItaloBrothers (except "My Life Is a Party" and "This Is Nightlife") is comparable with dance bands or artists, mostly from Italy, like [[Bloom 06]], [[Prezioso & Marvin|Prezioso]], [[Floorfilla]], [[Gigi D'Agostino]], [[Gabry Ponte]] or some releases of [[DJ Manian]] and has influences of [[Italo dance]], hands up and [[jumpstyle]]. They were also compared to [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronic-base.de/singles-alben-und-compilation/italobrothers-stamp/|title=electronic-base.de - ItaloBrothers – ''Stamp!''|language=de|access-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

In contrast to this, the music style of their singles "Cryin' In The Rain", "My Life Is a Party" and "This Is Nightlife" is mostly influenced by commercial European dance music like [[House (music)|house]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]]. This style can be compared to artists like [[R.I.O.]], 2010s releases of [[Manian]] and [[Cascada]], and [[Mike Candys]].

The band was founded in November 2005, the three band members having already made music together since 2003.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.italobrothers.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=2:biography&layout=blog&Itemid=3|title=German website of ItaloBrothers|access-date=2013-04-06|language=de}}</ref> Their first official release was "The Moon", an italo-dance track released in July 2006 on an EP by their label Zooland called ''Zooland Italo EP''.<ref>[http://www.technobase.fm/release/various-artists/2009/zooland-italo-ep/ ''Zooland Italo EP'' release preview at technobase.fm]</ref> In 2007, they gained growing popularity with the release of "[[Moonlight Shadow]]", a [[cover version]] of the 1980 release of the same name by [[Mike Oldfield]] and a cooperation with German dance group Tune Up! called "Colours of the Rainbow".
In 2006 and 2007, they also released various remixes of songs by other musicians for which they re-recorded the vocals and published them as "Italobrothers New Voc Rmx". Their next two releases, "Counting Down the Days" and "Where Are You Now?", established a fanbase throughout Europe.

===2009–2010: Commercial success in Scandinavia===
A new single, "[[So Small]]", which is a cover of the [[Carrie Underwood]] song of the same name, was published in November 2009. It is the only single that was directly available on CD. Another release, the digital ''[[Love is on Fire EP]]'', was released in March 2010.

The song "[[Stamp on the Ground]]", which was originally released in September 2009, was selected as official song for the Norwegian [[Russefeiring]] event 2010.{{cn|date=May 2021}} The song was therefore re-released in Scandinavia and became a huge success, reaching the Top 20 in Norway<ref name="NOR"/> and Denmark.<ref name="DEN"/> The song also gained a chart position in Sweden<ref name="SWE"/> and in the dance charts of Switzerland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdjc.de/sdc/index.php?PHPSESSID=pv8ihajp9n6icduj03an5t6kromhc7pa&LG=de&ID=5&MODUS=TITELANZEIGE&SUCHETITEL=italobrothers&TID=90427|title=''Stamp on the Ground'' by Italobrothers in the Swiss Dance Chart|publisher=Swiss Dance Chart|access-date=2013-04-06}}</ref> and Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdjc.de/dca/index.php?PHPSESSID=pv8ihajp9n6icduj03an5t6kromhc7pa&LG=de&ID=5&MODUS=TITELANZEIGE&SUCHETITEL=italobrothers&TID=87551|title=''Stamp on the Ground'' by Italobrothers in the Austrian Dance Chart|publisher=DJ-Charts Austria|access-date=2013-04-06}}</ref> The song was certified gold for 15,000 sold units in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gn-online.de/de/gn-extras/gn-szene/artikel.html?artikelid=3433|title="NOH gefällt mir": Party-Nacht in Uelsen|publisher=Grafschafter Nachrichten|date=2012-05-28|access-date=2013-04-07|language=de|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630230502/http://www.gn-online.de/de/gn-extras/gn-szene/artikel.html?artikelid=3433|archive-date=2013-06-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the success of "Stamp on the Ground", an album called ''[[Stamp!]]'' was released in December 2010 which contains all to this point released singles and five new tracks. One of this tracks with the title "Upside Down" was said to be a copy of the Russian singer [[Reda (singer)|Reda]]'s track "Ja budu s Taboj". Her label [[Data Records|DaTa Music]] took proceedings against the further release of the track, but the end of this lawsuit is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptext.net/pressemitteilung/sony-atv-plagiatsvorwurf-italobrothers-ernst-data-music-reicht-klage-225983|title=SONY /ATV nimmt Plagiatsvorwurf gegen Italobrothers nicht ernst - DaTa-Music reicht Klage ein!|publisher=ptext.net|language=de|date=August 17, 2011|access-date=2013-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105205434/http://www.ptext.net/pressemitteilung/sony-atv-plagiatsvorwurf-italobrothers-ernst-data-music-reicht-klage-225983|archive-date=November 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A follow-up single called "Radio Hardcore" was released in December 2010 and was able to recreate the success of "Stamp on the Ground" in Denmark.<ref name="DEN"/>

===2011–12: Change of music style and commercial success in Central Europe===
In May 2011, a track named "Cryin' in the Rain" was published, that differs very much from the common music style as it is a [[ballad]] with [[House (music)|House]] elements. However, there was also released an "IB HandsUp! Remix" featuring the common style. This release was seen as an experiment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} For their next release, "Boom", they worked together with the [[rapper]] [[Carlprit]]. This track is again in their old style, but features [[dubstep]] parts while Carlprit is rapping.

For the second time ItaloBrothers have produced the official [[Russefeiring|Russ]] anthem, this time called "Pandora 2012"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russen.no/buss/?p=11085|title=ItaloBrothers på busslåt|publisher=russen.no|date=March 27, 2012|access-date=2013-04-06|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109162133/http://www.russen.no/buss/?p=11085|archive-date=November 9, 2014}}</ref> which was released on 13 April 2012.

===2012–2014: "My Life Is a Party" and singles===
On 27 July 2012 the band released a single called "[[My Life Is a Party]]" which is a cover of the track "[[Dragostea din tei]]" by [[O-Zone]] from 2004. The radio edit of the song is still in typical ItaloBrothers style but the video features a remix by German dance band [[R.I.O.]], and was released on [[Kontor Records]] thus gaining a huge amount on YouTube views. The song entered the Top 20 in Austria,<ref name="AUT"/> and managed to reach the first chart positions for the band in their home country, Germany,<ref name="GER"/> and in Switzerland, too.<ref name="SWI"/> The song also charted in France<ref name="FRA"/> and Belgium.<ref name="BEL"/>

Another track named "[[This Is Nightlife]]", which contains elements of the song "[[Ecuador (song)|Ecuador]]" by [[Sash!]] from 1997, was uploaded to YouTube on 13 March 2013<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYcUv68nFUw Italobrothers - This Is Nightlife (Official Video HD) on YouTube]</ref> and was released as single two days later. The band changed their music style similar to the style of the video remix of their last single because it was much more successful than their old style. The song was able to recreate the success of the last single in Germany<ref name="GER"/> and Austria<ref name="AUT"/> and additionally entered the Top 30 in Switzerland.<ref name="SWI"/>

The band announced that they again produced a song for a Norwegian [[Russefeiring]] event, this time called "Luminous Intensity"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=616650215017988&id=505296242866294|title=Announcement of the official track for Luminous Intensity 2013 on Facebook|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=2013-03-19|access-date=2013-04-06|language=no}}</ref> which was officially released on 19 April 2013.

Italobrothers released the single "[[Up 'N Away]]" on 28 March 2014. On 28 November 2014, then they released another single "P.O.D." (People of DreamHack). Also, the single "Let's Go" Feat. P. Moody was released in December 2014.

===2015-2017: "One Heart", "Summer Air" and singles===
In January 2015 the single "One Heart" was released, Italobrothers worked with Floorfilla as well as rapper P. Moody for the track. The song embodies their first placement in the French single charts. April 2015 saw the release of "Springfield" with the Italobrothers working alongside Norwegian DJ [[Martin Tungevaag]] to produce the song. The track reached major success in Norway. In May 2015 the single "Welcome To The Dancefloor" was released. The single is a cover of "[[Rhythm Is a Dancer]]" by German eurodance band [[Snap!]] from the years 1992. They returned to their hands-up style with the song "Sleep When We're Dead", which was released in August 2015. In November 2015 a collaboration track with Danish singer Amalie Sølberg was published, called "Kings & Queens". With their track "Generation Party", released in July 2016 they released a song in a similar style as "Springfield". Later in summer 2016 the ItaloBrothers released the single "Summer Air", which became one of their biggest hit singles yet. After a re-release in early 2017 the tropical-house/future-bass track reached high success in several Scandinavian countries as well as in Central Europe. In Norway they jumped on number 2.

===2018–2019: "Looking Back Someday and further singles===

In 2018, Italobrothers released three singles within the year, the first being "Looking Back Someday" then "Inside Out" and finally "Till You Drop". On July 5th 2019 they released Ocean Breeze. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/italobrothers/status/1065931732627718144|title=Till You Single and Music Video on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=2018-11-23|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}</ref>

===2020–present: "Let Go (feat. Kiesza) and signing to new record label===
