'''Richard Paul Ashcroft''' (born 11 September 1971) is an English singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer and occasional rhythm guitarist of the [[alternative rock]] band [[The Verve]] from their formation in 1990 until their original split in 1999. Songs he wrote for the band include "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", "[[Lucky Man (The Verve song)|Lucky Man]]", and the UK number one "[[The Drugs Don't Work]]". He became a successful solo artist, releasing three UK top three solo albums. The Verve reformed in 2007 but again broke up by summer 2009. Ashcroft then founded a new band, [[RPA & The United Nations of Sound]], and released a new album on 19 July 2010. Ashcroft released his fourth solo album, ''These People'', on 20 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richardashcroft.com/|title=Richard Ashcroft |publisher=Richard Ashcroft|date=22 February 2016|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>

When Ashcroft was 11, his father died suddenly of a [[brain haemorrhage]].<ref name="musicsaves.org"/> Ashcroft soon "fell under the influence of his stepfather", who belonged to the [[Rosicrucian]]s.<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/>

==The Verve==
{{Main|The Verve}}
Ashcroft formed The Verve (originally just Verve) in 1990 with McCabe, Jones, and Salisbury. The band signed to Hut Records and became well known for their appetite for both psychedelic music and drugs. They also became a part of the Britpop movement. The band split in 1995, and around this time Ashcroft wrote a collection of songs he intended to release as his first solo album.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/richard-ashcroft-grand-designs-593258.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421070949/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/richard-ashcroft-grand-designs-593258.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 April 2011 | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Richard Ashcroft: Grand designs | date=4 April 2003 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> However, by 1997 he had changed his mind and asked McCabe to return (alongside new member Tong), reforming the Verve and releasing the very successful album ''[[Urban Hymns]]''. Ashcroft was at the forefront of the band's popularity, receiving an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for his songwriting<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/102024.stm |work=BBC News| title=Radiohead make double swoop | date=29 May 1998 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> and being referred to by the press as "the unmistakable face of the Number One rock band in England".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/37.shtml |title=Bittersweet Triumph |publisher=Musicsaves.org |access-date=18 January 2012}}</ref> However, the pressures of touring and the tensions within the band led to McCabe's departure in mid-1998 and the announcement of the band's break-up in April 1999.

In early 2007, Ashcroft made peace with McCabe and Jones and the Verve's reunion was announced in June. The band played gigs later that year and continued touring in 2008, headlining at several festivals around the world. A new album, ''[[Forth (The Verve album)|Forth]]'', was released in August.

In August 2008, the Verve broke up for the third time, though it was not announced until the following year.

==Solo career==

===''Alone with Everybody'' and ''Human Conditions'': 2000–2004===
Ashcroft's first solo single, "[[A Song for the Lovers]]", peaked at No. 3 in the UK charts in April 2000.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> It was followed by the single "[[Money to Burn (Richard Ashcroft song)|Money to Burn]]" which reached the UK Top 20 at No. 17.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> The album, ''[[Alone with Everybody]]'', was released in June, reaching number 1 and receiving platinum status in the UK. Album reviews were generally positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/richard-ashcroft/2437 |title=NME Album Reviews – Alone With Everybody |work=NME |date=20 June 2000 |access-date=18 January 2012}}</ref> In September, a third single was released – "[[C'mon People (We're Making It Now)]]" – entering the charts at No. 21.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> Richard does not publish the lyrics to his songs in the inlay cards of his albums or singles as he feels they are personal to him.

Ashcroft began work on his second album ''[[Human Conditions]]'' in 2002. The lead single, "[[Check the Meaning]]", was released in early October, and peaked at No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com">{{cite web |title=Richard Ashcroft at OfficialCharts.com |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=18 June 2009}}</ref> The album was released later that month and reached No. 3 in the UK Album Chart.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> Reception to the album was generally positive. Review aggregating website [[Metacritic]] reports a normalised score of 61% based on 15 reviews. In response to negative reaction to the album, [[Coldplay]]'s [[Chris Martin]] – a fan of both Ashcroft and the Verve – defended the album's merits which "made an impression" on Ashcroft.<ref name="Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy"/> The appreciation shown would later result in a support slot for Ashcroft, serving as the opening act for Coldplay during a European tour.<ref name="Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy">{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Stevenson |title=Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ashcroft_Richard/2006/03/17/1493092-sun.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115082909/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ashcroft_Richard/2006/03/17/1493092-sun.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 January 2013 |work=Toronto Sun |access-date=18 June 2009 }}</ref> The album's second single, "[[Science of Silence]]", was released the following January and charted at No. 14 in the UK.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> On 26 March, Ashcroft made his first live appearance of 2003 at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] as part of the third annual [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] charity fundraising event,<ref name="Ashcroft reveals single details">{{cite web |first=Jamilia |last=Al-amin |title=News: ''Ashcroft reveals single details'' |url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/music/news/2905_ashcroft_reveals_single_details |date=7 March 2003 |publisher=M.E.N.

Aside from a limited number of appearances in 2003, Ashcroft was absent from the music business for about two years. He later explained this in 2006, stating that "[e]veryone got it into their heads over the last few years that I was in my ivory tower like [[Lennon]], baking bread all day. The fact of the matter was that I was bringing up kids".<ref>[http://www.richardashcroftonline.com/images/press/ra/nme07-01-06/nme07-01-06d.jpg ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

===Live 8 and ''Keys to the World'': 2005–2007===

Ashcroft began playing gigs again in mid-2005, and, on 2 July at the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Coldplay]] invited him to perform with them during their set. They performed the Verve's hit "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", after having previously rehearsed the song in Crystal Palace.  Ashcroft's performance of the song was introduced by [[Chris Martin]] as "the best song ever written, and here's the best singer in the world",<ref name="Ashcroft is the man with the power"/><ref name="Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy"/> helping to create renewed interest in Ashcroft.  At Christmas 2005, a documentary entitled ''Live 8: A Bitter Sweet Symphony'' was aired on the [[BBC]] reliving moments of the day featuring a portion of Ashcroft's performance as the show's opening soundtrack.

After the disintegration of [[Hut Records]] in 2004, Ashcroft signed to [[Parlophone]]<ref name="Ashcroft is the man with the power">{{cite web |title=News: ''Ashcroft is the man with the power'' |url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/music/news/4842_ashcroft_is_the_man_with_the_power |date=6 February 2006 |publisher=M.E.N. Media |access-date=18 June 2009}}</ref> where he released his third solo album, ''[[Keys to the World]]'', on 23 January 2006. The first single from the album, "[[Break the Night with Colour]]", was released on 9 January 2006, and entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 3.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> Following his performance at Live 8, Ashcroft was booked as a support act for Coldplay's [[Twisted Logic Tour]] throughout North America and the UK, which started on 14 March in [[Ottawa]], Canada.  Ashcroft saw the support slot as "a good chance to play to a significant amount of people and say, 'I’m back. And this is what I do'".<ref name="Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy"/>

The album's second single, "[[Music Is Power]]", charted at number 20.<ref name="Richard Ashcroft at officialcharts.com"/> On 18 April 2006, he recorded the ''Live from London EP'', the ninth in a series of EPs released exclusively as digital downloads from Apple's iTunes Store. The EP was released just 6 days later on 24 April. With the release of ''Keys to the World'', the general consensus was that Ashcroft was "back at the top of his musical game",<ref name="Ashcroft talks Verve and Philosophy"/> as he announced his largest UK tour for years for May 2006, culminating in three nights at London's [[Brixton Academy]]. Following the tour, Ashcroft had hoped to perform two "Homecoming" shows at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]'s 25,000 seater [[JJB Stadium]] in June 2006, but was unable to do so as the proposed venue lacked the "appropriate licence".<ref name="JJB">{{cite web |first=Diane |last=Bourne |title=News: ''No go for Richard at JJB'' |url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/music/news/4634_no_go_for_richard_at_jjb |date=19 October 2005 |publisher=M.E.N.

===RPA & The United Nations of Sound, ''These People'', ''Natural Rebel'': 2009–present===
Ashcroft is contractually obligated to record another album for Parlophone.<ref>Graff, Gary..[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044396/the-verve-to-continue-on-after-reunion-album "The Verve to Continue on After Reunion Album.] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. 20 August 2008.</ref> Ashcroft played a solo gig on 25 August 2008 as part of the Last Days of Summer Festival in [[Buckingham]].<ref name="Last Days of Summer picture gallery">{{cite web |title=News: ''Last Days of Summer picture gallery'' |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Last-Days-of-Summer-picture.4426690.jp |date=26 August 2008 |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |access-date=18 June 2009}}</ref> The Verve broke up for a third time sometime between the last rehearsals in late 2008 and the summer of 2009. It was announced in August 2009 by a band's friend.

A b-side compilation was considered a possibility, as Richard's team has asked the fans through his site about their feelings on such an album, but it's now very unlikely. In December 2009, Richard contributed the lead soundtrack song for the documentary ''The Journey''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/18/journey-emma-thompson|title=Emma Thompson: 'Chances are you'll know somebody who pays for sex' |work=The Guardian |date=18 December 2009 |location=London | access-date=22 May 2010 |first=Catherine |last=Shoard}}</ref> A video of the song was posted at Ashcroft's site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.richardashcroft.co.uk/news-page/P20/|title=Dear All.

Sources revealed he worked on a number of new songs in New York, Los Angeles and London with producer [[No I.D.]], who Richard sought after because he liked his work in the [[Jay-Z]] song "[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]" and read an interview where he states how many producers destroy records to boost sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/ashcroft-working-with-rap-producer-no-id_1126200 |title=Ashcroft Working With Rap Producer No I.D. |publisher=Contactmusic |date=18 December 2009 |access-date=18 January 2012}}</ref>

Ashcroft is currently working with a new band called [[RPA & The United Nations of Sound|RPA & the United Nations of Sound]], who have released a promo single from the album called "Are You Ready?". The album "United Nations of Sound" (former working title "Redemption") and the first proper single "Born Again" were released on 19 July 2010. The full album leaked on 15 July and the NME started streaming the album the following day. The new sound seems to emulate many of Richard's influences described over the years in interviews and seems to close a circle for his solo career. Strings, beats, rock-guitar-riffs, voice-loops, ballads and heroic-choir-anthems are the core of the album's sound with Ashcroft's craft for pop tunes and unique melody-making. Also found in the songs are the ever-present spiritual lyrics for Richard, although here in fuller form.

On 15 October 2010, Ashcroft released through his website a second fanclub-only track, "Here We Go Again". On the same day the song "Are You Ready?" was released as the first official single from the new album in the United States.<ref name="Are You Ready? 0124">{{cite web|title=The single "Are You Ready?" was released today in the US iTunes Music store''|date=16 October 2010|access-date=16 October 2010|url=http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=7217833667&share_id=125290484191766&comments=1}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}</ref> During the same month Ashcroft had signed with the record company [[Razor & Tie]] in the United States. The radio edit of "Are You Ready?" is available for free on the US version of Richard's website.

The album [[United Nations of Sound (album)|United Nations of Sound]] was released across the Atlantic on 22 March 2011 under the name "Richard Ashcroft" and the lead single "Are You Ready?" was featured over the closing credits of the film ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]'' in March 2011, along with the new song "Future's Bright", written and performed specifically for the film's opening by Richard and ten-time Oscar-nominated composer [[Thomas Newman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.razorandtie.com/artist/richard-ashcroft|work=Razor & Tie official website (Richard Ashcroft BIO)|title=Richard Ashcroft news on Razor & Tie website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118014015/http://www.razorandtie.com/artist/richard-ashcroft|archive-date=18 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

For the US release of "Are You Ready?", Richard Ashcroft and Big Life Management commissioned Giorgio Testi for the promo – to be created out of live footage from a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. The video premiered on 7 February on the official website of Pulse Films, the production company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulsefilms.co.uk/news/?p=619|work=Pulse Films official website|title=Richard Ashcroft's 'Are You Ready?' by Giorgio Testi}}</ref>

After six years' absence, Ashcroft released his comeback fifth studio album, ''[[These People (Richard Ashcroft album)|These People]]'', in May 2016. The album received largely positive reviews from music critics. The album was followed by 2016 UK and Europe tour, an abbreviated North American tour, and—for the first time in Ashcroft's career—festival dates in Latin America.

In January 2018, it was confirmed that in June 2018, Ashcroft would be supporting [[Liam Gallagher]] at his two concerts in Malahide Castle and Gardens in Dublin and Belsonic at Ormeau Park in Belfast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/richard-ashcroft-supporting-liam-gallagher-2229103|title=Richard Ashcroft will support Liam Gallagher at these summer gigs|first=Luke Morgan|last=Britton|date=26 January 2018|website=NME|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> In March 2018, it was announced that Ashcroft would tour with Gallagher in North America in May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/liam-gallagher-richard-ashcroft-north-america-tour-2268888|title=Liam Gallagher and Richard Ashcroft to tour North America together|first=Luke Morgan|last=Britton|date=19 March 2018|website=NME|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> On 11 June 2018, it was announced that Ashcroft would support Gallagher at his show at [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] on 18 August 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/liam-gallagher/richard-ashcroft-support-acts-manchester/|title=Liam Gallagher's Huge Manchester Support Acts Announced|website=Radio X|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref>

In August 2018, Ashcroft announced his sixth solo album, ''[[Natural Rebel]]'', which was released October 19, preceded by the single "Surprised By The Joy" in September and subsequent teasers "Born To Be Strangers" and "That's When I Feel It." The LP debuted at #4 on the UK album charts.

Ashcroft is married to [[Kate Radley]], a former member of [[Spiritualized]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/09/rock.music | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | title=Music's a personal crusade, very much within his soul. But he's reaching out for something else – what he can be | first=Dave | last=Simpson | date=8 November 2007}}</ref> They married in 1995 and it was years before it was publicly revealed that the pair had married. Together, they have two sons: Sonny, born in 2000, and Cassius, born in 2004. The family lives in [[Taynton, Gloucestershire|Taynton]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in London.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/28/richard-ashcroft-i-wouldnt-trade-what-coldplay-have-achieved-for-any-of-my-songs|title=Richard Ashcroft: 'I wouldn't trade what Coldplay have achieved for any of my songs'|date=28 April 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref> Ashcroft is a [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] fan, and regularly attends matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/10245139/fenners-meets-richard-ashcroft|title=Fenners meets Richard Ashcroft|website=SkySports.com|access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref>

He is good friends with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Liam Gallagher]] and [[Coldplay]]'s [[Chris Martin]]. For a long time the Gallagher brothers have expressed great respect for Ashcroft, with Noel Gallagher fondly nicknaming Ashcroft 'Captain Rock'. The Oasis track "[[Cast No Shadow (song)|Cast No Shadow]]", from the successful 1995 album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' is dedicated to him, possibly as a response to Ashcroft having dedicated the title track of ''[[A Northern Soul]]'' to Noel Gallagher.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-verves-a-northern-soul-20-years-on-a-knife-twisting-snapshot-of-a-band-on-the-brink-767197 | work=NME | title=The Verve's 'A Northern Soul' 20 Years On: A Knife-Twisting Snapshot Of A Band On The Brink | date=1 July 2015| access-date=18 November 2016}}</ref> Ashcroft also provided backing vocals on the Oasis song "[[All Around the World (Oasis song)|All Around the World]]" in 1997, for Oasis' ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]''.

In a 2006 interview, Ashcroft mentioned taking [[Prozac]] to help him with [[clinical depression]], but said that it did not help, referring to the pills as "very, very synthetic." Ashcroft has said that he's always been "a depressive, someone who suffers from depression", and that music and creativity help him cope with his illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonnet.co.uk/entertainment/2006/jan/883_20060117.html |website=Londonnet.co.uk |title=Richard Ashcroft confesses to taking Prozac for depression |access-date=29 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823014254/http://www.londonnet.co.uk/entertainment/2006/jan/883_20060117.html |archive-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversies==
Controversy exists over the  Verve's biggest hit, "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", on which Ashcroft is the sole band member to share a co-writing credit.<ref name="Urban Hymns sleevenotes">''Urban Hymns'' sleevenotes</ref> The song uses a sample of [[Andrew Oldham Orchestra]]'s recording of [[The Rolling Stones]]' 1965 song "[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]". The Verve had negotiated this legally; however, the  Rolling Stones' [[ABKCO Records|record company]] successfully sued and argued that they had used "too much." The Verve was subsequently forced to give ABKCO 100 percent of the [[royalties]]<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/> from "Bitter Sweet Symphony", and [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] were given songwriting credits along with Ashcroft.<ref name="Urban Hymns sleevenotes"/> On 23 May 2019, Ashcroft announced that Jagger and Richards had signed over the rights to him. He now has sole writing credit, and will receive all future royalties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Humphries |first1=Will |title=Verve singer Richard Ashcroft's 22‑year fight with Rolling Stones is all over now |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/verve-singer-richard-ashcroft-s-22-year-fight-with-rolling-stones-is-all-over-now-5wnfcrwhz |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |date=24 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Beaumont-Thomas |first1=Ben |title=Bittersweet no more: Rolling Stones pass Verve royalties to Richard Ashcroft |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/23/bitter-sweet-symphony-royalties-richard-ashcroft-verve-royalties-novello |access-date=24 May 2019 |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |date=23 May 2019 |language=en |quote=23 May 2019 17.58 BST Last modified on Thu  22.13 BST}}</ref>

On 19 June 2006, Richard Ashcroft was arrested in [[Wiltshire]] after bursting into a youth centre and asking to work with the teenagers present at the club. He began swearing and refusing to leave so employees called the police, resulting in Ashcroft being arrested and receiving an £80 fine for [[disorderly behaviour]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard Ashcroft in shock arrest|url=https://www.nme.com/news/richard-ashcroft/23405|access-date=7 January 2015|work=NME|date=21 June 2006}}</ref>

In July 2021, Ashcroft pulled out of the headline slot at Sheffield's [[Tramlines Festival|Tramlines festival]] after it became part of the UK government's pilot events programme.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-07-05|title=Richard Ashcroft refuses to play festival that is government test event|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-57722072|access-date=2021-07-06}}</ref>
