The lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Masato Hayakawa]], guitarists Ryo Yokochi (Y.K.C.) and Kazuya Sugiyama (Sugi), bassist Ryo Shimizu (RxYxO) and drummer Katsuma Minatani.

The band's first two albums, ''[[Final Destination (album)|Final Destination]]'' and ''[[The Enemy Inside (Coldrain album)|The Enemy Inside]]'', were both released exclusively in their home country of Japan. The group made their worldwide debut in 2014 with the reissue of ''[[The Revelation (Coldrain album)|The Revelation]]'', which was previously released in 2013 under the label [[VAP (company)|VAP]], with the worldwide edition being released under [[Hopeless Records]] and [[Sony Music Australia|Sony Music]].

Coldrain later released ''[[Vena (album)|Vena]]'' (2015) and ''[[Fateless (album)|Fateless]]'' (2017).

==History==
=== 2007–2008: Formation and major label debut ===
After the disbanding of the bands Wheel of Life (RxYxO, Sugi and Y.K.C.) and [[AVER (band)|AVER]] ([[Masato Hayakawa|Masato]] and Katsuma),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jouyutzlhk|title=AVER - Voices over bullets (Masato and Katsuma from coldrain).}}</ref> Coldrain was formed on April 17, 2007 in [[Nagoya]] with [[Masato Hayakawa]] on vocals, RxYxO (Ryo) on bass guitar, Katsuma on drums, and Y.K.C (Yokochi) and Sugi on guitars. The common musical interest of the members was one of the decisive factors in the formation of coldrain. Once, when [[AVER (band)|AVER]] and Wheel of Life first co-debuted on stage, and AVER heard [[Sevendust]]'s song played during Wheel of Life's [[rehearsal]], an excited Katsuma asked RxYxO, "Don't tell me you're a fan of Sevendust as well!?"<ref name="powerpush">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceshowertv.com/powerpush/pp1/1304_coldrain.html|title=スペースシャワーTV ｜ レコメンドアーティスト - The Revelation / coldrain|work=[[Space Shower TV]]|language=ja}}</ref> Thereafter, each time they interacted, they wanted to form a new band together. RxYxO was originally doing vocals, but became a bassist because of coldrain.<ref name="powerpush"/> The band gained their first followers from performing as a local band in their home-town while distributing demo discs after each performance.

About a year after coldrain formed, they signed a major contract with [[Video and Audio Project|VAP]],<ref name="vap">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vap.co.jp/coldrain/|title=VAP -coldrain-|website=Vap.co.jp|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> and the band released their debut [[maxi single]] "[[Fiction (Coldrain song)|Fiction]]" on 5 November 2008. They then set off for their first nationwide tour and played in 30 venues across Japan.

=== 2009–2011: ''Final Destination'' and ''The Enemy Inside'' ===
{{Main|Final Destination (album)|l1=Final Destination|The Enemy Inside (Coldrain album)|l2=The Enemy Inside}}
After the tour, the group released their next [[maxi single]]: [[8AM (song)|8AM]]. The limited edition included a DVD which featured the music video of the title song and three live videos: "Fiction", "Painting", and "Come Awake". "8AM" was also used as a theme song to the [[anime]] series ''[[Hajime no Ippo]]: New Challenger''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vap.co.jp/ippo2/goods.html|title=アニメ はじめの一歩 New Challenger：PROMOTION SITE|website=Vap.co.jp|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> In 2009, saw their first performance at the [[Summer Sonic Festival]] 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.summersonic.com/09/lineup/182.html?a=o07 |title=coldrain {{!}} LINEUP {{!}} SUMMER SONIC 09 |access-date=7 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308010040/http://www.summersonic.com/09/lineup/182.html?a=o07 |archive-date=8 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In October, they released their first album ''[[Final Destination (album)|Final Destination]]''<ref name="musicglue">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicglue.com/coldrain/biography/|title=Biography|work=musicglue.com}}</ref> and embarked on another successful sold-out nationwide tour.

The band released their debut [[Extended play|EP]]: ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Coldrain EP)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' on 23 June 2010. One of the songs, "We're Not Alone", was used as an opening theme of the anime series ''[[Rainbow: Nisha Rokubō no Shichinin]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/rainbow/music/index.html|title=主題歌 &#124; RAINBOW 二舎六房の七人|website=Ntv.co.jp|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> Another song, "Die Tomorrow", was used in the ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 2011]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="musicglue"/> They also went on tour with several bands, including [[Mucc]], [[Avengers in sci-fi]] and [[Totalfat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/36135|title=ムック企画「えん」にアヴェンズ、TOTALFATら6組追加|work=Natalie|language=ja}}</ref>

On 16 February 2011, Coldrain released their second album called ''[[The Enemy Inside (coldrain album)|The Enemy Inside]]'', which keeps the melodic vocals and breakdown parts of the last songs.

I can't wait for everyone to hear the songs, learn the words and sing them with us live. We are grateful for the many fans in our homeland that have supported us in becoming the band we are today.

In regards to the performance at the Yokohama Arena, a venue of a capacity of 17,000, frontman [[Masato Hayakawa]] issued a statement:

<blockquote> "Blarefest back in February, which hosted and announced the international acts.
In June, I had no choice but to announce the postponement of the tour in a hope that self-exclusion would begin and converge.
We'll be able to make it to the rocks by October, can't we?! I was thinking that it's all the same that I was expecting.
However, the reality is that we can't get together as the first member after
we put together Coldrain, the time when we can't play live blows, we can't perform even if we want to perform, we can't see any breakthroughs, and it's time to make this announcement.
Now that various forms have been explored and the number of festivals and artists holding festivals and artists has increased by reducing the number of people, it may appear that it is possible to hold them somehow.
But the final conclusion is that by the standards of Coldrain, we still can't see the "new shape" and we still have to endure it as a live band.
However, I don't feel like I can see Coldrain live when social distancing comes in to think about how many people can be packed into the arena by attacking the last minute, and sticking to how close I can get to the audience.
I was troubled. But there is no hesitation.
Because the situation is a situation, we have to use the word cancellation instead of postponing it, but what we can promise now is that we will definitely do it someday.
Without the risk or anxiety caused by the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|corona]], let's endure it until it is in a state where we can help each other like that time, go on a rampage, scream from the bottom of our stomachs, and go home.
Let's make a happy live performance as much as you can endure.

Until then, I pray for everyone's health and dream of being able to welcome Coldrain's [[Yokohama Arena]] performance in perfect condition.
I'm not going to waste 10/18, and I'm trying to take on challenges that I've never done as a band that I can't see everyone live.
I'm just enduring it now, I'm not going to die! Regards from now on!"<ref name="Spice.Eplus"/></blockquote>

Early in its career the band played songs that sounded like [[alternative rock]] and especially like [[post-hardcore]],<ref name="jame">{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/uk/artists-biography-1109-coldrain.html|work=Jame-world.com|title=Coldrain}}</ref><ref name=wolves>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://houseofwolves.fr/musique/interview-exclusive-coldrain/|work=Houseofwolves.fr|title=Interview Exclusive : coldrain|access-date=18 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618160019/http://houseofwolves.fr/musique/interview-exclusive-coldrain/|archive-date=18 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> accompanied by guitar pieces reminiscent of classic metalcore<ref name="musictrespass"/> and [[thrash metal]] riffs. By their third album, ''[[The Revelation (Coldrain album)|The Revelation]]'', coldrain's music came to be defined as a mix of [[post-hardcore]] and [[metalcore]].<ref name=wolves/> According to other critics, certain influences instead recall genres like [[pop punk]] and [[screamo]],<ref name="musictrespass"/> and the band has been likened to groups like [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Pay Money to My Pain]],<ref name="jame"/> [[Asking Alexandria]], [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]]<ref name="musictrespass"/> and [[A Day to Remember]]. [[Masato Hayakawa]] himself has stated [[Linkin Park]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] to be his biggest influences to start recording music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pushtofire.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/interview-coldrain/|title=INTERVIEW: COLDRAIN|date=25 August 2014}}</ref> When Y.K.C, the main composer of the band, was asked about songwriting, he said, "It is essential not to forget 'why a song is cool', the song itself needs to have holding power, and only then is there meaning. That's what I try not to forget when [[musical composition|composing]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mi-japan.com/alumni/alumni-ykc|title=「とにかくバンドを組んでライブハウスに出ろ」ってことを強く言いたいです。|language=ja|access-date=25 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193411/http://mi-japan.com/alumni/alumni-ykc|archive-date=26 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
