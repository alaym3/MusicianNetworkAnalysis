'''Ezra Furman and the Harpoons''' were a four-piece rock band active between 2006 and 2011. The band consisted of [[Ezra Furman]] ([[vocals]], [[guitar]]), Job Mukkada ([[bass guitar]]), Adam Abrutyn ([[Drum kit|drums]]), and Andrew Langer ([[guitar]]). They formed at [[Tufts University]] in 2006.

==History==
They self-released their first album, ''Beat Beat Beat'' in June 2006, which was recorded in a series of college dorm rooms and engineered by former band member, Jahn Sood, and Dave Kant from Outtake Records.

In August 2007, the group signed with [[Minty Fresh Records]] for a two album contract and released their debut album ''[[Banging Down the Doors]]'', produced by [[Brian Deck]] for [[Minty Fresh Records]]. ''Banging Down The Doors'' was met with critical acclaim, making several best of 2007 lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/12/pastelocal-chicagos-best-of-2008-albums-and-songs.html |title=Paste:Local Chicago's Best of 2008: Albums & Songs :: Local:Chicago |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=2008-12-22 |access-date=2010-11-10}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Inside the Human Body]]'', was released in October 2008, and was also well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2008/12/top-local-indie.html |title=Turn It Up: Top local indies of 2008: Shot Baker, Nachtmystium, Cool Kids |publisher=Leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com |date=2008-12-18 |access-date=2010-11-10}}</ref>

After their contract with [[Minty Fresh Records]] expired, they released a self-produced album titled ''Moon Face'', which included live recordings and some of Furman's solo work. When the album was ordered through the band's website, one could include a small passage about themselves, and as an addition to the album, Furman would write a song singularly for the purchaser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ezrafurman.bigcartel.com/product/moon-face-bootlegs-and-road-recordings-2006-2009 |title=Ezra Furman & the Harpoons â€” MOON FACE: Bootlegs and Road Recordings 2006 - 2009 |publisher=Ezrafurman.bigcartel.com |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217190127/http://www.ezrafurman.bigcartel.com/product/moon-face-bootlegs-and-road-recordings-2006-2009 |archive-date=2010-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Their third studio album, ''[[Mysterious Power]]'', was released on April 5, 2011. through [[Red Parlor Records]]. It was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by [[Doug Boehm]].<ref>Conner, Thomas.
