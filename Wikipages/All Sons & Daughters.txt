==Background==
All Sons & Daughters formed in 2009, signing with their label Integrity in October 2010.<ref name=CCM/> They released three EPs, which were ''Brokenness Aside: EP No. 1'', ''Prone To Wander: A Collection of Hymns EP'' and ''Reason To Sing: EP No. 2'' that charted at No. 12 on [[Top Christian Albums|Christian Albums]] chart and No. 5 on [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/reason-to-sing-r2402495/charts-awards|title=Reason to Sing - All Sons & Daughters|author=Billboard|website=allmusic|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref> before their first full-length studio album called ''Season One''.<ref name=JESUS/> The album was released on March 13, 2012.<ref name=JESUS/> Their second album, ''Live'', was released April 23, 2013.

David Alan Leonard, formerly a member of Jackson Waters, decided he wanted deeper and more authentic connection with a planted body of believers. Leslie Anne Jordan had grown up in worship leading settings since high school, where she wrestled with a calling into a full career of ministry. The two were equally devoted to recording music that was authentic and raw. They joined together to write songs that have been called "unpolished" due to the unedited nature of their music. Both Leslie and David wanted to remain connected to the church body they shared. They have continued to lead worship at their non-denominational church in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], while also recording music and touring the country in concert.<ref>{{cite web|last=NRATeamAdmin|title=All Sons & Daughters Artist Profile|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=3412|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DeTray|first=Chris|title=All Sons & Daughters: About|url=http://allsonsanddaughters.com/about|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>
