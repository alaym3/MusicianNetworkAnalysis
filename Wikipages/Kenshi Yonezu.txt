For creating songs, Yonezu uses music software [[Cakewalk Sonar]].<ref name="Minaken"/> When he started to create Vocaloid music, he used [[Vocaloid#Vocaloid 2|Vocaloid 2]] software, and [[Hatsune Miku]] vocals exclusively.<ref name="Dengeki-P2"/><ref name="Niconico-Profile"/><ref name="Minaken"/> However, in 2010, Yonezu began using Megurine Luka and Gumi in his songs as well.<ref name="Niconico-Profile"/> His album ''Hanataba to Suisō'' features Hatsune Miku only, whereas ''Official Orange'' features Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka, Gumi, as well as his own vocals on the song {{nihongo|"Yūen Shigai|遊園市街||"Amusement City Streets"}}.<ref name="Natalie-DioramaInt"/>

He answered on a radio program that [[Susumu Hirasawa]]'s "MOTHER," which he listened to before he was 18 years old when he started his music career, was "one of the songs that changed my life," and said, "All of Susumu Hirasawa's songs have a musicality that I had never heard before, and I was very influenced by them.<ref name="ARCHIVE">{{Cite web|title=ARCHIVE|url=https://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/otoajito/|access-date=2021-08-16|website=SAPPORO BEER OTOAJITO {{!}} J-WAVE 81.3 FM RADIO|language=ja}}</ref> Yonezu said he learned about Susumu Hirasawa from [[Niconico|Nico Nico Douga]], and said, "This song 'MOTHER' is really new music that I've never heard before, but I feel nostalgia and nostalgia in it. I thought there was something universal about it." "I thought it was music with an amazing sense of balance, and for the first time, I thought I would cherish that sense of balance in my own music. [[Chris Peppler]], the MC of the radio show and star of "Kamen Rider Drive," asked me, "Would you like to meet him?" Yonezu replied, "On the contrary, I don't want to meet someone I really respect."<ref name="ARCHIVE"/>
