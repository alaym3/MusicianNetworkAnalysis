'''Melanie Anne Safka-Schekeryk''' (born February 3, 1947), professionally known as '''Melanie''' or '''Melanie Safka''', is an American singer-songwriter.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> She is best known for the 1971–72 global hit "[[Brand New Key]]", her cover of "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]", her composition "[[What Have They Done to My Song Ma]]", and her 1970 international breakthrough hit "[[Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)]]" (inspired by her experience of performing at the 1969 [[Woodstock]] music festival).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1972_4singles.html|title="Brand New Key" – Melanie|publisher=Superseventies.com|access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/sw_laydown.html|title=Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)|publisher=Superseventies.com|access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Melanie was born and raised in the [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], New York City. Her father, Frederick M. Safka (1924–2009), was of [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] ethnic background, and her mother, jazz singer Pauline "Polly" Altomare (1926–2003), was of [[Italians|Italian]] heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melaniemusic.com/melanie/Sheapr71.htm |title=Melanie Safka is known to her fans simply as Melanie|publisher=Melaniemusic.com|access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>Spelling, Ian.

==Career==
In the 1960s, Melanie started performing at The Inkwell, a coffee house in the West End section of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]]. After high school, her parents insisted that she go to college, so she studied acting at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York,<ref name="youtube1985">{{YouTube|J1N_wEg56Dk|Interview with Kathie Lee, 1985. Retrieved September 5, 2011}}</ref> where she began singing in the folk clubs of [[Greenwich Village]], such as [[The Bitter End]], and signed her first recording contract.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shedden|first1=Iain|title=Look what they did to her songs|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/look-what-they-did-to-her-songs/news-story/cf9364fe470ec715a2ccfd053815c6a1|access-date=December 19, 2017|work=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

Initially signed to [[Columbia Records]] in the United States, Melanie released two singles on the label. Subsequently, she signed with [[Buddah Records]] and first found chart success in Europe in 1969 with "Bobo's Party" which reached No. 1 in France. Melanie's popularity in Europe resulted in performances on European television programs, such as ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in West Germany. Her debut album received positive reviews from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which heralded her voice as "wise beyond her years. Her non-conformist approach to the selections on this LP make her a new talent to be reckoned with."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310410/melanie/biography|title=Melanie Safka biography|website=Billboard|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockhereandnow.com/2013/08/melanie-safka-exclusive-my-mother-drove.html|title=Melanie Safka Exclusive: "My Mother Drove Me To Woodstock" (Part 1)|website=classicrockhereandnow.com|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref>

Later in 1969, Melanie had a hit in the Netherlands with "Beautiful People". She was one of only three solo women<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/entertainment/tn-gnp-me-melanie-safka-20161004-story.html|title=Music Preview: Almost five decades after Woodstock, Melanie Safka still delivers powerful message|last=Whiteside|first=Jonny|website=Glendale News-Press|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> who performed at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in 1969 and the inspiration for her first hit song, "[[Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)]]", apparently arose from the Woodstock audience lighting candles during her set (although most of the "candles" were actually matches or lighters).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beviglia|first1=Jim|title=Melanie, "(Lay Down) Candles In The Rain"|url=http://americansongwriter.com/2013/08/melanie-lay-down-candles-in-the-rain/|website=American Songwriter: The Craft of Music|publisher=ForASong Media, LLC|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-date=October 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030040947/http://americansongwriter.com/2013/08/melanie-lay-down-candles-in-the-rain/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The recording became a hit in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States in 1970. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the single featured Melanie's spoken-word track "Candles in the Rain". "Lay Down" became Melanie's first top ten hit in America, peaking at No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|singles chart]] and achieving worldwide success. Later hits included "Peace Will Come (According To Plan)" and a cover of the [[Rolling Stones]]' "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rhodes|first1=Mick|title=Melanie brings music history to Claremont|url=https://www.claremont-courier.com/articles/news/t20318-melanie|access-date=December 12, 2017|work=[[Claremont Courier]]|date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Soffty-Melanie Safka.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Melanie on the "Mr Softee" free stage]]
In 1970, Melanie was the only artist to ignore the court injunction banning the [[Powder Ridge Rock Festival]] scheduled to be held on July 31, August 1 and 2, 1970.<ref>{{cite book |last=Santelli |first=Robert |author-link=Joe Bloggs |date=1980 |title= Aquarius Rising – The Rock Festival Years.|publisher= Dell Publishing Co., Inc. |page=200}}</ref> She played for the crowd on a homemade stage powered by [[Mister Softee]] trucks.

She was also the artist who sang to herald in the summer solstice at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury Fayre]] (later the Glastonbury Festival) in England, in June 1971. She performed again at Glastonbury in 2011, the 40th anniversary of the original festival.<ref>''Uncut'', July 2011.</ref>

Melanie left Buddah Records when they insisted that she produce albums on demand. In 1971, she formed her own label, [[Neighborhood Records]], with Peter Schekeryk who was also her producer and husband. She had her biggest American hit on the Neighborhood label, the novelty-sounding 1972 number one "[[Brand New Key]]" (often referred to as "The Roller Skate Song"). "Brand New Key" sold over three million copies worldwide and was featured in the 1997 movie ''[[Boogie Nights (soundtrack)|Boogie Nights]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Woodbury|first1=Jason P|title=Melanie Talks "Brand New Key", Starting Over, and McDonald's|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/melanie-talks-brand-new-key-starting-over-and-mcdonalds-6593542|access-date=December 11, 2017|work=Phoenix News Times|publisher=Phoenix New Times, LLC|date=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

When first released, "Brand New Key" was banned by some radio stations because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged the possibility of reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, "I wrote [''Brand New Key''] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been [[Freudian psychology|Freudian]] symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories as to what the lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio ... My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in their life afterward ... People will take it any way they want to take it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1972_4singles.html|title="Brand New Key" – Melanie|publisher=Superseventies.com|access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

In a 2013 interview with music journalist Ray Shasho, Melanie revealed the true origin of "Brand New Key":

<blockquote>Of course I can see it symbolically with the key, but I just thought of roller skating. I was fasting with a twenty seven-day fast on water. I broke the fast and went back to my life living in New Jersey and we were going to a flea market around six in the morning. On the way back ... and I had just broken the fast, from the flea market, we passed a McDonalds and the aroma hit me, and I had been a vegetarian before the fast. So we pulled into the McDonalds and I got the whole works ... the burger, the shake and the fries ... and no sooner after I finished that last bite of my burger ... that song was in my head. The aroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and the vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire. And me saying to my dad ... "You're holding, you're holding, you’re holding, right? Then I'd look back and he wasn't holding and I'd fall. So that whole thing came back to me and came out in this song. So it was not a deliberate or intentional sexual innuendo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmusicwriter.com/2013/08/melanie-safka-exclusive-my-mother-drove.html|title='Melanie' Safka Exclusive: "My Mother Drove Me To Woodstock" (Part 1)|last=Classic Rock Music Reporter|access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>

The follow-up single to "Brand New Key" was "Ring the Living Bell". To compete with this release, Melanie's former record company released "The Nickel Song", which she had recorded while still signed to Buddah Records. Both songs were simultaneous top-40 hits while "Brand New Key" was still on the charts – setting a record for the first female performer to have three top-40 hits concurrently.<ref>[[American Top 40]], February 26, 1972</ref>

She was awarded ''Billboard''{{'}}s No. 1 Top Female Vocalist award for 1972. She has been awarded two gold albums (and a gold single for "Brand New Key"), and three of her compositions were hits for [[The New Seekers]]. She is also well known for her musical adaptations of children's songs, including "Alexander Beetle" and "Christopher Robin". When she became an official [[UNICEF]] ambassador in 1972, she agreed to forego a world tour in favor of raising money for the organization.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Paul|title=MELANIE: STILL ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE|url=http://popcultureclassics.com/melanie.html|website=Pop Culture Classics|access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

Melanie had another top-40 hit single in 1973 with "Bitter Bad", a song that marked a slight departure from the hippie sentiments of earlier hits (with lyrics such as "If you do me wrong I'll put your first and last name in my rock n' roll song"). Other chart hits during this period were the self-penned "Together Alone" and a cover of "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]". In 1973, Melanie started to retreat from the spotlight to begin a family.

===Later career===
In 1976, Melanie released one album on [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Photograph (Melanie album)|Photograph]]'', which was overseen by [[Ahmet Ertegun]]. The album was praised by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the year's best, although it was largely ignored by the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/14/archives/melanies-back-and-shes-not-kissing-cows-melanie.html|title=Melanie's Back And She's Not Kissing Cows|last=Rockwell|first=John|date=November 14, 1976|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 19, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> It was re-issued on CD in 2005 with an additional disc of unreleased material.

In 1983, Melanie wrote the music and lyrics for a [[musical theatre|theatrical musical]], ''Ace of Diamonds'', with a book by Ed Kelleher and Seymour Vall, based on a series of letters written by [[Annie Oakley]]. Though never fully produced, several staged readings were performed at the Lincoln Center starring Melanie as the narrator and pop singer and actress [[Annie Golden]] as Oakley.<ref name=Copyright>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/copyright/red-hot-and-blue-nights-at-the-kingfish-cafe-stand-ins/ |title=Red hot & blue, nights at the Kingfish Cafe, Stand-ins, Stand ins |publisher=Faqs.org |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 1989, Melanie won an [[Emmy Award]] for writing the lyrics to "The First Time I Loved Forever", the [[theme music|theme song]] for the TV series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. With one exception, her albums were produced by her husband, Peter Schekeryk, who died suddenly in 2010.<ref>Melanie, quoted in ''Uncut'', July 2011</ref> Her three children – Leilah, Jeordie and Beau-Jarred – are also musicians. Beau-Jarred is a guitarist and accompanies his mother on tour.

One of Melanie's later albums, ''Paled By Dimmer Light'' (2004), was co-produced by Peter and Beau-Jarred Schekeryk and includes the songs "To Be The One", "Extraordinary", "Make It Work" and "I Tried To Die Young". In early 2005 most of Melanie's back-catalog was re-released on the internet-only music label ItsAboutMusic.com. After a series of disagreements, the relationship between the artist and the label was severed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2007, Melanie was invited by [[Jarvis Cocker]] to perform at the [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown Festival]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. Her sold-out performance received critical acclaim, with ''[[The Independent]]'' saying, "it was hard to disagree that Melanie has earned her place alongside Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell and Marianne Faithfull in the pantheon of iconic female singers. Meltdown was all the better for her presence."<ref name="Independent review published 19 June 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.melaniesmusic.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=20299&page=4&feature= |title=Beautiful People – Forums powered by UBB.threads™ |publisher=Melaniesmusic.com |date=March 28, 2015 |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The concert was filmed for a DVD titled ''Melanie: For One Night Only'', which was released in October 2007. She recorded "Psychotherapy", sung to the tune of the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]", which parodies aspects of Freudian psychoanalysis. It has been played on ''The [[Dr. Demento]] Show''. In 2012, Melanie headlined at the 15th annual [[Woody Guthrie Folk Festival]], along with Arlo Guthrie and Judy Collins. The festival is held annually in mid-July to celebrate the life and music of legendary singer-songwriter and folk musician Woody Guthrie.

In October 2012, Melanie collaborated with John Haldoupis, the artistic and managing director of Blackfriars Theatre in Rochester, New York, to create an original musical about her love story with her late husband, Peter. ''Melanie and the Record Man'' made its world premiere on October 19, with performances scheduled until October 28. The musical, conceived and designed by Haldoupis, features the music of Melanie and tells the story of her meeting Peter, falling in love, and working together to produce her music. Melanie performed during the musical and was also the narrator. In June 2014, she toured Australia for the first time since 1977.<ref name="Australian Tour 2014">{{Cite web|url=http://www.melaniesafka.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923094655/http://www.melaniesafka.com/#/tour--2?pp=1/|url-status=dead|title=Melanie|archive-date=September 23, 2004|website=Melanie|access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>
