==Influences==
When asked about his musical influences, singer-guitarist Kris Leonard said, "I'm definitely not consciously influenced by anyone",<ref name="lecho-guy"/> but mentioned [[the Coral]], [[the Zutons]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Hooton Tennis Club]] as being among his favourite [[Liverpool]] bands.<ref name="lecho-guy"/> He also said [[the Kooks]]' debut studio album ''[[Inside In/Inside Out]]'' played a big part in him becoming a musician.<ref name=wonder>{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Lizzy|title=New Noise: Viola Beach|url=http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/01/new-noise-viola-beach/|website=Wonderland Magazine|access-date=14 February 2016|date=29 January 2016}}</ref> ''BBC Introducing'' recommended the band to fans of [[Coasts (band)|Coasts]] and the Kooks,<ref name="bbc-cobain"/> while other critics drew comparisons with 1990s [[Britpop]].<ref name="parisien">{{cite news|language=fr|title=Découverte musique : Viola Beach|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/societe/culture/decouverte-musique-viola-beach-28-08-2015-5044887.php|access-date=17 February 2016|work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=28 August 2015}}</ref>

Leonard told ''Wonderland'' magazine that much of the band's lyrical content was inspired by their "very grey and industrial" hometown, where there was "nothing to do other than drink cider and smoke rollies on a park and chase after girls".<ref name=wonder/>

==Deaths==
[[File:Saltsjöbron, E4-bron och Järnvägsbron, 2017a.jpg|thumbnail|The bridges over the [[Södertälje Canal]]. The incident took place on the centre bridge.]]
In the early hours of 13 February 2016, all four band members together with manager Craig Tarry died in what remains a largely unexplained incident on a [[lift bridge]] along the [[European route E4|E4]] motorway at [[Södertälje]], southwest of [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref name="bbcnews">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35572838|title=UK band Viola Beach 'killed in Swedish car crash'|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2016|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="nme">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/91488|title=Members of UK band Viola Beach reportedly killed in Sweden car crash|work=NME.com|date=14 February 2016|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="9net">{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/entertainment/2016/02/14/21/24/members-of-british-indie-band-viola-beach-among-five-killed-after-car-plunges-off-bridge-in-sweden|title=Members of British indie band Viola Beach among five killed after car plunges off bridge in Sweden|work=[[Nine Network]]|date=14 February 2016|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref> At around 2:00 am, witnesses saw the band's car, a [[Nissan Qashqai]], clipping a stationary vehicle, driving through closed barriers and falling through a gap in the bridge, whose middle section was being lifted to let an oil tanker pass underneath. The band had played the previous day at the ''Where's the Music?'' festival in [[Norrköping]], and they were returning to the hotel at [[Arlanda Airport]].<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Khomami|first1=Nadia|last2=Meikle|first2=James|title=Members and manager of indie band Viola Beach die in car crash in Sweden|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/14/five-british-men-die-in-car-crash-in-stockholm-sweden|access-date=14 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="bbc-tribute">{{cite news|title=Viola Beach families pay tribute to band and manager|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35574051|access-date=14 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2016}}</ref>

The [[Swedish Police]] opened an inquiry. Among their initial findings was that the driver, whose identity was not disclosed until an inquest was held, had no traces of alcohol nor drugs in his blood.<ref name="bbc-inquiry">{{cite news|title=Viola Beach crash inquiry begins in Sweden|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35576251|access-date=16 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=siddique>{{cite news|author=Haroon Siddique and agency |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/25/viola-beach-driver-was-not-intoxicated-when-car-crashed |title=Viola Beach driver was not intoxicated when car crashed |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 February 2016 |access-date=25 February 2016}}</ref> It was also found that the car had braked before reaching the bridge, which, as the Police stated, ruled out the possibility that the driver had fallen asleep. However, the incident ultimately remained "completely inexplicable".<ref name="local">{{cite news|title=Viola Beach crash driver was not drunk, autopsy suggests|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20160225/viola-beach-crash-driver-was-not-drunk-autopsy-suggests|access-date=26 February 2016|work=[[The Local]]|date=25 February 2016}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, inquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned on 3&nbsp;March at Warrington Coroner's Court by Cheshire [[coroner]] Nicholas Rheinberg, who also released the bodies of the five men so their families could make funeral arrangements.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-35714975 |title=Viola Beach deaths: Bodies returned to family members |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2016 |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, the coroner recorded a verdict of "road traffic collision".

After analysing the video from a traffic camera, the police offered a reconstruction of the events. After the bridge barriers were lowered, two lorries were standing in the right-hand lane of the carriageway and two cars were standing in the left-hand lane, in front of the first set of barriers. The band's car arrived in the left lane, braked and then swerved left, narrowly passing the first car before driving on. The driver in the stationary front car estimated the speed of the band's car at {{convert|60|kph|abbr=on}}. He said their car then drove through both sets of barriers without braking. It subsequently struck the middle section of the bridge, which had been lifted by {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}}, and fell down {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} into the canal. It was suggested that the initial impact against the bridge may have been violent enough to cause the death of the car's occupants.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22414280.ab| title=Så körde popbandet mot döden på bron| newspaper=Aftonbladet| language=sv| date=10 March 2016| access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> The inquest heard that the car's speed was {{convert|108|kph|abbr=on}} and that Tarry was driving the vehicle.<ref name="inquest"/>
