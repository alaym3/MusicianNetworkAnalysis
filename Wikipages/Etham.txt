{{Short description|Second station of the Exodus}}
'''Etham''' ({{lang-he|אֵתָם}}, meaning "solid, enduring") was the second place, after [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]], at which the [[Israelites]] stopped during [[the Exodus]]. According to the [[Torah]], Etham was on the edge of the wilderness (i.e. the edge of civilization or the edge of cultivated land) and marked the start of their [[Wilderness]] journey along a route which avoided entering the land of the [[Philistines]], 'lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt'.<ref>Exodus 13:17</ref> It has been suggested that Etham is another name for Khetam (''fortress''), located on the great wall of [[Egypt]], which extended from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Suez]].<ref>M.G. Easton M.A., D.D., 'Etham', Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition (1897)</ref> It may be close to the modern town of [[Ismaïlia]].
