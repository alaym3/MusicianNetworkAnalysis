'''The Ocean''' (also known as '''The Ocean Collective''') is a German [[progressive metal]] band started in 2000 by German guitarist Robin Staps. Lo√Øc Rossetti has been the band's vocalist since the 2010 albums ''[[Heliocentric (The Ocean Collective album)|Heliocentric]]'' and ''[[Anthropocentric (album)|Anthropocentric]]''.

== History ==
The Ocean was founded in 2000 by guitarist and songwriter Robin Staps. During the following two years, about 40 musicians joined and left the band until a stable line-up was established. July 2002 saw The Ocean play their first concert at Berlin's now defunct semi-legal [[:de:Eimer (Berlin)|Eimer Club]]. Shortly after, the band released their eponymous demo ''Islands/Tides'', a 30-minute-long song that also constituted the substance of their early live shows.

After a brief tour with Swedish [[crust punk]] outfit Coma in early 2003, the band signed to Make My Day Records, which then released their debut album ''[[Fogdiver]]'' on September 1, 2003;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makemydayrecords.de/site/i_index.html|title=News|website=Make My Day Records|date=28 July 2003|access-date=28 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812012121/http://www.makemydayrecords.de/site/i_index.html|archive-date=12 August 2004|quote=THE OCEAN's debut album "Fogdiver" is ready to hit the stores on 09.01.2003.}}</ref> consisting of five songs, this is a instrumental record, despite the fact that on stage at least two singers could be found. Unlike its predecessor, this recording received considerable acclaim from critics throughout a variety of genres.

During winter and spring 2004, The Ocean recorded what was to become the material for their two following albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoceancollective.com/press-pdf/the_ocean_bio_2007.pdf|title=The Ocean Biography|website=Theoceancollective.com|format=PDF}}</ref> The calmer and more atmospheric half of this recording session was released as ''[[Fluxion (album)|Fluxion]]'' in August 2004; a joint effort of Make My Day and Throne Records. While the addition of vocalist Meta seemed to make the music more accessible to some, it also caused many other critics to consider the album a step backwards in terms of innovation and originality compared to the instrumental ''Fogdiver''. In interviews, the band would comment on this by pointing out the perceived closed-mindedness of some of the reviewers and their supposed inability to deal with the harshness and brutality the [[anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]], [[antitheism|anti-theistic]] vocals now added to The Ocean's sound.

After signing to [[Metal Blade Records]] in summer 2005, all the remaining songs from the session were released as ''[[Aeolian (album)|Aeolian]]''. Since ''Fluxion'' and ''Aeolian'' had originally been planned as a double CD with a mellow and a brutal part ‚Äî a plan that did not work out ‚Äî ''Aeolian'' came across as very different from its predecessor. Unlike on previous albums, classical instruments and electronic sounds were hardly used here, making the record sound rather minimalistic. But whereas ''Fluxion'' had featured only one singer, seven of them could be found on ''Aeolian'', among them [[Nate Newton (musician)|Nate Newton]], Sean Ingram, and Tomas Hallbom, whose names were also used extensively for the album's promotion campaign. According to the band, Meta's voice on ''Fluxion'' had created a monotony that was to be avoided on ''Aeolian'', which also resulted in the addition of second vocalist Nico Webers. March 2006 saw the North American release of the album. Later that year, a joint vinyl version of ''Fluxion'' and ''Aeolian'' was released by Throne Records, featuring three records in different colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/971494|title=The Ocean (2) - Fluxion / Aeolian|website=Discogs|access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref> During this time, vocalist Meta left the band and was replaced by Mike Pilat.

In late 2007, they released a new 2 disc album entitled ''[[Precambrian (album)|Precambrian]]''. A few months later Nico Webers left to join [[War From A Harlots Mouth]], leaving Mike Pilat as the band's sole vocalist. In April 2008, The Ocean embarked on a year-long tour through Europe and North America with bands like [[Intronaut]], [[Opeth]], and [[At The Gates]]. In April 2009 it was announced that lead vocalist Mike Pilat was leaving the band for personal reasons and other commitments.

On November 17, 2009, Robin Staps announced that a replacement vocalist had been found, Lo√Øc Rossetti. The Ocean released two albums in 2010, ''[[Heliocentric (The Ocean Collective album)|Heliocentric]]'' on April 9 and ''[[Anthropocentric (album)|Anthropocentric]]'' on November 9. Taken together, the two albums "represent a fundamental and philosophical [[criticism of Christianity|critique]] of [[Christianity]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/theoceancollective |title=THE OCEAN ('Heliocentric' out now!!!&# &#124; Free Music, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2 May 2013}}</ref> with ''Heliocentric'' describing the internal battles within the [[Catholic Church]] over the [[heliocentrism]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], and ''Anthropocentric'' critiquing the [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] view of [[Creationism]].

They announced that their first live DVD would be filmed on the 29 January 2011 in Berlin at the Museum f√ºr Musikinstrumente and will only contain tracks from their album ''Precambrian''. On August 3, 2011, The Ocean announced via its Facebook page that Robin Staps had been working on new material for an upcoming album. They stated that recording would get under way in early 2012 and hinted at the possibility of releasing another double album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/notes/the-ocean-collective/the-ocean-is-working-on-new-material/242005775830931 |title=THE OCEAN is working on new material |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2 May 2013}}</ref> In a September 2012 article on the website [[MetalSucks]], Robin stated that the new album was due for an April or May release in 2013 and would have very few if any vocals, but elaborated that Lo√Øc remains the vocalist of the group despite the change in style.<ref>{{cite web|last=Neilstein|first=Vince|date=4 September 2012|title=Are Metal Vocalists Irrelevant?

The band released ''[[Pelagial]]'' on April 29, 2013 in the United States. The CD version contained two discs - one has the songs with vocals, the other is purely instrumental. On 20 October 2013, the band announced the departure of guitarist Jonathan Nido and drummer Luc Hess.<ref>{{cite web|last=Neilstein|first=Vince|date=28 October 2013|title=The Ocean Collective Loses Two Members|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/10/28/ocean-collective-loses-two-members/|access-date=14 October 2014|website=[[MetalSucks]]}}</ref> It was later announced that Paul Seidel of the band [[War From A Harlots Mouth]] would replace Hess after the current tour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Neilstein|first=Vince|date=31 October 2013|title=And the New Drummer for The Ocean is...|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/10/31/new-drummer-ocean/|access-date=14 October 2014|website=[[MetalSucks]]}}</ref> Additionally, on the 8th of December it was announced via the band's Facebook page that Australian Damian Murdoch would be the band's new guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/theoceancollective?fref=ts|title=The Ocean Collective|website=Facebook|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref>
