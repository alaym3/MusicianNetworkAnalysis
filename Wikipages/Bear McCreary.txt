{{main|Music of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)|Music of Caprica}}

In 2003, McCreary worked under primary composer [[Richard Gibbs]] on the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|three-hour miniseries]] which served as a pilot for the reimagined series of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. When the show was picked up, Gibbs opted not to devote full-time to the regular series' production, and McCreary became the sole composer. He worked on the series until it reached its conclusion in 2009, scoring over 70 episodes. To date, six ''Battlestar Galactica'' soundtrack albums have been released, and have garnered a great deal of critical acclaim<ref name="sep080622">{{cite news|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Sepinwall on TV: Michael Giacchino and Bear McCreary, score keepers|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2008/06/sepinwall_on_tv_michael_giacch.html |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |access-date=March 18, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090321130959/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2008/06/sepinwall_on_tv_michael_giacch.html|archive-date=March 21, 2009|date=June 22, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ct080616">{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title='Battlestar Galactica' provides some Earth-shattering 'Revelations'|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/06/battlestar-ga-1.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]| access-date= March 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329055809/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/06/battlestar-ga-1.html|archive-date=March 29, 2009|date=June 16, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> and commercial success.

McCreary composed for the ''Battlestar Galactica'' prequel series ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome]]''.

=== ''Human Target'' ===
McCreary provided the score for the series ''[[Human Target (2010 TV series)|Human Target]]'' (based on [[Human Target|the comic book of the same name]]). The pilot episode and main theme score had been recorded with a full orchestra.<ref>{{cite web| last= McCreary| first= Bear| title=Human Target Screens Today|url=http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/?p=2532#comment-4702| publisher= BearMcCreary.com| access-date=July 26, 2009|date=July 25, 2009}}</ref> The series has the distinction of having one of the largest orchestras on television.

The score to the finale of season one, "Christopher Chance", used the largest orchestra ever assembled for episodic television, and he took the opportunity to rerecord the main title theme with a new orchestration with this larger ensemble.

In July 2010, he received his first Emmy nomination for the ''Human Target'' main title.<ref name = emmynomination>{{cite web| last= Burlingame| first=Jon|title=Emmy Music Nominations Announced|url=http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2010/070810.html| work= FilmMusicSociety.org |access-date=July 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817163328/http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2010/070810.html|archive-date=August 17, 2010|date=July 8, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''Black Sails'' ===
The opening title sequence for ''[[Black Sails (TV series)|Black Sails]]'' was composed by McCreary with a backing [[sea chantey]] inspired theme. It accurately features an instrument of the period in the form of the [[hurdy-gurdy]].{{Citation needed|reason=Hurdy Gurdies existed in the 18th century but whether or not they were popular in the locations of this show is unsure to this writer, they were probably out of fashion. If pirates played them is questionable and they certainly are not generally the instrument culturally associated with pirates.|date=January 2020}}

=== ''Outlander'' ===
McCreary has composed the soundtrack for each of the first five seasons of ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]'', with the main title being sung by long time collaborator and partner, Raya Yarbrough. McCreary was nominated for an Emmy for the episode "Sassenach" in 2015.
