'''The Dickies''' are an American [[punk rock]] band formed in the [[San Fernando Valley]], Los Angeles, in 1977. One of the longest tenured punk rock bands, they have been in continuous existence for over 40 years. They have consistently balanced catchy melodies, harmony vocals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bandstofans.com/interviews/greg-hanna-the-dickies |title=Interview with Greg Hanna of The Dickies |publisher=Bands To Fans |date=2019-01-05 |access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref name="dothebay1">[https://dothebay.com/events/2017/7/28/the-dickies] {{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> and [[pop music|pop]] song structures, with a speedy punk guitar attack.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1977–1979)===
Eventual Dickies vocalist Leonard Graves Phillips was a self-described celibate, "introverted character" in the period following high school. He played keyboards in his bedroom and, together with friend Bob Davis (later [[Chuck Wagon (musician)|Chuck Wagon]]), created a type of music that Phillips describes as "autism rock", similar to [[Devo]], though not as good. Another friend of Phillips was Steve Hufsteter, a former junior high school and high school class mate. The latter figure was the guitarist and main songwriter for local [[power pop]] band [[the Quick (US band)|the Quick]], and was giving guitar lessons to Stan Lee (born Stan Sobol).  Although Hufsteter thought highly of Phillips' keyboard playing, it was his opinion that Phillips becoming vocalist for the band Lee was starting would be good for his friend's social well being. Phillips intentionally sabotaged his first audition, but realizing his mistake, aggressively entreated Lee for another chance. That audition was successful. Singing for the Dickies had its intended effect for Phillips, causing him to break out of his shell, and improving his confidence with women.<ref name="latimes1989">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-10-19-ca-526-story.html|title=The Dickies Are Back, Just as Silly, Irreverent as Ever : Punk: Band will be in Huntington Beach Saturday evening, playing at Night Moves and pushing a new album called "Second Coming."|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref name="amazon108">{{cite book |last= Spitz|first= Marc|author-link= Marc Spitz|date= 2001|title= We Got the Neutron Bomb |location= New York|publisher= Three Rivers Press|pages= 108–121 |isbn= 0-609-80774-9}}</ref>

As a teenager, Stan Lee was a drug buddy of [[Iggy Pop]], once accepting the well known "leopard" jacket that the latter wore in [[the Stooges]] as payment for heroin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/iggy_pops_raw_power_jacket_the_rock-n-roll_shroud_of_turin|title=Iggy Pop's 'Raw Power' jacket: The rock-n-roll Shroud of Turin|date=February 24, 2017|website=DangerousMinds.net}}</ref> Surprisingly, it was not hanging out with Iggy Pop that pushed Lee into joining the nascent punk scene, but rather it was the experience of going with eventual Dickies bassist Billy Club (Bill Remar) to see [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] on their first American tour that proved most influential. Exposure to the music of [[the Ramones]] and [[the Weirdos]] was seminal as well. Prior to deciding on a [[punk rock]] direction, Lee had begun to learn guitar, at the urging of friend [[Kevin DuBrow]],<ref name="whatsmyscene1">{{cite web|author=Mary Boukouvalas |url=https://whatsmyscene.com/star-scene-stan-lee-of-the-dickies/ |title=Star Scene: Stan Lee - What's My Scene |website=Whatsmyscene.com |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> with the ambition of becoming a [[Ritchie Blackmore]]-like virtuoso. His teacher, Huffsteter, suggested that playing punk was a more practical idea, and by way of convincing, provided Lee with his initial introduction to the music of the Ramones. Lee and Club rounded out their initial punk band lineup with Phillips, multi-instrumentalist Chuck Wagon, and drummer Karlos Kaballero (Carlos Caballero), who came up with the name "Dickies" (Lee preferred "the Imbeciles"),<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punkglobe.com/stanleeinterview0513.php|title=Stan Lee|website=Punkglobe.com}}</ref> and the band made their live debut at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in September 1977. The Dickies were among the first punk rock [[musical ensemble|bands]] to emerge from Los Angeles. They were the first [[Punk rock in California|California punk]] band to appear on [[Big Three television networks|network television]] ([[C.P.O. Sharkey]]),<ref name=globe/> and the first California punk band to be signed to a [[major label|major]] [[record label]] ([[A&M Records]]).<ref name="amazon108"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dickies-mn0000123007 |title=The Dickies &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F19WAAAAIBAJ&pg=5437,3910792&dq=the-dickies+band&hl=en|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com}}</ref>

The book ''Going Underground: American Punk Rock 1979–1989'' describes the Dickies in the context of the early L.A. punk scene. Its author contends that the Dickies were "the best musicians on the scene and made good use of their talents". Also described is an early gig at [[the Masque]] in 1977. An opening band was so incompetent that "some punks turned a fire hose on them". The Dickies came out next, looking like "normal suburban nerds". The band "erupted in a tight, jackhammer, speed-of-light assault" of "ferocious... goofball comedy punk" which inspired manic punk rock dancing ("bodies carooming off each other"). The author claims that the Dickies' subsequent record contract caused jealousy among other bands, some of whom would say that the Dickies were only in it for money. This belief is contrasted with the Dickies actual stated primary goal of being written about in [[Slash (fanzine)]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Hurchalla|first= George|date= 2016 |title= Going Underground: American Punk 1979-1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aa6lCwAAQBAJ&q=l.a.+punk+the+dickies+X+germs+weirdos+screamers&pg=PT24 |pages=20–26 |isbn=978-1-62963-113-4 |edition= second}}</ref>

The band's A&M record deal came about after that label sacked the [[Sex Pistols]], one of several labels to do so in what manager [[Malcolm McLaren]] would later describe as "[[the Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]", wherein that band would behave poorly, and be booted off a label while keeping the signing money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grindhousedatabase.com/index.php/The_Great_Rock_%27n_Roll_Swindle/Review_2|title=The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle/Review 2 - The Grindhouse Cinema Database|website=Grindhousedatabase.com}}</ref><ref name="latimes1989"/> The label wanted a replacement punk band that was more manageable (or at least less notorious),<ref name=autogenerated1 />  and sent a representative to see the Dickies on the set of C.P.O. Sharky. This was followed up by a showcase at the Whisky, and some assertive bluster by Stan Lee, which, along with the enthusiastic efforts of true-believing manager John Hewlett<ref name="auto1">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first= Dave|author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|date= 2000|title= Alternative Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&q=sparks+manager+a%26m+the+dickies&pg=PA328|publisher= [[Miller Freeman Books]]|pages=328–329 |isbn=0-87930-607-6}}</ref> (who also managed [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]), led to the Dickies landing the record deal. The two albums that the band recorded for the label, [[The Incredible Shrinking Dickies]] (1979) and [[Dawn of the Dickies]] (1979) are influential, well regarded early punk records,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegram.com/entertainmentlife/20161120/dickies-remain-true-to-punk-roots|title=Dickies remain true to punk roots|author=Steve Knopper|website=Telegram.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/50-greatest-punk-albums-all-time#41-dickies-%E2%80%94-incredible-shrinking-dickies |title=50 Greatest Punk Albums of All Time &#124; Revolver |website=Revolvermag.com |date=2018-05-24 |access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> and were modestly successful commercially (the former peaked at #18 on the UK album charts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17335/dickies/|title=DICKIES &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref>).

The Dickies had a string of successful singles in the UK, twice making the top 40. They had a [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[single (music)|single]] with their speedy punk cover of the theme song to a children's show with "[[Banana Splits (Tra La La Song)]]" in 1979, and reached the top 40 again with their cover of "[[Nights in White Satin]]" (1979). Their punk rendition of "[[Silent Night]]" charted at #47 in December 1978, while their cover of "[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]" peaked at #45, in 1979. The band, which has claimed to have sold "a million singles" in England,<ref name="dothebay1"/> credits their popularity in that country to being perceived as a "teeny pop" punk band that appealed to the younger siblings of punk rockers.<ref name="latimes1989"/>

Their career off to a fast start, the Dickies would tour Europe 5 times between 1978 and 1980, pausing to play [[Top of the Pops]] on May 3, 1979.<ref name="chicagotribune1995"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0730454/|title=Episode dated 3 May 1979|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

===Post A&M (1980–1989)===
[[Guitarist]]/[[keyboardist]]/[[saxophonist]]/[[drummer]] [[Chuck Wagon (musician)|Chuck Wagon]] (born Bob Davis) released a solo recording, more [[synth pop]] than punk rock, entitled "Rock 'N' Roll Won't Go Away" (A&M, 1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chuck-Wagon-Rock-N-Roll-Wont-Go-Away/release/3534383 |title=Chuck Wagon - Rock 'N' Roll Won't Go Away (1979, Purple, Vinyl) |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://punkvinyl.com/2004/12/20/selections-from-the-punk-vault-chuck-wagon/|title=Selections from The Punk Vault [Chuck Wagon]|date=December 20, 2004|website=The Punk Vault}}</ref> Wagon, who was known for his energetic and entertaining antics at Dickies shows (such as running in a circle around his keyboard, or wearing an [[afro]] wig while playing saxophone),<ref name="auto2">{{cite book |last= Simmonds|first= Jeremy|date= 2012|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtpkCgAAQBAJ&q=the+dickies+chuck+wagon+death+afro+wig&pg=PA154 |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |pages= 154–155|isbn=978-1-61374-478-9}}</ref> has been said to have become troubled over time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dickies-mn0000123007/biography|title=The Dickies &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="auto"/> and dissatisfied with punk rock and the Dickies.

Wagon's death, and drug issues among surviving members, slowed down the Dickies initial momentum considerably starting the 1980s, with John Hewlett being fired as manager and the A&M contract expiring during this period.<ref name="auto1"/>  However, Phillips and Lee have kept the band playing and recording, at times sporadically, at other times more actively, until the present day, achieving venerable, "pop punk godfather" status along the way.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2008/08/05/the-dickies-california-punk-godfathers-348670/ |title=The Dickies: California punk godfathers |work=Metro.co.uk |date=2008-08-05}}</ref>

During lulls between activity, the band would occasionally play locally around L.A. to earn a paycheck. But steadier work would come, supported by concerts on both US coasts (and occasionally in between), the UK, and elsewhere. In addition to work on several motion pictures, the band would, over time, record albums for labels like [[PVC Records]] ([[Stukas Over Disneyland]]), ''Restless Brand Records'' ([[Killer Klowns from Outer Space (album)|Killer Klowns from Outer Space]]), [[Enigma Records]] ([[Second Coming (Dickies album)|Second Coming]]), [[Triple X Records]] ([[Idjit Savant]] and ''Dogs from the Hare that Bit Us'') and [[Fat Wreck Chords]] ([[All This and Puppet Stew]]).

After having had their first two albums released within a 9-month span, there was a nearly four-year gap before the release of ''Stukas Over Disneyland'' (1983). The influential punk [[zine]] [[Maximum Rocknroll]] published an enthusiastic review of this album, with writer Steve Spinali asserting that "The Dickies' first vinyl in almost four years ranks up there near their previous funnypunk triumphs. Most of the eight songs here veer toward amphetamine pop, with irresistible layered choruses to boot.... buoyant and entertaining as hell!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://punkygibbon.co.uk/bands/d/dickies_stukas.html |title=The Dickies - Stukas Over Disneyland |website=Punkygibbon.co.uk |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

On March 5, 1985, the Dickies were one of a number of California punk bands to play a very unexpected benefit show; other bands on the bill included the [[Circle Jerks]], [[the Vandals]], and [[D.I. (band)|D.I.]] The show's beneficiaries were the [[Cypress College]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Stan Lee and [[Keith Morris]] from the Jerks both stated that they were doing it out of fondness for the other bands on the bill, and because it was a paying gig (despite being a benefit). Both denied having political motivations for doing the show, and in fact wished for their respective bands to not be associated with politics. As to the show's organizers, one stated that there was a motivation to show their fellow college Republicans that punk was nothing to be afraid of, and to encourage them to have fun, since after all “(the college is in) Orange County, a predominantly conservative area, and a lot of punks come from conservative families.... (and) a lot of them think Orange County is good."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-03-08-ca-32582-story.html|title=PUNKERS TO PLAY FOR GOP GROUP|date=March 8, 1985|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

Live footage of the Dickies in concert was aired on [[MTV]] in 1985, as they were co-featured along with [[Charged G.B.H.|G.B.H.]] in a concert special entitled ''Punks and Poseurs: A Journey Through the Los Angeles Underground'', which also featured interviews with fans, as well as figures like [[Pleasant Gehman]] and Iris Berry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/vintage_mtv_punks_and_poseurs|title=Vintage MTV: 'Punks and Poseurs: A Journey Through the Los Angeles Underground'|date=August 21, 2014|website=DangerousMinds.net}}</ref>

In 1986, cassette-only label [[ROIR]] released a Dickies live compilation entitled ''We Aren't the World''. It contains performances from 7 different Dickies concerts, ranging in vintage from 1977 to 1985, and from  regions ranging from [[New York City|NY]] ([[C.B.G.B.]]) and [[New Jersey|NJ]], to [[California]], to the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://punkygibbon.co.uk/bands/d/dickies_wearent.html |title=The Dickies - We Aren't The World! |website=Punkygibbon.co.uk |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>

Among the bands that the Dickies shared bills with between 1985 and 1987 are [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Janes Addiction]], [[Faith No More]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Ramones]], [[X (American band)|X]], [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Thelonious Monster]], [[Dead Milkmen]], and [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/concerts/red-hot-chili-peppers-the-dickies|title=08/01/1987: Red Hot Chili Peppers / The Dickies @ Perkins Palace &#124; Concert Archives|website=Concertarchives.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1987-05-02/381/ |title=Tour Info: Jane's Addiction - May 02, 1987 - Main Exhibit Hall, North Campus, Cal State Northridge, Northridge, CA |website=Janesaddiction.org |date=1987-05-02 |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collectors.com/entertainment-item/the-dickies-goodies-fullerton-california-1987-punk-flyer-fa/-6449554808479453059 |title=The DICKIES Goodies FULLERTON California 1987 PUNK FLYE |website=Collectors.com |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedickies.com/html-gallery-flyers/NYC-1985.htm |title=The Dickies Official Website |website=Thedickies.com |date=1985-10-12 |access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/464574517795433351/?lp=true |title=RAMONES /DICKIES Original Concert Flyer 1987 LA BLONDIE Black Flag Elvis Ramone &#124; Concert flyer, Punk poster, Ramones |website=Pinterest.com |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hardcoreshowflyers.net/?p=14277 |title=Hardcore Show Flyers – Underdog-Murphy's Law-The Dickies @ New York City NY 10-31-87 |website=Hardcoreshowflyers.net |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1986-flyer-red-hot-chili-pepper-guns-293881752 |title=RARE 1986 FLYER RED HOT CHILI PEPPER GUNS N' ROSES @ UCLA!

In 1988, the Dickies wrote and performed the theme song for the cult classic <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-celebrates-30-years-with-a-carnival-of-freaky-amusements/ |title="Killer Klowns From Outer Space" Celebrates 30 Years With a Carnival of Freaky Amusements |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> horror film [[Killer Klowns from Outer Space]], which also became the title track for a [[Killer Klowns from Outer Space (album)|Dickies ep]] released that year. It was produced by Ron Hitchcock, and was the debut of drummer Cliff Martinez who had recently played with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[The Weirdos]], and [[Captain Beefheart]]. Martinez played with the Dickies from 1988 to 1994, and on albums such as Second Coming, Locked N' Loaded Live in London, and Idjit Savant.<ref name="latimes1989"/>

Also in 1988, The Dickies appeared in the comedic motion picture [[18 Again!]], starring [[George Burns]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094593/|title=18 Again!|website=IMDb.com}}</ref> In the movie, Burns' 81 year old character switches consciousnesses/souls with his 18-year-old grandson. In one scene, the octogenarian-turned-teenager accompanies a teenaged girl to a punk club, where the Dickies perform "You drive me ape (you big gorilla)". The whole song is performed, at times in the foreground, at times in the background. Closeups of Phillips wearing an ape mask (as is his penchant during live performances of the song), and [[Tarzan]]-like rope swinging by the singer, are featured.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Flaherty, Paul|date=1988 |title= 18 Again!|medium= motion picture|language=en |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094593/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 |access-date=1 March 2020 |format=motion picture |time=1:06:24 to 1:09:30 |publisher=New World Pictures }} [https://www.amazon.com/18-Again-George-Burns/dp/B007EHHUT6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=18+again&qid=1583078268&sr=8-1 Alt URL]</ref>

A gap of 5 years between studio albums number 3 and 4 having elapsed (notwithstanding the ''Killer Klowns'' EP), a writer at the [[Los Angeles Times]] was led to connect the title of their 1989 [[LP record|long player]], ''Second Coming'', to the band's "comeback status". The writer noted that this album had some [[Beatles]]-like melodicism and some "art-rock aspirations", while retaining the Dickies' characteristic punk "silliness". The writer also noted that the Dickies would be undertaking a national tour supporting the release.<ref name="latimes1989"/>

The close of the decade saw the third Dickies-involved motion picture. In the opening minutes of the 1989 skateboard drama ''[[Gleaming the Cube]]'', starring [[Christian Slater]], Slater's character Brian is seen flying in a small airplane over Disneyland, along with 4 friends and the pilot, when the 5 skaters sing a line from the chorus of "Stukas over Disneyland". The song, which the characters would later listen to in a bedroom, is also featured on the soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097438/|title=Gleaming the Cube|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

===During the pop punk revival (1990–1999)===
The Dickies toured Europe in 1990 for the first time in a decade. Upon their arrival on the continent, meeting fans provided evidence to band members of their enduring popularity despite their ten year absence.<ref name="chicagotribune1995">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-03-03-9503040208-story.html|title=WITTY AND IRREVERENT, THE DICKIES STILL LEAD THE PUNK PACK|author=Fred Shuster|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref> They have returned regularly since then, including participation in multi-band punk rock festivals.

In 1990, the Dickies wrote another theme song for a motion picture. This time it was for Lucas Reiner's time travel comedy film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|Spirit of 76]]'', which stars [[David Cassidy]], [[Leif Garrett]], [[Devo]], and [[Red Kross]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100670/soundtrack|title=The Spirit of '76 (1990) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100670/|title=The Spirit of '76|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

1991 saw the release of another live Dickies album, this one entitled ''Live In London - Locked 'N' Loaded'', put out by [[Germany|German]] label ''Rebel Rec.''

On June 4, 1993 the Dickies headlined a one day festival called the ''[[Milwaukee]] Mega Jam''. Other acts on the bill included Green Day (a half year before the release of their breakthrough [[Dookie]] album), [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]], and [[the Didjits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nostalgiacentral.com/music/artists-a-to-k/artists-d/dickies/ |title=Dickies, The |publisher=Nostalgia Central |date=2009-09-22 |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greendayauthority.com/tour/show/844/ |title=Green Day in Milwaukee, USA - Jun 04, 1993 - Tour Dates |website=Greendayauthority.com |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> Also in 1993, the band released a 3 song EP entitled ''Road Kill'' on Triple X Records.<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/album/road-kill-mw0000623015</ref>

In addition to whatever personal issues the Dickies had to cope with in the middle part of their career, there was also the commercial challenge of the decline of the original punk scene, replaced by [[post punk]], [[college rock]], underground [[hardcore punk]], and, eventually, [[alternative rock]], none of which provided the Dickies with a suitable milieu. Therefore, the profile of the band was uplifted with the rise of California pop punk in the 1990s, with successful bands like [[the Offspring]] and [[Green Day]] citing the Dickies as an influence. Leonard Phillips noted in a 1994 interview that "We are being recognized in a mainstream way again."<ref name="mcall1994">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1994-10-21-3010132-story.html|title=DICKIES MORE THAN FATHER FIGURES FOR NEW WAVE OF PUNK BANDS|author=FRANK PEARN JR|website=Mcall.com}}</ref>

One outgrowth of the revived attention given the Dickies, and attempts by interviewers to connect them to the current scene, was a minor feud with [[Green Day]]. This resulted from a misunderstood joke from the Dickies camp, often repeated (it was a stock answer to a frequent question), saying the multi-platinum selling Green Day should support their forbears by "passing the hat" at a stadium gig to fund a punk rock retirement home. One shortened version of this idea had Stan Lee saying "they should just write us a check", which was interpreted as Green Day ripping the Dickies off. This led to salty quotes from the former band directed at the Dickies in an issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'', which Leonard Phillips describes as being "[[World Wrestling Federation|WWF]]" style: the Dickies are "the most bitter old bastards", who are "just another Ramones rip-off".<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Di Perna |url=http://punkrocker.org.uk/punkinterviews/greenday.html |title=Green Day August 1996 |work=Punkrocker.org.uk |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> Apparently it blew over, as Green Day bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] would attend Dickies shows after this, and was friendly in his interactions with them.<ref name="pennyblackmusic1"/>

By the time of ''Idjit Savant'' (1994), the Dickies had released their third consecutive album which followed a prolonged recording hiatus, at least with respect to studio [[LP records|LPs]]. About this state of affairs, Leonard Phillips told the [[Chicago Tribune]] "every few years, it's me and Stan against the world with three new faces behind us."<ref name="chicagotribune1995"/> Axl Rosenberg of [[MetalSucks]] wrote of ''Idjit Savant'' that it is "one of the best pop-punk albums of all time", superior to [[American Idiot]]. He also noted that it was recorded during a time of dour [[grunge]] and angry [[nu metal]] music, and called the Dickies album possibly "the feel good album of the 90’s".<ref>{{cite web|author=Axl Rosenberg|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2007/05/02/the-album-of-the-day-is-the-dickies-idjit-savant/ |title=The Album Of The Day Is...

A reviewer for a November 1998 Dickies concert in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]] suggested that most attendees were old school punks wearing "vintage leather jackets" and "buttons that could be artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame". The writer quotes Leonard Phillips as sarcastically indicating his willingness to court a younger crowd by rebranding the Dickies as an [[alternative rock|"alternative"]] punk rock band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1998-11-16-9811160159-story.html|title=DECADES LATER, DICKIES UP TO SAME OLD TRICKS|author=Roger Catlin|website=Courant.com}}</ref>

The Dickies closed out the decade by recording an all-covers album, ''Dogs From the Hare That Bit Us''. [[Jack Rabid]], noting that the Dickies had a long history of recording covers, some of which are "terrific", gave this release a very favorable review, writing that although the latest batch were more reverent and less humorous than some previous efforts, it was "still frickin' great and a lot of fun."<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|author=Jack Rabid |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dogs-from-the-hare-that-bit-us-mw0000046394 |title=Dogs from the Hare That Bit Us - The Dickies &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1998-07-03 |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>

=== Turn of the century (2000–2009) ===
Stan Lee negotiated the band's ''Fat Wreck Chords'' deal by fibbing to label owner [[Fat Mike]], a Dickies fan who had, in 1996, obtained a 4 song demo the Dickies had recorded. Neither Lee nor Leonard Phillips had heard of the label head/[[NOFX]] front man, but were filled in by a member of the Dickies camp. Lee claimed that he had "an album's worth of material" ready to record, when in fact the band actually only had the 4 songs. Following this claim, a deal was agreed upon, but the L.P. was delayed by the amount of time it took to come up with and record an appropriate amount of material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fatwreck.com/pages/the-dickies-press-information|title=The Dickies Press Information|website=Fat Wreck Chords}}</ref> The resulting record found a prominent fan in [[Milo Aukerman]]. The scientist/[[Descendents]] front man has stated that ''All This and Puppet Stew'' (2001) gave him encouragement to continue playing into advancing middle age. "I was just extremely impressed with how they put out a great record [at that age]. It definitely set the kernel in my mind that you could be in your late 40s and still put out a record that full-on brought the punk rock from start to finish."<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|author=Matthew Schnipper |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/9924-punk-veteran-milo-aukerman-of-the-descendents-on-the-music-of-his-life/ |title=Punk Veteran Milo Aukerman of the Descendents on the Music of His Life |website=Pitchfork.com |date=2016-07-26 |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

The film features footage from the 2004 concert, which was held in particular to honor the then seriously-ill Ramones guitarist.

The Dickies played the 2007 [[Warped Tour]], a North American punk rock festival, for the first time in what would be [[List of Warped Tour lineups by year|four consecutive years]], and five years total.

The decade closed on two sour notes, as a pair of former Dickies passed away in the year 2009.

The new decade found the Dickies on the road. Reviewing an August 2011 headlining concert in [[Bristol]], England, a writer remarked on their enduring appeal in that country.

==Musical style and themes==
Some artists eschew the term "[[pop punk]]", perhaps viewing it as implying less authenticity than the label "[[punk rock]]" (for example, Green Day's [[Billie Joe Armstrong]]: "I’ve always hated the phrase. I think it’s a contradiction in terms. Either you’re punk, or you’re not”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-pop-punk-albums-122677/|title=The 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums|first1=Christopher R.

Leonard Phillips, however, has said he "has no problem" with the label being applied to the Dickies, rhetorically asking "can I help it if we are musical?"<ref name="rockbandsofla1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockbandsofla.com/l-a-punk-band-the-dickies-at-40-years/ |title=L.A.

During the band's formative period, they viewed the already existing punk bands as being divided into two camps: serious political bands (such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]]), and fun, entertaining bands (like [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and [[the Ramones]]). The Dickies made a deliberate choice to belong to the latter camp, albeit with a distinctive southern California vibe.<ref name="latimes1989"/> Elaborating on their distinction from the angrier, angstier bands, some of whom had gritty upbringings, Stan Lee points out that at the ''Dawn of the Dickies''' career, he was living with his parents in the valley with a swimming pool, preoccupied with waterslides and tv shows, finding not much to complain about.<ref name="westword1"/> [[the Quick (US band)|Steven Hufsteter]], an influential figure in the Dickies' formation and a sometimes "extra member" of the band,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/power-pop-icons-the-quick-finally-find-heaven-after-decades-in-rock-roll-purgatory/|title=Power-Pop Icons The Quick Finally Find Heaven After Decades in Rock & Roll Purgatory|first=Falling|last=James|date=June 14, 2018|website=[[LA Weekly]]}}</ref> opines that "the Dickies never really thought of themselves as punks" at the outset, but instead saw the form "as an opportunity", particularly the "silly" variant of punk evident in [[Ramones]] music.<ref name="amazon108"/>

Many of the Dickies [[lyrics]] concern [[Southern California]] culture, rife with references and in-jokes; examples include songs like "Waterslide", "I'm A [[Cholo|Chollo]]", "[[Pep Boys|Manny, Moe, and Jack]]", [[Stukas Over Disneyland]], and "(I'm Stuck in a Pagoda with) [[Tritia Toyota|Tricia Toyota]]".  Another theme is classic cartoons/children's TV, with songs like "Banana Splits (tra la la song)", "[[Gigantor]]", "Eep Opp Ork (Uh Uh)" (from [[the Jetsons]]), "Bowling with [[the Flintstones|Bedrock]] Barney", and most recently, another Flintstones reference with "The Dreaded Pigasaurus". Leonard Phillips has said that these choices add up to a social commentary. He saw some of his peers in [[Los Angeles|LA]] punk coming from privileged backgrounds, but projecting [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[working class]]-style angst. "We wanted to show all those bourgeois ‘punks’ what it really MEANT to come from the valley."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mortado.com/gravemusic/news/interviews/dickies.shtml|title=Interview with The Dickies|website=Mortado.com}}</ref>

The Dickies are also known for [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] many fast-paced punk [[cover version|covers]] of [[classic rock]] songs, including [[The Moody Blues]]' "[[Nights in White Satin]]," [[The Quick (U.S. band)|The Quick]]'s "Pretty Please Me", [[Black Sabbath]]'s "[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]," [[The Monkees|The Monkees']] "[[More of The Monkees|She]]," [[Barry McGuire]]'s "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]," [[The Isley Brothers]]' "[[Nobody but Me (The Isley Brothers song)|Nobody but Me]]," [[The Left Banke]]'s "[[Pretty Ballerina]]," [[The Cowsills]]' [[Hair (Hair song)|"Hair"]], "[[Sound of Silence]]" by [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Communication Breakdown]]", [[The Germs]]/[[Pat Smear]]'s "golden boys", as well as the cover album ''Dogs from the Hare That Bit Us''. When asked about this penchant of the band, Stan Lee responded "It was easier as you didn't have to write the songs."<ref name="pennyblackmusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/3780/Dickies-Interview |title=Dickies - Interview |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> Regarding the band's choice of material, Lee has said that they cover "mostly songs we liked when we were 13."<ref name="rvamag1"/> Describing the tone of some of the early covers of 1960's music, Lee characterizes it as "affectionate piss-takes of hippies and the old culture."<ref>{{cite book |last= Spitz|first= Marc|author-link= Marc Spitz|date= 2001|title= We Got the Neutron Bomb |location= New York|publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= 120 |isbn= 0-609-80774-9}}</ref>
 
Leonard Phillips has said that he feels the Dickies many covers are different in character from those by latter-day punk cover band [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]] (who have paid homage to the Dickies by playing a snippet of "You Drive Me Ape" in their cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[All My Loving]]"). Phillips feels that band employs a formula, whereas the Dickies reinterpret songs that are meaningful to them.<ref name="rockbandsofla1"/>

Something else that the Dickies are known for is Phillips' routines when playing live, including wearing an ape mask or scuba gear, and using props ranging from a dog puppet, to a talking penis puppet ("Stewart"), to an inflatable female "[[love doll]]", each for use during particular songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santa |first=Goldstar |url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-dickies-di-tickets-91422861239 |title=The Dickies & D.I.

In the book ''Punk Rock: So What? The Cultural Legacy of Punk'', edited by Roger Sabin, a writer states that the Dickies follow in a tonal/thematic tradition started by immediate predecessors [[the Dictators]] and [[the Ramones]], but it is "in the Dickies (that) punk's simultaneous parody and celebration of commercial teen culture reached its apex". The author believes that 90's punk like [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] are indebted to the older punk trio for this reason.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sabin |first=Roger |date= 1999|title= Punk Rock: So What?

==Influence==
In a feature about the [[Bad Brains]] in ''Timeline'', it was written that the Dickies and the [[Dead Boys]] were among the Brains' punk influences, which they combined with [[jazz]] and [[funk]] influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timeline.com/bad-brains-shattered-stereotypes-about-punk-rock-and-black-music-3659aafcc9cc |title=It's been nearly 40 years since Bad Brains shattered stereotypes about punk rock — and black music |publisher=Timeline.com |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> [[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm's]] biography of the Bad Brains also lists the Dickies, along with Dead Boys, [[Black Sabbath]], and the [[Sex Pistols]] as being among the band's influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/biography.php?band_id=2527&bandname=Bad+Brains |title=Bad Brains - Biography |publisher=Metal Storm |date=2007-05-07 |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> [[Jack Rabid]], writing for [[AllMusic]] wrote, perhaps hyperbolically, that the Dickies' cover of "paranoid" by Sabbath "basically inspired the Bad Brains to form!"<ref name="allmusic1"/>

[[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Bad Religion]] and [[Epitaph Records]] has stated that members of his band "grew up with" the Dickies, and considers the band "one of the greatest punk bands", as good as the [[Buzzcocks]]. He praises the Dickies songs more than their humor.<ref name="chicagotribune1995"/>

[[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]] have cited Dickies influence.<ref name="mcall1994"/> While the former band would later give mixed messages about their feelings about the Dickies, Noodles, guitarist for the Offspring, said that the Dickies are "one of my favorites", in a [[Rolling Stone]] interview.<ref name="chicagotribune1995"/>

[[Ben Weasel]] of [[Screeching Weasel]] included the Dickies in a short list of punk bands that "were sort of pioneers, both musically and in what they did to lay the groundwork for bands like mine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adita.org/redlinedistribution/interviews/benweasel.shtml |title=Red Line Distribution - Ben Weasel |website=Adita.org |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

[[the Queers|Joe "Queer" King]] has stated that his band is in a tradition of punk bands, like the Dickies, [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Circle Jerks]], [[Angry Samoans]], and [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], that "were funny, but... had a message", and feels that this spirit is lost on modern, politically sensitive audiences, who are "just looking for a reason to say they’re offended".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/joe-queer-of-the-queers-on-milo-yiannopoulos-darren-wilson-and-nazis-9199191|title=The Queers' Joe Queer Once Fought Nazis.

The [[Groovie Ghoulies]], themselves named after the cartoon ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'', were influenced by the "cartoon-punk" aspect of the Dickies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/ghoul-talk-6402347 |title=Ghoul Talk |publisher=Phoenix New Times |date=2006-11-02 |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

In a profile of [[Bob Mould]] in [[Pop Matters]], it was said that in writing/performing for [[Husker Du]], he was driven by "being faster" than the Dickies, Ramones, and Buzzcocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/145439-see-a-little-light-by-bob-mould-2495979599.html|title=Bob Mould Casts a Spotlight on Himself in 'See a Little Light'|date=August 10, 2011|website=PopMatters.com}}</ref>

[[Ian MacKaye]] recounted an anecdote to a reporter from [[Salon (website)|Salon]] about listening to a [[mix tape]] an acquaintance made, while in a car traveling to a [[Ramones]] concert, in 1979. He recalled "it had that Dickies 'Banana Splits' song on it and it just blew my mind!

[[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]], and [[Fat Wreck Chords]], and [[Milo Aukerman]] of [[Descendents]], both cite the Dickies as an influence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Niesel |first=Jeff |url=https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/melody-makers-after-30-years-nofx-is-still-going-strong/Content?oid=3717053 |title=Melody Makers: After 30 Years, NOFX is Still Going Strong &#124; Music Lead &#124; Cleveland &#124; Cleveland Scene |publisher=Clevescene.com |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref name="pitchfork1"/>
