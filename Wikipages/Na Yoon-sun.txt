'''Na Yoon-sun''' ({{lang-ko|나윤선}}; born August 28, 1969), also known as '''Youn Sun Nah,''' is a South Korean [[jazz]] musician.<ref name=Daum-bio/>

== Life and career ==
Na Yoon-sun was born on August 28, 1969, in Seoul. Her parents are musical: her father, Na Young-soo (나영수), is a conductor in Korea and her mother, Kim Mi-jung (김미정), is a musical actress. She studied French literature at [[Konkuk University]] in Korea. While she was working for a fashion company, she was scouted by Kim Min-gi (김민기), who was the president of the Hakchon Theater Company (극단 학전). There, she made her acting debut in a musical called ''[[Linie 1|Subway Line 1]]'' (지하철 1호선).

Having been exposed to many kinds of music by her parents, Na decided to study and sing jazz after her performance in ''Subway Line 1.'' In 1995, she went to Paris to study jazz and [[chanson]]. There, she studied jazz at the CIM Jazz School, the National Music Institute of Beauvais, Nadia and the Lili Boulanger Conservatory. After graduating, she taught students at the CIM Jazz School from 2000 to 2001. She formed her own quintet, YSN 5tet, and performed at various jazz clubs, theaters, festivals, and bars in France. Also in 2001 she released her debut album, ''Reflet''. Her mostly self-composed 2002 album, ''Light for the people'', was her first album to receive a wide distribution. She recorded the follow-up, ''Down by love'', with guitarist [[Olivier Ode]]. With her 2004 release ''So I am'' she became more known in Europe.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2007, she made a pop record, ''Memory Lane''. In 2008, she signed a contract with German label [[ACT (record label)|ACT]], and in 2009 was acknowledged for her musical contributions in France by receiving [[Chevaliers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} She released ''[[Same Girl (Na Yoon-sun album)|Same Girl]]'' in 2010. In 2011, she gave about 180 performances in more than 13 countries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 2011, this rose to about 200 performances in more than twenty-five countries in 2012.<ref name=Naver-people/><ref>https://blog.naver.com/news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=106&oid=262&aid=0000006488</ref><ref>http://neoissue5/110102311002</ref> In 2013 she released ''Lento''.

== Vocal style ==
She was not influenced by any historical jazz musicians, because she did not have any knowledge of jazz music until her late start as a singer.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Even though she began studying jazz history in Paris, it was after she had already created her own vocal style. Rather, she sang various genres of music from classical music to rock music by herself before she studied jazz in Paris.
