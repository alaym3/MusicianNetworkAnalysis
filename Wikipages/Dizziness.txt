* [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]] is the sensation of spinning or having one's surroundings spin about them. Many people find vertigo very disturbing and often report associated nausea and vomiting.<ref name=Epi09/>
* [[Presyncope]] describes [[lightheadedness]] or feeling faint; the name relates to [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], which is actually fainting.
* [[equilibrioception#Dysfunction|Disequilibrium]] is the sensation of being off balance and is most often characterized by frequent falls in a specific direction.  This condition is not often associated with nausea or vomiting.
* Non-specific dizziness may be psychiatric in origin.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion and can sometimes be brought about by [[hyperventilation]].<ref name=UTD/>

==Mechanism and causes==
Many conditions cause dizziness because multiple parts of the body are required for maintaining balance including the [[inner ear]], [[human eye|eyes]], [[muscle]]s, [[human skeleton|skeleton]], and the [[nervous system]].<ref name=merck>{{cite web |title=Dizziness and Vertigo |year=2009 |publisher=Merck Manual |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch084/ch084e.html?qt=dizziness&alt=sh}}</ref> Thus dizziness can be caused by a variety of problems and may reflect a focal process (such as one affecting balance or [[motor coordination|coordination]]) or a diffuse one (such as a toxic exposure or low [[perfusion]] state).<ref name=healthroid>{{cite web |title=What Causes Dizziness?

Common causes of dizziness include:
* Inadequate blood supply to the [[brain]] due to:

** [[Cardiovascular disease|Heart problems]] or [[arterial embolism|artery blockages]]<ref name=merck /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=10 Surprising Facts About Dizziness and Vertigo|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/10-surprising-facts-about-dizziness-vertigo/|access-date=2021-11-14|website=EverydayHealth.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Dizziness may occur from an abnormality involving the brain (in particular the brainstem or cerebellum), inner ear, eyes, heart, vascular system, fluid or blood volume, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or body electrolytes. Dizziness can accompany certain serious events, such as a concussion or brain bleed, epilepsy and seizures (convulsions), strokes, and cases of meningitis and encephalitis. However, the most common subcategories can be broken down as follows: 40% peripheral vestibular dysfunction, 10% central nervous system lesion, 15% psychiatric disorder, 25% presyncope/disequilibrium, and 10% nonspecific dizziness.<ref name=chan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan Y | title = Differential diagnosis of dizziness | journal = Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–3 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19365263 | doi = 10.1097/MOO.0b013e32832b2594 | s2cid = 9923013 }}</ref> Some vestibular pathologies have symptoms that are comorbid with mental disorders.<ref>Lawson, B. D., Rupert, A. H., & Kelley, A. M. (2013). Mental Disorders Comorbid with Vestibular Pathology. Psychiatric Annals, 43(7), 324.</ref>

While traditional medical teaching has focused on determining the cause of dizziness based on the category (e.g. vertigo vs presyncope), recent research suggests that this analysis is of limited clinical utility.<ref name="AFP">{{cite journal | vauthors = Muncie HL, Sirmans SM, James E | title = Dizziness: Approach to Evaluation and Management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–162 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28145669 | url = https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0201/p154.html }}</ref><ref name="Misdiagnosing">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerber KA, Newman-Toker DE | title = Misdiagnosing Dizzy Patients: Common Pitfalls in Clinical Practice | journal = Neurologic Clinics | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 565–75, viii | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26231272 | doi = 10.1016/j.ncl.2015.04.009 }}</ref>

==Disequilibrium==
{{About|the loss of sense of balance||Disequilibrium (disambiguation){{!}}Disequilibrium|section=TRUE}}
In medicine, '''disequilibrium''' refers to impaired [[equilibrioception]] that can be characterised as a sensation of impending fall or of the need to obtain external assistance for proper locomotion. It is sometimes described as a feeling of improper tilt of the floor, or as a sense of floating. This sensation can originate in the inner ear or other motion sensors, or in the central nervous system. Neurologic disorders tend to cause constant vertigo or disequilibrium and usually have other symptoms of neurologic dysfunction associated with the vertigo. Many medications used to treat seizures, depression, anxiety, and pain affect the vestibular system and the central nervous system which can cause the symptom of disequilibrium.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Konrad HR | chapter = Chapter 123: Vertigo and Associated Symptoms | chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK228/ | veditors = Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JA |title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations. | edition = 3rd | location = Boston | publisher = Butterworths | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-409-90077-X }}</ref>
