'''Waylon Arnold Jennings'''  (born '''Wayland Arnold Jennings'''; June 15, 1937&nbsp;– February 13, 2002) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He is best known as one of the founding pioneers of the [[Outlaw Country|Outlaw Movement]] in [[country music]].

Jennings started to play guitar at age of eight and first performed at age 12 on [[KVOW]] radio, after which he formed his first band, The Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age 16, determined to become a musician and worked as a performer and DJ on KVOW, [[KDAV]], [[KYTI]], [[KBZO (AM)|KLLL]], in [[Coolidge, Arizona]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. In 1958, [[Buddy Holly]] arranged Jennings's first recording session, and hired him to play [[Bass guitar|bass]]. Jennings gave up his seat on the [[The Day the Music Died|ill-fated flight]] in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, [[The Big Bopper|J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson]] and [[Ritchie Valens]].

Jennings then formed a [[rockabilly]] club band, [[The Waylors]], which became the house band at "JD's", a club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and [[A&M Records]], but did not achieve success until moving to [[RCA Victor]], taking on Neil Reshen as a manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts for him. After he gained creative control from [[RCA Records]], he released the critically acclaimed albums ''[[Lonesome, On'ry and Mean]]'' and ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', followed by the hit albums ''[[Dreaming My Dreams (Waylon Jennings album)|Dreaming My Dreams]]'' and ''[[Are You Ready for the Country]]''. During the 1970s, Jennings became one of the main figures of [[outlaw country]]. With [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tompall Glaser]] and [[Jessi Colter]] he recorded country music's first platinum album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. It was followed by ''[[Ol' Waylon]]'' and the hit song "[[Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)|Luckenbach, Texas]]".

Jennings was featured in the 1978 album ''[[White Mansions]]'', performed by various artists documenting the lives of people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Jennings also appeared in films and television series, including [[Sesame Street]], and a stint as the [[wikt:balladeer|balladeer]] for ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', composing and singing [[Theme from The Dukes of Hazzard (Good Ol' Boys)|the show's theme song]] and providing narration for the show. By the early 1980s, Jennings struggled with a [[cocaine]] addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and [[Johnny Cash]], which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album ''[[Will the Wolf Survive]]''.

He toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. In 2001, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In 2007, he was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the [[Academy of Country Music]].

== Early life ==
Waylon Arnold Jennings was born on June 15, 1937, on the J.W. Bittner farm, near [[Littlefield, Texas]]. He was the son of Lorene Beatrice (née Shipley, 1920&ndash;2006) and William Albert Jennings (1915&ndash;1968).{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=4}} The Jennings family line descended from [[Black-Dutch]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=10}} The Shipley line descended from [[Cherokee]] and [[Comanche]] families.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=9-11}}

The name on Jennings's birth certificate was Wayland. It was changed after a Baptist preacher visited his parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the [[Wayland Baptist University]] in [[Plainview, Texas]]. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, "I didn't like Waylon. It sounded corny and hillbilly, but it's been good to me, and I'm pretty well at peace with it right now."{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=6}} After working as a laborer on the Bittner farm, Jennings's father moved the family to Littlefield and established a [[Creamery|retail creamery]].{{sfn|Jasinski|p=432|2012}}

== Music career ==

=== Beginnings in music ===
When Jennings was eight, his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune "Thirty Pieces of Silver". Jennings used to practice with his relatives' instruments until his mother bought him a used [[Stella (guitar)|Stella]] guitar, and later ordered a [[Harmony Company models#Patrician|Harmony Patrician]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=22}} Early influences included [[Bob Wills]], [[Floyd Tillman]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/waylon-jennings-dead-at-sixty-four-20020214|title=Waylon Jennings Dead at Sixty-four|author=Dansby, Andrew|date=February 14, 2002|access-date=November 1, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media LLC}}</ref>{{sfn|Wishart|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&lpg=PA540&dq=waylon%20jennings%20drop%20out%20high%20school&pg=PA540#v=onepage&q&f=false 540]}}{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=271}}{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=34}}

Beginning with performing at family gatherings, Jennings played his first public concert at the Youth Center with Anthony Bonanno, followed by appearances at the local [[United States Junior Chamber|Jaycees]] and [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Clubs]]. He won a talent show at [[KLBK-TV|Channel 13]], in Lubbock, singing "[[Hey Joe (Carl Smith song)|Hey Joe]]". He later made frequent performances at the Palace Theater in Littlefield, during local talent night.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=36}}

At the age of fourteen, Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield, Texas. Owner J.B. McShan, along with Emil Macha, recorded Jennings's performance. McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30-minute program. Following his performance on the show, Jennings formed his own band. He asked Macha to play bass for him and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form The Texas Longhorns. The style of the band—a mixture of [[Country and Western]] and [[Bluegrass music]]—was often not well received.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=154}}

After several disciplinary infractions 16 year-old tenth-grader Jennings was convinced to drop out of Littlefield High School by the superintendent.{{sfn|Burton, Alan|2002|p=79}} Upon leaving school, he worked for his father in the family store, while he also took temporary jobs. Jennings felt that music would turn into his career.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=31–33}} The next year along with The Texas Longhorns he recorded a demo of the songs "Stranger in My Home" and "There'll Be a New Day" at [[KFYO (AM)|KFYO]] radio in Lubbock.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=154}} Meanwhile, he drove a truck for the Thomas Land Lumber Company, and a [[cement truck]] for the Roberts Lumber Company. Tired of the owner, Jennings quit after a minor driving accident.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=39}} Jennings, and other local musicians, often performed at country radio station [[KBZO (AM)|KDAV]].  During this time he met [[Buddy Holly]] at a Lubbock restaurant.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=48}} The two often met during local shows, and Jennings began to attend Holly's performances on KDAV's ''Sunday Party''.{{sfn|Amburn|p=15|2014}}

[[File:Waylon Jennings KLLL.jpg|thumb|200px|Jennings during a broadcast of his show on KLLL in 1958]]
In addition to performing on air for KVOW, Jennings started to work as a DJ in 1956{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}} and moved to Lubbock.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}} His program ran from 4:00 in the afternoon to 10:00 in the evening, filled with two hours of country classics, two of current country and two of mixed recordings.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=40}} The latter included early rock-and-roll stars such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. The owner reprimanded Jennings for his selection, and after playing two Richard records in a row Jennings was fired.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=47}}

During his time at KVOW Jennings was visited by DJ Sky Corbin of [[KLVT]] in Levelland. Corbin was impressed with his voice, and decided to visit Jennings at the station after hearing him sing a jingle to the tune of Hank Snow's "[[I'm Moving On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Moving On]]". Jennings expressed his struggle to live on a US$50-a-week salary. Corbin invited Jennings to visit KLVT, where he eventually took Corbin's position when it opened.<ref>{{cite news|author=Corbin, Sky|url=http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-One-/18144181?pid=393697|title=The Waylon Jennings Years at KLLL (Part One)|work=KLLL|publisher=KLLL Lubbock|access-date=July 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171821/http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-One-/18144181?pid=393697|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The Corbin family later purchased [[KLLL]], in Lubbock. They changed the format of the station to country, becoming the main competition of KDAV. The Corbins hired Jennings as the station's first DJ.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=51}}

{{listen|filename=Jole Blon Waylon Jennings.ogg|title=Jole Blon|description=During his first recording session in September 1958, Jennings was accompanied by Buddy Holly on the guitar and King Curtis on the saxophone}}
Jennings produced commercials and created jingles with the rest of the DJs. As their popularity increased, the DJs made public appearances. Jennings's events included live performances. During one performance, Holly's father, L.O. Holley, approached them with his son's latest record and asked them to play it at the station. L.O. mentioned his son's intention to start producing artists himself, and Corbin recommended Jennings. After returning from his tour of England Buddy Holly visited KLLL.<ref>{{cite news|author=Corbin, Sky|url=http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-Two-The-int/18144181?pid=393913|title=The Waylon Jennings Years at KLLL (Part Two)|work=KLLL|publisher=KLLL Lubbock|access-date=July 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714165213/http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-Two-The-int/18144181?pid=393913|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

Holly took Jennings as his first artist. He outfitted him with new clothes, and worked with him to improve his image.<ref>{{cite news|author=Corbin, Sky|url=http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-Four-/18144181?pid=394643|title=The Waylon Jennings Years at KLLL (Part Four)|work=KLLL|publisher=KLLL Lubbock|access-date=July 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175405/http://www.klll.com/The-Waylon-Jennings-Years-at-KLLL-Part-Four-/18144181?pid=394643|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> He arranged a session for Jennings at [[Norman Petty]]'s recording studios in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. On September 10, Jennings recorded the songs "[[Jole Blon]]" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)" with Holly and [[Tommy Allsup]] on guitars and saxophonist [[King Curtis]]. Holly then hired Jennings to play bass for him during his "Winter Dance Party Tour".{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}}

=== Winter Dance Party Tour ===
Before the tour, Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958. Jennings and Sky Corbin performed the hand claps to Holly's tune "You're the One".{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} Jennings and Holly soon left for New York City,<ref>{{cite news|author=Corbin, Sky |url=http://www.klll.com/pages/18144181.php?pid=395032 |title=The Waylon Jennings Years at KLLL (Part Five) |work=KLLL |publisher=KLLL Lubbock |access-date=July 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155659/http://www.klll.com/pages/18144181.php?pid=395032 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref> arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly's apartment by [[Washington Square Park]] prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the [[General Amusement Corporation|General Artists Corporation]], that organized the tour.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp = 58–59}} They later took a train to Chicago to join the band.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 62}}

The [[Winter Dance Party]] tour began in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, leading to drummer Carl Bunch being hospitalized for frostbite on his toes.  Holly made the decision to find another means of transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&lpg=PA15&dq=%22I%20hope%20your%20ol'%20bus%20freezes%20up%22&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false 13]}}

Before their performance at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], for himself, Jennings, and Tommy Allsup, to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Following the Clear Lake show (which ended around midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to [[Ritchie Valens]], while Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, known as [[The Big Bopper]], who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size.{{sfn|Denberg, Jody|1988|p=103}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/entertainment/buddy-holly-plane-crash-reexamined/index.html|title=Buddy Holly plane crash may be re-examined|date=March 4, 2015|last1=Hetter|first1=Katia|last2=Marsh|first2=Rene|website=cnn.com}}</ref>

When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly, a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued, and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow: Holly jokingly told Jennings, "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up!" Jennings jokingly replied, "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes!"{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&lpg=PA15&dq=%22I%20hope%20your%20ol'%20bus%20freezes%20up%22&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q=%22I%20hope%20your%20ol'%20bus%20freezes%20up%22&f=false 15]}} Less than an hour and a half later, shortly after 1:00&nbsp;am on February 3, 1959, [[The Day the Music Died|Holly's charter plane crashed]] at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City, instantly killing all on board.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&lpg=PA18&dq=%22I%20hope%20your%20ol'%20bus%20freezes%20up%22&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false 18], 19}}

Later that morning, Jennings's family heard on the radio that "Buddy Holly and his band had been killed." After calling his family, Jennings called Sky Corbin at KLLL from Fargo to say that he hadn't been aboard the plane.<ref>{{cite news|author=Corbin, Sky|url=http://www.klll.com/pages/18144181.php?pid=395376|title=The Waylon Jennings Years at KLLL (Part Six)|work=KLLL|publisher=KLLL Lubbock|access-date=July 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150323/http://www.klll.com/pages/18144181.php?pid=395376|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The General Artists Corporation promised to pay for first-class tickets for Jennings and the band to attend Holly's funeral in Lubbock in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 71}} After the first show, they were initially denied their payment by the venue, but after Jennings's persistence, they were paid.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 72}} The flights were never paid,{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 73}} and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks, featuring Jennings as the lead singer.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}} They were paid less than half of the original agreed salary, and upon returning to New York, Jennings put Holly's guitar and amplifier in a locker in [[Grand Central Terminal]] and mailed the keys to [[Maria Elena Holly]]. Then he returned to Lubbock.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 74}}

In the early 1960s, Jennings wrote and recorded "The Stage (Stars in Heaven)", a tribute to Valens, the Big Bopper and Holly, as well as [[Eddie Cochran]], a young musician who died in a road accident a year after the plane crash.

For decades afterward, Jennings repeatedly admitted that he felt responsible for the crash that killed Holly. This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of Jennings's career.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 70}}

"Jole Blon" was released on Brunswick in March 1959 with limited success.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> Now unemployed, Jennings returned to KLLL. Deeply affected by the death of Holly, Jennings's performance at the station worsened. He left the station after he was denied a raise, and later worked briefly for the competition, KDAV.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp = 77–81}}

=== Phoenix ===
Due to his father-in-law's illness, Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas. While his family lived back in Littlefield, Jennings found a job briefly at [[KODM|KOYL]] in [[Odessa, Texas]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=81}} He moved with his family to [[Coolidge, Arizona]], where his wife Maxine's sister lived. He found a job performing at the Galloping Goose bar, where he was heard by Earl Perrin, who offered him a spot on [[KCKY]]. Jennings also played during the intermission at [[drive-in theater]]s and in bars.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=82–86}} After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], he was approached by two contractors (Paul Pristo and Dean Coffman) who were building a club in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] for James (Jimmy) D. Musil, called JD's. Musil engaged Jennings as his main artist<ref name=pnt>, with Jennings noted to be at the construction site.

Jennings formed his backing band, [[The Waylors]], with bassist Paul Foster, guitarist Jerry Gropp, and drummer Richie Albright.{{sfn|Smith|p=15|1995}} The band soon earned a strong local fan base at JD's,{{sfn|Erlewine|Bogdanov|Woodstra|2003|p=375}} where Jennings developed his rock-influenced style of country music that defined him on his later career.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p= 159}}

[[File:Waylon Jennings Promotional Picture cropped.JPG|RCA Victor publicity portrait of Jennings (1965)|thumb|upright]]
In 1961, Jennings signed a recording contract with [[Trend Records]],{{sfn|Erlewine|Bogdanov|Woodstra|2003|p=375}} and experienced moderate success with his single, "Another Blue Day".{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT167#v=onepage&q&f=false 156]}} His friend [[Don Bowman (singer)|Don Bowman]] took demos of Jennings to [[Jerry Moss]], who at the time was starting [[A&M Records]] with associate [[Herb Alpert]]. In July 1963 Jennings signed a contract with A&M that granted him 5% of record sales. At A&M, he recorded "Love Denied" backed with "[[Rave On!|Rave On]]", and [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Four Strong Winds]]" backed with "[[Just to Satisfy You (song)|Just to Satisfy You]]". He followed up by recording demos of "[[The Twelfth of Never]]", "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]", and "[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]", and also produced the single "Sing the Girls a Song, Bill", backed with "[[The Race Is On]]". The singles were released between April and October 1964.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=94–96}}

Jennings's records found little success at A&M, because the label was releasing mostly [[folk music]] rather than country at the time.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p={{google books|id=3Jorozp1yp4C|p=360}}}} He had a few regional hits around Phoenix, due to local radio airplay with  "Four Strong Winds" and "Just To Satisfy You", which was co-written with Bowman. Meanwhile, he recorded an album on BAT records produced by James Musil and engineered by Jack Miller, called ''[["JD's Waylon Jennings" on the front of the album, and "Waylon Jennings at JD's" on the back side]]''. After 500 copies were sold at the club another 500 were pressed by the Sounds label.<ref>Country Music Foundation; p. 53</ref> He also played lead guitar for [[Patsy Montana]] on a 1964 album.{{sfn|Montana, Patsy|Frost, Jane|2002|p=166}}

Singer [[Bobby Bare]] heard Jennings's "Just to Satisfy You" on his car radio while passing through Phoenix, and recorded it and "Four Strong Winds".{{sfn|Streissguth|2013|p=52}} After stopping in Phoenix to attend a Jennings performance at JD's, Bare called [[Chet Atkins]], head of the [[RCA Victor]] studios in Nashville, and suggested he sign Jennings.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=102–103}} Unsure after being offered a deal with RCA if he should quit his gig at JD's and relocate to Nashville, he sought the advice of RCA artist and friend [[Willie Nelson]], who had attended one of Jennings' shows.

===The Nashville Sound===
In 1966, Jennings released his debut RCA Victor album ''[[Folk-Country]]'', followed by ''[[Leavin' Town]]'' and ''[[Nashville Rebel]]''.{{sfn|Cramer|p=715|2009}}{{sfn|Thompson|p=622|2002}} ''Leavin' Town'' resulted in significant chart success as the first two singles "Anita, You're Dreaming" and "Time to Bum Again" both peaked at no. 17 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. The album's third single, a cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s "[[(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me]]", peaked at no. 9, Jennings's first top 10 single. ''Nashville Rebel'' was the soundtrack to an independent film, ''The [[Nashville Rebel (film)|Nashville Rebel]]'', starring Jennings.<ref name="rebel">The Southern Quarterly; p. 118</ref> The single "Green River" charted on ''Billboard'' country singles at #11.{{sfn|Henderson|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FikEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA72&dq=the%20waylors&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q&f=false 84]|2001}}

{{Listen|filename=Just to Satisfy You Waylon Jennings.ogg|title="Just to Satisfy You"|description= From the album of the [[Just to Satisfy You (album)|same name]], the song was a local radio hit for Jennings in Nashville}}
In 1967, Jennings released a hit single, "[[Just to Satisfy You (song)|Just to Satisfy You]]". During an interview, Jennings remarked that the song was a "pretty good example" of the influence of his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music.{{sfn|Country song roundup staff|1967}} Jennings produced mid-chart albums that sold well, including 1967's ''[[Just to Satisfy You (album)|Just to Satisfy You]]'', which included the hit single.{{sfn|Cramer|p=715|2009}} Jennings's singles enjoyed success. "[[The Chokin' Kind]]" peaked at number eight on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Singles in 1967, while "[[Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line]]" hit number two the following year. In 1969, his collaboration with The Kimberlys on the single "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]" earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group]]. His single "[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]" reached number three at the Hot Country Singles chart by the end of the year.{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=247}}

During this time, Jennings rented an apartment in Nashville with singer [[Johnny Cash]].{{sfn|Streissguth|2007|p=135}} Jennings and Cash were both managed by "Lucky" Moeller's booking agency Moeller Talent, Inc.{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=333}} The tours organized by the agency were unproductive, with the artists being booked to venues located far from each other in close dates. After paying for the accommodation and travel expenditures, Jennings was frequently forced to request advances from the agency or RCA Victor to make the next venue. While playing 300 days on the road, Jennings's debt increased, and along with it his consumption of [[amphetamine]]. He believed himself to be "trapped on the circuit".{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=112, 182}}

In 1972, Jennings released ''[[Ladies Love Outlaws (Waylon Jennings album)|Ladies Love Outlaws]]''. The single that headlined the album became a hit for Jennings, and was his first approach to [[outlaw country]].{{sfn|Larkin|1995|p=3005}} Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band, [[Waymore's Outlaws|The Waylors]], a practice that was not encouraged by powerful Nashville producers, who favored the [[Nashville sound]] produced by a roster of experienced local studio musicians. The music style publicized as "[[Countrypolitan]]" was characterized by orchestral arrangements and the absence of most traditional country music instruments. The producers did not let Jennings play his own guitar or select material to record.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT167#v=onepage&q&f=false 156]}} Jennings felt limited by Nashville's lack of artistic freedom.{{sfn|Petrusich|2008|p=[https://archive.org/details/itstillmoveslost00petr_0/page/105 <!-- quote=waylon jennings Nashville sound. --> 105]}}

=== Outlaw Country ===
In an interview Jennings recalled the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: "They wouldn't let you do anything. You had to dress a certain way: you had to do everything a certain way.... They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean."{{sfn|Ashby|p= [https://archive.org/details/withamusementfor00ashb/page/418 <!-- quote=waylon jennings atlantic records. --> 418]|2006}} By 1972, after the release of ''Ladies Love Outlaws'', his recording contract was nearing an end. Upon contracting [[hepatitis]], Jennings was hospitalized. Sick and frustrated with the Nashville music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue, suggesting he hire Neil Reshen as his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Reshen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing the offer with Reshen, he rejected it and hired Reshen.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=182–186}}

[[File:Kris Willie Waylon.jpg|thumb|left|L-R: [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Willie Nelson]], and Waylon Jennings at the [[Dripping Springs Reunion]], in 1972]]
Reshen started to renegotiate Jennings's recording and touring contracts. At a meeting in a Nashville airport Jennings introduced Reshen to Willie Nelson. By the end of the meeting Reshen had become Nelson's manager as well. Jennings's new deal included a $75,000 advance and artistic control.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=187–192}}{{sfn|Petrusich|2008|p=[https://archive.org/details/itstillmoveslost00petr_0/page/106 <!-- quote=waylon jennings Nashville sound. --> 106]}} Reshen advised Jennings to keep the beard that he had grown in the hospital, to match the image of Outlaw Country.{{sfn|Larkin|1995|p=2159}}{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_afNI8SL6UC&lpg=PA169&dq=Neil%20reshen%22%20willie%20nelson%20waylon&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false 169]}}{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=266}}

In 1973, Jennings released ''[[Lonesome, On'ry and Mean]]'' and ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', the first albums recorded and released under his creative control. This heralded a major turning point for Jennings, that resulted in his most critically and commercially successful years.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&lpg=PA340&dq=Lonesome%2C%20On'ry%20and%20Mean%20and%20Honky%20Tonk%20Heroes&pg=PA340#v=onepage&q&f=false 340]}} More hit albums followed with ''[[This Time (Waylon Jennings album)|This Time]]'' and ''[[The Ramblin' Man]]'', both released in 1974. The title tracks of both albums topped the ''Billboard'' Country singles chart, with the self-penned "This Time" becoming Jennings's first no. 1 single. ''[[Dreaming My Dreams (Waylon Jennings album)|Dreaming My Dreams]]'', released in 1975, included the no. 1 single "[[Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way]]", and became his first album to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]; it was also the first of six consecutive solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&lpg=PA340&dq=Lonesome%2C%20On'ry%20and%20Mean%20and%20Honky%20Tonk%20Heroes&pg=PA340#v=onepage&q&f=false 340]}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ramblin-man-r107198/review|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |title=The Ramblin' Man&nbsp;– Overview|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1976 Jennings released ''[[Are You Ready for the Country]]''.

Jennings and The Waylors traveled to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at Jennings's own expense. A month later, Jennings returned to Nashville and presented the master tape to [[Chet Atkins]], who, after listening to it, decided to release it.

Jennings was married four times and had six children.{{sfn|Brownstone, David|Franck, Irene|1997|p=213}} He married Maxine Caroll Lawrence in 1956 at age 18,{{sfn|Jennings, Terry|2016|p=21}} with whom he had four children: Terry Vance (January 21, 1957 – January 25, 2019), Julie Rae (August 12, 1958 – October 3, 2014), Buddy Dean (born March 21, 1960), and Deana. Jennings married Lynne Jones on December 10, 1962, adopting a child, Tomi Lynne.{{sfn|Jennings, Terry|2016|p=24}} They divorced in 1967. He married Barbara Elizabeth Rood in 1967. He composed the song "This Time" about the trials and tribulations of his marriages and divorces. He married country singer [[Jessi Colter]] in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 26, 1969. Colter had a daughter, Jennifer, from her previous marriage to [[Duane Eddy]]. The couple had a son, Waylon Albright, known as [[Shooter Jennings]].{{sfn|Jennings, Terry|2016|p=49-51}} In the early 1980s Colter and Jennings nearly divorced due to his abuse of drugs and alcohol.{{sfn|Jennings, Terry|2016|p=64}} In 1997, after he stopped touring, Jennings earned a [[GED]] at age 62 to set an example about the importance of education to his son, Shooter.{{sfn|Birk|2005|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false 72]}}{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&lpg=PA264&dq=waylon%20jennings%20radio%20high%20school&pg=PA264#v=onepage&q&f=false 264]}}

=== Addiction and recovery ===
Jennings started to consume [[amphetamines]] while he lived with [[Johnny Cash]] during the mid-1960s. Jennings later stated, "Pills were the artificial energy on which Nashville ran around the clock."<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> In 1977, Jennings was arrested by federal agents for conspiracy and possession of [[cocaine]] with intent to distribute. A private courier warned the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] about the package sent to Jennings by a New York colleague that contained 27 grams of cocaine. The DEA and the police searched Jennings's recording studio but found no evidence because, while they were waiting for a [[search warrant]], Jennings disposed of the drug. The charges were later dropped and Jennings was released.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=184}} The episode was recounted in Jennings's song "[[Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand]]".{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=322–325}}

During the early 1980s, his cocaine addiction intensified. Jennings claimed to have spent $1,500 a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Weatherby|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w-1-NqaOaKsC&lpg=PA46&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20cocaine&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false 46]|1988}}{{sfn|Ching|2001|p=[https://archive.org/details/wrongswhatidobes00chin/page/124 <!-- quote="$2.5 million" waylon. --> 124]}} Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to do so, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=322–325}} Jennings leased a home in the Phoenix area and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine. Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to finally do so.{{sfn|Weatherby|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w-1-NqaOaKsC&lpg=PA46&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20cocaine&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false 46]|1988}}

== Illness and death ==
[[File:Mesa-City of Mesa Cemetery-Waylon Jennings.JPG|thumb|upright|Grave of Waylon Jennings]]
Decades of excessive smoking and drug use took a large toll on Jennings's health in addition to being overweight and a poor diet which resulted in his developing [[Type II diabetes]]. In 1988, four years after quitting cocaine, he finally ended his six-pack-a-day [[smoking]] habit.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063513,00.html |title=The Outlaw in Love |magazine=People.com |access-date=July 3, 2013}}</ref> That same year, he underwent [[heart bypass surgery]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=322}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/12/13/Jennings-alert-after-heart-bypass-surgery/4369597992400/|title=Jennings alert after heart bypass surgery}}</ref> By 2000 his diabetes worsened, and the pain so reduced his mobility that he was forced to end most touring.{{sfn|Birk|2005|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false 72]}} That same year, he underwent surgery to improve his left leg's blood circulation.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> In December 2001, his entire left foot was amputated at a hospital in Phoenix. On February 13, 2002, Waylon Jennings died in his sleep from diabetic complications at the age of 64, at his home in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. He was buried in the [[City of Mesa Cemetery]], in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Waylon Jennings laid to rest at private ceremony|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|volume=56|number=120|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/77033356/|page=A-4|via=Newspapers.com|access-date=May 4, 2021}} {{open access}}</ref> At his memorial service on February 15, Jessi Colter sang "Storms Never Last".{{sfn|Birk|2005|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false 72]}}

He was inducted to the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.{{sfn|Jasinski|2012|p=831}} In October 2001, Jennings was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], but he was unable to attend the ceremony due to the pain caused by his diabetes.{{sfn|Birk|2005|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false 72]}} On July 6, 2006, Jennings was inducted to [[Guitar Center]]'s RockWalk in Hollywood, California. Jessi Colter attended the ceremony along with Kris Kristofferson, who was inducted on the same day.{{sfn|AP staff|2006|p=2}} On June 20, 2007, Jennings was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. During the ceremony, [[Ray Scott (singer)|Ray Scott]] sang "Rainy Day Woman" and the award was accepted by Buddy Jennings.{{sfn|Keel, Beverly|2007|p=4-B}}

Jennings's music had an influence on numerous artists,<ref name="AM" /> including [[Hank Williams Jr.]],{{sfn|Guralnick|p=203|1989}} [[The Marshall Tucker Band]],{{sfn|Browne|Browne|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&lpg=PA515&dq=hank%20williams%20jr%20influence%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA515#v=onepage&q&f=false 515]|2001}} [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]], [[Eric Church]], [[Cody Jinks]], [[Jamey Johnson]], [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]],{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=333}} his son, Shooter Jennings, [[Sturgill Simpson]], and [[Hank Williams III]].{{sfn|Fox|Ching|2008|p=10}}

In 2008 the posthumous album ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' was released, which consisted of songs recorded with his then sixteen-year-old son Shooter. In 2012 the three-volume ''[[Waylon: The Music Inside]]'' was released, featuring covers of Jennings's songs by different artists. Also released the same year was ''[[Goin' Down Rockin': The Last Recordings]]'', a set of 12 songs recorded by Jennings and bassist [[Robby Turner]] before Jennings' death in 2002.  The songs initially featured only Jennings' guitar and vocals, with Turner on bass; further accompaniment was to be added later. Turner completed the recordings in 2012 with the help of former Waylors. The Jennings family approved the release.  Meanwhile, it launched a new business focused on his estate. Shooter Jennings arranged deals for a clothing line, launched a renewed website, and started talks with different producers on a biographical film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/new-music-on-the-way-from_0_n_1272779.html|title=New Music on the Way From Late Waylon Jennings|author=Talbott, Chris|work=Huffington Post|date=February 13, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420023351/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/new-music-on-the-way-from_0_n_1272779.html |archive-date=April 20, 2014 |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref>
