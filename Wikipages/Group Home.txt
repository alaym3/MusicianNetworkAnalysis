'''Group Home''' is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo, composed of members Lil' Dap (birth name '''James Heath''') and Melachi the Nutcracker (birth name '''Jamal Felder''').<ref name="Shapiro">Shapiro, Peter (2005) ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop, 2nd ed.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-263-8}}, p.165</ref> They came to prominence as members of the [[Gang Starr Foundation]]. Lil' Dap made his rhyming debut on Gang Starr's 1992 classic ''[[Daily Operation]]'' on the song "I'm the Man".<ref name="Shapiro" /> Both members appeared on Gang Starr's critically acclaimed 1994 effort ''[[Hard to Earn]]'', on the tracks "Speak Ya Clout" and "Words from the Nutcracker".<ref name="Shapiro" /> In 1995, the group released its debut album, ''[[Livin' Proof]]''.<ref name="Shapiro" /> The album was very well received, mainly due to DJ Premier's advanced production work, described by ''[[Allmusic]]'' as "rhythmic masterpieces".<ref name="Shapiro" /><ref name="DiBella">DiBella, M.F. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r228948/review|pure_url=yes}} ''Livin' Proof'' Review]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> A second album ''A Tear for the Ghetto'' was released in 1999, this time with only one track produced by DJ Premier.<ref name="Shapiro" />

Since then, little has been heard of the group. Lil' Dap released a solo single, "Brooklyn Zone", in 2001, and guested on several other releases.<ref name="Shapiro" /> {{As of|2007}}, Lil' Dap is an independent artist. He released in 2008 a solo album called ''I.A.Dap''.  He was featured on [[Large Professor]]'s 2008 album ''Main Source''. [[Nas]] referred to Group Home on the track "Where are They Now?" from his album ''[[Hip Hop Is Dead]]''.

Currently, the duo occasionally performs and goes on tour with other artists, such as [[Cypress Hill]]. Melachi currently suffers from emotional turmoil from prior drug abuse.
