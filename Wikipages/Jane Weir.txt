She was the sister of [[Major Thomas Weir]] who was charged with incest and [[witchcraft]] in 1670 and was subsequently executed.<ref name="Uglow 1999">{{cite book|last=Uglow|first=Jennifer|title=The Northeastern Dictionary Of Women's Biography: Revised by Maggy Hendry|year=1999|publisher=Northeastern University Press|location=Boston|isbn=155553421X|edition=3rd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/northeasterndict0000uglo}}</ref><ref name="Black 2003">{{cite book|last=Black|first=George F.|title=A calendar of cases of witchcraft in Scotland, 1510–1727|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location=Whitefish, MT|isbn=0766158381}}</ref><ref name="Levack 1992">{{cite book|last=Levack|first=Brian P.|title=Witchcraft in Scotland|year=1992|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0815310293|edition=Reprint of works orig. publ. 1891–1984.}}</ref>

Weir was born near [[Carluke]] in [[Lanarkshire]]. Her brother Thomas Weir was a strict [[Protestant]] whose spoken prayers earned him a reputation that attracted visitors to his home in [[Edinburgh]]. 

Following his retirement in 1670, Weir fell ill and began to confess to a secret life of crime and vice. The [[Lord Provost]] initially found the confession implausible and took no action, but eventually Weir and his spinster sister, Jane Weir, were taken to the [[Edinburgh Tolbooth]] for interrogation. Major Weir, now in his seventies, continued to expand on his confession and Jane Weir gave an even more exaggerated history of witchcraft, sorcery and vice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=R |title=Traditions of Edinburgh |year=1824 |publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd. reprint 1980 |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-550-21292-2 |page=33}}</ref><ref name="Scottish Clans">{{cite web|title=Supernatural Scotland: Major Weir|url=http://www.scotclans.com/scottish_myths/supernatural_scotland/major_weir.html|work=Scottish Clans|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>

The trial began on 9 April 1670. Jane Weir confessed that their mother had been a witch and had taught her children. She also revealed that Thomas bore the mark of the Beast on his body and that they frequently roamed the countryside in a fiery coach.<ref name="Scottish Clans" />
