'''The Wiggles''' are an Australian [[children's music]] group formed in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] in 1991. Since 2013, the group members have been [[Anthony Field]], [[Lachlan Gillespie]], [[Simon Pryce]], and [[Emma Watkins]]. The original members were Field, [[Murray Cook]], [[Jeff Fatt]], [[Greg Page (musician)|Greg Page]], and [[Phillip Wilcher]]. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy [[Sam Moran]], but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Cook, Fatt, and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Watkins will leave the group at the end of 2021, with [[Tsehay Hawkins]] taking her place.

Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band [[The Cockroaches]] in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at [[Macquarie University]], where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and he enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with [[The Wiggles characters|costumed characters]] Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the human character Captain Feathersword, played by [[Paul Paddick]] since 1993. Shirley Shawn the Unicorn was later introduced. They originally travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.

The group was formally [[Consolidation (business)|consolidated]] in 2005.  They were listed at the top of ''[[Business Review Weekly]]''{{'}}s top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row and earned [[Australian dollar|A$]]45&nbsp;million in 2009.  In 2011, the worldwide recession hit the Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list that year.  The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world.  They have earned multiple Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records; have sold 23&nbsp;million DVDs and 7&nbsp;million CDs; and have performed, on average, to one million people per year. The band has earned multiple [[APRA Awards (Australia)|Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA)]] and [[ARIA Music Awards|Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards]], and they have been inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===1988–1991: Background===
[[Anthony Field]] and [[Jeff Fatt]] were members of [[the Cockroaches]], a Sydney pop band known for their "good-time [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] material"{{sfn|McFarlane|1999|p=128}} and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s.{{sfn|McFarlane|1999|p=129}} In 1988, Field's infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member [[Paul Field (musician)|Paul Field]], died of [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], causing the group to disband.<ref name="SIDS">{{cite news | last = Stapleton | first = John | title = Death of little girl gave birth to the Wiggles | newspaper=[[The Australian]] |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] | date = 7 June 2008 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/death-of-little-girl-gave-birth-to-the-wiggles/story-e6frg8n6-1111116564735 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612192125/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/death-of-little-girl-gave-birth-to-the-wiggles/story-e6frg8n6-1111116564735 |archive-date=12 June 2015 | access-date = 23 October 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref> Anthony Field enrolled at [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney to complete his degree in [[early childhood education]],<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/kid-rock.html |title = Kid Rock|last = Scott|first = Paul|date = 2 April 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date =23 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616185719/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/kid-rock.html|archive-date=16 June 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and later stated that his niece's death "ultimately led to the formation of [the] Wiggles".<ref name="SIDS"/> [[Murray Cook]], also "a mature-aged student",{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=28}} was the guitarist in the pub rock band [[Bang Shang a Lang]] before enrolling at Macquarie.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=28}}<ref>{{cite web | last = Mulligan | first = Mark |publisher=[[Bang Shang a Lang]] | title = A Brief History of Nearly Everything BSL | url = http://www.bangshangalang.com/images/ABriefHistoryofNearlyEverythingBSL.doc | format = DOC | access-date = 2 April 2015 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320213444/http://www.bangshangalang.com/images/ABriefHistoryofNearlyEverythingBSL.doc | archive-date = 20 March 2012}}</ref> [[Greg Page (musician)|Greg Page]], who had been a [[roadie]] for and sang with the Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=28}}<ref name="cnn">{{cite news | last = Eng | first = Dinah | title = How The Wiggles became an empire | work = [[CNN Business]] |publisher=[[CNN]]| date = 23 January 2010 | url = https://money.cnn.com/2010/01/18/smallbusiness/wiggles_how_we_got_started/ | access-date = 2 April 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116140342/http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/18/smallbusiness/wiggles_how_we_got_started/ |archive-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>  Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=21}}{{refn|Field admitted that one of the things that drew him to teaching was that women outnumbered the men at Macquarie's program.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=21}}|group=note}}

In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children.<ref name="nytimes"/>{{sfn|Field|2006|p=2}} The album was dedicated to Field's niece.<ref name="SIDS"/>  A song he wrote for the Cockroaches, "Get Ready to Wiggle", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance.<ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="cnn"/>  Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=2}} They needed a keyboardist "to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project",{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=28}} so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.<ref name="denton">{{cite web|last1=Denton|first1=Andrew|title=Enough Rope with Andrew Denton|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s886402.htm|work=[[ABC TV (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=2 May 2015|date=23 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214064421/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s886402.htm|archive-date=14 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{refn|According to Field, the four original members of the Wiggles, with Page's "mellifluous voice" and "perfect children's music instrument", Cook's knowledge of child development, Fatt's "incredible musicianship and gentle persona" that appealed to children, and Field's energy, balanced each other.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=44}}|group=note}}

To promote their first album, the Wiggles filmed two music videos with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) and created a self-produced, forty-minute-long video version. Finances were limited, so there was no post-production editing of the video project.  They used Field's nieces and nephews as additional cast, and hired the band's girlfriends to perform in character costumes.  Cook's wife made their first costumes.<ref name="cnn"/>  They used two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=2}}

===1991–1993: Early career===
The Cockroaches' former manager, Jeremy Fabinyi, became the group's first manager. Using their previous connections, he negotiated with the ABC to help them promote their first recording.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=32}} The album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce and it sold 100,000 copies in 1991. Anthony Field and Cook got teaching jobs, while Page finished his degree, so they could only perform during school holidays; finding time to do so was, as Field reported, "challenging".<ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="cnn"/>  Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales.<ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="denton"/> The Wiggles' debut performance was at a friend's daycare facility in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], New South Wales, for about a dozen children.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=93}} They played for crowds at shopping centres like [[Westfield Group|Westfield]] in Sydney and at small pre-school events and parties, and [[busking|busked]] at [[Circular Quay]], then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations, averaging about 300 people in the audience.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=28}}<ref name="cnn"/><ref name="denton"/>  They were promoted by local [[Pre-school playgroup|playgroups]] or [[Australian Breastfeeding Association|nursing mothers' associations]] with whom they split their proceeds.<ref name="wigglyway">{{cite news | last = Munro | first = Catharine | title = The Wiggly way | newspaper= [[The Age]] |publisher=Nine Entertainment | date = 22 May 2005 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/The-Wiggly-way/2005/05/19/1116361668574.html | access-date = 11 May 2015 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045804/https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/the-wiggly-way-20050522-geww32.html|archive-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>  They performed at pre-schools with other ABC children's performers;<ref name="cnn"/> when 500 people attended these concerts just to see the Wiggles, they started doing their own shows, and according to Field, "Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=32}}

In 1993, Field, Cook, and Page decided to give up teaching for a year to focus on performing full-time, along with Fatt, to see if they could make a living out of it.<ref name="cnn"/><ref>{{cite news | last = Chamberlain | first = Adrian | title = The Wiggles: Rock star status with screaming crowds of tots | work = [[Vancouver Sun]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] | date = 17 April 2008 | url = http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=ff331ffb-74e1-46da-b542-65ce07654b40&k=13504 | access-date = 5 March 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150811165027/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=ff331ffb-74e1-46da-b542-65ce07654b40&k=13504 | archive-date = 11 August 2015 | url-status=dead}}</ref>  As Fatt reported, "it was very much a [[cottage industry]]".<ref name="wigglyway"/>  They used many of the [[The Wiggles Pty Ltd|business techniques]] developed by the Cockroaches, choosing to remain as independent and self-contained as possible.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=31}} John Field, Mike Conway, who later became the Wiggles' general manager, trumpeter Dominic Lindsay, and Cockroaches saxophonist Daniel Fallon performed with them.<ref name="wigglyway"/><ref name = "fallon">{{cite news | last = Fallon | first = Daniel | title = My life as a Cockroach (not a Wiggle) | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/my-life-as-a-cockroach-not-a-wiggle-20140603-zrw8j.html#ixzz34Yt2EfH5 | newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Nine Entertainment  | date = 3 June 2014 | access-date = 11 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106152304/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/my-life-as-a-cockroach-not-a-wiggle-20140603-zrw8j.html|archive-date=6 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{refn|According to Anthony Field, his brother John enjoyed the group's busking performances, but found their pre-school gigs "weird", choosing to contribute by writing and changing the Cockroaches' songs to children's songs.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=29}}|group=note}}  Anthony Field, with input from the other members, led most of the production of their music, home video releases, and live shows.<ref name="dictator">{{cite news | last = Sams | first = Christine | title = I'm no dictator, says Blue Wiggle | work = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Nine Entertainment | date = 19 May 2012 | url =http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/im-no-dictator-says-blue-wiggle-20120519-1yxgg.html | access-date = 11 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927015159/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/im-no-dictator-says-blue-wiggle-20120519-1yxgg.html|archive-date=27 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Their act was later augmented with supporting characters: the "friendly pirate" Captain Feathersword and the [[costumed performer|costumed characters]] Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog. These characters were initially performed by the band members themselves: Field played Captain Feathersword and Wags; Cook played Dorothy; and Fatt played Henry. In 1993, actor [[Paul Paddick]] permanently joined the group to play Captain Feathersword; he later became known as "the fifth Wiggle" and was as popular as the regular bandmembers.<ref name="swordplay">{{cite news | last = Meacham | first = Steve | title = The master of sword play | newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Nine Entertainment | date = 3 December 2005 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/12/01/1133311137232.html?page=fullpage | access-date = 11 May 2015|url-access=subscription|archive-date=24 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124182745/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/the-master-of-sword-play-20051203-gdmjzg.html?page=fullpage|url-status=live}}</ref>  At first, the group travelled with a small group of dancers hired from a local dance studio to perform with them.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=223}}{{refn|By 2006, they toured with two 54-foot trucks that carried equipment and merchandise and three buses that carried 33 cast members, and would employ 25 local crew in each city.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=5}}|group=note}}

After the production of their second album, the Wiggles, who were called by their first names when they performed, began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as the Cockroaches had done, and adopted colour-coded shirts: Page in yellow, Cook in red, Fatt in purple, and Field in blue. The coloured shirts also made it easier for their young audience to identify them.<ref name="babysband"/>  As Field reported, the decision to emphasise colour was "a no-brainer, considering our pre-school-age audience".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=32}} Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours, but Field and Page "met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=32}}

===1993–2004: Australian and international success===
Through the rest of the 1990s, the Wiggles maintained a busy recording and touring schedule, becoming as Field reported and despite his strong dislike of touring, "the hardest-working touring act in the country".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=31}} They released multiple albums and home videos and, depending upon the word of mouth of their audience, performed to increasingly large audiences in Australia and New Zealand despite having to re-introduce themselves to a new audience of children approximately every three years.<ref name="cnn"/><ref name="hotseat">{{cite web| last = Brandle | first = Lars | title = The Hot Seat: Anthony Field from The Wiggles | work = Lars Brandle | date = 7 February 2011 | url = http://larsbrandle.com/the-hot-seat-anthony-field-from-the-wiggles | access-date = 23 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502040318/http://larsbrandle.com/the-hot-seat-anthony-field-from-the-wiggles|archive-date=2 May 2013}}</ref>  They produced a new album and video each year and toured to promote them.  By late 1993, they "grew bigger than anyone had thought", and hundreds attended their concerts; by 1995 they had set records for music and video sales.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=33}}{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}} In 1997, [[Twentieth Century Fox]] produced a feature-length film, ''[[The Wiggles Movie]]'', which became the fifth-highest grossing Australian film of 1998, earning over a million-and-a-half dollars.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 5 Australian Feature Films Each Year  | publisher = [[Screen Australia]] | url = https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/fact-finders/cinema/australian-films/top-films-at-the-box-office/top-5-each-year | access-date=5 November 2021 |date=March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903081926/https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/fact-finders/cinema/australian-films/top-films-at-the-box-office/top-5-each-year|url-status=live|archive-date=3 September 2016 }}</ref>

In spite of their early success in Australia, Paul Field reported that the band was unable to produce a television program on the ABC, where they felt they would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}} "Around 1996–1997",<ref name="cnn"/> they filmed a television pilot for the ABC, but as ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported in 2002, "the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences".<ref name="aunty"/>  As a result, the Wiggles financed a TV program of 13 episodes themselves and sold it to [[Disney Channel (Australian TV channel)|Disney Channel]] in Australia and to [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]], where it became a hit.<ref name="nytimes"/>{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}} By 1998, the Wiggles were ready to move on to international markets, despite its members' health issues, especially Anthony Field's. The reaction of producers in the UK was less positive than the group would have liked, although they were eventually able to make inroads there, but their real success came in the US.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=58}}{{refn|Field later said, "For us, America was the goal. It sounds like a cliché, but performing in America was everything we ever wanted to do."<ref name="hoffman"/>|group=note}}  Disney arranged for them to perform at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in California, where they were discovered by [[Lyrick Studios]], the producers of ''[[Barney & Friends]].''  Both Anthony and Paul Field reported that Lyrick, despite their initial misgivings about whether American audiences would accept the band's Australian accents, came to understand the Wiggles and their goals, and after successful tests with American children, enthusiastically promoted them.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}}{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=56}}

The Wiggles used many of the same promotion techniques in the US that they had used in Australia, and chose to keep their concerts simple and maintain the same values that were successful in Australia.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=42}} The Wiggles performed during the intermission of ''Barney Live'' stage shows, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' likened to "getting the warm-up slot for [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]]" in the pre-school entertainment world.<ref name="nytimes"/>{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}}{{refn|According to Anthony Field, the Wiggles had to leave their own dinosaur character Dorothy behind, stating tongue in cheek, "Too many dinosaurs on stage can be distracting".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=59}}|group=note}}  In 2000, when video sales took off in the US, Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their ''Barney'' videos, which, as Anthony Field stated, "pushed us over the edge".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=59}} At first, the group's videos were distributed in boutique stores such as [[FAO Schwarz]] and [[Zany Brainy]], and on-line.  According to Paul Field, they entered the mass media market when their videos became top-sellers at [[Amazon.com]], and their first two videos, ''Yummy Yummy'' and ''Wiggle Time'', landed in the top ten at Amazon.com.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=5}} Stores such as [[Wal-Mart]] began to take notice, and began to sell Wiggles videos.  The band released nine DVDs in the next three years to keep up with the demand.<ref name="nytimes"/>

Despite their success, Anthony Field almost left the group in 2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by the Wiggles' demanding tour schedule. After meeting [[chiropractor]] James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue.

The new iteration of the Wiggles, with Field and its new members, began touring in early 2013. Cook became the group's road manager in mid-2013.  Pryce reported that since the Wiggles' audience changed every few years, the transition to the new group was easier for their young audience than it was for their parents. One of their challenges, especially for their early tours, was learning the Wiggles' catalogue of 1400 songs.<ref name="simon">{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/actor-and-singer-simon-pryce-settles-into-new-role-as-red-wiggle-20141205-11x3hi.html|title = Actor and singer Simon Pryce settles into new role as Red Wiggle|last=Northover|first=Kylie|date=30 November 2015|newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Nine Entertainment |access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref> After a seven-year absence from Australian television, they filmed a new television series, called ''Ready, Steady, Wiggle!'', in their spare time at their studio in Sydney between tours and on the road.

The Wiggles found success with their new line-up in 2014, when they doubled their concert ticket sales from the year before, and won the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2014|2014 ARIA Award]] for [[ARIA Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] with ''Apples & Bananas''.<ref name="2014aria"/> By 2015, Paul Field called the new group "an amazing success".{{sfn|Bugg|2015|p=55}} They performed to sell-out audiences throughout Australia and had high sales of their DVDs and CDs.

The Wiggles have written new music each year since their inception; they sequestered themselves for a month each summer and wrote three albums' worth of original children's music based on simple concepts familiar to young children, and using several genres of music and types of instruments. Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt that young children needed to be presented with a song's topic in their first few lines.<ref name="nytimes"/>  They wrote songs individually at first, but eventually wrote as a group, often with John Field, trumpet player Dominic Lindsay, and Paddick.<ref name="guitar">{{cite news|last=Bourgeau |first=Michel |title=Play your guitar with Murray |publisher=bangshangalang.com |url=http://www.bangshangalang.com/images/MurrayCookguitarMagazineInterview.doc |format=DOC |access-date=23 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015061344/http://www.bangshangalang.com/images/MurrayCookguitarMagazineInterview.doc |archive-date=15 October 2013 }}</ref>  Fatt, the only member of the original group without a degree in early childhood education, tended to focus on composing music.  Fatt told reporter Brian McElhiney, who called the group's songwriting process "a collaborate affair", that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles, which were appealing to children.<ref name="wiggleroomdaily"/> Watkins reported that she was invited to write songs for their albums, even though she was primarily a dancer.<ref name="wigglywoman">{{cite news|last1=Kretowicz|first1=Ewa|title=Wiggly woman: Emma Watkins' rise to yellow stardom|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/wiggly-woman-emma-watkins-rise-to-yellow-stardom-20131105-2wyt4.html|access-date=13 June 2015|work=The Canberra Times|date=10 November 2013}}</ref> [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], who appeared in a Wiggles video in 2002, told ''The New York Times'' that he was "very impressed" with the group's songwriting, especially with their [[Hearing the shape of a drum|drum sound]].<ref name="nytimes"/>

According to Field, the transition from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for the Wiggles. "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what we did in the Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; the Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti."<ref name="rock">{{cite web | last = Sachs | first = Rob | title = The Wiggles Rock!

The group sang the same 60s-style pop as the Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=3}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pollard|first1=Lawrence|title=Entering the world of the Wiggles|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8108723.stm|access-date=13 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2015}}</ref>  The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by [[nursery rhymes]], folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="babysband"/>  Page reported, "First and foremost, we're entertainers".<ref name="rock"/>  The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.<ref name="rock"/>

The group wrote and performed children's music that was different from what had been done previously; as Cook stated, "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music".<ref name="nytimes"/>  They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music.<ref name="babysband"/> ''Guitar Magazine'' speculated that since Cook was one of the first guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world.  Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15&nbsp;years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [The] Wiggles".<ref name="guitar"/>  In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like [[Regular John]] approached him and said that the Wiggles were the first band "they got into".<ref name="glastonbury"/>

==Educational theory==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote="Where was the fun? Where were the references to the simple things that are so dominant in a child's life?  Favourite books, colours, dancing, playing, nap time. And what's wrong with kids getting up and grooving; squealing, screaming, and laughing through a performance? I wanted to explore alternate ways to write and perform for young children, to ensure the music was for them, not just the musician. Nothing complicated, snide, or condescending."|source=—Anthony Field, speaking about the state of children's music in the early 1990s, 2012{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=27}}}}

The Wiggles' songwriting and performances were rooted in their professional training as pre-school teachers and in the concepts of early childhood education.<ref name="nytimes"/>{{sfn|Field|2006|p=2}} Anthony Field reported, as he studied music for young children at university, being "shocked&nbsp;... at the non-inclusive way music for children was usually performed".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=27}} According to Field, children had to sit silently as musicians played "traditional songs often featuring negative or outdated lyrics and dealing with subject matter of no interest to small children".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=27}} The lack of songs with themes and topics that interested children inspired Field to record the Wiggles' first album.

The group's "golden rule", according to Field, was to make the content of their songs and shows "developmentally appropriate and fun".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=89}} Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as ''The New York Times'' reported, "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements".<ref name="nytimes"/>  They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty.  As Field said, "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=56}} The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=3}} They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.<ref name="nytimes"/>

The Wiggles' stage shows were full of action and audience participation.  By the group's "New Wiggles" iteration, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' called their shows slick and fast-paced, with inside jokes for the adult members of their audience.  The bandmembers tended to wander throughout the audience, "thrilling toddlers and smartphone wielding guardians alike".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Northover|first1=Kylie|title=The Wiggles review: Toddlers show the grown-ups how to party|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/the-wiggles-review-toddlers-show-the-grownups-how-to-party-20141213-126ole.html#ixzz3UlOh1XKC|access-date=14 December 2014|newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Nine Entertainment}}</ref>  Pryce, as an experienced stage performer, was conscious that their shows were the first live theater young children experienced; as a result, the group adapted the content of their shows to accommodate their audience's development and understanding.<ref name="simon"/> Paddick's role as Captain Feathersword became more important in the mid-1990s, especially in the group's stage shows, when he was able to incorporate his circus and opera training, as well as impersonations that were popular with their audience's parents.<ref name="swordplay"/>

Some hand motions, originally patterned after professional bowlers, have another, more practical purpose.<ref name="denton" /> When asked about the origin of "Wiggles fingers", Cook explained "when you’re a teacher in early childhood [development], you have to be aware that you can be accused of things ...In photos for instance, if there are kids there, if you’ve got your hands doing this, everyone sees where your hands are." He stated that all physical contact, no matter how innocent, was forbidden within the band, in an effort to protect the group from litigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/you-have-to-protect-yourself-the-sad-origin-of-wiggles-iconic-move/news-story/55bf85789597c17717723b836ae48ce6|title=Heartbreaking reason The Wiggles created their iconic move|date=2019-04-29|website=NewsComAu|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

They believed in empowering children by practices such as greeting their audience members with "Hello, everyone", instead of "Hello, boys and girls" because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension".{{sfn|Field|2006|p=3}} Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to "Wake Up Jeff" when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was "very much in keeping with the way they work with children".<ref name="wigglyway"/>{{refn|Warren has been a consultant for the Wiggles since Field, Cook, and Page were her students at Macquarie University.|group=note}}  Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives.  Fatt was the only original member of the Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything".<ref name="aunty"/>  Paul Field reported that children in the Wiggles' audience felt "great excitement" and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=3}} Anthony Field, who called it "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done since the start of the group",{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=49}} claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences.  The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because "it was a perfect fit".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=49}} When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Shane|title=Three new Wiggles are part of children's group tour|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20130815/ENTERTAIN/308160306|access-date=14 June 2015|work=Cape Cod Times|date=15 August 2013|location=Hyannis, Massachusetts}}</ref>

Simple movements were developed by their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as ''The New York Times'' reported, they believed "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children".<ref name="nytimes"/>  According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves in order to identify more with their young audience.<ref name="babysband"/>  The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. "So [The] Wiggles have kind of become a bit more, dare I say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported.<ref>{{cite news | title = Offspring put the wiggle in the Wiggles | work = The Canadian Press | date = 8 March 2008 | url = http://www.capebretonpost.com/Football/2008-03-22/article-767634/Offspring-put-the-wiggle-in-the-Wiggles/1 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810025854/http://www.capebretonpost.com/Football/2008-03-22/article-767634/Offspring-put-the-wiggle-in-the-Wiggles/1 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 10 August 2011 | access-date = 23 June 2015 }}</ref>  In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in [[acrobatics]] and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former [[trampoline]] champion Karl Shore.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=212}} Watkins, whom Paul Field called "a dancer of many disciplines",{{sfn|Bugg|2015|p=55}} was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as "mainly a dancer".<ref name="wigglywoman"/>

Between 1999 and 2003, to test the group's appeal across cultures, Warren used one of the Wiggles' CDs as an educational tool in a village near [[Madang]], on the north coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. She found that the Madangese children were able to relate to the group's songs, and that they were able to sing along and participate in their simple choreography.<ref name="wigglyway"/>  Although the Wiggles' recorded and performed songs, dances, and musical styles from different cultures and languages, the Wiggles did not find that adapting their music to non-Australian cultures was necessary to reach children in other countries.{{sfn|Field|2006|p=4}}<ref name="ofoz"/> As Cook stated, "...&nbsp;Toddlers don't have the same hang ups as adults".{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=59}} The Wiggles recognised that as long as they spoke at the same level as their audience, their Australian accents would not matter, and that young children were able to adapt to a variety of contexts and to different pronunciations of common words, no matter where they resided.{{sfn|Field|Truman|2012|p=58–59}}
