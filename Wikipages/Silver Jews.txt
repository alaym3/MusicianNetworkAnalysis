'''Silver Jews''' were an American [[indie rock]] band from [[New York City]], formed in 1989 by [[David Berman (musician)|David Berman]] along with [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]'s [[Stephen Malkmus]] and [[Bob Nastanovich]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=354}}</ref> Throughout, Berman was the only constant band member. During the last few albums, [[Cassie Berman]] became a regular member of the band. They disbanded in 2009.

==History==
===Early years===
Berman was living in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] with two [[University of Virginia]] friends, [[Stephen Malkmus]] and [[Bob Nastanovich]] and recording discordant tapes in their living room.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Around this time Berman worked as a security guard at New York's [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], which influenced their music. "We were working at the Whitney with all this conceptual art, and we were learning about it … and so I thought, "Well let’s just make this record that looks like a record, and has song titles and everything, but the songs would be the ones we make at home that sound terrible." said Berman.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2018961/silver-jews-american-water-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/|title=Silver Jews' 'American Water' Turns 20|website=Stereogum.com|date=October 19, 2018|access-date=8 August 2019}}</ref>

Although Silver Jews is often called a Pavement side project, it was formed at about the same time as Pavement. Walnut Falcons was tossed around as a potential band name before settling on Silver Jews.<ref name="auto"/> Berman has misrepresented the origin of the band's name as coming from the transcription of a billboard that he saw reading "Silver Jewelry", but he has stated in an interview that the name was actually intended to be a pseudonym for a conceptual art piece and later evolved into the actual band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raford.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/silver-jews-thursday-exclusive-interview-wdavid-part-i/ |title=Silver Jews Thursday – David Berman on LOMLOC, Writing, and the Ugliness of Failure – Part I &#124; Blog de Ford |website=Raford.wordpress.com |date=2008-06-19 |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref>

Others claim, however, that the name pays homage to [[Silver Apples]], [[The Beatles#Formation and early years (1957–1962)|The Silver Beatles]], and slang for blonde-haired Jews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Artist Biography by Heather Phares |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/silver-jews-mn0000755496/biography |title=Silver Jews &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref> In an interview with [[Vish Khanna]] on the June 12, 2019 episode of Kreative Kontrol, Berman stated, "Silver Jews was a very burdensome band name.  It confused people: I never made it clear what I meant by it.  It wasn’t until the end until I realized what a proper definition of Silver Jew would be outside of the context of my music, which would be a Jew that was Jewish down through patrilineal descent, which would be a Jew that’s not a Jew, really.  It’s the outsiders to the outsiders."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vishkhanna.com/2019/06/12/ep-481-david-berman/|title=Ep. #481: David Berman – Kreative Kontrol|website=Vishkhanna.com|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>

===Touring===

Though Berman had pointedly avoided playing live throughout much of the band's existence, then Silver Jews surprised fans by embarking on their first-ever tour following the release of ''[[Tanglewood Numbers]]'' in 2005. They toured North America, Europe, and Israel in 2006. A documentary, titled ''[[Silver Jew]]'', was filmed during the band's time in Israel.

===Break up===
On January 22, 2009, Berman announced via the official [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] [[internet forum|messageboard]] that he planned to retire from music and that the Silver Jews would play their final show on ''[[Bluegrass Underground]]'' at [[Cumberland Caverns]] in [[McMinnville, Tennessee]] at 3 pm on January 31, 2009.<ref>[http://bluegrassunderground.com/2008/12/its-hard-to-find-a-friend-the-silver-jews-are-so-underground/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513023312/http://bluegrassunderground.com/2008/12/its-hard-to-find-a-friend-the-silver-jews-are-so-underground/ |date=May 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="pitchfork">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/148664-silver-jews-david-berman-calls-it-quits ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126024624/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/148664-silver-jews-david-berman-calls-it-quits |date=January 26, 2009 }}</ref> The caverns are located 333 feet underground, and only 300 general admission tickets were made available. Berman stated that he would play his 15 favorite Silver Jews songs. He also wrote that his intentions are to move to "[[screenwriting]] or [[Muckraker|muckraking]]".<ref name="pitchfork" /> He closed the entry by saying, "I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the answer song to '[[Shiny Happy People]]'."<ref name="dc">[http://dragcity.com/dcforums/viewtopic.php?p=2298&sid=1a999b4209f426a801b14fc1ff8eccd0#2298]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506105434/http://dragcity.com/dcforums/viewtopic.php?p=2298&sid=1a999b4209f426a801b14fc1ff8eccd0#2298 |date=May 6, 2009 }}</ref>

Berman originally planned for the concert to be recorded and aired sometime in February 2009 on Nashville's famed [[WSM (AM)|WSM AM]] radio station;<ref name="pitchfork" /> however, the day before the show, Berman posted on the Drag City message board to say that he had "negotiated out of the WSM part out of the deal."<ref>[http://dragcity.com/dcforums/viewtopic.php?t=654&sid=1e50689a0f7bc1569706a99105037e56]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129145313/http://dragcity.com/dcforums/viewtopic.php?t=654&sid=1e50689a0f7bc1569706a99105037e56 |date=January 29, 2009 }}</ref> The concert was documented by several [[16 mm film]] cameras, and Berman hinted at a possible DVD release of the show at some point in the future.

The last song that the Silver Jews performed live was "Smith and Jones Forever".

===Post-breakup events===
On June 19, 2012, ''Early Times'' was released by Drag City. ''Early Times'' is a compilation of EPs and singles that were released before the debut LP ''Starlite Walker''.

In 2015, Bob Nastanovich posted a photo to his Facebook page featuring the band rehearsing. He said that the band is working on two new songs, "The Veranda Over The Toy Shoppe", and "Wacky Package Eyes". David Berman later said the photo was a prank.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150214143247/http://www.chartattack.com/news/2015/01/13/silver-jews-maybe-reuniting/]</ref> Berman instead returned with new project [[Purple Mountains]] in July 2019, but died the following month.
