'''Tim Levinson''', better known by the stage name '''Urthboy''', is an Australian [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] MC and producer from [[New South Wales]]. He is widely known for his solo music under the moniker '''Urthboy''', as a founding member of the hip-hop group [[The Herd (Australian band)|The Herd]], and for co-founding and managing the [[Elefant Traks]] record label. Levinson has released five solo albums: ''[[Distant Sense of Random Menace]]'' (2004), ''[[The Signal (Urthboy album)|The Signal]]'' (2007), ''[[Spitshine]]'' (2009), ''[[Smokey's Haunt]]'' (2012) and ''The Past Beats Inside Me Like a Second Heartbeat'' (2016); as well as five studio albums with The Herd.

==Early life==
With origins in [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]], a town in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] area of New South Wales, Levinson's interest in music began at an early age, when he was exposed to a broad range of musical styles, many of which were introduced to him by his older brother, Matthew. The [[Run DMC]] album ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]'' was the first influential hip-hop record for Levinson<ref name="Story">{{cite web|title=Urthboy: The Storyteller|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/36355/Urthboy-The-Storyteller|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|access-date=15 March 2014|author=Andrew McMillen|author-link=Andrew McMillen|date=22 July 2013}}</ref>

== Music career ==
===Explanetary===
In 1998, Levinson co-formed Explanetary in Wentworth Falls with local friends Realistix, Elgusto and Luke Dubs, who played keys and drums respectively, while Levinson delivered the vocals. The band also included Realistix on vocals and production, No Mumbles (a.k.a. Nugs) on vocals, Aja Stuart on bass and DJ Alf.<ref name="etraks-explanetary">{{cite web|title=Explanetary|url=http://www.elefanttraks.com/node/5|work=Elefant Traks|publisher=Elefant Traks|access-date=1 September 2012|author=Elefant Traks|year=2011}}</ref> Explanetary released the ''In on the Deal'' [[Extended play|EP]] through Elefant Traks in July 2001.<ref name="etraks-explanetary" /> The EP was one of the label's first releases, but was the band's only recording before the act disbanded.<ref name="Story" /> Despite the end of Explanetary, many subsequent collaborations have occurred, including "Fallen Giants", from 2005's ''[[Tales of the Drift]]''.

By the time he completed high school, Levinson relocated to New South Wales' capital city, Sydney. While in his new environment, Levinson proceeded to form the Australian hip-hop band [[The Herd (Australian band)|The Herd]], alongside eight other artists, while Elgusto and Luke Dubs formed [[Hermitude]] and later joined the Elefant Traks label. Levinson also developed his solo hip-hop production and MC work, created under his moniker in the Herd, "Urthboy".<ref name="Story" />

===The Herd===
{{main|The Herd (Australian band)}}
Alongside [[Kenny Sabir]], Levinson is one of the key co-founding members of [[The Herd (Australian band)|The Herd]], an [[Australian hip hop]] outfit. Levinson is one of the group's two MCs—the other is Shannon Kennedy, who uses the moniker "[[Ozi Batla]]". Unusual for a hip-hop group, the Herd consists of a full live band as well as MCs: in addition to Levinson and Kennedy, Unkle Ho (beats), Sabir/Traksewt ([[accordion]], clarinet and beats), Sulo (beats and guitar), Byron/Toe-Fu (guitar), Dale/Rok Poshtya (bass), and singer Jane Tyrrell complete the line-up. Their songs often feature politically oriented lyrics.<ref name="Vine">{{cite web|title=The Herd – interview|url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/the-herd-interview-20110401-258514/?page=1|work=The Vine|publisher=Fairfax Media|access-date=15 March 2014|author=Andrew McMillen|author-link=Andrew McMillen|date=1 April 2011}}</ref>

===2004-2006: Solo career & ''Distant Sense of Random Menace''===
{{main|Distant Sense of Random Menace}}
In 2004, Levinson released his first Urthboy solo album, ''[[Distant Sense of Random Menace]]''. The album was a success and featured songs such as "Come Around" and "No Rider". Urthboy toured the album nationally with Elgusto as DJ and Ozi Batla as co-MC. The music video for "No Rider", directed by Broken Yellow, won the Sunscreen Music Video Award at the [[Festival of the Sun]] Music Festival (FOTSUN) in 2005.<ref name="Broken Yellow">{{cite web |url=http://www.brokenyellow.com/ns11.html |title=Broken Yellow Music Videos |access-date=30 April 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621104932/http://www.brokenyellow.com/ns11.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 21 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunscreen.net.au/ |title=Sunscreen 2005 finalists |publisher=Sunscreen |access-date=30 April 2008}}</ref>

===2007-2008: ''The Signal''===
{{main|The Signal (Urthboy album)}}
After the success of his debut album, Urthboy headed into the studio in 2007 to record his sophomore release, ''[[The Signal (Urthboy album)|The Signal]]'', with Pip Norman/Count Bounce ([[TZU]]) and Elgusto (Hermitude). The album was released in July 2007 to much critical praise and cemented Urthboy's place in the growing Australian hip-hop scene.

The first single, "We Get Around", was hailed as "a classic" by Rolling Stone and reached No. 25 on [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2007|Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2007]]. The album received two nominations at the [[AIR Awards of 2007]],<ref name="2007 AIR Chart Award nominees">[http://air.org.au/index.php?cID=2108&menuID=504&apply=&PHPSESSID=&menubox=&siblingID= 2007 AIR Chart Award nominees]</ref> a nomination at the [[J Awards of 2007]] and was shortlisted in the prestigious [[Australian Music Prize]] (Best Album 2007).<ref>[http://australianmusicprize.com.au/ Australian Music Prize website]</ref> The album was licensed to Motivo Records, and was released internationally in late 2007. Urthboy toured Malaysia and Japan in 2008 before resuming work with The Herd in Australia.

In 2008, as a part of The GetUp Mob, organised by the advocacy group [[GetUp!]], Levinson released an Urthboy version of "[[From Little Things Big Things Grow]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getup.org.au/media/TheGetUpMob/ |title="From Little Things Big Things Grow" by The GetUp Mob |publisher=[[GetUp!]] |access-date=24 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807180740/http://www.getup.org.au/media/TheGetUpMob/ |archive-date=7 August 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=youplusme>{{cite book|title=You Plus Me Equals Us|year=2011|publisher=NSW Reconciliation Council|url=http://nswreconciliation.org.au/_webapp_815683/Urthboy_-_Alternative_Education|access-date=24 March 2011|chapter=Urthboy – Alternative Education}}</ref> a song originally released by [[Kev Carmody]] and Kelly in 1993. Levinson's version featured elements of the apology to the [[Stolen Generations]], made by [[Kevin Rudd]], Australia's [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] at the time, on 13 February 2008, as well as excerpts of the [[Redfern Speech]], made by former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] on 10 December 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23575456-7642,00.html |title=Single samples Rudd, Keating |publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]] |last=Edwards |first=Anna |date=22 April 2008 |access-date=20 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618150440/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23575456-7642,00.html |archive-date=18 June 2008 }}</ref>

{{main|Spitshine}}
In August 2009, Urthboy's released his third solo album, ''[[Spitshine]]''.

===2014-present: ''The Past Beats Inside of Me Like a Second Heartbeat''===
On 22 July 2014, Levinson posted a video clip in which he announces the "Make Me a Mixtape" concept. Based on the mixtape cassette tapes that were popular during the 1980s, Levinson created a live performance in collaboration with other artists based on the themes that would sometimes guide the creation of mixtapes; for example, a mixtape would be given to a friend who was travelling overseas. The first "Make Me a Mixtape" show is based on the theme of Levinson's first overseas trip to Southeast Asia and will consist rap, remix, song and spoken word.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Levinson|title=July 22|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152486838626480|website=Urthboy on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 August 2014|date=22 July 2014}}</ref> Performances are scheduled for both the Brisbane<ref>{{cite web|title=Urthboy 6 Sept|url=http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/urthboy|website=Brisbane Festival 2014|publisher=Brisbane Festival|access-date=3 August 2014|date=3 August 2014}}</ref> and Melbourne Festivals,<ref>{{cite web|title=Urthboy Make Me A Mixtape|url=https://www.melbournefestival.com.au/urthboy#.U93aWVb5lg0|website=Melbourne Festival|publisher=Melbourne Festival|access-date=3 August 2014|date=3 August 2014}}</ref> with [[Patience Hodgson]] ([[The Grates]]), Rival MC (Impossible Odds and [[Black Arm Band]]) and Bobby Flynn announced as collaborators for the Brisbane show.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Levinson|title=July 29|url=https://www.facebook.com/urthboy/photos/a.99562631479.118182.74668771479/10152503028401480/?type=1|website=Urthboy on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 August 2014|date=29 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Levinson|title=July 24|url=https://www.facebook.com/urthboy/photos/a.10151821525756480.1073741827.74668771479/10152491032616480/?type=1|website=Urthboy on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 August 2014|date=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Levinson|title=July 23|url=https://www.facebook.com/urthboy/photos/a.99562631479.118182.74668771479/10152488991336480/?type=1|website=Urthboy on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 August 2014|date=23 July 2014}}</ref>

==Political activism==
===Australian refugee policy===
In response to the 2013 [[Abbott Government]]'s refugee policy, titled "Operation Sovereign Borders", whereby asylum seekers arriving by boat are turned back by naval officers and an offshore processing centre—built on [[Manus Island]], Papua New Guinea in 2001—was reopened for offshore processing of asylum seekers, Levinson released a protest song in early March 2014.<ref name="Boy">{{cite news|title=Urthboy speaks up and sings out after Reza Barati death on Manus Island|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/urthboy-speaks-up-and-sings-out-after-reza-barati-death-on-manus-island-20140311-34k24.html|access-date=16 March 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 March 2014|author=Sarah Whyte}}</ref> In the week following the completion of the song, a 23-year-old Iranian national, [[Reza Berati]], was killed at the processing centre. Levinson explained to the media:

<blockquote>
I’d been writing a song about the extreme mismatch of our navy facing off against asylum seekers in ramshackle boats. The official silence and militaristic language. The paranoid obsession Australia has with asylum seekers. The billions we spend so we can turn our back. Then Manus Island happened and it clarified the purpose of the song, giving us a tragic consequence to a hopeless situation. Somewhere along the way we mangled our perception of success to be measured by how many boats have landed. This is hysteria. So many miles from the myth of the ‘fair go’.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listen: Urthboy – 'Don't Let It Go'|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/listen-urthboy-dont-let-it-go/|work=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|access-date=16 March 2014|author=Greg Moskovitch|date=9 March 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

Called "Don't Let It Go", the song was released with an accompanying online music video, directed by Australian filmmaker Dan Ilic, on 6 March 2014. The video uses news footage edited with footage of Levinson rapping with a set of headphones on his head, taking music from the song "Let It Go" by fellow Elefant Traks artist [[Sietta]]. Following the release of the material, Levinson stated: "We are talking about quite a popular policy, so a lot of these artists are worried about the bottom line and what their audience are going to think about them. A lot of the time there is this fear of standing up, and I wanted this song to be part of a call to get out there and speak more … We need artists to come out there and break ranks and stop the double speak."<ref name="Boy" />

===Palestine===
Levinson posted a photograph of himself and daughter Jetta Joanie marching in a Sydney protest against the Gaza bombings of mid-2014 on 3 August 2014. Levinson wrote: "Jetta representing for Palestine in Sydney today".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Levinson|title=August 3|url=https://www.facebook.com/urthboy/photos/a.10151821525756480.1073741827.74668771479/10152511178411480/?type=1|website=Urthboy on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 August 2014|date=3 August 2014}}</ref>
