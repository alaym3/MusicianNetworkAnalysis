'''Blood on the Dance Floor''' was an American [[electronic music]] group from [[Orlando, Florida]], formed in 2006. The group's longest-standing lineup, from 2009 to 2016, consisted of Jesus David Torres also known as Dahvie Vanity (born 1984) and Jayy Von Monroe (born 1991). The group released nine studio albums before breaking up in 2016 following Von Monroe's departure. It was reformed by Vanity the following year, initially with Fallon Vendetta. After Vendetta's departure, Vanity became the sole member of the group. Since 2019, Vanity has performed under the name Kawaii Monster and most recently the Most Vivid Nightmares.

== History ==

Around September 2006, Jesus David Torres,  also known as "Dahvie Vanity", on his 22nd birthday, started a trio called Love the Fashion with Christopher Mongillo and Rebecca Fugate. The group was originally a joke, which soon developed into Blood on the Dance Floor in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saturday: Blood on the Dance Floor |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/71432071/arizona-republic/ |work=Arizona Republic |date=June 18, 2016 |page=A22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gomez |first1=Adrian |title=Duo wants to unite world with music |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/71432420/albuquerque-journal/ |work=Albuquerque Journal |date=December 9, 2011 |page=52}}</ref> The group self-released their first album, ''Let's Start a Riot'', in April 2008.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Not being able to tour, Mongillo and Fugate left the band while Vanity toured the [[Orlando, Florida]] area.<ref name="studio">[http://criticstudio.com/interviews/blood-on-the-dance-floor/ Exclusive Interview: Blood On The Dance Floor]. Critic Studio (January 26, 2012). Retrieved on October 21, 2015.</ref>

During the recording of their second album, ''It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World'', Mongillo and Fugate left, and the band was picked up by producer and writer Rusty Wilmot.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} During the recording of this album, Garrett Marshal McLaughlin ("Garrett Ecstasy") was recruited to do backup vocals and screaming. The CD was self-released in October 2008. Only 300 copies were made.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Vanity and Ecstasy recorded the singles "Siq With a Q" and "Suicide Club" as a duo in 2008, and released three extended plays over the first half of 2009, ''I Scream I Scream'', ''OMFG Sneak Peak'', and ''Extended Play''.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The duo embarked on the OMFG Tour with other local bands Electric Valentine, Weston Buck, The Greenlight District, and The Crush in promotion of their upcoming album then titled ''OMFG''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

As the OMFG tour continued and concluded without Vanity, Ecstasy left the band after accusing Vanity of being a [[sexual predator]] and was replaced by Jeremy Brian Griffis, known by his stage name "Jayy Von Monroe". Along with Von Monroe, Vanity and the group's new drummer and rapper, Nick "Nasty" Wenzel, released "Horrifically Delicious".{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Many of the songs originally recorded with Ecstasy intended for the upcoming album ''OMFG'' were re-recorded with new vocals by Von Monroe. The previous concept of the ''OMFG'' album was scrapped, and rebranded as ''EPIC'', set for release in 2010. The band went on tour over spring and summer 2010 to promote the release of ''Epic''. With [[Jeffree Star]] they recorded three songs for that album. However, the collaboration was short-lived because during the ''Looking Hot & Dangerous Tour'', Star had accused Vanity of being a pedophile and a predator, claiming to have witnessed questionable behavior. Star later chose to go back on his accusations and sweep what he claimed to have seen under the rug. He was then featured on their 2014 single "Poison Apple", from the album ''Bitchcraft''.<ref name="fight">{{Cite web |title=Jeffree Star and BOTDF at war |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1872142 |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> As with the previous conflict with Garrett, the three singles featuring Jeffree's vocals were re-recorded with vocals by Von Monroe, and the original tracks were not featured on the final album.

In October 2010, the album ''[[Epic (Blood on the Dance Floor album)|Epic]]'' charted No. 5 on the dance/electronic [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]].<ref name="amg" /> The band headlined the Epic Tour and the Epic Tour Part II in support of the album.<ref>[http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html The Epic Tour!!! – Top Spot USA – September 29th 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222194910/http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html |date=February 22, 2014 }}. Top Spot USA (September 29, 2010). Retrieved on October 21, 2015.</ref>

Even before the release of ''Epic'', recording began for Blood on the Dance Floor's fourth album, ''[[All the Rage!!]]''. The duo collaborated with several artists for the album, including Lady Nogrady, JJ Demon, and Nick Nasty. The album was preceded by several singles to promote the release, including "Bewitched", "Yo Ho", and "P.L.U.R." The band embarked on [[Warped Tour 2011]] in June 2011,<ref name="warped">{{Cite web |title=Vans Warped Tour / Bands / June 16th – August 5th / Tickets On Sale Now / Blood on the Dance Floor |url=http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |publisher=Vanswarpedtour.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805020200/http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> and released the album while on tour.

A music video for their hit single from the album, "Bewitched", featured Nicole "Lady" Nogrady, who later said that she felt disrespected by the band during production of the album as well as on the music video, and found herself having to confront the band directly in order for her name to appear on the credits of her work with them.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lady Nogrady Speaks Out |url=http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |date=July 2012 |publisher=Lemonade Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215045345/http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |archive-date=February 15, 2013}}</ref> The song was subsequently performed by other female vocalists in place of Nogrady at live shows, and was re-recorded with vocals by Haley Rose for their 2013 acoustic album ''Blood Unplugged''.

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums chart.<ref name="amg" /> At the end of 2011, the duo headlined the All the Rage Tour and was planning the 'Tis the Season to be Killing Tour.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blood on the Dance Floor:.
