===Formation and early years (2005–2011)===
In August 2005, high school classmates Sean Zelda, Dave Stephens (born 1988), Jonny Nabors, Mark Myatt and Joshua Moore (born 1989) formed a band called "This Emergency." During the beginning years, current vocalist Dave Stephens performed the guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals. They performed various shows throughout the metro Detroit area. In November 2005, the band parted ways with bass player Jonny Nabors and replaced him with Sean Daly. In June 2006, Zelda quit to pursue education at the University of Michigan. In the summer of 2006, a close friend of the band and another high school classmate, Larry Clark, officially joined on vocals and changed their name to We Came as Romans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/This+Emergency|title=This Emergency|website=Last.fm|date=November 21, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref> After Clark left in late 2007, the band added Chris Moore as the new singer. According to Dave Stephens, during this time, two songs entitled "Mouth to Mouth" and the original version of "Colours" were released with Larry Clark as the vocalist.

He sees himself at his darkest in the first video, trying endlessly to find his way out. After going through a traumatic experience, he finds his way out and his eyes begin to open to a new journey of finding out what really makes him feel alive. Through this journey the man traces back to his childhood house, where it all began. Overwhelming feelings wash over him as he remembers the feeling he once had long ago. Now, with a sense of purpose, he embarks back into the world to take the path he should have taken long ago".
