== Career ==
At the age of ten, Ender started rapping after being influenced by the German-Turkish rap group [[Cartel (rap group)|Cartel]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Demirci | first = Ferdi | title = Bir insanın kaderi bir ulusun kaderini değiştirir | url = http://www.yazete.com/genc-kalemler/ferdi-demirci/bir-insanin-kaderi-bir-ulusun-kaderini-degistirir/457/ | publisher = Yazete | access-date = 17 May 2013 | date = 13 April 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150927175305/http://www.yazete.com/genc-kalemler/ferdi-demirci/bir-insanin-kaderi-bir-ulusun-kaderini-degistirir/457/ | archive-date = 27 September 2015}}</ref> After dropping out of school, he started rapping in 2001 and then attended the music contest Akademi Türkiye broadcast by [[ATV (Turkey)|atv]] television channel.

Initially asked to sing pop music in the Akademi Turkiye contest, Ender refused to comply with the competition's request. Eventually, the Akademi introduced a rap course into its programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Norm Ender ft.

Ender began a group with Erman Altınoğlu, known as Ender & Erman or Erman & Ender. After completing his military service, in 2010 Ender made a solo rap album called ''Inside Patlar''.<ref name="asir2">{{cite web|title="Rap müzik dinleyenlerin beyni daha hızlı çalışıyor"|url=http://www.yeniasir.com.tr/Sarmasik/2010/12/17/rap_muzik_dinleyenlerin_beyni_daha_hizli_calisiyor|publisher=yeniasir|access-date=17 May 2013|date=16 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530041226/http://www.yeniasir.com.tr/sarmasik/2010/12/17/rap_muzik_dinleyenlerin_beyni_daha_hizli_calisiyor|archive-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> In 2012, he announced that he would release a new album. He gave concerts in İzmir, Diyarbakır and Ankara to promote this album and started using the stage name Norm Ender for his solo releases.

Ender became known on social media for his song "Eksik Etek". This song received about 40 million plays on YouTube in one month, making him the 17th most listened to Turkish artist of 2006.<ref name="asir2"/>

After a 5-year break from music, in 2016 Ender announced a new album under the EMI-Universal Music Turkey label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/emimusicturkey/status/683983515646582784|access-date=17 January 2016|title=Türkçe Rap müziğin öncülerinden Norm Ender'in yeni albümü, EMI – Universal Müzik Türkiye etiketiyle geliyor!|publisher=Twitter|date=4 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604174805/https://twitter.com/emimusicturkey/status/683983515646582784|archive-date=4 June 2016}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019, Ender returned with the track "Mekanın Sahibi" (Owner of the Venue), which satirised the Turkish rap scene and specifically took aim at rappers like [[Ezhel]] and [[Ben Fero]], calling them 'babies', and featuring a chorus that aimed to establish Ender's dominance over newer and younger rappers: "The owner of the venue is back, let's take the babies off the track".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/onur-basturk/norm-enderin-bebeler-ve-pozitifle-polemigi-41280439|title=Norm Ender's 'babies' and the Positive Polemic|last=Baştürk|first=Onur|date=22 July 2019|work=Hürriyet Daily News|access-date=22 July 2019}}</ref> In November 2019, the song was taken down by [[Spotify]] due to alleged copyright violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnnturk.com/magazin/norm-enderin-mekanin-sahibi-sarkisi-spotfydan-kaldirildi-rap-dunyasi-karisti|title=Norm Ender'in 'Mekanın Sahibi' şarkısı Spotify'dan kaldırıldı rap dünyası karıştı|publisher=CNN Türk|date=5 November 2019|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref> The song was again restored on Spotify in the same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/cadde/galeri/cok-konusulmustu-norm-ender-geri-dondu-6077878/2|title=Çok konuşulmuştu!
