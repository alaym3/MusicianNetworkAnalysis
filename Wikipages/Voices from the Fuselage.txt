Voices from the Fuselage starting writing original material in 2011 and went on to release their first single 'Out Of Hand' on SoundCloud,<ref>{{Citation|title=Out Of Hand|url=https://soundcloud.com/voices-from-the-fuselage/out-of-hand|language=en|access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> which was written during a class in college. The band continued writing original music in-between classes, eventually releasing 'Everything Begins With Choice'.<ref>{{Citation|title=Everything Begins With Choice|url=https://soundcloud.com/voices-from-the-fuselage/everything-begins-with|language=en|access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> These first two songs were well received by fellow college musicians and the wider music scene in Northampton, which inspired the band to start writing their debut EP 'To Hope'.

'To Hope' was originally written as a short-length concept EP with repeating themes and motifs throughout. The EP was demoed in the summer of 2011 at drummer Scott Lockhart's house and eventually recorded by 'Timfy James' at Core Studios in Milton Keynes in October 2011. The EP was much heavier than the previous releases and quickly gained the attention of the 'djent' scene online.

After the release of the EP, the band went on to play shows around the UK supporting band such as Textures, The Safety Fire and Hacktivist.

The album was completed in May 2015.
