== Biography ==

=== Beginnings, first crews and ''Non dormire'' (1996–2005) ===
As a teenager he began playing basketball and cultivating a passion for [[Nike (company)|Nike]] and graffiti so he joined the TBF crew and [[Savage Boys]]. He began his career in a [[grindcore]] group together with [[Metal Carter]], but soon realized that his path was that of [[hip-hop]]. He entered the world of [[rap]] at 19 in the crew Erreaccanegativo, founded by Darko Fetz and Ricky Jd. They released their first album ''Calma apparente'' in 1996, but Noyz did not take part in it as he left the crew.  Later in 2000 he worked with Truceboys in the creation of their first EP. He then joined the Roman crew on a permanent basis, contributing to the creation and release of the album ''Sangue'' in 2003. The next period, in which the members of the group took on solo careers after the creation of the collective [[Truceklan]], was very positive for Noyz. In July 2005 he released his first solo album entitled ''[[Non dormire]]'', disc of 16 tracks in which TruceBoys worked together with other artists of the Roman scene.

=== ''La calda notte'' with Chicoria and ''Verano zombie'' (2006–2007) ===
Shortly after, Noyz Narcos collaborated with Chicoria (from the project In The Panchine) and they published together ''[[La calda notte (album)|La calda notte]]'' in October 2006. The album, released by Traffik Records, consisted of a CD containing 13 tracks with collaborations with Truceklan artists and a DVD containing live performances of Truceklan. A music video was never broadcast on TV for its explicitly pornographic content.

In 2007 Noyz Narcos published ''[[Verano zombie]]'', an album in which the instrumental sounds of ''[[Non dormire]]'' are set aside to move to the equally aggressive beat, but not array of guitar. In the album [[Metal Carter]], [[Gel (rapper)|Gel]], [[Cole (rapper)|Cole]], [[Mystic One]], [[Duke Montana]], [[Chicoria]], collaborated with members of the [[Truceklan]], [[Danno (rapper)|Danno]] from [[Colle Der Fomento]], [[Gue Pequeno]], [[Marracash]] and [[Vincenzo da Via Anfossi]] of [[Dogo Gang]]. In the same year, together with representatives of [[Truceklan]] and [[Hawk Nelson]] Noyz played a part in ''Mucchio selvaggio'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rockit.it/news/8881/miss-violetta-attrice-porno-con-i-club-dogo|title= Miss Violetta attrice porno con i Club Dogo}}</ref> a porn film that has become a cult for fans of Hip Hop.

=== ''Ministero dell'inferno'' and the collaboration with DJ Gengis (2008–2009) ===
The Ministero dell'inferno<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockit.it/news/10880/i-truceklan-presentano-il-disco-a-milano|title=Il Truceklan presenta il suo disco}}</ref> collection was released in March 2008, starring the [[TruceKlan]] supported by several well-known names of the Italian hip hop scene like [[Club Dogo]], [[Kaos One]], Santo Trafficante, [[Fabri Fibra]], Gente de Borgata, [[Danno (rapper)|Danno]] from [[Colle Der Fomento]], and names totally detached from hip hop context: [[Cripple Bastards]], [[Miss Violetta Beauregarde]] and [[Pinta Facile]]. The atypical nature of the collaboration, the use of samples from the soundtracks of a certain genre film, the dark atmospheres and the dark beats, lyrics focusing exclusively on existential malaise, urban decay, horrific imagery, faced with cruelty, cynicism and total disenchantment wanted to be a breaking point compared to all the Italian rap compilations released until then. The production of the beats was headed by Lou Chano, Fuzzy, Rough, [[Don Joe]], Noyz Narcos, C.U.N.S., Giordy Beat, [[DJ Gengis Khan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockit.it/recensione/8259/truceklan-il-ministero-dellinferno|title=Recensione Ministero dell'inferno}}</ref> In addition, he starred with [[Chicoria]], [[Duke Montana]] and Cole in the short film ''Ganja Fiction''.

In the same year the mixtape ''[[The Best Out Mixtape]]'' was released, produced by DJ Genghis Khan. The album saw the participation of many Italian MC and was a great success so as to make it necessary to build a [[The Best Out Mixtape Vol. 2|second volume]], issued in June 2009.

=== ''Guilty'' and B.B.C. with Metal Carter and Duke Montana (2009–2011) ===
On the morning of September 18, 2009 during a drug raid called ''La calda notte'' Noyz Narcos was detained without being arrested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockit.it/recensione/8259/truceklan-il-ministero-dellinferno|title=Recensione Ministero dell'inferno}}</ref>

In 2011, Noyz Narcos, [[Metal Carter]] and [[Duke Montana]] founded the BBC (an acronym for "Black Bandana Click"). The first project was supposed to be the album ''Klan Related'', but after the publication of the video of [[Metal Carter]] (''Undead''), [[Duke Montana]] (''Anthem'') and Noyz Narcos (''Drag You to Hell'') the project failed due to disagreements between Noyz and Duke and the three tracks are collected in the EP ''[[BBC Project Single]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockit.it/news/14309/noyz-narcos-apre-per-public-enemy-e-cypress-hill|title=Noyz Narcos lancia il suo nuovo video Drag you to hell }}</ref>
