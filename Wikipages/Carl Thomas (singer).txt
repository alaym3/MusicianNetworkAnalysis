==Biography==
Thomas was born in Aurora, Illinois<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carl-thomas-mn0000169818/biography|title=Carl Thomas {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> and attended [[East Aurora High School]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/opinion/ct-abn-crosby-carl-thomas-st-1125-20161125-column.html|title=R&B star and Aurora native to perform hometown 'unity concert'|last=Crosby|first=Denise|work=Aurora Beacon-News|access-date=May 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> He sang around Chicago and became a member of The Fourmula. He branched out, however, and traveled to New York City, where he sang at clubs during open-mic nights. One such performance caught the eye of [[Sean "Puffy" Combs]], who signed Thomas to [[Bad Boy Entertainment]] in 1997.<ref name=":0" />

==Career==
With the single "[[I Wish (Carl Thomas song)|I Wish]]" released in late 1999, topping the R&B charts for six consecutive weeks, creating strong interest. ''[[Emotional (Carl Thomas album)|Emotional]]'', his debut album was released on April 18, 2000. On the strength of this single, and the album's other singles, "Summer Rain" at No. 18, which also appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film version of ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'', and the title track "Emotional" at No. 8 on the R&B charts, the album was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]] with over 1 million in sales. Later rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s "[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]" interpolated Thomas' "I Wish" on his 2000 album ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]''. He sung in the track "Everyday" on [[The Understanding (Memphis Bleek album)|The Understanding]].

His second album, ''[[Let's Talk About It]]'', was released on March 23, 2004. Although two singles – "She Is" and "[[Let's Talk About It]]" – were released, they charted poorly. Lack of promotion caused by the death of Thomas's brother Duranthony Evans, who was killed in a drive-by on Halloween night on [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora's]] east side was a contributing factor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/chi-aurora-slaying_both_18jun18,0,7000116.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=baltimoresun.com |access-date=June 21, 2013}}</ref> This devastated Thomas, causing him to take a sabbatical from his music and the promotion of the album.
The album was highly anticipated due to the length of time that had passed since ''Emotional'' but was not well received by fans. In 2005, Thomas was featured on R&B singer [[Amerie]]'s second album ''[[Touch (Amerie album)|Touch]]'', on the ninth track, entitled "Can We Go".

On the 2006 [[2Pac]] album ''[[Pac's Life]]'', he was featured beside [[Hussein Fatal]] and [[Papoose (rapper)|Papoose]] on the track "Dumpin'".

On December 7, 2006, Thomas earned a Grammy Award nomination, along with [[Chaka Khan]], [[Yolanda Adams]], and the late [[Gerald Levert]], for "Everyday (Family Reunion)", a song from the soundtrack of [[Tyler Perry]]'s ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]''. The song received a nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocals.

His third album, ''[[So Much Better (album)|So Much Better]]'', was released May 30, 2007, and reached number 25 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>Katie Hasty, [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051559/t-pain-soars-to-no-1-ahead-of-rihanna-mccartney "T-Pain Soars To No. 1 Ahead Of Rihanna, McCartney"], ''Billboard'', June 13, 2007.</ref>

His last contract was with [[Verve Music Group]]. Thomas' last album entitled ''Conquer'' was released on December 6, 2011. The first single was "Don't Kiss Me", which featured [[Snoop Dogg]] and was written and produced by [[Rico Love]].

== Personal life ==
In 2004, Thomas' brother was killed in a drive-by shooting shortly before ''Let's Talk About It'' came out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/features/carl-thomas-explains-why-he-turned-down-tv-one-s-unsung-YDbFTaQGWkS210ZwtEAI5A/|title=Carl Thomas Explains Why He Turned Down TV One's "Unsung"|website=AllHipHop.com|language=en|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> His brother was a corrections officer at the Illinois Youth Center in St. Charles before his death.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-01-02-0501020342-story.html|title=R&B singer tells of pain from loss|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> The singer cancelled his tour to deal with his brother's death<ref name=":0" /> and his record label established the Duranthony Evans Foundation in his memory.<ref name=":1" /> In 2019, Thomas underwent a surgical procedure to remove a noncancerous tumor in his salivary glands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thejasminebrand.com/2019/07/02/exclusive-singer-carl-thomas-undergoes-surgery-to-remove-tumor/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Singer Carl Thomas Undergoes Surgery To Remove Non-Cancerous Tumor.
