==History==
Saba is the most well-known rapper in the group, and is known as the front-man of Pivot Gang. All of the group's music can be downloaded for free online, which is one of the main effects of the growing independent music movement happening in present-day Chicago. Most of the music made by the group has a diverse sound, ranging from smooth soulful samples to more aggressive, rapid drill beats. MFnMelo explains in an interview with the Chicagoist, "a lot of the Pivot shit has that smooth kind of chord tradition that's influenced by New York soul, but it will just go harder. I'll put some drill drums over it. Some of my music has that same creative process, but a lot of it goes into a soulful, hip-hop-y route".<ref name="chicagoist">{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2013/10/02/interview_pivot_gang_keeping_it_the.php|title=Interview: Pivot Gang&mdash;Keeping It In The Family: Chicagoist|publisher=chicagoist.com|accessdate=2015-04-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004050214/http://chicagoist.com/2013/10/02/interview_pivot_gang_keeping_it_the.php|archivedate=2013-10-04}}</ref> The group has released a mixtape titled ''JIMMY'' on October 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pivot Gang – JIMMY [Mixtape + Download] |url=https://earmilk.com/2013/10/16/pivot-gang-jimmy-mixtape-download/ |website=EarMilk}}</ref>
