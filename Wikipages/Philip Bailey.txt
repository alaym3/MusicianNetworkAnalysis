[[Michael Eric Dyson]] of [[Rolling Stone]] stated "In the hands of a lesser talent, some of these songs might barely seep through the cracks, less than memorable fare conjured up to please a legend.

While that alone doesn't compensate for some of the just-OK stuff he has to work with, it delights nonetheless."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/220145350|title=Recordings -- Philip Bailey by Philip Bailey|author=Eric Dyson, Michael|author-link=Michael Eric Dyson|issue=691|page=97|date=September 22, 1994|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|website=proquest.com|id={{ProQuest|220145350}}}}</ref>
