==Life and career==
Born of [[Croats|Croatian]] immigrants in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], at age 11 he was signed by [[Warner Brothers]] Pictures, to be a child star, and  performed on the [[radio]] on [[KFWB]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. After leaving school, he worked as a [[horse tack|saddle]]maker, supplementing his income by singing. Dude Martin, who had a [[country music]] broadcast in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], hired him for his band.

Mitchell served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years in World War II, then sang with [[Carmen Cavallaro]]'s [[big band]]. In 1947 he recorded for [[Decca Records|Decca]] with Cavallaro's band, but left due to [[food poisoning]]. He went next to [[New York, New York|New York City]] and made records for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] as Al Grant (one, "Cabaret", appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' in 1949 as a soloist.<ref>Obituary, ''New York Times'', July 5, 1999.</ref>

[[Mitch Miller]], in charge of talent at [[Columbia Records]], noticed Cernik in 1950. He joined Columbia and took his new stage name at Miller's urging: Miller supposedly said, "my name is 'Mitchell' and you seem a nice 'guy', so we'll call you Guy Mitchell." [[Bob Merrill]] wrote hits for Mitchell.<ref>Obituary for Bob Merrill, ''[[The Independent]]''; February 20, 1998.</ref> In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as ''[[Those Redheads From Seattle]]'' (1953) and ''[[Red Garters (film)|Red Garters]]'' (1954). He appeared in "Choose a Victim", a 1961 episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]''.  In 1990 he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series [[Your Cheatin' Heart (TV series)|Your Cheatin’ Heart]] as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O’May, singing several standards including his own hit "[[Singing the Blues]]".

His first hit was "[[My Heart Cries for You]]" (1951). Other hits included "[[Heartaches by the Number]]", "[[Rock-a-Billy (song)|Rock-a-Billy]]" (a crossover into the rock and roll field), "[[The Same Old Me]]", and his biggest hit, "[[Singing the Blues]]", which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956.<ref>Obituary, ''The Guardian'', July 5, 1999.</ref>
