'''''Epic Rap Battles of History''''' ('''ERB''') is a [[YouTube]] [[web series]] and music project created by [[Peter Shukoff|Peter "Nice Peter" Shukoff]] and [[Lloyd Ahlquist|Lloyd "EpicLLOYD" Ahlquist]]. The series pits [[Historical figure|historical]] and [[pop culture]] figures against one another in a [[rap battle]] format. The characters portrayed are often determined by suggestions from viewers in the comments sections of the channel's videos. Shukoff and Ahlquist write each song themselves, researching the subject in order to find obscure details to use as references in the lyrics.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|author=Michael Humphrey|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2011/10/26/epic-rap-battles-of-history-talking-brash-wit-with-a-youtube-hit/|title=Epic Rap Battles of History: Talking Brash Wit With A YouTube Hit|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=October 26, 2011|access-date=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Inverse>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/38430-epic-rap-battles-season-6-youtube-trump-nazis|title=The Dudes Behind 'Epic Rap Battles of History' Eye an Uncertain Future|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2017|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> As of March 26, 2021, the channel has 14.8 million subscribers and approximately 3.7 billion total video views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsheep.com/ERB|title=ERB YouTube channel statistics - StatSheep|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> Following an extended hiatus, the channel returned with a bonus battle in December 2018, and the sixth season debuted on April 20, 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERBofHistory/status/1071117277238571008|title=ERB Season 6 Billionaire Bonus Battle is HERE like a Boolean value of 1|date=December 7, 2018|website=@ERBofHistory|language=en|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> and the seventh season debuted on June 14, 2021.

Although early episodes of the series featured only Shukoff and Ahlquist, later episodes have regularly featured guest appearances, and other internet celebrities such as [[Dan Bull]], [[Lisa Donovan]], [[Traphik|Timothy DeLaGhetto]], [[George Watsky]], [[DeStorm|DeStorm Power]], [[Jesse Wellens]], [[PewDiePie]], [[Jenna Marbles]], [[Lilly Singh]], [[Ray William Johnson]], [[Rhett and Link]], and [[Smosh]]. Media celebrities like rappers [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Chali 2na]], and [[T-Pain]], singers [[Jackie Tohn]] and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], actors [[J.B. Smoove]] and [[Gary Anthony Williams]], and the comedy duo [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]] have also appeared in the series.

On July 3, 2013, "[[Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney (video)|Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney]]" became the first of its singles to be [[RIAA certification|certified Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the United States. 10 other singles, "[[Adolf Hitler]] vs. [[Darth Vader]]", "[[Einstein vs. Stephen Hawking (music video)|Albert Einstein vs. Stephen Hawking]]", "[[Dr. Seuss]] vs. [[William Shakespeare]]", "[[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] vs. [[Leonidas]]", "[[Steve Jobs]] vs. [[Bill Gates]]", "[[Justin Bieber]] vs. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]", "[[Mario Brothers]] vs. [[Wright Brothers]]", "[[Mr. T]] vs. [[Mr. Rogers]]", "[[Abraham Lincoln|Abe Lincoln]] vs. [[Chuck Norris]]", and "Hitler vs. Vader 2", were subsequently certified Gold as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Epic+Rap+Battles+of+History%22 |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - Epic Rap Battles of History |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |date=December 30, 2014 |access-date=December 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104181412/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Epic+Rap+Battles+of+History%22 |archive-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref>

The idea for historical figures rapping against each other was conceived by Ahlquist, who pitched the idea to Shukoff as an [[improvisational theatre|improvised show]] titled "''Check OneTwo''"; both were working in improv at the time along with [[Zach Sherwin]], who would later become a regular guest on the series.<ref name=Forbes/> They were met with high levels of difficulty at first and decided that the concept would fare much better as a YouTube series than an improv show.<ref name=Inverse/> The first three rap battles were each shot on a $50 budget.<ref name="Peter states that first 3 battles cost approx $50">{{cite web|title=Peter states that first 3 battles cost approx $50|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjW9I6jo7bQ|publisher=YouTube|work=ERB2|access-date=December 23, 2013|at=1:25|format=YouTube video|date=February 16, 2013}}</ref>

Before the web series existed on YouTube, Shukoff and Ahlquist recorded their first song, which was a battle between ''[[Child's Play (film series)|Child's Play]]'' antagonist [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and actor [[Michael J. Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMZ8eKQeVo |title=The First Epic Rap Battle of History - Michael J. Fox vs Chucky |publisher=YouTube |date=February 19, 2012 |access-date=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The song was freestyle and poorly made; as a result, it was not released to the public.

On September 26, 2010, the first rap battle was uploaded to YouTube, featuring Shukoff as [[John Lennon]] and Ahlquist as [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]].<ref name=Inverse/><ref name=NYtimes2013>{{cite news|author=Leslie Kaufman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/arts/television/epic-rap-battles-seeks-staying-power-on-youtube.html?_r=0|title=Making Silly Showdowns for YouTube|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 29, 2013|access-date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

The 15th episode, "Nice Peter vs EpicLLOYD", marked the end of the first season. This battle pitted Ahlquist and Shukoff against each other with cameos from all of the characters they had played over the 14 prior episodes. At the end of the battle, [[KassemG]] arrives and convinces Peter and Lloyd to continue the battles on their own channel. ''Epic Rap Battles of History'' later returned on December 8, 2011, hosted on their new channel (moving from Shukoff's personal channel), ''ERB'', with behind-the-scenes videos on their second channel, ''ERB2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegenews.com/article/video_epic_rap_battles_of_history_hitler_vs_vader|title=College News grades Epic Rap Battles of History Season 2|publisher=College News|date=December 14, 2011|access-date=December 15, 2011}}</ref> Shukoff and Maker Studios also created the official website for the series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epicrapbattlesofhistory.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129065855/http://epicrapbattlesofhistory.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 29, 2011|title=Epic Rap Battles of History|publisher=Epic Rap Battles of History|access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref> where fans could vote on winners for each video, and read short comical autobiographies by each character.

On September 27, 2012, following a four-month pause after the "[[Steve Jobs]] vs. [[Bill Gates]]" episode, a video was released on the series' YouTube channel where Ahlquist (voicing to an animation of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) announced that new episodes would be released every two weeks until the Christmas holidays,<ref>{{cite web|author=Sam Gutelle|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2012/10/02/epic-rap-battles-of-history-return/|title='Epic Rap Battles' Returns, Will Post 6 Episodes Over Next 3 Months|publisher=Tubefiler|date=October 2, 2012|access-date=December 30, 2014}}</ref> starting with the 22nd episode "[[Frank Sinatra]] vs. [[Freddie Mercury]]" (aired on October 1, 2012).<ref name=IDT>{{cite web|author=Daniel Perez |url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/11585/20121002/epic-rap-battles-pits-queens-freddy-mercury.htm |title='Epic Rap Battles' Pits Queen's Freddy Mercury vs Frank Sinatra In Season 2 Premiere [VIDEO] |publisher=International Digital Times |date=October 2, 2012 |access-date=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130123732/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/11585/20121002/epic-rap-battles-pits-queens-freddy-mercury.htm |archive-date=November 30, 2012 }}</ref> "[[Moses]] vs. [[Santa Claus]]", aired on December 10, 2012, was the last battle before taking a break for the holidays.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Lloyd Ahlquist]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4BJzBwYUMA&list=UUMu5gPmKp5av0QCAajKTMhw&index=0&feature=plcp|title=Epic Rap Battles of History News with Theodore Roosevelt.|publisher=YouTube|work=Epic Rap Battles of History|date=September 27, 2012|access-date=October 9, 2012}}</ref>
