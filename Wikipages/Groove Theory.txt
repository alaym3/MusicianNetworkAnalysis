'''Groove Theory''' is an American duo, with former member, singer-songwriter [[Amel Larrieux]] and songwriter/producer/actor, [[Bryce Wilson]]. The group is best known for their 1995 hit "[[Tell Me (Groove Theory song)|Tell Me]]", which reached the top five of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]].

==Early years==
The group formed in New York City in 1993, when Amel Larrieux met Bryce Wilson while she was working at Rondor Music as a receptionist. Larrieux had been working at the music publishing company since the age of 18. A publisher at the company had signed Wilson as a producer, and knew he was interested in forming a group. He approached Larrieux, who he knew was a singer-songwriter, with one of Wilson's production tracks, saying "look, you wanna try writing a song? You know I can give you one of the tracks, and you can do it, and if you don't mind, you can demo it."{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Wilson hoped to use the group as a chance to utilize his production talents, while Larrieux wanted a chance to shine in R&B. Wilson also found it useful for Larrieux to both write, sing, and arrange each song instead of shopping around for different singers and songwriters.<ref>[http://blog.nu-soulmag.com/?p=1147 Blog.nu-soulmag.com]</ref>

==Career==

===Commercial success===
The group signed a recording contract with [[Epic Records]], and in 1995, they released their self-titled debut album ''[[Groove Theory (album)|Groove Theory]]''. The album featured the [[music recording sales certification|gold-selling]] [[hit single]], "[[Tell Me (Groove Theory song)|Tell Me]]", which reached number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]. "Tell Me" peaked at No. 31 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in November 1995.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

===Break up===
Larrieux left Groove Theory in 1999 to pursue a solo career, being replaced by Makeda Davis. The group signed with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded a new album, 'The Answer', which was expected for release in 2000. Displeased with Columbia's track record at the time with urban projects, Wilson asked for a release from the label, causing the album to remain unreleased. A single entitled "4 Shure" was released from the album to minor chart performance.

Larrieux began her solo career in her absence from the group, forming her own [[independent record label]], Blisslife, to distribute her music. Wilson appeared in the films ''[[Beauty Shop]],'' ''Trois'' and ''Hair Show,'' and produced music for [[Beyoncé]], [[Amerie]] and [[Mary J. Blige]].<ref>[http://www.bvbuzz.com/2010/02/10/groove-theory-bryce-wilson-amel-larrieux/ Bvbuzz.com]</ref>
