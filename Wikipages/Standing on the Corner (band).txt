'''Standing on the Corner''' is an American [[avant-garde music]] collective led by the [[Nuyorican]] musician known professionally as '''Gio Escobar'''. Emerging from the [[New York City|New York]] underground art and music scene, they have been referred to as a [[post-rock|post]]-genre [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] and praised for their use and blends of different sounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/meet-standing-on-the-corner-the-post-genre-crew-whose-music-speaks-a-secret-language/|title=Meet Standing on the Corner, the Post-Genre Crew Whose Music Speaks a Secret Language|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>

==History==

In 2014, Gio Escobar formed a guitar-based live group called Children of the Corner; the name was an homage to [[Harlem]] rap collective [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]]. This project later evolved into Standing on the Corner. Escobar wrote several tape machine-recorded songs that were not initially intended for release.<ref name="thefader.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/09/21/standing-on-the-corner-interview-red-burns|title=How Standing On The Corner created a visceral snapshot of New York life|website=The FADER}}</ref> Later Escobar brought some of those same demos he was working on to producer Jasper Marsalis, better known as Slauson Malone, who helped refine them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/meet-standing-on-the-corner-the-post-genre-crew-whose-music-speaks-a-secret-language/|title=Meet Standing on the Corner, the Post-Genre Crew Whose Music Speaks a Secret Language|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> Work on those songs resulted in the band's 2016 self-titled debut.<ref name="thefader.com"/>

In 2017, Standing on the Corner released their second album ''[[Red Burns (album)|Red Burns]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Soon after the release of ''Red Burns'', Slauson Malone quietly left the group due to ideological differences and in order to work on solo material.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-05-24|title=Rap Monthly: Slauson Malone Smiles at the Past, Plus Rico Nasty, Kevin Abstract, and More|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/05/slauson-malone-interview-rico-nasty-kevin-abstract-reviews/|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Spin}}</ref>

In 2019, they contributed to [[Solange Knowles|Solange's]] album [[When I Get Home (album)|''When I Get Home'']], with production and writing credits on the songs "S McGregor (interlude)", "Can I Hold the Mic (interlude)", "Down With the Clique", "Nothing Without Intention (interlude)", and "Exit Scott (interlude)".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Solange (2) - When I Get Home|url=https://www.discogs.com/Solange-When-I-Get-Home/release/13834233|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref> After their contributions to Solange's project, multi-instrumentalist Caleb Giles announced he was leaving the group on good terms to focus on his solo rap career.

Also in 2019, they have production credits for [[Danny Brown|Danny Brown's]] album ''[[U Know What I'm Sayin?|uknowhatimsayin¿]]'' for the track "Shine", on which Slauson Malone was also credited; however this is mostly as a result of reusing old material rather than a new collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Danny Brown (2) - uknowhatimsayin¿|url=https://www.discogs.com/Danny-Brown-uknowhatimsayin/release/14430614|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref>

On May 11, 2020, they released the video for their single "Angel", starring [[Melvin Van Peebles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/standing-on-the-corner-angel/|title="Angel" by Standing on the Corner|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=20 May 2020}}</ref> Peebles is a major influence towards their whole catalog, having sampled him multiple times and implementing [[spoken word]] passages into their record in a similar vein to Peebles' own albums.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet Standing on the Corner, the Post-Genre Crew Whose Music Speaks a Secret Language|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/meet-standing-on-the-corner-the-post-genre-crew-whose-music-speaks-a-secret-language/|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>
