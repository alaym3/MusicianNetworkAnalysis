Corby was musical from a young age. Recognising his talent, Corby's school principal encouraged him to sing at a school assembly where he performed a song from [[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit|Sister Act 2.]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sehmar|first=Paras|date=2019-02-15|title=Matt Corby // Interview {{!}} LONDON IN STEREO|url=https://www.londoninstereo.com/matt-corby-interview/|access-date=2021-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref> A six year old Corby asked his father for a guitar.

Along the way his talents were shaped by experiences both mundane and quite remarkable: touring with a church band called [[Iron and Clay]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stawelltimes.com.au/story/221385/iron-and-clay-to-perform-in-stawell/|title=Iron and Clay to perform in Stawell|date=1 March 2012|work=The Stawell Times-News|access-date=26 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> a stint working in Subway, music scholarships, support slots and talent shows; until by his late teens he found himself burned out, bewildered and unsure just where to take his music next.<ref name=":0" />

It took a trip to London, shortly after his 18th birthday, to begin his path back to creative contentment. Playing low-key shows and falling in love with music again, it was there that he would meet with label [[Communion Music|Communion]] (home to the likes of [[Ben Howard]], Marcus Foster and [[The Staves]]) and find himself encouraged to learn the craft of songwriting, to understand the marriage between the force of his voice and the words it carries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/matt-corbys-down-to-earth-debut-ng-ya-100996|title=Matt Corby finally releases his debut album|date=1 March 2016|work=The West Australian|access-date=26 July 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Career==

===2007: ''Australian Idol''===
[[File:Photo by band member Jack Standen .jpg|alt=|thumb|Photo by band member Jack Standen]]
At age 16, Corby auditioned for the [[Australian Idol (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Australian Idol]]'', where he finished as runner-up. Corby was involved in a clash with a Sydney paparazzo at Bondi Beach which rattled him and his family.<ref name=":3" /> He described participating in the competition as being a "big fucking mistake,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/why-australian-idol-runnerup-matt-corby-is-glad-his-days-on-reality-tv-are-behind-him/news-story/7de94bc9281bf4555830df8063a5cc09|title=Why Australian Idol runner-up Matt Corby is glad his days on reality TV are behind him |newspaper=News.com.au — Australia's Leading News Site |date= 7 March 2016|access-date=21 May 2017|last1=McCabe |first1=Kathy }}</ref> describing how the struggle to forge his own identity post-idol was bigger than most could have seen from the outside. "I took all the negatives out of that (Idol) and thought 'Bugger, I've ruined everything'".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/matt-corby-says-going-australian-idol-big-fucking-mistake/|title=Matt Corby Says Going On Australian Idol Was A "Big Fucking Mistake" – Music Feeds|date=7 March 2016|work=Music Feeds|access-date=26 July 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

One aspect of [[Australian Idol]] that the media speculated about was the number of Christian musicians among the finalists. The media suggested that Christians were "stacking" the voting to keep "their" artists on the show.<ref name=":3" /> Corby rejected those suggestions by stating that he wasn't part of a big church and wasn't promoting himself as religious.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Matt Corby: Building Something Real|url=https://www.hopechannel.com/au/read/matt-corby-building-something-real|access-date=23 June 2021|website=HopeChannel|language=en}}</ref>

===2012: ''Into the Flame'' EP and "Brother"===
After a few months of writing, Corby spent September 2011 recording his third EP, ''[[Into the Flame]]'', with producer Tim Carr. The EP showcased a new direction for Corby, including [[Soul music|soul]]-influenced, growling vocals along with a [[Blues music|bluesy]] melody, in conjunction with Corby's signature folk style. The title song has been described as "lyrically raw and endearingly honest." The EP also features a duet with keyboardist Bree Tranter, previously a part of Australian band, [[The Middle East (band)|The Middle East]]. The EP provided Corby's first entry on the [[ARIA Charts]], where it reached No.&nbsp;46 on the ARIA Top&nbsp;50 Singles Chart on 4 December 2011.

[[File:Matt Corby (193603).jpg|thumb|Matt Corby performs at Piknik i Parken in Oslo in June 2016]]
On 1 October 2015, Corby released his first song in two years, "[[Monday (Matt Corby song)|Monday]]" from his debut album, ''[[Telluric (album)|Telluric]]''. The song was described as containing "lush, transcendent harmonies, wailing falsetto, folky boom-claps and heartbreaking lyrics." The song reportedly took 10 minutes to record, and was laid down in a cottage in the NSW coastal town of [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry]] where he wrote and recorded most of the album. Corby said to Matt and Alex of [[Triple J]]: "It's stomping on the ground and clapping. It feels good to have that as a composition in a weird way, it's just your voice and everyone who would maybe want to do a cover of that if they so wish, it'll always sound different because they'll have to harmonise with their own [voice]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4322989.htm|title=Matt Corby premieres new single 'Monday', announces national tour {{!}} Music News {{!}} triple j|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=26 September 2016}}</ref>

In February 2019, Matt released a mini-documentary ''Behind Rainbow Valley'' documenting the recording and creative process of the ''Rainbow Valle''y album. Speaking of the influence of his newborn son Hugh on the creation of the album, Corby states "I wanted to create something that was almost instructional for my little boy... A reference for him of the way I see reality and the simple truths that I’ve come across. The lyrics are simple truths. I’m not trying to be too clever or poetic. If anything it was, "This is the way I see the world and this is the way I feel about it".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusicnetwork.com/matt-corby-drops-doco-behind-making-of-rainbow-valley/|title=Matt Corby drops doco behind making of Rainbow Valley|date=1 February 2019|website=The Music Network|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Matt Corby crop.jpg|thumb|Corby performing at [[Easterfest]] 2008]]
Corby and his sister Grace, grew up in the Christian faith after their parents became Christian when Corby was two years old. Corby would sing in church and stated in 2008, “When I was 13, I started touring with a ministry team and we went around schools and churches, promoting Jesus and tackling depression issues and stuff like that. I did that for a couple of years. So I’ve sort of been in church my whole life and it’s been fun”.<ref name=":2" /> Going into Australian Idol, Corby wondered how his faith would fit in with the show, but stated that it made him self-reliant and brought him closer to God through his own personal drive into bible study.<ref name=":2" /> Corby headlined [[Easterfest]], a Christian music festival in 2008 and a [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong]] United convention.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=5 August 2011|title=Post-Worship Songs|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/rhythmdivine/post-worship-songs/4718096|access-date=2021-06-23|website=Radio National|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Hillsong Conference 2008- Matt Corby|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2omnSsDkoc0|language=en|access-date=23 June 2021}}</ref>

Although growing up as a strong Christian,<ref name=":2" /> Corby is no longer religious, but does understand the draw of a church for young families in particular to have a community connection and collective moral of kindness.<ref name=":1" />  Corby once stated "I'm a stoner and I don't really have much sympathy for religion any more, I basically believe that human beings are pure entities when they're born, and they have the ability to do whatever they want to change the Earth in a positive way. And it's just... they get lied to, and in the process of becoming an adult that ends up fucking up the world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/amen-brother-the-testament-of-matt-corby|title=Amen, Brother: The Testament of Matt Corby}}</ref>

By the time he was 20 he was reading books on philosophy and neuroscience, the latter because he wanted to know how the brain functions, partly because of his experiences with depression and anxiety. "People have said I have depression before, especially when I was younger," he offers. "People were like, you should really go see someone. But I just thought, no, I'm pretty sure the human brain is capable of so much more than what I'm being told I'm capable of. When people say you need help it's like, do I? With what? And if you could just tell me what I need help with, couldn't I just go and work on it myself?" His search for self led him to spiritual authors such as [[Eckhart Tolle]], and to experimenting with [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]]: "You take mushrooms and then you go, I have no problems," he explains.
