==Career==

===1980–2009: Early life and career===
Rittz was born in [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania|Waynesburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], on August 16, 1980, and moved with his family to the suburbs of [[Gwinnett County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], when he was eight years old.<ref name="hiphopdx1">{{cite web|last=Nguyen |first=Michael |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.2089/title.rittz-affirms-fuck-swag-stance-says-he-doesn-t-believe-in-selling-out |title=Rittz Affirms "Fuck Swag" Stance; Says He Doesn't Believe In Selling Out &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2013-04-30 |access-date=2013-05-05}}</ref><ref name="hiphopdx2">{{cite web|last=Company |first=The |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22040/title.rittz-ponders-why-he-isnt-mentioned-amongst-other-white-rappers-explains-two-atlantas |title=Rittz Ponders Why He Isn't Mentioned Amongst Other White Rappers, Explains "Two Atlantas |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-11-29 |access-date=2013-06-11}}</ref> His parents were intensely interested in [[rock and roll]], ensuring that he and his siblings were exposed to musical instruments and recording studios from a young age.<ref name="hiphopdx2"/>

Around 2003, after numerous disappointments, Rittz's musical career stalled. “I won Battlegrounds on Hot 107.9, got retired and shit and felt like I was ‘bout to make it. But, so many industry up and downs, with managers, contracts…” He was broke, feeling dejected, living with friends, and ready to resign from the rap game. However, in 2009 he was contacted by the rapper [[Yelawolf]], and this led to financial support. “I had some money behind me.” Rittz says, “Everything was going good and then everything fell out, at the same time, I’m getting older, thinking it’s time to hang it up. This isn’t gonna happen and that’s when Yelawolf put me on ‘Box Chevy.’”<ref name="hiphopdx2"/> Rittz stated in a 2013 interview that he had supported himself by working various "nine to five" jobs, such as in the restaurant industry. Rittz also went on to say that he would commonly tell people he was a rapper, even when he was not active.<ref name="hiphopdx1"/>
