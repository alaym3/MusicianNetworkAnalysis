==Biography==
Westside Connection began performing together in 1994, appearing on Mack 10's self-titled debut album, ''[[Mack 10 (album)|Mack 10]]'', on the song "[[Westside Slaughterhouse]]". A few months later, the group again joined forces, this time appearing on WC's album, ''[[Curb Servin']]'', on the song "West Up!". It was around this time the group began work on their debut album, ''[[Bow Down]]'', which was released October 22, 1996.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=365}}</ref>

Individually, Mack 10, WC and Ice Cube continued working on solo projects in between group albums. Together, as Westside Connection, they produced several songs released on film soundtracks and compilations including "Bangin'" (from ''[[West Coast Bad Boyz II]]''), "Let It Reign" (from ''[[Thicker than Water (soundtrack)|Thicker than Water]]'') and "It's the Holidaze" (from ''[[Friday After Next (soundtrack)|Friday After Next]]'').

On December 9, 2003, the group released their second album ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'', hallmarked by the lead single "[[Gangsta Nation]]" produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featuring [[Nate Dogg]].

Mack 10 quit the group in 2005 due to a conflict with WC, and Westside Connection subsequently disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/features/archive/2005/11/10/18133369.aspx|title=Mack 10 interview|website=AllHipHop.com|date=November 10, 2005|access-date=2007-10-23}}</ref> However, Ice Cube and WC continued to collaborate, having since appeared on each other's albums.

In 2008, [[HipHopDX]] reported that WC and Ice Cube were planning to relaunch the Westside Connection project, with [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] being proposed as Mack 10's replacement (having appeared with WC on Ice Cube's album ''[[Raw Footage]]'' that same year), however the rumored relaunch never came to fruition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.7316/title.dx-clusive-the-game-to-replace-mack-10-in-westside-connection-comeback|title=DX-clusive: The Game To Replace Mack 10 In Westside Connection Comeback|date=15 July 2008|website=Hiphopdx.com|access-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref> In an interview with [[VladTV]] in 2020, Mack 10 commented in retrospect that any reunion without his involvement would still require his being paid, as he owns the trademark on the group's name, due to their second album being released through his record label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbbd6ovxxU|title=Mack 10 on Ice Cube, Westside Connection, Common & Cypress Hill Beef, T-Boz (Full Interview)|access-date=June 30, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
