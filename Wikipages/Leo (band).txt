'''Leo''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[alternative rock]] band formed by Ian Eddy in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/leo-mn0002098564|title=Leo Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Eddy explained the name of the band by stating "I'm an Aries, and Leo is supposed to be my perfectly matched partner. I named the band Leo because music is my perfect partner." Leo originally consisted of Eddy on guitar and lead vocals, drummer Stephen Nicholson, lead guitarist Brandon Lozano, and bassist Dan Griffith. The band recorded several tracks in 2002 and began distributing demo CDs at live shows.<ref>[http://www.pitchperfectreviews.net/?p=659] {{dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref> Stephen Nichols left the band in 2004, and he was replaced on drums by [[Chad Szeliga]], formerly of the Cleveland based band [[Switched (band)|Switched]].

Eddy relocated the band from Cleveland to [[St. Peters, Missouri]] in late 2004. As a result of the move, the band experienced changes in their line-up. Bassist Rek Mohr and guitarist Brandon Lozano moved to St. Peters with Eddy. Drummer [[Chad Szeliga]] and bassist Dan Griffith left the band and remained in Ohio. Szeliga eventually went on to join [[Breaking Benjamin]] on drums in 2005. Lozano decided to leave Leo and return to Ohio just a couple days after relocating to the St. Louis area. Lozano went back to Ohio to form the band, Dozen Dead Roses with Griffith and ex-Signoffs guitarist Tim Long and drummer Kris Monroe. In order to fill the empty slots in Leo, Eddy convinced guitarist Michael Roberts and drummer Mark Grabowski from the Ohio based band Ivet to moved to Missouri to join Leo. Leo began recording their debut album at their home studio in 2006. Chad Szeliga had already recorded drums for several tracks before joining Breaking Benjamin in 2005, and he gave his permission to use the drum work on Leo's debut album. The band released their debut album ''Nightmares'' in 2007 on the Dream Makers Music label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/nightmares-mw0000749968|title=Nightmares - Leo &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://store.cdbaby.com/|title=CD Baby Music Store|website=Store.cdbaby.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/localbands/2007/11/local_cd_spotlight_leo_nightma.html|title=Local CD Spotlight: Leo - 'Nightmares'|date=November 9, 2007|website=Cleveland.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/coming-up-roses/Content?oid=1488686|title=Coming Up Roses|first=Jason|last=Bracelin|website=Clevescene.com}}</ref>

Leo has opened for [[Breaking Benjamin]], the [[Burden Brothers]], [[Sick Puppies]], and [[Greenwheel]]. The band also earned a spot in the 2007 [[Pointfest]] music festival, opening for Breaking Benjamin, [[Three Days Grace]], and [[Seether]].<ref name="auto"/><ref>[http://www.abc-pr.com/leo.htm] {{dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref>

Ian Eddy has now moved on to releasing solo work, although Roberts, Mohr, and Grabowski continue to support Eddy on guitar, bass, and drums for some tracks. Rek Mohr moved on to join that band [[Hurt (band)|Hurt]] in May 2008. Ian Eddy released ''The Storm'' EP in July 2010. Roberts, Mohr, and Grabowski performed in two of the six tracks on the EP. Also joining Eddy in recording ''The Storm'', were Evan Johns on drums, David Arato on strings, and Nathan Hershey on piano.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ianeddy.bandcamp.com/album/the-storm-2|title=The Storm, by Ian Eddy|website=Ianeddy.bandcamp.com}}</ref>

In 2013, Ian Eddy reformed Leo with Copperview members Pat Gibson and Dave Kopp, and St. Louis drummer Alex Rivera.
