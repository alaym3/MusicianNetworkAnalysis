'''Vanity Fare''' (often misspelled ''Vanity Fair'', due to the similarity of the [[Vanity Fair (novel)|novel]] and [[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|magazine]] title) are an English pop/rock group formed in 1966. They had the million-selling song, "[[Hitchin' a Ride (Vanity Fare song)|Hitchin' a Ride]]", which became a worldwide hit in 1970.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Career==
School friends Trevor Brice (born 12 February 1945, [[Rochester, Kent]], England) (vocals), Tony Goulden (born Anthony Goulden, 21 November 1942, Rochester) (guitar), Dick Allix (born Richard Allix, 3 May 1945, [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], Kent) (drums) and Tony Jarrett (born Anthony Jarrett, 4 September 1943, in Rochester, Kent) (bass) formed the band in Kent in 1966, originally calling themselves The Avengers. As The Avengers, they recorded a number of demos with record producer [[Joe Meek]], including "Marianne", though none were ever released. After this they changed their name to The Sages, and had one 45 single release on the RCA Victor label (47–8760) called "In The Beginning" on the "A" side and "I'm Not Going To Cry" on the "B" side. They played local [[nightclub|clubs]] and were spotted by entrepreneur Roger Easterby who became their manager and producer. Having changed the name of the band to Vanity Fare after the novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], they signed to Larry Page's [[Page One Records]].

Vanity Fare achieved a UK hit single with their first release, a [[cover version|cover]] of "I Live for the Sun" (originally [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] by [[The Sunrays]] in 1965) in the summer of 1968.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

Following two more singles, "Summer Morning" and "Highway of Dreams," both of which failed to make the [[UK Singles Chart]], they released their biggest UK hit, "[[Early in the Morning (Vanity Fare song)|Early in the Morning]]". Written by [[Mike Leander]] and Eddie Seago, it reached number 8 in that country in August 1969,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> number 12 in the US, and number 10 in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.6103.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - January 31, 1970}}</ref> in early 1970. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

For their next release "[[Hitchin' a Ride (Vanity Fare song)|Hitchin' a Ride]]", they added keyboardist Barry Landeman (born 25 October 1947, [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], England), formerly of [[Kippington Lodge]], to the group.  "Hitchin' A Ride", written by [[Peter Callander]] and [[Mitch Murray]], gave them a second million-selling hit,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> reaching No. 16 in the UK (January 1970), No. 1 for two weeks each on Chicago radio stations [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] (May 1970) and [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] (June 1970), No. 5 on the [[Hot 100]] (June–July 1970), and No. 3 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.3817.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - June 27, 1970}}</ref>

The hit was preceded by a tour of the United States, following which both Dick Allix and Tony Goulden left the band and were replaced by guitarist and singer Eddie Wheeler and drummer Mark Ellen.

Two more singles followed before the end of 1970; Mike Leander and Eddie Seago's "Come Tomorrow" and [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] and [[Roger Greenaway]]'s "Carolina's Coming Home" both of which failed to dent the [[record chart|charts]] on either side of the Atlantic.  In addition, a belated US release of "Summer Morning" charted only to No. 98 for two weeks.

Over the next couple of years more singles were released including [[Tony Macaulay]]'s "Better By Far" on [[DJM Records]] in 1972, but none of them entered the charts. Following this they decided to concentrate on live performances touring Europe, where they were having hit singles. Following the mid-1970s, and amid many band member changes (including the departure of Jarrett, replaced by Bernie Hagley), the group recorded only sporadically. In 1986, the band attempted to represent the UK in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], finishing third in the UK heat of ''[[List of Eurovision: Your Decision contestants|A Song for Europe]]'', with the song "Dreamer" featuring Jimmy Cassidy on vocals, Phil Kitto on keyboards alongside longtime members Ellen, Wheeler and Bernie Hagley. In 2007 they toured alongside [[P. J. Proby]]. In August 2015 drummer Mark Ellen retired from Vanity Fare after playing with the band for 43 years and was replaced by Howard Tibble.
In 2018 Graham Walker (from Gary Moore Band) took over on drums. 
They are still together today with a line-up of Hagley, Wheeler, Walker and Steve Oakman.

In his spare time, Brice sings second tenor with the [[City of Bath Male Choir]], who reached the final of [[BBC One]]'s '' [[Last Choir Standing]]''.  His son, Sebastian Brice, is part of the alt/rock band [[Avius]].
