Ferreira received modest popularity and a cult fanbase following the release of his first two projects, ''I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here'' and ''Milo Takes Baths'', both of which received attention on ''[[Forbes]]''.<ref name=":4" /> The recognition led to Ferreira being noticed by rappers [[Busdriver]] and [[Open Mike Eagle]], later going on his first tour with them and signing to their label, [[Hellfyre Club]].<ref name=":5" />

Ferreira's debut studio album, ''A Toothpaste Suburb'' was announced in March 2014 though it underwent numerous hiccups during rollout and problems with its release, eventually getting released in September 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ferreira|first=Rory Allen Philip|date=September 23, 2014|title=rory (afk) on Twitter|language=en-US|work=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/yomilo/status/514290818983534592|url-status=live|access-date=November 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126022949/https://twitter.com/yomilo/status/514290818983534592|archive-date=November 26, 2020}}</ref> The issues around release resulted with Milo founding his own label, Ruby Yacht (stylized RBYT), which he ran out of his record store, Soulfolks Records in Biddeford, Maine.
