On July 30, 2010, at the [[9:30 Club]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Zimmerman collapsed on stage, suffering from exhaustion and vomiting.

==Etymology==
Zimmerman's father claims that when his son was in his early teens, he was chatting with a friend on his computer, which then abruptly shut off. According to Zimmerman's father, he said that it had a smell of burnt wire and had a strange odor. Zimmerman started to dismantle his computer and happened to find a dead mouse. Zimmerman then became known as the "dead mouse guy" among friends. He tried to change his name to "Deadmouse" in an online chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to "Deadmau5". "Maus" is the German word for "mouse" and is pronounced the same as in English; the ending character 5 instead of an 's' is a form of [[leet]].<ref name="aritcle0101" />

Zimmerman created the original logo—called "mau5head"—while learning how to use 3D modelling software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2010/may/28/deadmau5|title=Paul Morley meets deadmau5 – The Guardian|access-date=October 1, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615072350/http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2010/may/28/deadmau5|archive-date=June 15, 2015}}</ref> The logo appears in many different colors and designs, and has been shown on the cover art of most of Zimmerman's albums. He was given the idea to wear a helmet based on the logo by one of his friends, [[Jay Gordon]] of the industrial metal band [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]].<ref>{{cite news |author1=Baltin, Steve |title=Who I Am: Deadmau5 On Film Scoring, NIN, Getting Married And Quitting Social Media |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/01/22/who-i-am-deadmau5-on-film-scoring-nin-getting-married-and-quitting-social-media/?sh=352d826e7565 |access-date=11 January 2021 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=January 22, 2019 |quote=The idea actually came from Jay Gordon in Orgy.}}</ref> In an interview with [[CBC Television]], Zimmerman said that he wants his logo to be an "icon". Fans often attend Deadmau5 concerts sporting their own copy or alteration of the mau5head.

He created his website and began uploading songs to SectionZ and producing under the alias "Deadmau5" in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sectionz.com/detail.asp?rType=mp3&SZID=2720 |title=SectionZ Electronic Music Community – All Computer Music Enthusiasts Welcome |access-date=June 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818172810/http://www.sectionz.com/detail.asp?rType=mp3&SZID=2720 |archive-date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>

Zimmerman provided a "Demo Track" which came bundled with FL Studio, along with several loop samples.

=== Disney trademark dispute ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|width=200|image1=Deadmau5.png|caption1=Deadmau5 logo|image2=Mickey Mouse head and ears.svg|caption2=Basic geometrical representation of Mickey Mouse's head and ears}}
In a 2012 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Zimmerman acknowledged possible similarities between his Mau5head logo and that of [[Mickey Mouse]], joking that "someone at the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] patent office fell asleep on that one."<ref name=guardian-mickeymau5/>

In March 2014, it was reported that The Walt Disney Company had filed a request with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to investigate Zimmerman's application to register the Mau5head emblem as a [[trademark]], noting its resemblance to the figure of Mickey Mouse.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=Is a Mickey Mouse v.

In response to the opposition, Zimmerman attacked Disney on Twitter, arguing that the company thinks of people as being "stupid" because "[they] might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse."<ref name=guardian-mickeymau5>{{cite news|title=Deadmau5 v Disney: mouse ear logo sparks legal dispute|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/04/deadmau5-disney-mickey-mouse-ear-logo-legal-dispute|access-date=September 5, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=September 4, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905083153/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/04/deadmau5-disney-mickey-mouse-ear-logo-legal-dispute|archive-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref> Zimmerman also believed that he had been targeted by Disney due to their attempts to "cash in" on the EDM market, specifically alluding to ''[[Dconstructed]]''—a recently released compilation album containing remixes of music from Disney properties by major electronic musicians such as [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Avicii]] and [[Kaskade]].<ref name=rollingstone-disneycd/>

On September 4, 2014, Zimmerman revealed on Twitter that Disney had used "Ghosts 'n' Stuff" in a Mickey Mouse "re-micks" video on their website and YouTube channel without his or his labels' permission, and posted pictures showing a [[DMCA takedown notice|takedown notice]] that had been sent to Disney by his lawyers. The letter also contained a trademark infringement accusation, arguing that the use of Deadmau5's name in material regarding the video falsely implied his endorsement of it. Disney argued that it had properly licensed the song and that there was "no merit to his statement."<ref name=rollingstone-disneycd>{{cite news|title=Deadmau5 Sends Cease and Desist to Disney Over 'Infringing Video'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-cease-desist-disney-20140905|access-date=September 6, 2014|work=Rolling Stone|date=September 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906123032/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-cease-desist-disney-20140905|archive-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=inthemix-pwnage>{{cite web|title=Deadmau5 drops some "complete pwnage" on Disney in legal war|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/58904/Deadmau5_ramps_up_legal_war_against_Disney_with_Cease_Desist|website=inthemix.com.au|access-date=September 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905075707/http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/58904/Deadmau5_ramps_up_legal_war_against_Disney_with_Cease_Desist|archive-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

In an October 2014 USPTO filing, Zimmerman argued that Disney has attempted to co-exist with him in goodwill. Zimmerman presented evidence that Disney had been in contact with him regarding potential collaborative projects, including an offer to participate in a "re-imagining" of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' as a live concert tour for the film's 75th anniversary.<ref name=billboard-deadmau5documents>{{cite web|title=Deadmau5 Says Archenemy Disney Wanted His Help on 'Fantasia' Anniversary|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-says-disney-approached-him-740615|website=Billboard.biz|access-date=October 15, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016191046/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-says-disney-approached-him-740615|archive-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

=== Meowingtons trademark dispute ===
In 2015, Zimmerman attempted to register a trademark for the name of his pet cat, Professor Meowingtons, whom he adopted in 2010 and has incorporated into some of his own merchandising. However, the registration was rejected due to a pre-existing Meowingtons trademark held by an online retailer of the same name established in 2014,<ref name="thr-meowingtons"/> which sells cat-themed accessories and clothing. After discovering the trademark, Zimmerman petitioned against it, citing his pre-existing uses.<ref name="billboard-meowingtonstm">{{cite magazine|title=deadmau5 Files Trademark Petition to Protect His Cat Meowingtons' Brand|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7640508/deadmau5-files-trademark-petition-protect-cat-meowingtons-brand|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 26, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320015034/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7640508/deadmau5-files-trademark-petition-protect-cat-meowingtons-brand|archive-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2017, Zimmerman was sued by Emma Bassiri (the owner of the website) for trademark infringement and unfair competition; the suit argued that claims by Zimmerman that she had named the site specifically after the cat was false. Zimmerman himself told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that "from the very beginning I was working to find a way to resolve this situation amicably", but that he had been forced to "litigate this woman out of existence".<ref name="thr-meowingtons">{{cite web|title=Deadmau5 Sued Over 'Meowingtons' Trademark|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-sued-meowingtons-trademark-986054|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=March 26, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326140129/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-sued-meowingtons-trademark-986054|archive-date=March 26, 2017}}</ref> On May 15, 2017, Deadmau5 filed a countersuit against Bassiri with the intention of seeking forfeiture of Bassiri's website and domain name.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Deadmau5 Escalates 'Meowingtons' Trademark Cat Fight With Countersuit|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7793109/deadmau5-meowingtons-trademark-countersuit|magazine=Billboard|access-date=June 1, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519084108/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7793109/deadmau5-meowingtons-trademark-countersuit|archive-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref>

===Offensive slurs===
In October 2018, Zimmerman posted comments on Twitter during an argument including the statements "I'll bet you suck a guy off for 40 grand zero fucking questions asked" and "women don't posses {{sic}} penises". These comments were construed by readers as being homophobic and transphobic.<ref name="EDM">{{cite news |title=deadmau5 Accused of Making Transphobic Remarks During Online Argument|url=https://edm.com/news/deadmau5-transphobic-remarks-online-argument |access-date=25 February 2019 |publisher=EDM.com |date=8 October 2018}}</ref> Zimmerman apologized for his comments, saying that he "wasn't trying to make blatant transphobic statements", and had "just got into a heated arguement {{sic}} with some dude online", noting that his comments had been taken "somewhere unintended".<ref name="Duffy">{{cite news |last1=Duffy |first1=Nick|title=Deadmau5 walks back 'homophobic, transphobic' comments|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/10/08/deadmau5-homophobic-transphobic-comments/ |access-date=25 February 2019 |publisher=PinkNews |date=8 October 2018}}</ref>

A few days later, during a gaming stream, he referred to a track by artist [[Slushii]] as "AIDS fucking music" and calling it "autistic shit". Slushii – who is on the [[autism spectrum]] – responded to these comments on Twitter, calling them "really disappointing".<ref name="Martin">{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Laura |title=Deadmau5 forced to apologise for disgusting Aids and autism slurs |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/deadmau5-forced-apologise-disgusting-aids-13399028 |access-date=25 February 2019 |publisher=Mirror Online |date=11 October 2018}}</ref> Zimmerman later apologized for these comments, citing mental health issues that required "professional help", and stating that he would take time "off the radar" to "work on [himself]".<ref name="Meadow">{{cite news |last1=Meadow |first1=Matthew |title=Deadmau5 Addresses His Recent Insensitive Tweets In Statement Admitting He "Needs Help" |url=https://www.youredm.com/2018/10/10/deadmau5-addresses-his-recent-insensitive-tweets-in-statement-admitting-he-needs-help/ |access-date=25 February 2019 |publisher=YourEDM |date=10 October 2018}}</ref>
