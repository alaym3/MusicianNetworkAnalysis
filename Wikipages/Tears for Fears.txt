'''Tears for Fears''' are an English [[pop rock]] band formed in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, in 1981 by [[Roland Orzabal]] and [[Curt Smith]]. Founded after the dissolution of their first band, the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]-influenced [[Graduate (band)|Graduate]], Tears for Fears were associated with the [[New wave music|new wave]] [[Synthesizer#Synthpop|synthesizer]] bands of the early 1980s, and attained international chart success. Tears for Fears were part of the [[MTV]]-driven [[Second British Invasion]] of the US.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Joanne |last1= Sujansky |first2= Jan |last2= Ferri-Reed |year= 2009 |title= Keeping the Millennials: Why Companies Are Losing Billions in Turnover to This Generation- and What to Do About It |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]] |page= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780470438510/page/66 66] |isbn= 978-0-4704-3851-0 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780470438510 |url-access= registration}}</ref>

The band's debut album, ''[[The Hurting]]'' (1983), reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], achieving multi-platinum status in both the UK and the US.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|title= RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – Songs from the Big Chair |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Songs+from+the+Big+Chair%22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Certified Awards |publisher= [[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx}}</ref> ''Songs from the Big Chair'' contained two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one hits: "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]" and "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]". The latter song won the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Best British Single in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears For Fears |publisher= [[Brit Awards]] |url= http://www.brits.co.uk/taxonomy/term/236 |archive-date= 3 November 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131103094554/http://www.brits.co.uk/taxonomy/term/236}}</ref>

After the release of their platinum-selling third album, ''[[The Seeds of Love]]'' (1990), Smith and Orzabal had an acrimonious split in 1991. Orzabal retained the Tears for Fears name as a solo project, releasing the albums ''[[Elemental (Tears for Fears album)|Elemental]]'' (1994) and ''[[Raoul and the Kings of Spain]]'' (1996). Orzabal and Smith reconciled in 2000 and released an album of new material, ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'', in 2004. The duo have toured on a semi-regular basis since then. After spending almost a decade in development, the band's seventh album, ''[[The Tipping Point (Tears for Fears album)|The Tipping Point]]'', has been announced for release in February 2021.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Tom |last= Skinner |title= Tears for Fears announce first album in 17 years, 'The Tipping Point' |magazine= [[NME]] |date= 7 October 2021 |access-date= 8 October 2021 |url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/tears-for-fears-new-album-17-years-the-tipping-point-listen-single-3064771}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
Orzabal and Smith met as teenagers in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath, Somerset, England]]. Their professional debut came with the band [[Graduate (band)|Graduate]], a [[mod revival]]/new wave act. In 1980, Graduate released an album, ''Acting My Age'', and a single "Elvis Should Play Ska" (referring to [[Elvis Costello]], not [[Elvis Presley|Presley]]). The single just missed the top 100 in the UK, but performed well in Spain and in [[Switzerland]]. The band split in 1981. Shortly afterwards, the duo became session musicians for the band [[Neon (British band)|Neon]],<ref>{{cite web|first= Jonas |last= Wårstad |title= Naked Eyes – The Story |website= Discog.info |access-date= 17 August 2011 |url= http://www.discog.info/naked-eyes-interview.html}}</ref> where they first met future Tears for Fears drummer [[Manny Elias]]. Neon also featured [[Pete Byrne]] and [[Rob Fisher (British musician)|Rob Fisher]], who went on to become [[Naked Eyes]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Brian |last= Burlage |title= Revisiting Tears for Fears for the Anniversary of 'Songs from the Big Chair' |date= 23 February 2015 |newspaper= [[The Michigan Daily]]}}</ref> 

Orzabal and Smith continued working together, drawing inspiration from artists such as [[Talking Heads]], [[Peter Gabriel]]<ref name="Noisey">{{cite web|title= How We Wrote Our First Record: Tears for Fears revisit 'The Hurting' |website= [[Noisey]] |access-date= 12 April 2017 |url= https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/youneedtohearthis-tears-for-fears-the-hurting}}</ref> and [[Brian Eno]]. Orzabal developed a fondness for [[synthesizer]]s as a consequence of the early 1980s "electronic explosion", in which the technology-based, drummer-free approach of [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD) and [[Depeche Mode]] "became ''the'' thing";<ref>{{cite episode|title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair |network= [[BBC Four]] |series= [[Classic Albums]] |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 14 February 2020 |minutes= 15}}</ref> [[Gary Numan]] has also been cited as an influence on the duo's new [[Electronic music|electronic]] direction.<ref name="Noisey"/> They operated under the name History of Headaches, which was soon changed to Tears for Fears. The band's name was inspired by [[primal therapy]], developed by the American psychologist , which gained tremendous publicity after [[John Lennon]] became Janov's patient in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|first= Dennis |last= Hunt |date= 4 August 1985 |title= Primal Scream Is Behind Tears for Fears |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times]] |page= L2}}</ref> In a 2004 interview with [[VH1 (UK and Ireland)|VH1 UK]], Orzabal and Smith said that when they finally met Janov in the mid-1960s, they were disillusioned to find he had become quite "Hollywood" and wanted the band to write a musical for him.

As Tears for Fears, Orzabal and Smith intended to form the nucleus of the group and bring in surrounding musicians to help them complete the picture. Around this time they met local musician [[Ian Stanley]], who offered them free use of his home [[Multitrack recording|8-track studio]]. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to [[Phonogram Records]] in the UK in 1981 by [[Artists and repertoire|A&R manager]] Abdullah Bhutta. Their first single, "[[Suffer the Children (song)|Suffer the Children]]", produced by [[David Lord (producer)|David Lord]], was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of "Pale Shelter" (produced by [[Mike Howlett]]) in March 1982, but neither releases were successful.

===''The Hurting'' and first international successes (1982–1983)===
The band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, "[[Mad World]]", which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 75: 31 October 1982 – 06 November 1982 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |access-date= 11 May 2015 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19821031/7501}}</ref> Their first album, ''[[The Hurting]]'', was released in March 1983. For this album (and the next), [[keyboardist]] and composer [[Ian Stanley]] and drummer [[Manny Elias]] were considered full band members, though Smith and Orzabal were still essentially the frontmen and public face[s] of the band.

The album, produced by [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]] and Ross Cullum, showcased guitar- and synthesizer-based songs with lyrics reflecting Orzabal's bitter childhood and his interest in [[primal therapy]].<ref name="Noisey"/> The album was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached No. 1 and platinum status. It also reached the top 20 in several other countries and yielded the international hit singles "[[Mad World]]" (top 5 hit in South Africa), "[[Change (Tears for Fears song)|Change]]" (top 40 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the [[Netherlands]], Poland and South Africa – their first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), and a re-recorded version of "[[Pale Shelter]]". All three of these singles reached the Top 5 in the UK.

Towards the end of 1983, the band released a new, slightly more experimental single, "[[The Way You Are (Tears for Fears song)|The Way You Are]]", intended as a stopgap while they worked on their second album. The single was a top-30 hit in the UK, but did not come close to matching the success of their three previous hits, despite a national [[Concert|concert tour]] in December of that year (captured on the ''[[In My Mind's Eye]]'' live video release). The single, which heavily featured sampling and programmed rhythms, was a departure from Tears for Fears' previous musical approach. In the liner notes to their 1996 [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] compilation album ''[[Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]]'' they wrote "this was the point we realised we had to change direction", though the somewhat experimental style of the single continued to be reflected in their forthcoming B-sides.

===''Songs from the Big Chair'' and worldwide fame (1984–1986)===
In early 1984, they began working with a new producer, Jeremy Green, on their new single "[[Mothers Talk]]". However, the band were ultimately unhappy with the results and so producer Chris Hughes was brought back into the fold and the "Mothers Talk" single re-produced for release in August 1984. A departure from their earlier works, the single became a top-20 hit in the UK, but it was the follow-up single "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]" (released in the UK in November 1984) that was the real beginning of the band's international fame.

"Shout", a top-5 UK hit, paved the way for their second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (released in February 1985), which entered the UK album chart at No. 2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. They did away with the predominantly synthpop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band's stylistic hallmark. Anchored on the creative hub of Orzabal, Stanley and producer Hughes, the new Tears for Fears sound helped to propel ''Songs from the Big Chair'' into becoming one of the year's biggest sellers worldwide, eventually being certified triple platinum in the UK and quintuple platinum in the US (where it remained the No. 1 album for five weeks in the summer of 1985).<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears for Fears – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tears-for-fears-mn0000019892/awards}}</ref>

The album's title was inspired by the book and [[Miniseries|television miniseries]] ''[[Sybil (1976 film)|Sybil]]'', the chronicle of a woman with [[dissociative identity disorder]] who sought refuge in her analyst's "big chair", Orzabal and Smith stating they felt each of the album's songs had a distinctive personality of its own. The band had also recorded a track titled "The Big Chair", which was released as the B-side to "Shout" but was not included on the album.

The album's success came in conjunction with the array of hit singles it yielded: "Mothers Talk" (re-recorded yet again for its US release in 1986), "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]" (No. 4 UK, No. 1 in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, [[Switzerland]] and a huge hit in other territories), "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" (their highest-charting UK and Irish hit at No. 2 and another No. 1 in the US and in Canada), "[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]" (UK No. 12, US No. 3, Ireland No. 5, Canada No. 8), and "[[I Believe (Tears for Fears song)|I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)]]" (UK No. 23 and Ireland No. 10).<ref>{{cite news|first= Bo. |last= Emerson |title= Tears for Fears: Dynamic Duo Keeps Lucky Streak Alive |date= 9 February 1990 |newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]] |page= D3}}</ref> Some regions even saw the release of [[Special edition|limited edition]] 10" singles for these hits, and a variety of double packs and picture discs in addition to the regular 7" and 12" formats.

Following the album's release, the band went on a world tour that lasted most of the year, playing notably at the ''Montreux Golden Rose Rock and Pop Festival'' in May 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Heather |last= Johnson |title= Classic Tracks: Tears for Fears' "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" |magazine= [[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |date= 8 January 2007 |url= https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-tears-fears-everybody-wants-rule-world-365857}}</ref> In September 1985, the band performed "Shout" at the [[1985 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title= MTV Video Music Awards – Performers |publisher= [[MTV]] |access-date= 4 December 2011 |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/archive/performers.jhtml}}</ref> Also during the tour, [[Roland Orzabal|Orzabal]] and [[Curt Smith|Smith]] discovered an American female singer/pianist, [[Oleta Adams]], who was performing in a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] hotel bar, and whom they invited to collaborate on their next album. Towards the end of the year, they released a video collection/documentary titled ''[[Scenes from the Big Chair]]''.

In February 1986, having completed the lengthy and exhausting Big Chair world tour, Tears for Fears were honoured at the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1986|1986 Brit Awards]] in London, where they won the Best British Single award for "Everybody Wants to Rule the World".<ref name="BPI">{{cite web|title= Brit Awards 1986 Winners |publisher= Brit Awards |access-date= 15 May 2011 |url= http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1986}}</ref> The band was also nominated for Best British Group and Best British Album, and Chris Hughes was nominated for Best Producer.<ref name="BPI"/> The band performed the song at the ceremony, which became the final public performance of drummer Manny Elias who left the group shortly afterwards.

The same year, Orzabal and Stanley worked together on a side project named Mancrab and released a single, "Fish for Life", which was written for the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Karate Kid, Part II]]''. The track was written and produced by Orzabal and Stanley, and featured vocals by US singer/dancer Eddie Thomas, who was one of the dancers in the video for "Everybody Wants to Rule the World".

====Live Aid====
On 13 July 1985, Tears for Fears were scheduled to perform at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium|JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]] for the [[Live Aid]] charity event. However, on the morning of the historic event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear at the event before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group [[George Thorogood#The Destroyers|George Thorogood and the Destroyers]], which had a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non-appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist Andrew Saunders and saxophonist [[Will Gregory]], had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by [[Apartment (Bristol band)|Alan Griffiths]] on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate proceeds from their concerts played in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York.<ref>{{cite news|first= Damian |last= Corless |title= Calling out around the world... Remembering Live Aid |newspaper= [[Irish Independent]] |date= 12 July 2015 |access-date= 20 July 2015 |url= http://www.independent.ie/life/calling-out-around-the-world-remembering-live-aid-31364166.html}}</ref>

As a further donation, the band also recorded a slightly rewritten version of one of their biggest hits and released it for the British [[fundraising]] initiative [[Sport Aid]], a sister project of [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] in which people took part in running races of varying length and seriousness to raise more money for African famine relief projects. Sport Aid's slogan was "I Ran the World", therefore Tears for Fears released "[[Everybody Wants to Run the World]]" (No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in Ireland). Indirectly, the band were involved in the earlier Band Aid single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" from 1984, which featured a slowed down [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from their song "The Hurting" (from their [[The Hurting|debut album of the same name]]) in the introduction.

===''The Seeds of Love'' (1987–1990)===
It was 1989 before the group released their third album, ''[[The Seeds of Love]]'' (on which Ian Stanley appeared for the last time as a member of Tears for Fears), at a reported production cost of over a million pounds.<ref>{{cite news|first= Stephen |last= Humphries |title= Singer sheds Tears for Fears |newspaper= [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date= 9 November 2001 |url= https://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1109/p20s2-almp.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Fred |last= Shuster |title= Tears Leader has no Fears Exploring the Past |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via= [[HighBeam Research]] |date= 8 December 1995 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029124.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191526/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029124.html}}</ref> The album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist [[Nicky Holland]], who had toured with the band on their "Big Chair" world tour in 1985. Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down. The length of the production impacted on the band's management company, who had financially over-extended themselves in other business matters and were hoping for an earlier release date to pay off their debts.<ref name="JD">{{cite news|first= Jamie |last= Doward |title= Nursing a King-size hangover |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 August 2002 |access-date= 26 August 2012 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/aug/04/theobserver.observerbusiness8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Michael |last= Snyder |title= Tears for Fears Rehashes the '60s |date= 1 September 1993 |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |page= E1}}</ref>

The album retained the band's epic sound while showing increasing influences ranging from [[jazz]] and [[blues]] to [[the Beatles]], the latter being evident on the [[hit single]] "[[Sowing the Seeds of Love]]".<ref>{{cite news|first= Kim |last= Jae-Ha |title= Tears for Fears Partners Plant New Pop 'Seeds' |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |via= [[HighBeam Research]] |date= 5 February 1990 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3983242.html |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924193653/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3983242.html |archive-date= 24 September 2015}}</ref> The second single from the album was "[[Woman in Chains]]" (a top 40 hit in the UK, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the US), on which [[Phil Collins]] played drums and [[Oleta Adams]]—whom Orzabal would later guide to a successful solo career—shared vocals.

The album was a worldwide success, entering the UK Albums Chart at no. 1, making the top 10 in the US and in numerous other countries, eventually going on to sell millions of copies internationally. The band set out on an extensive "Seeds of Love" world tour sponsored by Philips to start recovering the debt incurred during the recording process. The band's show in [[Santa Barbara, California]], in May 1990 would be captured on the ''[[Going to California (Tears for Fears video)|Going to California]]'' live video as the singles "[[Advice for the Young at Heart]]" and "[[Famous Last Words (Tears for Fears song)|Famous Last Words]]" delivered modest chart success.<ref>{{cite news|first= Cheryl |last= Wenner |title= Tears for Fears: Emotion, Rhythm and Meaning |newspaper= [[The Morning Call]] |date= 7 June 1985}}</ref>

A 64-page companion book, simply titled ''Tears for Fears – The Seeds of Love'', was released by [[Virgin Books]] in 1990 and offered extensive insight from Orzabal, Holland and Adams into the songwriting and production process for the album, as well as the musical scores for each track and rare promotional photographs from the era.

===Break-up and solo careers (1991–1992)===
After ''The Seeds of Love'', Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious falling out and parted company in 1991. The split was blamed on Orzabal's perfectionist approach to production and delays caused by Smith's jetsetting lifestyle and desire to slow down the pace of their work (Smith was also going through a divorce at the time).<ref>{{cite web|first= Felix |last= Behr |title= This Is Why Tears for Fears Broke Up in the 90s |website= Grunge.com |date= 14 August 2020 |access-date= 10 June 2021 |url= https://www.grunge.com/236824/this-is-why-tears-for-fears-broke-up-in-the-90s/}}</ref>

Another factor in the break-up was the band's manager, Paul King, who declared bankruptcy in 1990 and was later convicted of fraud. The duo had signed to King's Outlaw Management Agency in 1982 and remained clients throughout the remainder of the decade (the agency also operated the band's fan club, the Tears For Fears World Service, between 1983 and 1986). By the late 1980s, the agency had run into serious debt and, after discrepancies were discovered in King's financial management, Orzabal became increasingly concerned that Smith was unwilling to drop King as their manager.<ref name="JD"/> Outlaw folded in 1990 with debts of almost £1 million as King declared bankruptcy. In 2004, following fraudulent activities with his other businesses, King was prosecuted for fraud and imprisoned for three and a half years, as well as being disqualified from being a company director again for ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ex-Tears For Fears Manager Jailed |date= 10 May 2004 |publisher= Music News |access-date= 26 August 2012 |url= http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=Ex-Tears-For-Fears-manager-jailed&nItemID=1353}}</ref>

Following Smith's departure, Orzabal kept the band name alive by releasing the 1992 hit single "[[Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)]]". The single was released to promote the band's greatest hits collection ''[[Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82–92)]]'', which featured every single to reach the Top 20, either in the UK or internationally, apart from the Sport Aid fundraiser. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK, where it was certified double platinum, and also reached the Top 10 in several other countries, including France, Italy and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears For Fears – Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82–92) |website= Charts.org.nz |access-date= 7 November 2019 |url= https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Tears+For+Fears&titel=Tears+Roll+Down+%28Greatest+Hits+82%2D92%29&cat=a}}</ref>

Smith relocated to New York City, and in 1993 he released his first solo album, ''[[Soul on Board]]''. The album was a commercial failure and Smith himself has said on numerous occasions that he despised it, alleging that he only made it to fulfill his [[recording contract]]. In 1995, he met local songwriter and producer Charlton Pettus. The two formed a self-described "organic" partnership, writing simple, melody-based songs and recording them at home on vintage analogue equipment. The result was released in 1997 under the name Mayfield and a short US tour followed.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

===Second line-up: ''Elemental'' and ''Raoul and the Kings of Spain'' (1993–1996)===
In 1993, Orzabal (still under the name Tears for Fears) released the album ''[[Elemental (Tears for Fears album)|Elemental]]'' together with longtime collaborator [[Apartment (Bristol band)|Alan Griffiths]]. Co-produced by [[Tim Palmer]], it yielded the international hit "[[Break It Down Again]]" (top 20 in the UK, Canada, France, and Italy) and was supported with another successful world tour, including a college tour of the US where "Break It Down Again" reached no. 25.

The album was a top 10 hit in the UK, France and Italy, and top 30 in several other countries. Although it charted considerably lower in the US than the previous two studio albums (no. 45), it still earned a Gold disc there for sales of over half a million copies. The singles "[[Cold (Tears for Fears song)|Cold]]", "[[Elemental (song)|Elemental]]" and "[[Goodnight Song]]" met with minor chart success in certain territories. The lyrics to "Cold" contained a scathing reference to the band's former manager, Paul King, in which Orzabal sings ''"King got caught with his fingers in the till. Where's your calculator – did you leave it in your will?"''

Orzabal, still working with Griffiths and Palmer, released another Tears for Fears album, ''[[Raoul and the Kings of Spain]]'', in 1995. This was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new [[Latin American music|Latin]] musical influence (Raoul was originally the name Orzabal's parents wanted to give him, and is also the name of his own first son). Orzabal stated that it was not a concept album but that there was a theme, namely that of familial relationships. The album also included a reunion with [[Oleta Adams]] who duetted with Orzabal on the track "Me and My Big Ideas".

The album was not a commercial success by Tears for Fears standards, though minor chart success came via the single release of the title track (top 40 in the UK) and (to a lesser extent) the single "[[God's Mistake]]". The release of the album had been delayed for nearly a year due to a last-minute label switch from [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] to [[Epic Records|Epic]] (part of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]]), and the ensuing confusion (Mercury had already begun promotion) did not help the album's chances either. Although the track listing for the album had been changed at the record company's request, [[Sony]] did not extend Tears for Fears' contract following the album's release. A worldwide tour followed, including dates in Latin America, though Orzabal declined to tour his native UK this time except for a single show in London.

In 1996 a B-sides compilation album, ''[[Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]]'', was released on Mercury, which included B-sides and some rare tracks from the successful 1982–93 period. The liner notes, written by Orzabal and [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]], gave fans an insight into the songwriting process as well as a rare glimpse of [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] humour regarding the tracks they would rather forget.

===Remasters and other projects===
In 1999, Mercury Records released remastered editions of Tears for Fears' first three albums, including B-sides, remixes, and extended versions. Supervised by producer Chris Hughes, the remasters also included new liner notes for each album providing details and new insights into the music.

Due to record company [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the late 1990s, Tears for Fears' back catalogue was eventually placed into the [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] fold.

After undertaking production work and some songwriting for the Icelandic singer-songwriter [[Emilíana Torrini]] on her 1999 album ''[[Love in the Time of Science]]'', Orzabal re-teamed with Alan Griffiths and released the album ''[[Tomcats Screaming Outside]]'', released on [[Eagle Records]] as a [[Musical ensemble|solo project]] under his own name. Whereas Tears for Fears' work had become guitar-based, ''Tomcats Screaming Outside'' showcased a predominantly electronic style.

===Reunion: ''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending''===
In 2000, routine paperwork obligations led the duo to re-establish contact with each other after Orzabal signed a business document on Smith's behalf.<ref>{{cite news|first= Aidin |last= Vaziri |title= Pop Quiz: Roland Orzabal of Tears For Fears |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= 19 September 2004 |access-date= 15 August 2010 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/music/popquiz/article/POP-QUIZ-ROLAND-ORZABAL-OF-TEARS-FOR-FEARS-2724224.php}}</ref> Smith flew back to England (where Orzabal still lived) and they had dinner and decided to work on a new album together.<ref>{{cite news|first= Steve |last= Morse |title= Tears for Fears' New Disc is Back on the Right Track |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |via= HighBeam Research |date= 20 August 1993 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8241625.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201002/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8241625.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Rick |last= de Yampert |title= Tears for Fears Brings Tears of Joy |newspaper= [[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]] |date= 1 October 2004 |page= 10E}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= The KPCS Archive » 08 (1) – Curt Smith |website= Kevinpollakschatshow.com |access-date= 15 May 2011 |url= http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?cat=70 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713144717/http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?cat=70 |archive-date= 13 July 2011}}</ref>

The songwriting sessions included Charlton Pettus (Smith's collaborator since the mid-1990s), and fourteen songs were written and recorded in less than six months. The ensuing album, ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'', was scheduled for release on [[Arista Records]] in late 2003, but a change in management at Arista prompted the band to opt out of their contract and switch to the New Door label (a new offshoot of Universal Music), and delayed the release until September 2004. Two US tours followed, and the 2004 tour included an unrehearsed guest appearance by [[Oleta Adams]] at the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] show for a performance of "Woman in Chains". The song "Who Killed Tangerine?" was used in the movie ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]''.

''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'' was released in the UK and Europe in March 2005 on [[Gut Records]], shortly after the comeback single "Closest Thing to Heaven" became the first Tears for Fears [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] hit in a decade. The promo video for the single was a colourful fantasy that featured Hollywood actress [[Brittany Murphy]] riding in a [[hot air balloon]]. The European releases of the album contained all fourteen tracks recorded during the recording sessions, while the US version only contained twelve. A brief tour of larger UK venues followed in April.

In 2005, the band began discussions with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] for the release of a new comprehensive anthology of their work to date, including a new track titled "Floating Down the River". However, the subsequent release (at least in the US) was a compilation issued as part of [[Hip-O Records]]' generic "Gold" series, a Universal subsidiary that specialises in budget-priced back catalogue compilations.

A live performance at the [[Parc des Princes]] stadium in Paris, recorded in June 2005, was released on CD and DVD in France and [[Benelux]]. Titled ''[[Secret World Live in Paris|Secret World – Live in Paris]]'', it was released on the [[XIII Bis Records|XIII Bis]] label in early 2006 and became a best-seller, with over 70,000 physical copies sold in addition to downloads. The CD contained the aforementioned new studio song, "Floating Down the River", and a remastered Curt Smith/Mayfield track, "What Are We Fighting For?". The relationship with XIII Bis proved so successful that Smith chose the comparatively small French label to release his 2007 solo album, ''[[Halfway, Pleased]]''.

[[File:Tears for Fears 2008.jpg|thumb|Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith in 2008.]]
In 2006, ''Songs from the Big Chair'' was re-issued again by Universal Music, this time as a 2-disc Deluxe Edition with additional B-sides and rarities added, expanding further than the 1999 remastered version. The release did not include the lyrics as the band had intended with the original release, but came with a 24-page booklet including rare photographs and newly written liner notes. The 28-track set contained four sections, with the first disc containing the original album and various B-sides taken from the earlier 1999 remastered edition. It also included the rare piano version of "The Working Hour", which had previously only been available as a limited edition item. The second disc contained various 7" versions of the singles (including the aforementioned "The Way You Are", the re-recording of "I Believe" and the 1986 US remix of "Mothers Talk"), followed by various 12" remixes from the era.

In August 2009, the ''Raoul and the Kings of Spain'' album was also re-issued by [[Cherry Red Records]], featuring seven bonus B-side tracks from the time of its original release.<ref>{{cite web|title= Raoul and the Kings of Spain – Tears for Fears |publisher= [[Cherry Red Records]] |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=880 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140202164131/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=880}}</ref>

===2010–present===
In April 2010, Tears for Fears joined the reformed 1980s group [[Spandau Ballet]] on their seven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, before a four-date headlining tour of their own in Southeast Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and a 17-date tour of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears for Fears Concert – Perth, Australia |date= 22 March 2010 |url= http://www.curtsmithofficial.com/event/2010/april/17/tears-for-fears-concert-perth-australia |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100102064852/http://www.curtsmithofficial.com/event/2010/april/17/tears-for-fears-concert-perth-australia |archive-date= 2 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title= Tears for Fears 'Songs from the Big Chair' Released November 11, 2014, via Universal Music Enterprises |date= 29 September 2014 |agency= [[Business Wire]] |access-date= 20 July 2015 |url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140929005296/en/Tears-Fears-%E2%80%98Songs-Big-Chair%E2%80%99-Released-November}}</ref>

In 2011 and 2012, they played dates in the US, Japan, South Korea, Manila and South America.<ref>{{cite web|title= Curt Smith – Official Site (2012 tour dates) |website= Curtsmithofficial.com |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= http://curtsmithofficial.com/events/ |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618234800/http://curtsmithofficial.com/events/ |archive-date= 18 June 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Smith confirmed that he was writing and recording new Tears for Fears material with Orzabal and Charlton Pettus. Several songs were worked on in the UK at Orzabal's home studio, Neptune's Kitchen, in April 2013, and continued in Los Angeles in July 2013. According to Orzabal, they have been producing more dark, dramatic pieces of music. "There's one track that's a combination of Portishead and Queen. It's just crazy," Orzabal stated.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Patrick |last= Flanary |title= Tears for Fears' Arcade Fire Cover 'Kick-Started' New Recording |date= 22 August 2013 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |access-date= 9 September 2013 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tears-for-fears-arcade-fire-cover-kick-started-new-recording-20130822}}</ref> In August 2013, Tears for Fears released their first newly recorded material in nearly a decade, with a cover of [[Arcade Fire]]'s "[[Ready to Start]]" made available on [[SoundCloud]].<ref>{{cite web|title= TearsForFears |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= https://soundcloud.com/tearsforfearsmusic}}</ref> In 2014, the track was included on a limited edition 3-track 10" vinyl EP from the band called [[Ready Boy & Girls?]], released exclusively for [[Record Store Day]], which also featured covers of [[Hot Chip]]'s "[[Boy from School]]" and [[Animal Collective]]'s "[[My Girls (Animal Collective song)|My Girls]]". All three songs were recorded as "kick-start" projects as the band commenced work on their seventh studio album. In an interview on [[BBC Radio Devon]] in October 2014, Orzabal stated that the band had now signed to [[Warner Music Group]] and that around five or six songs had so far been completed for the new album.<ref>{{cite interview|first= Richard |last= Green |others= Roland Orzabal |title= Roland Orzabal of Tears for Fears |work= The Richard Green Show, [[BBC Radio Devon]] |location= Plymouth, England |date= 18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Tears For Fears |publisher= Warner Bros.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band's debut album ''The Hurting'', Universal Music reissued it in October 2013 in two Deluxe Editions (one a 2-disc set and the other a 4-disc set with a DVD of the 1983 ''[[In My Mind's Eye]]'' concert). Deluxe Editions of the band's second album, ''Songs From The Big Chair'', were released on 10 November 2014 including a 6-disc set that features various rarities and two DVDs (one audio, one video). On 12 November 2014, Tears for Fears performed "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" on ABC's ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' TV programme.<ref name="CoS">{{cite web|first= Ben |last= Kaye |title= Tears For Fears perform the hits on Jimmy Kimmel Live — watch |website= [[Consequence of Sound]] |date= 13 November 2014 |access-date= 15 December 2014 |url= http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/11/tears-for-fears-perform-the-hits-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-watch/}}</ref> In mid 2015, the band began a series of live dates in the US and Canada.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref>{{cite news|first= George A. |last= Paul |title= Just Like Old Times for Tears for Fears |newspaper= Orange County Register |date= 3 August 2012}}</ref>

On 26 October 2017, the band performed a 65-minute live set at the BBC Radio Theatre in London for the [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2 in Concert]] series, which was broadcast on both radio and television (via the [[BBC Red Button]] service). The following night, the band played their first ''full-length'' UK concert since 2005, at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Prior to this, on 12 October, "[[I Love You But I'm Lost]]" was released as a single from a new 16-track Tears For Fears compilation album titled ''[[Rule the World: The Greatest Hits]]''. The compilation was released by Universal Music on 10 November 2017, and includes fourteen Top 40 hits from all six previous Tears For Fears albums along with two new tracks. In October 2017, the band announced an 11-date UK arena tour for April–May 2018, featuring [[Alison Moyet]] as the support act. However, the tour was postponed to early 2019 due to Orzabal's health problems following the death of his wife.<ref>{{cite press release|author= Celebretainment |title= Roland Orzabal back to old self after wife's sudden death |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 19 February 2019 |access-date= 21 July 2021 |url= https://apnews.com/article/53210fb273dd460584e42ae97a05bfd6 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210610185558/https://apnews.com/article/53210fb273dd460584e42ae97a05bfd6 |archive-date= 10 June 2021}}</ref>

In February 2020, ''Songs from the Big Chair'' was the subject of an episode of the BBC series ''[[Classic Albums]]'' featuring new interviews with the band and all key personnel from the album's creation and subsequent success.<ref>{{cite episode|title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair |network= [[BBC Four]] |series= [[Classic Albums]] |date= 14 February 2020 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f8xc}}</ref> To coincide with the album's 35th anniversary, the 2014 deluxe boxed set was reissued by Universal Music, as well as a new 12-inch vinyl picture disc of the album. In October 2020, ''The Seeds of Love'' album was also reissued as various deluxe editions (including a 5-disc super-deluxe set) and returned the band to the UK Top 20.

In November 2020, ''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending'' was made available through various streaming services for the first time after Orzabal and Smith signed with Irving and Jeff Azoff's Full Stop management company. Also, when discussing the delay of their long-awaited new album, Orzabal said that he and Smith had reconsidered the direction of the project because the more they worked with other writers and producers, the less it felt like a Tears for Fears album. Accordingly, they had opted to rework several tracks, along with composing some new material.<ref>{{cite web|first= John |last= Earls |title= Lack of 'Happy Ending' contributed to Tears for Fears management split |website= Super Deluxe Edition |date= 26 November 2020 |access-date= 30 November 2020 |url= https://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/lack-of-happy-ending-contributed-to-tears-for-fears-management-split/}}</ref>

On 12 June 2021, Tears for Fears released the live double album ''Live at Massey Hall'' (recorded in 1985) for [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Live at Massey Hall |website= Record Store Day |access-date= 21 July 2021 |url= https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/13687}}</ref>

On 7 October 2021, Smith appeared on the BBC Radio 2 programme ''The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show'' to introduce the band's new single "[[The Tipping Point (Tears for Fears song)|The Tipping Point]]", the first track from their new album due out on Concord Records in February 2022.<ref>{{cite news|title= Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Tears for Fears |work= The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show |publisher= [[BBC Radio 2]] |date= 7 October 2021 |access-date= 10 October 2021 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00108g3}}</ref>
