'''Derek and the Dominos''' was an English–American [[blues rock|blues-rock]] band formed in the spring of 1970 by guitarist and singer [[Eric Clapton]], keyboardist and singer [[Bobby Whitlock]], bassist [[Carl Radle]] and drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]]. All four members had previously played together in [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]], during and after Clapton's brief tenure with [[Blind Faith]]. [[Dave Mason]] supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was [[George Harrison]], the recording for whose album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos.

The band released only one studio album, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'', produced by [[Tom Dowd]], which also featured extensive contributions on lead and [[slide guitar]] from [[Duane Allman]]. A [[double album]], ''Layla'' did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single "[[Layla]]" (a tale of [[unrequited love]] inspired by Clapton's infatuation with his friend Harrison's wife, [[Pattie Boyd]]) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton's career.<ref name="SuperSeventies">{{Cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/spderekdominoes.html|title=Derek and the Dominos - Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs|website=Superseventies.com|access-date=23 August 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Background and formation===
[[File:Delaney & Bonnie.png|thumb|The members of Derek and the Dominos met while touring as backing members of [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]], a soul band fronted by [[Delaney Bramlett|Delaney]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]].]]
Derek and the Dominos came about through its four members' involvement in the American [[Soul music|soul]] revue [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]].<ref name="Dominos/AM">{{cite web|author=Ruhlmann, William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/derek-the-dominos-mn0000817369/biography|title=Derek and the Dominos|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> The group were anchored by the musical duo [[Delaney Bramlett|Delaney]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]] with a rotating ensemble of supporting members. Delaney & Bonnie and Friends supported [[Blind Faith]], [[Eric Clapton]]'s short-lived supergroup with [[Stevie Winwood]], on a US tour in the summer of 1969. While on that tour, Clapton was drawn to Delaney & Bonnie's relative anonymity, which he found more appealing than the excessive fan worship lavished on his own band.<ref>''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', pp. 88, 183, 254.</ref><ref name="Santoro p 62" />

Together with his fellow future Dominos – [[Bobby Whitlock]] (vocals, keyboards), [[Carl Radle]] (bass) and [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] (drums)<ref name="Dominos/AM" /> – Clapton toured Europe and the United States again between November 1969 and March 1970, this time as a member of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends.<ref>Whitlock, pp. 52, 60.</ref> In addition, the entire band backed him on his debut solo album, ''[[Eric Clapton (album)|Eric Clapton]]'',<ref>Reid, pp. xiii, 29.</ref><ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /> recorded over the same period.<ref name="Sutcliffe/Mojo" /> Disagreements over money led several members to leave Delaney & Bonnie and Friends.<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /> Whitlock, recalling other difficulties with Delaney and Bonnie, noted the couple's frequent fights and described Delaney as a demanding band leader in the manner of [[James Brown]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 5.</ref><ref name="Santoro p 63">Santoro, p. 63.</ref> Gordon, Radle and other Friends personnel, including drummer [[Jim Keltner]], immediately joined [[Joe Cocker]]'s ''[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]'' tour with [[Leon Russell]], but Whitlock remained with Delaney and Bonnie for a short time.<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" />

In April 1970, at the suggestion of his friend and mentor [[Steve Cropper]],<ref>Whitlock, p. 65.</ref> Whitlock travelled to England to visit Clapton.<ref name="Harris/Mojo p 70">Harris, p. 70.</ref> Whitlock subsequently lived in Hurtwood Edge, Clapton's house in [[Surrey]], where the two musicians [[Jam session|jammed]] and began to write the bulk of the Dominos' catalogue on acoustic guitars.<ref name="Sutcliffe/Mojo">{{cite magazine|author=Sutcliffe, Phil|title=Derek and the Dominos: The Story of ''Layla''|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=May 2011}} Available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/derek-and-the-dominos-the-story-of-ilaylai Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).</ref> Many of the new songs reflected Clapton's growing infatuation with [[Pattie Boyd]],<ref name="Williamson/Uncut" /><ref name="Murray/AVClub" /> the wife of his best friend [[George Harrison]],<ref name="Sutcliffe/Mojo" /><ref name="Layla40/Goldmine">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/features/layla-turns-40|last=Evans|first=Rush|date=19 April 2011|title=Layla turns 40|work=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref> who had joined Clapton as a guitarist on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour in December 1969.<ref>Clayson, pp. 275, 277–79.</ref>

Soon after Whitlock's arrival, he and Clapton were eager to form a new band<ref name="Whitlock p 73">Whitlock, p. 73.</ref> and contacted Radle and Gordon in the United States. Although their first choice for a drummer was Keltner – like Radle and Russell, a native of Tulsa<ref>Reid, pp. 42, 47.</ref> – he was busy recording with [[jazz]] guitarist [[Gábor Szabó]].<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /><ref name="Whitlock p 73" /> Gordon, however, had been invited to London to work on Harrison's post-[[The Beatles|Beatles]] solo album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /> In May that year, Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon reunited in London at a session for [[P.P. Arnold]],<ref name="Harris/Mojo p 72">Harris, p. 72.</ref> before going on to serve as the backing band on much of Harrison's album.<ref name="Shapiro p 116" /> In a 1990 interview, Clapton said, "We made our bones, really, on that album with George", since the four musicians had "no game plan" other than living at Hurtwood Edge, "getting stoned, and playing and semi-writing songs".<ref name="White/Spin" />

Clapton biographer [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] comments on the unprecedented aspect of Clapton's bond with his new bandmates, in that from the Blind Faith tour onwards, the guitarist "had been able to build a working relationship in a slow and natural fashion" for the first time. Among the friendships formed before the group officially came into existence, Shapiro continues, "the empathy ... outcropped most noticeably in Bobby Whitlock, in whom Eric found an accomplished and sympathetic songwriting partner and back-up vocalist."<ref name="Shapiro p 118">Shapiro, p. 118.</ref> Clapton and Whitlock considered adding the Delaney & Bonnie [[horn section]] to their new band, but this plan was abandoned.<ref name="DeRiso/SN" /> Whitlock later explained the ethos of Derek and the Dominos: "we didn't want any horns, we didn't want no chicks, we wanted a rock 'n' roll band. But my vocal concept was that we approach singing like [[Sam and Dave]] did: [Clapton] sings a line, I sing a line, we sing together."<ref name="Santoro p 64">Santoro, p. 64.</ref>

===Concert debut===
Towards the end of the sessions for the basic tracks on ''All Things Must Pass'',<ref name="Whitlock p 82" /> [[Dave Mason]] – another former guitarist with Delaney & Bonnie<ref>Reid, p. 47.</ref> – joined the Dominos at Clapton's home.<ref>Shapiro, pp. 115, 116.</ref> With the lineup expanded to a five-piece band, Derek and the Dominos gave their debut live performance on 14 June 1970.<ref name="Shapiro p 115">Shapiro, p. 115.</ref> The event was a charity concert in aid of the [[Dr Spock]] Civil Liberties Legal Defence Fund, held at London's [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum Theatre]].<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo">{{cite magazine|author=Shapiro, Harry|title=The Prince of Love ...

The group had been billed as "Eric Clapton and Friends", but a discussion ensued backstage just before their appearance, with Harrison<ref>Clayson, p. 290.</ref> and pianist [[Tony Ashton]] among those involved, in an effort to find a proper band name.<ref name="Shapiro p 115" /> Clapton recalls that Ashton suggested "Del and the Dominos",<ref>Clapton, p. 133.</ref> having taken to calling the guitarist "Derek" or "Del" since the Delaney & Bonnie tour the previous year.<ref name="DeRiso/SN" /> Whitlock maintains that "the Dynamics" was the name chosen and that Ashton, following his opening set with [[Ashton, Gardner and Dyke]], mispronounced it when introducing the band.<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /> Writing in 2013, Clapton and Whitlock biographer Marc Roberty quoted [[Jeff Dexter (DJ)|Jeff Dexter]], the [[Master of ceremonies|compere]]  at the Lyceum show, who recalled that "Derek and the Dominos" had already been decided on before they went on stage. According to Dexter, Clapton was immediately taken with the name, but Whitlock, Radle and Gordon – all Americans – were concerned that they might be mistaken for a [[doo-wop]] act.<ref name="DeRiso/SN">{{cite web|last=DeRiso|first=Nick|url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2013/06/16/books-eric-clapton-day-by-day-the-early-years-1963-1982-by-marc-roberty-2013/ |title=Books: ''Eric Clapton, Day by Day: The Early Years, 1963–1982'', by Marc Roberty (2013)|website=Something New!|date=16 June 2013|access-date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

The reception afforded the band from critics and fans was mixed.<ref>Reid, pp. 104–05.</ref><ref>Shapiro, pp. 115–16.</ref> Together with the unfavourable reviews for Clapton's eponymous solo album, particularly in Britain, this reaction was reflective of a widespread reluctance to view Clapton as a singer and frontman, rather than as the virtuoso guitarist synonymous with his role in bands such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Yardbirds]].<ref>Sandford, pp. 112, 114, 116.</ref> In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wrote that his main recollection of the Lyceum show was consulting [[New Orleans]]–born musician [[Dr. John]], a self-styled practitioner of [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]],<ref>''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', p. 276.</ref> and receiving a package made of straw that would serve as a means of winning Boyd's affection.<ref>Clapton, pp. 133–34.</ref>

===Recording with Phil Spector===
In return for the Dominos' assistance on ''All Things Must Pass'', Clapton and Harrison had agreed that the latter's co-producer, [[Phil Spector]], would produce a single for the new group.<ref name="White/Spin">{{cite magazine|author=White, Timothy|title=Rollin' & Tumblin'|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=March 1990|page=36}}</ref><ref>Reid, pp. 92–93, 105.</ref> On 18 June, the five band members, together with Harrison on guitar, took part in a session for the single at the Beatles' [[Apple Studio]] in central London.<ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 427.</ref><ref name="Reid pp 104, 105">Reid, pp. 104, 105.</ref> With Spector producing, two Clapton–Whitlock compositions were recorded that day<ref>Clapton, p. 132.</ref> – "[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]" and "Roll It Over"<ref name="Reid p 105" /> – along with two instrumental jams that would be included on the ''[[Apple Jam]]'' disc of Harrison's triple album.<ref name="Whitlock p 82">Whitlock, p. 82.</ref>

After this London session, Mason departed from the lineup; he later told ''[[Melody Maker]]'' that he was impatient to see the band start working full-time whereas Clapton was committed to helping Harrison complete ''All Things Must Pass''.<ref>Clayson, pp. 289, 478.</ref> Clapton and Whitlock then contributed to the [[overdubbing]] phase of Harrison's album, including adding backing vocals with Harrison (as "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers") to tracks such as "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]" and "[[Awaiting on You All]]".<ref>Whitlock, p. 81.</ref> In addition, while continuing to rehearse at Hurtwood Edge,<ref name="Shapiro p 116">Shapiro, p. 116.</ref> all four band members participated in London sessions for Dr. John's album ''[[The Sun, Moon & Herbs]]'' (1971).<ref name="Reid p 105">Reid, p. 105.</ref>

===UK summer tour===
Early in the summer of 1970, Clapton asked former [[Apple Records]] employee Chris O'Dell to find accommodation for Whitlock, Gordon and Radle in [[central London]], telling O'Dell that they were "going bonkers" out in the Surrey countryside.<ref>O'Dell, p. 170.</ref> The band then moved into a two-storey flat at 33 [[Thurloe Place]],<ref>Whitlock, p. 98.</ref> close to [[South Kensington tube station]].<ref>O'Dell, pp. 170–71.</ref> The flat also served as a meeting place for Clapton and Boyd,<ref>O'Dell, p. 172.</ref> who found herself flattered by Clapton's attention in light of her husband's infidelities<ref name="Black/Blender" /> and his preoccupation with Eastern spirituality.<ref>Boyd, pp. 119–20, 135, 138.</ref> In his autobiography, Clapton wrote that he was both inspired and "tormented" by his feelings for Boyd, which he channelled into his music, beginning with a UK tour by Derek and the Dominos.<ref name="Clapton p 135">Clapton, p. 135.</ref>

===''Layla'' sessions===

Only three songs – "I Looked Away", "[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]" and "Keep on Growing" – were recorded without his participation. The band remade "Tell the Truth" during the sessions and subsequently attempted to have the Spector-produced single cancelled.<ref>Sandford, p. 117.</ref> In the United States, [[Atco Records]] released the original version of "Tell the Truth" backed with "Roll It Over" in September, but soon withdrew the single.<ref name="Reid p 123" />

He could play parts, but he couldn’t sing with his guitar."<ref name="Layla40/Goldmine" /> The jams from Allman's first night at Criteria with the Dominos were issued on the second CD of ''[[The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition]]'' in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Layla Sessions|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/layla-sessions/|website=uDiscover Music|access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref>

The album's best-known track, "Layla", was compiled from recordings from two separate sessions. The main, guitar-oriented section was taped on 9 September, after the band had recorded their version of Hendrix's "Little Wing"; the closing section was added several weeks later, after Clapton had decided that the song lacked a suitable ending. The answer was an elegiac piano piece composed by Gordon (and an uncredited [[Rita Coolidge]])<ref name="Shapiro/Mojo" /> and played by the drummer, with Whitlock providing a second piano part to cover Gordon's relative inexperience on the instrument.<ref name="Black/Blender" /> During the ''Layla'' sessions, Gordon had been writing and playing songs for an intended solo album when, by chance, Clapton first heard the piano piece. According to Clapton's recollection, in return for continuing to use the Dominos' studio time for his own project, Gordon agreed to have the segment used as the ending for "Layla".<ref name="Williamson/Uncut" />

===October–December 1970 live shows===

After the recording of ''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'', the four-piece Derek and the Dominos returned to the UK to continue touring there before heading back to America to start the US tour on 15 October. Allman performed two shows with the group near the end of the US tour: at [[Curtis Hixon Hall]], in Tampa, Florida, on 1 December, and at the [[Onondaga County War Memorial]] in Syracuse, New York, the following night.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sean Kirst |url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/music_legends_from_aerosmith_t.html#incart_hbx |title=Music legends from Aerosmith to ZZ Top made our War Memorial the place to be |website=Syracuse.com |access-date=2012-02-27}}</ref>

Whitlock recalled of their drug consumption during the tour: "We didn't have little bits of anything. There were no grams around, let's just put it like that. Tom couldn't believe it, the way we had these big bags laying out everywhere. I'm almost ashamed to tell it, but it's the truth. It was scary, what we were doing, but we were just young and dumb and didn't know. [[Cocaine]] and heroin, that's all and [[Johnnie Walker|Johnny Walker]]."<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref> [[Elton John]], who opened for them, said that despite the reports of drugs and booze, "They were phenomenal. From the side of the stage, I took mental notes of their performance ... it was their keyboard player Bobby Whitlock that I watched like a hawk ...

===Album release===
''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'' was issued in November 1970. According to Shapiro, relative to the band and Dowd's high expectations, it was a "critical and commercial flop".<ref name="Shapiro p 123" /> Clapton similarly describes ''Layla'' as having "died a death" on release.<ref>Clapton, pp. 136–37.</ref> Although it received favourable reviews in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]'', the album missed the top ten in the United States and failed to chart at all in the United Kingdom, until a reissue on CD resulted in a one-week stay at number 68 in 2011. It garnered little attention,<ref name="Santoro p 69">Santoro, p. 69.</ref> partly as a result of a lack of promotion by [[Polydor]], and partly due to the public's ignorance of Clapton's presence in the band.<ref name="Shapiro p 123">Shapiro, p. 123.</ref> Dowd said that he "felt it was the best album I'd been involved with since ''[[The Genius of Ray Charles]]''" and was disappointed at the lack of acclaim it initially received.<ref name="Santoro p 69" />

"Layla" was included on ''[[The History of Eric Clapton]]'' in 1972, and Atlantic issued the song as a single in July that year.<ref name="Shapiro p 123" /> It became a hit, reaching number 10 in America and number 7 in Britain.<ref>Sandford, p. 119.</ref> The success of the title track in 1972 led to a reappraisal of ''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs''.

===''Johnny Cash Show'' appearance===
The band appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', in their only television appearance. Filmed at the  [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], and broadcast on 6 January 1971, the band performed "[[It's Too Late (Chuck Willis song)|It's Too Late]]" and then joined Cash and [[Carl Perkins]] to play Perkins' "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Derek + the Dominos Play The Johnny Cash Show|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/derek-dominos-johnny-cash-6-18-166/|website=Bestclassicbands.com}}</ref>

===Tragedy and dissolution===
<!--  Commented out: [[File:ClaptonD&D.jpg|thumb|200px|Eric Clapton performing live in 1970]] -->Tragedy and misfortune dogged the group throughout and following its brief career. In September 1970, Clapton was devastated by the death of his friend and professional rival Jimi Hendrix; having just recorded a version of "Little Wing" in Miami, the Dominos included the track on ''Layla'' as a tribute to Hendrix. In October 1971, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. Clapton later wrote in his autobiography that he and Allman had been inseparable during the sessions at Criteria.<ref>Clapton, p. 128.</ref> In addition, Clapton took the lukewarm critical and commercial reception to ''Layla'' personally, which accelerated his spiral into drug addiction and depression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography on Clapton Fanclub Magazine| url=http://www.ericclaptonfaq.com/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-biography-mother-father-grandparents-wife-children-son-daughter-addiction-.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119103230/http://www.ericclaptonfaq.com/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-biography-mother-father-grandparents-wife-children-son-daughter-addiction-.html| archive-date=19 January 2008|access-date=2006-09-27}}</ref> In 1985 when talking about the band, Clapton said:
<blockquote>We were a make-believe band. We were all hiding inside it. Derek and the Dominos – the whole thing. So it couldn't last. I had to come out and admit that I was being me. I mean, being Derek was a cover for the fact that I was trying to steal someone else's wife. That was one of the reasons for doing it, so that I could write the song, and even use another name for Pattie. So Derek and Layla – it wasn't real at all.<ref name="autogenerated1998">DeCurtis, Anthony (May 1998). ''Rocking My Life Away'', Duke University Press, {{ISBN|0-8223-2184-X}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Bobby Whitlock (1972).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bobby Whitlock in 1972]]
In February 1971, Radle and Gordon participated in sessions, produced by Spector and Harrison, for a [[Try Some, Buy Some#Planned Ronnie Spector solo album|planned solo album]] by [[Ronnie Spector]].<ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 434.</ref> Later that year, the Dominos disbanded acrimoniously in London, just before they could complete their second LP. In a subsequent interview with music critic [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], Clapton said the second album "broke down halfway through because of the paranoia and tension. And the band just dissolved."<ref name="Santoro p 69" /> After the dissolution, Clapton turned away from touring and recording to nurse an intense heroin addiction.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eric Clapton on Addiction, Cream, the Future of the Guitar |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/eric-clapton-talks-addiction-creams-brilliance-the-future-of-the-guitar-127052/ |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref><ref>Harris, p. 74.</ref> This three-year career hiatus was interrupted only by his participation in Harrison's [[Concert for Bangladesh]] shows in August 1971, along with a large cast of musicians, including Leon Russell, Keltner and Radle;<ref>Clayson, pp. 309–310, 313.</ref> a guest appearance at Russell's December 1971 show at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]];<ref>Shapiro, pp. 123–24.</ref> and his own [[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]], in January 1973. The latter event was organised by [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] to help Clapton kick his drug habit and build momentum for his return.<ref name="New RS Encyclo p 183">''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', p. 183.</ref><ref>Shapiro, pp. 126–27.</ref> Whitlock signed with the US record label [[ABC-Dunhill]], for which he recorded the albums ''[[Bobby Whitlock (album)|Bobby Whitlock]]'' and ''[[Raw Velvet]]''. Both albums were released in 1972 and included contributions from all the Dominos (recorded in early 1971), along with Harrison, the Bramletts, Keltner, and the former Delaney & Bonnie horn section.

Following Clapton's return as a solo artist in 1974, he and Radle worked together until 1979, when Clapton abruptly dismissed him from his band. Radle died in June 1980 of complications from a kidney infection<ref>Shapiro, p. 152.</ref> associated with alcohol and drug use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carl-radle-mn0000792981/biography|title=Carl Radle &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=23 August 2021}}</ref> Whitlock and Clapton did not work together again until 2000, when they performed on [[Jools Holland]]'s BBC show ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''. In 1983, Gordon, an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] at the time, killed his mother with a hammer during a psychotic episode. He was confined to a mental institution in 1984,<ref>Sandford, p. 120.</ref> where he remains today.<ref name="autogenerated2003">Romanowski, Patricia (2003). ''Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' Rolling Stone Press, {{ISBN|0-671-43457-8}}</ref> Recordings from the 1971 sessions for the band's cancelled second album were included on Clapton's four-CD/cassette box set ''[[Crossroads (box set)|Crossroads]]'', released in 1988.<ref name="Santoro p 69" />
