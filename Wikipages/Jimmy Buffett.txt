'''James William Buffett''' (born December 25, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/05/10/news/newsmakers/sirius_buffett|title=Margaritaville moves to Sirius|date=May 10, 2005|publisher=CNN Money|access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref> musician, author, actor, and businessman. He is best known for his music, which often portrays an "island escapism" lifestyle. Together with his [[Coral Reefer Band]], Buffett has recorded hit songs including "[[Margaritaville]]" (ranked 234th on the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s list of "[[Songs of the Century]]") and "[[Come Monday]]". He has a devoted base of fans known as "Parrotheads".

Aside from his career in music, Buffett is also a bestselling author and was involved in two restaurant chains named after two of his best-known songs; he currently owns the [[Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville|Margaritaville Cafe]] restaurant chain and co-developed the now defunct [[Cheeseburger in Paradise (restaurant)|Cheeseburger in Paradise]] restaurant chain. Buffett is one of the world's richest musicians, with a net worth of $900 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2017-07-21/how-jimmy-buffetts-margaritaville-became-the-most-valuable-song-of-all-time/|title=How Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville" Became the Most Valuable Song of All Time|author=Freeman, Doug|date=July 21, 2017|newspaper=Austin Chronicle|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref>

== Early and personal life ==
Buffett was born on Christmas Day 1946, in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/celebrities/index.ssf/2015/09/jimmy_buffett_bridge_pascagoul.html|title=Jimmy Buffett's hometown of Pascagoula, Miss., is naming a bridge for him|last=Associated Press|date=September 12, 2015|work=NOLA.com|access-date=December 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and spent part of his childhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He later lived in [[Fairhope, Alabama]]. He is the son of Mary Lorraine (''née'' Peets) and James Delaney Buffett Jr.<ref>Eng, S.: ''Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Georgia Revealed'', page&nbsp;39. St. Martin's Press, 1996.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/james-delaney-buffett-jr-j-d/article_712b0b32-2fc9-5e75-85ed-5e7feac0d97c.html |title=James Delaney Buffett, Jr. "J.D." |publisher=Billingsgazette.com |date=May 2, 2003 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> During his grade school years, he attended St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone in the school band. As a child he was exposed to sailing through his grandfather and these experiences would go on to influence his later music. He graduated from [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School|McGill Institute for Boys]] in 1964. He began playing guitar during his first year at [[Auburn University]] before continuing his college years at [[Pearl River Community College]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1969. He is an initiate of [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity at the University of Southern Mississippi. After graduating from college, Buffett worked as a correspondent for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], breaking the news of the separation of [[Flatt and Scruggs]].

Buffett married Margie Washichek in 1969; they divorced in 1971. Buffett spent years working as the first mate on the yacht of industrialist [[The Rival Company|Foster Talge]] on the ''Petticoat III'' in Key West while perfecting the "Caribbean Rock n' Roll" genre. Buffett and his second wife, Jane (née Slagsvol) have two daughters, [[Savannah Buffett|Savannah Jane]] and Sarah Delaney (Sarah was almost named Sara Loraine, after her grandmother, but was named Sarah Delaney after her grandfather),<ref>personal letter dated January 6, 1992</ref> and an adopted son, Cameron Marley, and reside in [[Sag Harbor, New York]], and [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. They separated in the early 1980s, but reconciled in 1991. Buffett also owns a home in [[Saint Barthélemy|Saint Barts]], a Caribbean island where he lived on and off in the early 1980s while he was part owner of the Autour de Rocher hotel and restaurant. He spends part of the summer traveling about the East Coast on his sailboat. An avid pilot, Buffett owns a [[Dassault Falcon 900]] that he often uses while on concert tour and traveling worldwide. He has also owned a [[Boeing Stearman]], [[Cessna Citation]], [[Lake Amphibian]], and [[Grumman Albatross]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=AOPA Pilot |date=May 2014 |page=79 |title=A Plane-Crazy America}}</ref><ref>"A Pirate Looks At Fifty" by Jimmy Buffett</ref>

His father died May 1, 2003, at the age of 83.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff|first=Chronicle|title=Obituary for JAMES DELANEY "J.D."

In 2015, Buffett spoke at the University of Miami's graduation ceremony and received an honorary doctorate in music. Wearing flip flops and aviator sunglasses, he told graduates, in a paraphrase of his song "The Pascagoula Run", that "it's time to see the world, time to kiss a girl, and time to cross the wild meridian."<ref>{{Citation|last=Miami Herald|title=Jimmy Buffett offers advice in 2015 University of Miami graduation speech|date=May 8, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah31bk9UAHo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/ah31bk9UAHo| archive-date=2021-10-30|access-date=August 13, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Buffett is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has hosted fundraisers for Democratic politicians, including one for [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|last=services|first=Tribune news|title=Jimmy Buffett and Paul McCartney join Hillary Clinton for star-studded fundraiser|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-jimmy-buffett-jon-bon-jovi-and-paul-mccartney-join-clinton-for-star-studded-fundraiser-20160831-story.html|access-date=December 5, 2020|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>

==Music==

===Music career===
Buffett began his musical career in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], during the late 1960s as a [[country music|country]] artist and recorded his first album, the country-tinged [[folk rock]] record ''[[Down to Earth (Jimmy Buffett album)|Down to Earth]],'' in 1970. During this time, Buffett could be frequently found [[busking]] for tourists in [[New Orleans]]. Fellow country singer [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] took him to [[Key West]] on a busking expedition in November 1971.<ref>{{cite book |last=Corcoran |first=Tom |title=Jimmy Buffett The Key West Years |year=2006 |publisher=Ketch & Yawl Press |location=Marathon FL |isbn=978-0-9788949-0-0 |page=9}}</ref> Buffett then moved to Key West and began establishing the easy-going beach-bum persona for which he is known. He started out playing for drinks at the Chart Room Bar in the [[David Wolkowsky#Restoration and rejuventation|Pier House Motel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.margaritavillekeywest.com/chart-room.html |title=Jimmy in Key West – The Chart Room Bar |publisher=margaritavillekeywest.com |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> Following this move, Buffett combined country, [[rock music|rock]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[pop music]] with coastal as well as tropical lyrical themes for a sound sometimes called "Gulf and Western" (or [[tropical rock]]). Today, he is a regular visitor to the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Saint Barts]] and other islands where he gets inspiration for many of his songs and some of the characters in his books.

With the untimely death of friend and mentor [[Jim Croce]] in September 1973, ABC/Dunhill Records tapped Buffett to fill his space. Earlier, Buffett had visited Croce's farm in Pennsylvania and met with Croce in Florida.<ref>Steve Eng. ''The Man from Margaritaville Revealed.'' Page 144.</ref><ref>Mark Humphrey. ''Jimmy Buffett Scrap Book.'' Page 120.</ref>

Buffett's third album was 1973's ''[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]''. Albums ''[[Living & Dying in 3/4 Time]]'' and ''[[A1A (album)|A1A]]'' both followed in 1974, ''[[Havana Daydreamin']]'' appeared in 1976, and ''[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]'' followed in 1977, which featured the breakthrough hit song "[[Margaritaville]]".

[[File:Jimmy Buffett at Clemson (Taps 1977).png|thumb|Buffett performs at [[Clemson University]] in 1977]]

During the 1980s, Buffett made far more money from his tours than his albums and became known as a popular concert draw. He released a series of albums during the following 20 years, primarily to his devoted audience, and also branched into writing and merchandising. In 1985, Buffett opened a "Margaritaville" retail store in Key West, and in 1987, he opened the Margaritaville Cafe.

In 1994, Buffett dueted with [[Frank Sinatra]] on a cover of "[[Mack the Knife]]" on Sinatra's final studio album, "[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-11-15-1994319146-story.html|title=Sinatra and his collaborators end up odd couples in the listless 'Duets II'|author=Considine, J. D.|date=November 15, 1994|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=October 2, 2020}}</ref> In 1997, Buffett collaborated with novelist [[Herman Wouk]] to create a musical based on Wouk's novel, ''[[Don't Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don't Stop the Carnival]]''. Broadway showed little interest in the play (following the failure of Paul Simon's ''[[The Capeman]]''), and it ran only for six weeks in Miami. He released an album of songs from the musical in 1998.

In August 2000, Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band played on the White House lawn for then-President [[Bill Clinton]].

In 2003, he partnered in a partial [[duet]] with [[Alan Jackson]] for the song "[[It's Five O'Clock Somewhere (song)|It's Five O'Clock Somewhere]]", a number-one hit on the country charts. This song won the 2003 [[Country Music Association]] Award for Vocal Event of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/history/ |title=History &#124; CMA AwardsCMA Awards |publisher=Cmaawards.com |date=November 6, 2013 |access-date=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317094724/http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/history/ |archive-date=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This was Buffett's first award in his 30-year recording career.

Buffett's album ''[[License to Chill]]'', released on July 13, 2004, sold 238,600 copies in its first week of release according to [[Nielsen Soundscan]]. With this, Buffett topped the U.S. pop albums chart for the first time in his  career.

Buffett continues to tour every year, although he has shifted recently to a more relaxed schedule of around 20–30 dates, with infrequent back-to-back nights, preferring to play only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This schedule provided the title of his [[Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays|1999 live album]].

In the summer of 2005, Buffett teamed up with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and introduced [[Radio Margaritaville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siriusxm.com/channellineup# |title=Channel Lineup – SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |access-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Until this point, Radio Margaritaville was solely an online channel. Radio Margaritaville has remained on the service through Sirius' merger with [[XM Radio]] and currently appears as XM 24. The channel broadcasts from the Margaritaville Resort Orlando in [[Kissimmee, Florida]].

In August 2006, he released the album ''[[Take The Weather With You]]''. The song "Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On" on this album is in honor of the survivors of 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Buffett's rendition of "Silver Wings" on the same album was made as a tribute to [[Merle Haggard]]. On August 30, 2007, he received his star on the Mohegan Sun Walk of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaritaville.com/jimmybuffett_about.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 16, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309024952/http://www.margaritaville.com/jimmybuffett_about.html |archive-date=March 9, 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mohegansun.com/signature-events/mohegan-sun-s-walk-of-fame.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805004845/https://mohegansun.com/signature-events/mohegan-sun-s-walk-of-fame.html |archive-date=August 5, 2016  }}</ref>

On April 20, 2010, a double CD of performances recorded during the 2008 and 2009 tours called ''[[Encores (Jimmy Buffett album)|Encores]]'' was released exclusively at Walmart, Walmart.com, and Margaritaville.com.

Buffett partnered in a duet with the [[Zac Brown Band]] on the song "[[Knee Deep]]"; released on Brown's 2010 album ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]'', it became a hit country and pop single in 2011. Also in 2011, Buffett voiced [[Huckleberry Finn]] on ''[[Mark Twain: Words & Music]]'', which was released on [[Mailboat Records]]. The project is a benefit for the [[Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum]] and includes [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Mark Twain]], [[Garrison Keillor]] as the narrator, and songs by [[Brad Paisley]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and others.

Of the over 30 albums Jimmy Buffett has released, as of October 2007, eight are Gold albums and nine are Platinum or Multiplatinum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Albums database |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=October 18, 2007}}</ref> In 2007, Buffett was nominated for the CMA Event of the Year Award for his song "Hey Good Lookin'" which featured Alan Jackson and [[George Strait]].

Jimmy Buffett was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

In 2020 Buffett released ''Songs You Don't Know by Heart,'' a fan-curated collection of his lesser-known songs rerecorded on his collection of notable guitars.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Guitar Talk: Jimmy Buffett on His Evolving Collection of Golden-Era Instruments {{!}} Acoustic Guitar|url=https://acousticguitar.com/guitar-talk-jimmy-buffett-on-his-evolving-collection-of-golden-era-instruments/|access-date=2021-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Musical style===
[[File:Jimmy Buffett 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Buffett performing in January 2008]]
Buffett began calling his music "drunken Caribbean rock 'n' roll" as he says on his 1978 live album ''You Had To Be There''. Later, Buffett himself and others have used the term "Gulf and Western" to describe his [[music genre|musical style]] and that of other similar-sounding performers.<ref>Alanna Nash.

=== Fans ===

'''Parrot Head''' or '''parrothead''' is a commonly used nickname for Buffett fans with "parakeets" or "keets" used for younger fans, or children of Parrotheads. At a Buffett 1985 concert at the [[Kings Island|Timberwolf Amphitheater]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://phofnc.com/home/what-is-a-parrot-head/ |title=What is a Parrothead? |access-date=May 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621160428/http://phofnc.com/home/what-is-a-parrot-head/ |archive-date=June 21, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Buffett commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming a back to see his shows, just like [[Deadheads]].

==Writing==
[[File:Jimmy Buffet navy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buffett in Hawaii in June 2003]]
Buffett has written three number-one best sellers. ''[[Tales from Margaritaville]]'' and ''[[Where Is Joe Merchant?]]'' both spent over seven months on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller]] fiction list. His memoir ''[[A Pirate Looks at Fifty]],'' published in 1998, went straight to number one on the ''New York Times'' Best Seller nonfiction list, making him one of the few authors to have reached number one on both the fiction and nonfiction lists.<ref>{{cite news |author=Anthony Decurtis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/21/arts/music-jimmy-buffett-traveling-salesman-of-leisure.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; Jimmy Buffett, Traveling Salesman of Leisure – New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=February 21, 1999 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

Buffett also co-wrote two children's books, ''[[The Jolly Mon]]'' and ''Trouble Dolls,'' with his eldest daughter, Savannah Jane Buffett. The original hardcover release of ''The Jolly Mon'' included a cassette tape recording of the two reading the story accompanied by an original score written by [[Michael Utley]].

Buffett's novel ''[[A Salty Piece of Land]]'' was released on November 30, 2004, and the first edition of the book included a CD single of the song "A Salty Piece of Land", which was recorded for ''[[License to Chill]]''. The book was a ''New York Times'' best seller soon after its release.

Buffett's latest title, ''Swine Not?'', was released on May 13, 2008.

[[File:Jimmy Buffett Himank BRO sign in Nubra Valley, Ladakh, Northern India.jpg|thumb|right|Jimmy Buffett quotation on Himank/BRO signboard in the [[Nubra Valley]], [[Ladakh]], Northern India]]

Buffett is one of several popular "philosophers" whose quotations appear on the road signs of [[Himank#Road signs|Project HIMANK]] in the [[Ladakh]] region of Northern India.

==Film and television==
Buffett wrote the soundtrack for, and co-produced and played a role in, the 2006 film ''[[Hoot (film)|Hoot]],'' directed by [[Wil Shriner]] and based on the book by [[Carl Hiaasen]], which focused on issues important to Buffett, such as conservation. The film was not a critical or commercial success. Among his other film music credits are the theme song to the short-lived 1993 [[CBS]] television series ''[[Johnny Bago]]''; "Turning Around" for the 1985 film ''[[Summer Rental]]'' starring [[John Candy]]; "I Don't Know (Spicoli's Theme)" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''; "Hello, Texas" for the 1980 [[John Travolta]] film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''; and "If I Have To Eat Someone (It Might As Well Be You)" for the animated film ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'', which was sung in the film by rap artist [[Tone Loc]].

In addition, Buffett has made several [[cameo appearance]]s, including in ''[[Repo Man (1984 film)|Repo Man]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]'', ''[[Hoot (film)|Hoot]]'', ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'', and ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''. He also made cameo appearances as himself in ''[[Rancho Deluxe]]'' (for which he also wrote the music) and in ''[[FM (film)|FM]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0119364/ |title=Jimmy Buffett |publisher=IMDb.com |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> He made a guest appearance in the second season of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' on [[CBS]] in 2011 and returned in April 2013, March 2015, January 2017,  March 2018, May 2019, and March 2020 playing Frank Bama. Buffett reportedly was offered a cameo role in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', but declined the offer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0325980/trivia |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl |publisher=IMDb.com |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref> In 1997, Buffett collaborated with novelist [[Herman Wouk]] on a musical production based on Wouk's 1965 novel ''[[Don't Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don't Stop the Carnival]]''. In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", an animated version of Buffett (but not voiced by Buffett) was seen singing "AIDSburger in Paradise" and "CureBurger in Paradise". Jimmy has also appeared on the ''Sesame Street'' special, ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', singing "[[Caribbean Amphibian]]" with the popular Muppet, [[Kermit the Frog]]. Buffett appeared in an episode of ''Hawaii Five-0'' in November 2011. He played a helicopter pilot named Frank Bama, a character from his novel ''Where Is Joe Merchant?''. Another character mentioned that he preferred "margaritas"; Buffett's character replied, "Can't argue with you there."  He reprised the role with a brief cameo visiting McGarret on the March 30, 2018, episode "E Ho'oko Kuleana".

Buffett made a cameo in the 2015 film ''[[Jurassic World]]'', where he is seen holding two margaritas while the dinosaurs are set loose in the park.

In 2017, Buffett was the musical guest on the ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' episode "Rogue Nation", playing the song "I Will Play for Gumbo" in Dwayne Pride's (Scott Bakula) newly rebuilt bar.

In 2019, he had an extended cameo playing himself in the [[Harmony Korine]] film ''[[The Beach Bum]]''.

==Theatrical works==
In 1994, Buffett began developing a musical based on [[Herman Wouk]]'s 1965 novel, ''[[Don't Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don't Stop the Carnival]]''.  Buffett wrote the music and lyrics and Wouk wrote the book for the show.  ''Don't Stop the Carnival'' debuted in [[Miami| Miami, Florida]] in 1997 to negative reviews from critics. In response, the producers approached Buffett and told him that Wouk needed to be fired and a more experienced playwright needed to rewrite Wouk's script.  Buffett refused to remove Wouk from the project and any further productions of the show were canceled.  Buffett turned the show into an [[Don't Stop the Carnival (Jimmy Buffett album)|album]] that was released in 1998.

A new musical, ''[[Escape to Margaritaville]]'', opened at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in [[San Diego]] in May 2017 and ran until July.  The show then performed limited runs in [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[Chicago]], and was well received by critics. The show features a book by [[Greg Garcia (producer)|Greg Garcia]] and [[Mike O'Malley]] and uses Buffett's classic songs, some of which he rewrote the lyrics to in order to better fit in the context of the story. The show began previews at the [[Marquis Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on February 16, 2018 and officially opened on March 15 under the direction of [[Tony Award|Tony]] winner [[Christopher Ashley]]. The Broadway production received mixed reviews from New York critics. In June that same year, the producers announced that the production would close on July 1 after 29 previews and 124 regular performances. Along with the announcement of the show's Broadway closing, it was announced that a national tour would launch in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], in the fall of 2019.<ref name="Taffy" />

==Charity work==
[[File:Jimmy Buffett on USS Harry S Truman.jpg|Jimmy Buffett aboard USS ''Harry S Truman'', January 2008|thumb|upright]]
Buffett has been involved in many charity efforts. In 1981, the [[Save the Manatee Club]] was founded by Buffett and former Florida governor [[Bob Graham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savethemanatee.org/smchist.htm |title=Save the Manatee Club |publisher=Savethemanatee.org |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> [[West Indian manatee]] In 1989, legislation was passed in Florida that introduced the "Save the Manatee" [[license plate]], and earmarked funding for the Save the Manatee Club. One of the two manatees trained to interact with researchers at [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] is named Buffett after the singer.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Buffett is also a longtime supporter of and major donor to the [[Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wakulla.com/Wakulla_News/Local_News/Jimmy_Buffet_Visits_Gulf_Specimen_Marine_Lab_201003109715/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207042222/http://www.wakulla.com/Wakulla_News/Local_News/Jimmy_Buffet_Visits_Gulf_Specimen_Marine_Lab_201003109715/|archive-date=February 7, 2016|title=Jimmy Buffet Visits Gulf Specimen Marine Lab|date=February 7, 2016|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

On November 23, 2004, Buffett raised funds with his Surviving the Storm hurricane relief concert in Orlando, Florida, to provide relief for hurricane victims in Florida, Alabama and the Caribbean affected by the four major hurricanes that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html |title=Jimmy Buffett: Surviving the Storm – Hurricane Benefit |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219131526/http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html |archive-date=December 19, 2007 |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref>

Buffett performed in Hong Kong on January 18, 2008, for a concert that raised US$63,000 for the Foreign Correspondents' Club Charity Fund. This was his first concert in Hong Kong and it sold out within weeks. Not only did Buffett perform for the groundlings for free, but he also paid for the concertgoers' tequila and beer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascrampton.com/2008/01/31/jimmy-buffett-hong-kong-concert-organizers-apologize-to-buffett-fans/ |title=Jimmy Buffett Hong Kong concert organizers apologize to Buffett fans |publisher=Thomas Crampton |date=January 31, 2008 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

On July 11, 2010, Buffett, a Gulf Coast native, put on a free concert on the beach in [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]]. The concert was Buffett's response to the [[BP]] oil disaster in the Gulf. The concert was aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] television. The 35,000 free tickets were given away within minutes to help draw people back to Alabama's beaches. Buffett played several popular songs including "Fins", "Son of a Son of a Sailor", "A Pirate Looks at Forty" and modified versions of "Margaritaville" (where the lyrics were changed in the chorus to "now I know, it's all BP's fault") and "When the Coast is Clear" (the lyrics in the chorus also referencing the Deepwater Horizon disaster: "That's when it always happens / When greed and crude collide"). The concert featured [[Jesse Winchester]] and [[Allen Toussaint]].

==Controversies==
The earliest controversy with Buffett was his recording of "[[God's Own Drunk]]" on the album ''[[Living and Dying in 3/4 Time]]''. In 1983, the son of the late entertainer [[Lord Buckley]] sued Buffett for $11 million for copyright infringement, claiming that Buffett took parts of the monolog from Buckley's ''A Tribute to Buckley'' and claimed it as his own work in "God's Own Drunk". The suit also alleged that Buffett's "blasphemous" rendition presented to the public a distorted impression of Lord Buckley.<ref>"Jimmy Buffett Sued Over Song" ''Miami Herald'' August 30, 1983: 1A.</ref> A court injunction against Buffett prevented him from performing the song until the lawsuit was settled or resolved, so starting in 1983, Buffett would get to the part of his show where he would normally perform "God's Own Drunk", he would say that he was not allowed to play it because of the lawsuit and instead played a song he wrote called "The Lawyer and the Asshole" in which he accuses Buckley's son and lawyers of being greedy and tells them to "kiss his ass."

In January 1996, Buffett's [[Grumman HU-16]] airplane named ''[[Hemisphere Dancer]]'' was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane was carrying Buffett, as well as [[U2]]'s [[Bono]], his wife and 2 children, and [[Island Records]] producer [[Chris Blackwell]], and co-pilot Bill Dindy. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Buffett, who penned the song "[[Jamaica Mistaica]]" for his ''Banana Wind'' album based on the experience. The plane from the incident is now on display at Margaritaville Orlando, located at Universal Studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/widgeon-seaplane-crash/ |title=Jimmy Buffett Crashes his Grumman Widgeon Seaplane " Jimmy Buffett World |publisher=Buffettworld.com |date=August 25, 1994 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=19940826&id=7yQgAAAAIBAJ&pg=2680,5532930|title=Sun Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

Buffett's 1999 song "[[Math Suks]]" caused a brief media frenzy. The song was in fact promptly condemned by the US [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] and the [[National Education Association]] for its alleged negative effect on children's education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr147.shtml|title=Middle-School Algebra: Ready or Not?|author=Starr, Linda|date=June 21, 1999|publisher=Education World|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref> Comedian [[Jon Stewart]] also criticized the song on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' during a segment called "Math Is Quite Pleasant".<ref>[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/xcjjnd/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-math-is-quite-pleasant Math Is Quite Pleasant.] ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''.

On February 4, 2001, he was ejected from the [[American Airlines Arena]] in Miami during a basketball game between the [[Miami Heat]] and the [[New York Knicks]] for cursing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Buffett Booted from NBA Game|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94188&page=1|access-date=2021-07-28|website=ABC News|language=en}}</ref> After the game, referee Joe Forte said that he ordered him moved during the fourth quarter because "there was a little boy sitting next to him and a lady sitting by him. He used some words he knows he shouldn't have used." Forte apparently did not know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach [[Pat Riley]] because he thought Riley—who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was—was insulting him by asking if he had ever been a "Parrothead", the nickname for Buffett fans.<ref name="buffettEjected">{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/02/05/Sports/Across.The.Wire-698290.shtml |title=Singer Buffett ejected from Knicks and Heat contest |access-date=August 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204108/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/02/05/Sports/Across.The.Wire-698290.shtml |archive-date=September 30, 2007  }}</ref> Buffett did not comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' three days later.

On October 6, 2006, it was reported that Buffett had been detained by French customs officials in [[Saint Tropez]] for allegedly carrying over 100 pills of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite magazine

Buffett's luggage was searched after his [[Dassault Falcon 900]] private jet landed at Toulon-Hyères International Airport. He paid a fine of $300 and was released. A [[spokesperson]] for Buffett stated the pills in question were [[prescription drugs]], but declined to name the drug or the health problem for which he was being treated. Buffett released a statement that the "ecstasy" was in fact a B-vitamin supplement known as [[Foltx]].<ref>{{cite web

==Concerts and tours==

==="The Big 8" and standard songs===
Before 2003, songs almost always played at every Buffett show were known as the Big&nbsp;8. The "Big 8" were:
# "[[Margaritaville]]"
# "[[Come Monday]]"
# "[[Fins (song)|Fins]]"
# "[[Volcano (Jimmy Buffett song)|Volcano]]"
# "[[A Pirate Looks at Forty]]"
# "[[Cheeseburger in Paradise]]"
# "[[Why Don't We Get Drunk]]"
# "[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]"

With the success of the [[Alan Jackson]] duet "It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere", and the rising popularity of "[[One Particular Harbour]]", the list of songs played at most shows went from 8 to 10. However, "Why Don't We Get Drunk" has been reduced to only occasional performances. Other notable songs that are played at many shows are "[[Son of a Son of a Sailor (song)|Son of a Son of a Sailor]]", [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Girl]]" and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]]'s "[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]", bringing the total number of songs played at the vast majority of concerts since 2004 to 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?tour=4bd70342|title=Jimmy Buffett Tour Statistics: I Don't Know|website=Setlist.fm|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref> In the years 2010–2016, in 262 advertised appearances Buffett performed the song "Margaritaville" 248 times, "Son of a Son of a Sailor" 236, "Volcano" 235, "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes" 235, "Come Monday" 235, "Fins" 232, "A Pirate Looks at Forty" 232, "Cheeseburger in Pardise" 228, "Five O'Clock Somewhere" 225, "One Particular Harbour" 221, and "Southern Cross" 220. (Many of the appearances had short set lists such as guesting on television shows).<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?year=2016 Setlist.fm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019043608/http://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?year=2016 |date=October 19, 2016 }} Retrieved October 17, 2016.</ref>

In an interview on KLBJ radio in Austin, Texas, on May 2, 2013, Buffett humorously referred to the fact that they have to "play the ten that everyone wants, or else we'll get killed", and then went on to play "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere" on air.

===Tour accident===
On January 26, 2011 ([[Australia Day]]), Buffett was performing a concert in Australia at Sydney's [[Hordern Pavilion]] and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, "He just went over to the edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped."<ref name="Fulde"/><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122985.htm Jimmy Buffett doing well after stage fall] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405230739/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122985.htm |date=April 5, 2011 }}, January 27, 2011, [[ABC News Online]].

In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda, he presented additional verses of "Margaritaville" in which he made humorous references to the accident.
